"Local Crime, Pink Shoes and Silence","Since Ted Cruz began his speech against Obamacare, Washington Post health care policy reporter Sarah Kliff has failed to notice it. Or so I assume from her Twitter feed, which has precisely zero tweets about it.

Obamacare is Kliff’s primary reportorial focus. That’s why, she explained to me in April, she chose not to cover the trial of late-term abortion doctor and murderer Kermit Gosnell:

@MZHemingway Hi Molly – I cover policy for the Washington Post, not local crime, hence why I wrote about all the policy issues you mention. — Sarah Kliff (@sarahkliff) April 11, 2013

But the weird thing is that she was very interested in Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis’ filibuster in defense of late-term abortion. You can find her tweets and retweets here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.

For just a sample of those 27 tweets:

Texas filibuster madness was still happening 12 hours ago. Feels like ages already! — Sarah Kliff (@sarahkliff) June 26, 2013

Since Ted Cruz began his speech against Obamacare on the afternoon of September 24, Kliff has tweeted, but not about the speech.

So I guess I’m confused. The murder trial of one of the country’s most infamous late-term abortion doctors couldn’t be covered because it was just a local crime story (she walked that back a little after public outrage over her explanation). The failed effort to stop a bill protecting unborn children who had made it through five months’ gestation was worthy of effusive tweets and a live-stream on the Washington Post Wonkblog itself!

But Ted Cruz’s speech against the federal issue of Obamacare — the signature policy issue covered by Sarah Kliff and the Wonkblog — isn’t worthy of any similar coverage? Here’s the Wonkblog site. The only stories about the speech are Wonkbook: Ted Cruz is no Rand Paul, by Ezra Klein and Evan Soltas, and Ted Cruz’s ‘filibuster’ is an excellent argument against Ted Cruz’s ‘filibuster’, by Ezra Klein.

I realize that when even Dylan Byers of Politico is pointing out that the coverage of Cruz is biased, the situation must be obvious to everyone. But can anyone defend these coverage choices?",https://thefederalist.com/2013/09/25/local-crime-pink-shoes-and-silence-2/,2013-09-25
"No, Casinos Do Not Create Cultural Wastelands","“The consequences for the common good (of casinos) are straightforwardly disastrous.” Ross Douthat, New York Times. November 2013.

Opponents of casinos and gambling will often claim that casinos cause terrible problems. In a way, the opposition to gambling makes for strange political alliances. For example, the right-wing organization Focus on the Family claims gambling “is morally bankrupt from its very foundation.” They also quote the Bible in their opposition. Many on the left also oppose gambling, but for different reasons. For example, some on the left who oppose gambling claim that gambling is like a tax on the poor and uninformed. Others claim that people who gamble are exploited by casinos, which are large corporations. The opponents of gambling think if a new casino moves into an area, it only hurts society. They’re wrong.

Let’s focus on three often-made claims by opponents of gambling, and analyze each claim individually. First, we’ll look at the claim that casinos are bad for the people who gamble. Second, we’ll examine whether casinos harm a local economy, as opponents claim. Finally, we’ll examine the claim that casinos cause an increase in crimes in local areas.

Let’s start with the claim that casinos are bad overall for those who gamble. Some people, unfortunately, do develop gambling problems. I’ve known people who have suffered with gambling problems, and it is heartbreaking. The claim that this is a commonplace situation, however, is not accurate. Most people who gamble don’t experience serious negative consequences. In a recent paper I published in the Journal of Gambling Issues with two colleagues from my university, we surveyed those who gambled (for real money) on Internet poker sites. While 12 percent of respondents did express significant side-effects, like spending too much time gambling, most didn’t. Two-thirds reported no negative side-effects at all, and many report significant benefits from their gambling, such as relaxation or socialization.

It shouldn’t be surprising that people enjoy and find benefits from gambling. In America, people aren’t forced to gamble, yet they do it often. Those who choose to gamble experience enjoyment from going to a casino, much like people enjoy going to a football game, a Broadway show, or spending an evening at a nightclub. The value of the enjoyment people receive from a night of leisure at a casino is significant but often overlooked by those who claim gamblers themselves are worse off when a casino opens.

While opponents of casinos will first try to claim that the patrons of casinos will be worse off if a casino opens, they then turn to the economy of the area that opens the casino, and will claim bringing casinos to an area will have a negative economic impact. Claims like this one on by PBS Frontline can be found on many anti-gambling websites:

… two studies of the riverboat casinos in Illinois concluded that for every one job created by the riverboats, most of the surrounding communities probably lost one or more jobs …

While many make similar claims, it is difficult to envision the situation where a casino that moves into an area actually decreases the total number of jobs. In order for a casino to actually have a negative economic impact, two things initially have to occur. One is expected, and that is that a casino would reduce the economic activity of at least some other local businesses. The second isn’t a given, however, and that is that the casino sends more of its revenue out of the local area than the other local businesses. Let’s elaborate. Suppose people decide to go to a casino and spend $100 instead of to a restaurant. The casino (and previously the restaurant) will enjoy some of that $100 as profits, and the rest goes to workers, equipment, food, materials, etc. For casinos to have a negative impact, they’d have to send more of their money out of the local area for these purchases. While it could happen, it’s not obvious that it does.

Even if these two conditions happen to cause a slight negative impact on the economy, there can still be economic gains. Any time a casino causes somebody to visit (and spend money in) an area when they otherwise wouldn’t, that causes a positive economic impact. Also, if somebody who likes visiting casinos and lives in the local area chooses to stay locally instead of traveling to another casino outside the area, then the local casino has boosted the economy. For example, Pennsylvania’s economy got a boost when it opened casinos as many who otherwise would travel to Atlantic City decided instead to stay (and spend their money) within Pennsylvania.

Overall, most studies seem to show a positive economic impact from casinos. However, there are plenty that don’t. I wouldn’t pay much attention to either side. As somebody who has studied economic impact studies extensively, I can assure you that either side can manipulate their numbers and release a press statement.

Let’s now look into the claim that crime increases dramatically when casinos are brought into an area. First, let’s think about why crime might increase. The main reason you might expect an increase in crime is for those who wish to fund a gambling problem, and steal or embezzle in order to do so. Also, if casinos are populated by people who would be more likely to commit crimes than those who don’t visit casinos, building a casino might cause an increase in crime.

There are reasons to think crime might decrease, however, when casinos enter an area. First, the presence of legal gambling might decrease the propensity for somebody to offer illegal gambling. Local illegal gambling halls would have a much tougher time maintaining their business which would decrease crimes. Second, since casinos can bring additional jobs to an area (especially if they draw in visitors from outside the area), casinos can increase employment and decrease crime. Whether a casino increases or decreases crime is then an empirical question.

Many scholars have examined the influence of casinos on crime, and the evidence is mixed. Some studies have found increases in crime, such as an often-cited one published in 2006 which estimates that 8 percent of crimes in counties with casinos were attributed to the casinos. Other studies come to different conclusions. Scholars from the University of Alberta find that “the introduction of legal gambling can increase some crime rates and decrease others”. Douglas Walker from the College of Charleston summarizes the research in his article in the Oxford Handbook on the Economics of Gambling: “There is clearly good reason to expect some relationship between casinos and criminal activity. However, based on an overview of the literature, there is no conclusive evidence on the relationship between casinos and crime.”

We’ve examined three claims by anti-gambling critics: that casinos hurt its patrons, that the economy in the area is hurt, and that crime increases. The evidence on these issues, however, tells a different story. It is a bit disheartening that an industry serving the public must prove the positive or negative effects of its business in order to open and increase freedom and opportunities for individuals. Think about this: when an issue arises and freedom is at stake, do you defend freedom by a detailed benefit-cost analysis, or by choosing the side that gives more freedom? With casinos, it’s turned into a benefit-cost argument. The numbers still don’t discourage casino expansion, but it’s probably not the best way to make a case for consenting adults to engage in activities.

"If Guns Cause of More Crime, Why Isn't There More Of It?","Last week I reiterated what most people already know and what the Supreme Court has upheld multiple times—that, in contrast to the “collective rights” model of the Second Amendment, owning a firearm is an individual right. It might have been worth it to write something else, if only because the FBI recently hammered the point home itself: 2013 counted the most background checks for firearm purchases since 1998, when the National Instant Criminal Background Check System went into place.

The FBI’s report doesn’t tell the whole story. Reportedly, household gun ownership has declined to a record low of 34%; yet, in contrast, another poll showed nearly 50% of houses self-reported having a gun on the property. In any event, it remains that America still has the highest rate of private gun ownership in the world.

Yet where’s the exploding crime rate? The gun control lobby has been claiming for years that the more guns in private hands, the more gun violence we’ll see; the perennial hyperventilation is given to fears of a kind of Wild West America of lawless anarchy, wherein every gun owner is prepared to shoot from the hip at the first sign of danger.

Well. Last year the Department of Justice released a report revealing that firearm homicides declined nearly 40% between 1993 and 2011, and nonfatal firearm injuries declined nearly 70% within the same time period. Every year since 2002 has seen a rise in the number of NICS background checks performed, yet in 2011 the firearm homicide rate was lower than it was in 2002; in fact, all firearm violence, both fatal and nonfatal, was lower the former year than the latter.

The United States retains the highest rate of civilian gun ownership on the planet, and it maintains the highest number per capita of gun homicides in the developed world—which is enough to convince gun controllers that civilian gun ownership is a failed experiment that needs to be scrapped. Yet curiously enough, the gun controllers never seem to notice—or else they’re plainly ignoring—the baffling cases of countries like Brazil, a nation that has nearly twenty times less the amount of civilian-owned guns as the United States, yet has nearly triple the amount of gun homicides. (Of course, Brazil isn’t part of the “developed” world, so it generally isn’t lumped in with first-world countries like the United States—a useful divider when one is attempting to ignore inconvenient facts).

So what gives? Why do we have more guns in private hands, yet less gun violence? Why do some countries with drastically lower gun ownership nonetheless have grossly higher gun violence rates? However we might propose to lessen the amount of gun violence in the United States, it is plainly self-evident that the simple equation of “Less Guns, Less Crime” doesn’t really add up, not in this country, and not when we’ve seen more guns and less crime over the past few decades. If we’re going to reduce gun homicides in the United States, the solution must necessarily be more complicated than the honest but uninformed notions that have colored the gun control movement for the past twenty years or so.

Advancing on a single issue

With that in mind, there is every reason for gun rights advocates to be wholly suspicious of the even moderate encroachments upon America’s gun freedoms that frequently arise. While this columnist was last week bloviating about the individual right to own a gun, California’s legislature did me one better and proposed background checks for ammunition purchases. According to state senator Kevin de Leon:

“The ammunition is the fuel that feeds the violence. The gun itself…is the delivery device. The gas, the fuel, is the ammunition, and no one knows who buys it.”

From a purely stylistic point of view, one has to concede that this is a dramatically muddled and sloppy metaphor. Violence is committed, for one, not fed; it is an act, not a set of circumstances. Yet even if we concede the senator that bizarre rhetorical device, his characterization of a gun is a real head scratcher—it’s a “delivery device” for “fuel” that “feeds violence.” What does this really even mean?

In any event, the rationale for ammunition background checks is tenuous: in 2012, the Sacramento Police Department “reported that it had tracked 349 people prohibited from owning firearms who nonetheless purchased ammunition.” We don’t learn if these people ever ended up using the ammunition to commit gun violence, and indeed we’re not given any compelling evidence that background checks for ammunition has any negative effect on gun violence rates.

It’s a mark of the lobby’s anti-gun devotion that the major gun control proposal of last year—a dramatic expansion of background checks mandated by Washington—would not have stopped massacres like those that occurred at Newtown, Tucson or Aurora.

But the gun control lobby doesn’t really need compelling evidence, or really much evidence at all, to justify gun legislation of any kind. It’s a mark of the lobby’s anti-gun devotion that the major gun control proposal of last year—a dramatic expansion of background checks mandated by Washington—would not have stopped massacres like those that occurred at Newtown, Tucson or Aurora. Even successful legislation like the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 dealt primarily with cosmetic features, did not outlaw any weapons manufactured prior to the passage of the law, and didn’t end up having a measurable effect on violent crime rates.

So why the ineffective, inconclusive and seemingly-pointless legislation? As economics professor Walter Williams put it, laws that strip Americans of their fundamental liberties “are always advanced as a single issue.” There’s every reason to believe that politicians and pundits might honestly recognize that mandated background checks for ammunition won’t have much of an effect on crime—yet they know that once Californians, say, have become comfortable with such a law, it will then becomes much easier to pass another, more restrictive law. Gun controllers, for instance, are ceaselessly lecturing gun owners about how under the National Firearms Act of 1934 we effectively cannot own fully automatic weapons, thereby stipulating that gun rights are subject to some limitations. But the NFA’s prohibition on automatic weapons does not ipso facto legitimize any other firearm law—and more importantly, the NFA does not ipso facto legitimize the NFA.

A self-referential appeal to authority hardly justifies a government to continually strip its citizens of their rights. But for many people, it’s a perfectly reasonable justification, which is why little piecemeal maneuvers such as California’s ammunition law are so troubling: if it passes, we can expect a kind of legislative stare decisis a few years down the road, where a new gun control measure cites ammo background checks as an authority. As we’ve seen, gun violence is a complicated and critical issue that deserves a great deal of thought, but our commitment to making America safer should not come at the cost of our vital liberties—and we should be aware of the little but significant efforts to take those vital liberties away.

God Complex: Why Hollywood Thinks Sex Crimes Are No Big Deal,"Dylan Farrow began and ended her damning case against her father, filmmaker and serial award-winner Woody Allen, with a query: “What’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?”

It’s a scathingly rhetorical question aimed especially at those who brush off Farrow’s reports that Allen sexually assaulted her as a child. Dylan Farrow’s open letter – published Saturday on Nicholas Kristof’s New York Times blog – describes Woody Allen secretly taking her into an attic to indulge his sexual appetites when she was just seven years old. She also writes that Allen’s behavior towards her was habitually yucky before then. And that a criminal case was never prosecuted even though the State of Connecticut found probable cause.

Whatever your reaction, there can be no doubt of one thing: Dylan Farrow bids us to feel the suffering of any child – any person — who has been violated in body and soul, and then made to watch as the world heaps praises upon the violator.

“Imagine a world that celebrates her tormentor,” Dylan implores. Indeed, there’s something utterly wrong with such a picture.

And that’s really the heart of this matter. Farrow’s point goes far beyond whether or not you believe her. It’s really all about the noxious effects of idol worship. We’ve allowed the virus of idolatry to infect society as never before. The symptoms are cult-like behaviors that end up coddling the guilty while pulling the innocent into a vortex where they get sucked down the drain.

Parallels with Cult Behavior?

Humans have a strong tendency to ignore the proverbial elephant in the room if everyone else is doing same. Even when something seems grossly remiss, the instinct to find safety in the herd and follow the leader too often trumps any urge to mention something that’s wrong. And if someone does note it, often others will rationalize to quiet things down and protect the center of power.

This isn’t rocket science. We can see every day how people constantly take cues from the behavior of those around them. Especially key are the reactions of the people who are close to the center of power (in Farrow’s case, that would be someone like Diane Keaton, a close associate of Allen’s for decades.) But such folks tend to be so invested in and dependent upon the success of the central cult figure, that they’ll promote the illusion of his status under any circumstances. That is, until and unless there is a strong power shift in the inner circle.

In the meantime, people tend to just go with the flow. When they won’t shift course, even in the face of certain injury or tragedy, we might say they’re “drinking the Kool-aid.” The source of that idiom is very instructive even if it’s maybe the most extreme example of groupthink in recent times. It comes from the 1978 Jonestown massacre-suicide in Guyana where 909 followers of the charismatic People’s Temple cult leader Jim Jones obeyed his command to commit “revolutionary suicide” by drinking Kool-aid mixed with potassium cyanide.

But the intense madness of the original Kool-aid drinking should offer us all an edifying lesson about the futility of giving in to a groupthink mentality when it comes to opinion polling or anything else. Ultimately, there’s no safety in a lemming mindset. Sooner or later, we end up going over the cliff.

Elitists and the Expendability of the Lives of Others

Just as Mary Jo Kopechne drowned in the car abandoned by Ted Kennedy at Chappaquiddick, so those of lesser status are expendable to insure the power of the elites. In fact, a short time after that tragedy, citizens of Massachusetts expressed a high level of loyalty and support for Kennedy. For Mary Jo, we can only hear faint echoes of Annie Hall in the eponymous movie chanting: “La de da. . . . La de da.”

Whenever someone gains cult-like status, they’re freer to abuse their power and position and lord it over others. So it’s always dangerous to give it to them. The venerated folk singer Peter Yarrow remained revered even after convicted of making sexual advances to a 14-year-old girl who sought his autograph. Though he later claimed to regret it as an “indiscretion” for which he was “nailed,” the incident didn’t really affect his career in the long run.

Consider also the case of the internationally hailed director Roman Polanski who raped a 13-year-old girl. After he fled the United States, he retained his admirers and defenders – among them Woody Allen – and continued to make movies and win awards. They’re all looking for immunity that protects their self-absorption and absolves them from the indignities they heap on others.

We might also ponder the peculiar acclaim and adulation of best-selling author, the late Gore Vidal. It seems Vidal never ceased to drip with contempt and abuse for virtually everyone in his line of sight or mind. Interestingly, last year a reporter for the Daily Beast wrote that Vidal was “convinced and genuinely afraid, I discovered, that [William F.] Buckley had evidence he had had sex with underage boys.” The article also noted that Vidal bragged of having sex with – i.e., using as commodities — a thousand men before he was 25.

Of course, the list of celebrated users and abusers goes on and on. The world has a habit of cultivating the mystique of the powerful and sweeping under the rug their crimes along with their victims. As an aside, an interesting question to contemplate is this: Why do so many Hollywood and media elites (like Gore Vidal) profess such a disdain for America, such a distaste for the core American traditions, values, and ideals of freedom? Could it possibly be that a true pledge to “liberty and justice for all” cramps their ability to dictate who should be free and what constitutes justice?

The Nietzschean Power of Elites

If nothing else, Dylan Farrow’s letter is a wake-up call. It’s time for us to pour a lot of cold water on the notion that the elites – those controlling the media, Hollywood, politics, and academia — are entitled to a separate standard of behavior or a separate moral code from everybody else. The biggest equality gap today is really one of accountability and personal responsibility.

It seems that the elites are determined to write all of the scripts and do all of the casting in order to dictate who may say what in the public square. Political correctness is the tool to whip all of us extras into memorizing our lines. Or into just shutting up and doing what we’re told. What’s at stake is the survival of a moral code that strives for equal protection. The alternative is the transformation of that moral code into a permanent double standard that insures nothing more than the perpetual power of the core elite. It’s a Nietzschean thing that we don’t quite yet understand.

Dylan Farrow describes the despair of one who is stuck in this Nietzschean panorama. It’s indeed a world that celebrates your tormentor, in which the “Superman” or ubermensch with the victorious Will to Power can rule by whim over everyone else. It’s an amoral world. There’s no room for individual integrity or dignity or free choice in it. You are expected to comply with whatever alternative reality your ruler wishes to impose on you. There’s no way out.

Today’s elitism and cult of celebrity are a deadly combination, a dangerously slippery Nietzschean slope. When massaged by adulation of the masses, the anointed are freer to adopt a proprietary attitude towards the lives of others. If you try to place checks on their power or insist on your own individual freedom, you become suspect and a threat. This is likely why the elites of our time push so hard for political correctness: to control what you may say, what you may do, and what you may think. Ultimately, this leads to dictating the personal relationships of everyone around them, adopting an attitude not unlike a high school queen bee.

Dictating Relationships Is What Little Gods Do

When Woody Allen decided that it was okay to indulge in a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter Soon-Yi Previn, he revealed far more than his contempt for traditional sexual taboos. He was making the narcissistic point that he was above it all, kind of like the attitude of the Judah character in Allen’s anti-Dostoyevsky movie Crimes and Misdemeanors. (Judah had a hit man kill his girlfriend before she could tell his wife about their affair. Judah felt some guilt, but then worked through it, and went on to continue enjoying his elitist professional life in Manhattan.)

According to the feature written by Maureen Orth in Vanity Fair after the scandal broke in 1992, Mia Farrow “made the discovery of Allen’s affair with Soon-Yi when she found a stack of Polaroids taken by him of her daughter, her legs spread in full frontal nudity . . . each managed to contain both her daughter’s face and vagina.”

How could Woody Allen take such liberties with a stepdaughter while enjoying international fame and adulation? Playwright Leonard Gershe, though a friend of Mia Farrow’s, was able to explain this seemingly Nietzschean phenomenon flawlessly:

Woody Allen is a chilling figure of power, a potentate of reel life who doesn’t seem to have to play by the rules. “This man is so exalted in the business—no one has the position he has. . . . I think when you get up into that stratosphere you no longer have to pay attention to the law of gravity. Regular morals, conscience, ethics—that’s for slobs like you and me.” The effect, says Gershe, “spills over into real life. He’s treated like a little god, and little gods don’t have to do what everybody else does.”

Lines and Spiders and Buicks (Oh, My?)

In fact, little gods are users and takers of whatever they feel like using and taking. It could be something big like an industry, or like a person and his dignity. Or it could be a little thing, like maybe just a punchline.

Which leads me to ask: What’s your favorite Woody Allen line? For some folks it’s in the funny scene from the 1977 Academy Award winning Annie Hall in which Woody Allen says to Diane Keaton: “Honey, there’s a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.”

Do a Google search of that line and you’ll see lots fan appreciation and accolades on the witty brilliance of it all, and how Woody Allen introduced this new idiom into the language.

But that line in Annie Hall fell flat with me.

Consider a slightly different take: “I seen spiders could stop a Buick.”

I listened to “I seen spiders could stop a Buick” — recited night after night – while I rehearsed and performed in a community theater production of A View from the Bridge. Arthur Miller – whom Allen has identified as a huge influence on him — published that play at least 22 years before Annie Hall was released.

So when I heard Allen say “Honey, there’s a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick,” it just sounded like a cheap rip off to me.

Of course, I ought not trouble my little head about such things from pre-internet days. It’s just a little thing, another little entitlement for little gods. Not for little people like you and me.

Bill De Blasio’s Law Enforcement Racket,"Is Bill de Blasio about to take New York City’s public safety back to the bad old days of rampant street crime and murder – or is he, like President Obama, mostly just slapping a new coat of rhetorical paint over largely unchanged security policies?

The jury is still out, especially on the impact of a federal court decree that could yet hamstring the NYPD. But early indications suggest that de Blasio’s Police Commissioner, William Bratton, is determined to keep in place the core of the “stop and frisk” policies that de Blasio campaigned against – policies whose foremost national advocate is none other than Bratton himself. Mayor de Blasio’s fans and critics alike may have to grapple with the possibility that a lot less is going to change than his racially charged anti-law-enforcement campaign would suggest.

Mugged By History

Back in the pre-Giuliani days when muggings were a constant daily threat throughout New York City, they used to say that a conservative was just a liberal who had been mugged, and the City’s political history bears that out. After enduring three decades of rising rates of street crime and violence, New Yorkers finally rebelled in 1993, booting David Dinkins from office in favor of Rudy Giuliani, the most conservative mayor of the City in modern times.

As befits elections that determined the course of the City’s future safety and prosperity, the 1989 and 1993 Giuliani-Dinkins races engaged a far higher proportion of the city’s population than any election before or since – Rudy got 120,000 more votes in losing the 1989 election than de Blasio did in winning a landslide in 2013 in which less than 15% of New Yorkers voted:

That political reality can’t be lost on de Blasio: while national Democrats like Obama may fairly claim to have brought new voters into the process, de Blasio won on a tide of indifference and low turnout, and even in a city where Democrats have an 8-1 registration advantage (likely to grow after the devastation visited on Staten Island by 2012’s Hurricane Sandy), he needs to keep the sleeping giant of single-issue anti-crime voters (many of whom are fairly liberal on other issues) from reawakening.

For the moment, it’s held at bay by amnesia and complacency. Most of today’s progressives – most of New York’s voters, in fact – don’t remember the Dinkins years. Besides the 11% of voters under 30 in the 2013 election, there’s the fact that roughly a million of the city’s three million immigrants arrived since 2000, meaning that around 10% of New Yorkers only came to the United States since Mike Bloomberg became the Mayor. With that level of population turnover, New York lacks the collective memory to be alarmed, yet, by de Blasio’s rhetoric. But results are another matter.

Broken Windows: The NYPD in the 1990s

It’s hard to argue with the results that the Giuliani and Bloomberg Administrations achieved in New York, although a few die-hard Dinkins partisans – chief among them de Blasio, a former Dinkins aide married to another former Dinkins aide – argue that some of the credit should go to Dinkins himself for beginning the process of expanding the NYPD’s street presence.

Giuliani’s first Police Commissioner had actually served under Dinkins: Bratton had been Dinkins’ head of the Transit Police before moving to Boston to become Police Commissioner. And Dinkins’ own Police Commissioner, Lee Brown, had already begun implementing new ideas about “community policing” that required a more aggressive presence on the streets of high-crime neighborhoods, ideas that were expanded when Dinkins replaced Brown in 1992 with Ray Kelly (the same Ray Kelly who was the target of many of de Blasio’s barbs in his more recent tenure heading the NYPD). The idea that more patrolmen would have more interactions with the populace was already taking hold even before Rudy took office.

In 1994, Rudy brought back Bratton, naming him as Kelly’s successor to run the NYPD. Giuliani and Bratton brought the critical elements to the table that the Dinkins-Brown and even Dinkins-Kelly teams had lacked. The NYPD, from Bratton down to the ordinary beat cop, knew the Mayor was on their side even when they came under criticism – a major morale booster that had been lacking under the weak, ineffectual Dinkins, whose first instinct was always to pander to the Al Sharptons of the New York street. The new team brought an intense, demanding focus to restoring order (Brown, by contrast, had been nicknamed “Out of Town Brown” by the cops and the tabloids). They marshalled increasingly detailed data: the CompStat system, first developed by the Transit Police under Bratton, was rolled out city-wide, enabling the NYPD to track crime on a more detailed, weekly precinct-by-precinct and neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis and hold precinct commanders accountable for results. They put a social-science theory into practice as well: the NYPD went after low-level “lifestyle” street offenders like squeegee men, building on James Q. Wilson and George Kelling’s “broken windows” theory of how social disorder encourages crime. And at the core of this process, where the rubber met the road, was the day-to-day activity of cops patrolling dangerous, crime-ridden neighborhoods and taking a proactive approach to threats by stopping and frisking people who looked suspicious – never an error-free process but one that resulted in scores of arrests of criminals carrying illegal guns and drugs. In a real sense, Bratton earned the title of “the father of stop and frisk,” which he also later expanded in his tenure heading the LAPD from 2002-09.

The results in New York could hardly have been more dramatic – arguably the greatest success story of any domestic public policy initiative of the past half-century. The murder rate dropped by 70% from the high watermark of 2,245 murders in 1990, the worst of the Dinkins years. And the improvements in the crime rate went well beyond the headline homicide rate. As an NBER study observed:

During the 1990s, crime rates in New York City dropped dramatically, even more than in the United States as a whole. Violent crime declined by more than 56 percent in the City, compared to about 28 percent in the nation as whole. Property crimes tumbled by about 65 percent, but fell only 26 percent nationally….Over the 1990s, misdemeanor arrests increased 70 percent in New York City. When arrests for misdemeanors had risen by 10 percent, indicating increased use of the “broken windows” method, robberies dropped 2.5 to 3.2 percent, and motor vehicle theft declined by 1.6 to 2.1 percent.

Rudy was a revolutionary change-agent figure in New York, with a revolutionary personality; his abrasive, hard-charging style was a necessary element of his success, but it made him many enemies, and the magnitude of his success made him eager to claim the credit. And that led him into inevitable personality conflict with Bratton, himself an outsize personality who wanted his share of the limelight. Bratton left office abruptly in March 1996 after Giuliani ordered an investigation into a book deal Bratton had signed. Great success in fighting crime, but also controversies and the overshadowing tragedy of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, would follow throughout Giuliani’s remaining six years in office. It would take his departure from office to allow his successes to be institutionalized and separated from his personality.

Operation Impact: The Bloomberg Years

The Bloomberg years seemed, for a while, to put the frictions of the Giuliani era behind the City; far from a crusading radical overturning the status quo, Bloomberg was by both temperament and circumstance a manager who inherited a City already pointed in the right direction and had the more prosaic task of making it run more efficiently. And for the most part, in the area of law enforcement, he did; the major crime rate continued to plunge to improbably low levels, even through the economic hard times that followed the 2008 financial crisis – rapes down by a third, burglaries dropped in half, car thefts down more than 75%. By 2013, Bloomberg and Ray Kelly (who served as Police Commissioner for the entire duration of Bloomberg’s 12-year tenure) could boast:

[N]ew all-time lows will be set in 2013 for the fewest homicides and fewest shootings in recorded city history. There have been 332 homicides so far this year, which is a reduction of 20 percent from the previous record low, which was established last year – and homicides have fallen nearly 50 percent since 2001. Similarly, the number of shootings have fallen by 20 percent from last year’s record low – with 1,093 shootings through Thursday, December 26th – down from 1,608 in 2001, a 32 percent reduction. Overall crime is now down 32 percent since 2001.

That success story bucked the national trend, which saw crime rates bounce back in many places after the policing revolution of the 1990s, and took place at a time when an increasing share of the NYPD’s resources were being redirected to anti-terrorism work. But the primary goal of maintaining order brought tension with Bloomberg’s continuing struggle to control the City’s budget. In 2003, Kelly launched “Operation Impact,” a plan to flood “impact zones” of high crime with patrol officers; the program was expanded in 2004 after producing sharp reductions in crime in the impact zones, and was doubled to more than 1,800 officers in 2007, about 5% of the whole Department. But the program relied on the ground-level work being done by raw recruits straight out of the police academy, leading left-wing critics to argue that it led to “officer burnout and overly aggressive tactics.” The 2008 financial crisis took a huge bite out of the City’s budget in Bloomberg’s third term, and even the NYPD wasn’t safe. Bloomberg pressed in 2010 and 2011 for cuts in the police force, and while he ultimately backed off the most aggressive plans, the NYPD ended his term as a shrinking share of the City’s government:

There are now roughly 34,500 cops on the beat, about the same number as there were in 1992 when the city was besieged by crime and down from 37,000 in 2002 when Bloomberg took office.



But the city’s overall workforce has grown, There are now roughly 271,000 full-time employees on the city payroll, up 10 percent from 247,000 in 2002…



…[T]he NYPD is facing an unprecedented wave of 10,000 retirements in the next three years. These are cops hired 20 years ago under the “Safe Cities, Safe Streets” program, which was hastily ordered in 1992 by then-Mayor David Dinkins and the City Council to combat a tidal wave of crime that gripped the city.

The tension between keeping a lid on the NYPD’s budget and maintaining its aggressive presence on the streets was balanced by putting the heaviest burden of policing on the least expensive, least experienced members of the Force. Unless deeper cuts could be made to other parts of the City’s enormous government, the new Mayor would have to decide if that balance should be reconsidered.

Why Bratton?

Given that de Blasio had run so hard to the Left during the election against “racial profiling” and promised to drop the City’s appeal of a federal court ruling that its “stop-and-frisk” policy was racially discriminatory, his decision to bring back Bratton seems more than a little puzzling at first glance. In 2006, Bratton co-wrote a strongly-worded defense of “broken windows” policing in National Review Online, blasting “ivory-tower academics” who “have never sat in a patrol car, walked or bicycled a beat, lived in or visited regularly troubled violent neighborhoods, or collected any relevant data of their own ‘on the ground’.” He has been critical of cities that “made the mistake of embracing” Occupy Wall Street. And Bratton remains a vocal defender of stop-and-frisk:

Bratton is an ardent supporter of the policy because he says it’s an effective means of reducing crime on the street. Last year, he even compared stop-and-frisk as a solution to crime to “chemotherapy” as a treatment for cancer. In an interview …with NPR, Bratton hinted that the policy would be an effective crime-fighting tool in Oakland.

Bratton defended stop-and-frisk as “essential,” and in a May 2013 interview with Jeffrey Toobin, before de Blasio’s emergence as a serious candidate, Bratton bluntly suggested that stop-and-frisk critics didn’t know what they were talking about:

“First off, stop-question-and-frisk has been around forever,” he told me. “It is known by stop-and-frisk in New York, but other cities describe it other ways, like stop-question-and-frisk or Terry stops. It’s based on a Supreme Court case from 1968, Terry v. Ohio, which focussed very significantly on it. Stop-and-frisk is such a basic tool of policing. It’s one of the most fundamental practices in American policing. If cops are not doing stop-and-frisk, they are not doing their jobs. It is a basic, fundamental tool of police work in the whole country. If you do away with stop-and-frisk, this city will go down the chute as fast as anything you can imagine.”



We also discussed the current controversy over stop-and-frisk under Raymond Kelly, Bloomberg’s Police Commissioner. “What you have right now is a controversy in which nobody really understands what they are fighting about,” Bratton said. “Stop-and-frisk is not a tool solely to look for guns. Unfortunately, both the Mayor and the Police Commissioner refer to it that way, and that’s a problem because so few guns are recovered. But so what? The vast majority of stops are for a wide variety of things. Is someone drinking a can of beer on the corner? You want to stop that behavior. If somebody is aggressively panhandling on the street, urinating against a building. Is there somebody that you suspect is casing a building? Or is that two guys just locked out of their apartment? Police officers notice what may be a burglary. Of course they should be noticing and investigating. There are countless examples of what you want police to do.”

Bratton’s tenure at the LAPD copied his approach in New York:

When Bratton led the LAPD, the department’s use of stop and frisk expanded significantly. In 2002, cops made 587,200 stops, and by 2008, they made 875,204 stops, an increase of 49 percent…

Critics noted that “[w]ell over 70 percent of 2008 LAPD stops in inner-city precincts were of African-American and Latinos, a ratio[] similar to New York’s.” Bratton’s LAPD stopped a lot more minorities – but also improved the accuracy of its stops:

The LAPD’s improved image coincided…with a 49% spike in stops of pedestrians and motorists from 2002 to 2008, according to a Harvard Kennedy School report. Blacks comprised 9% of the city’s population but accounted for 23% of all those stopped. Over the same period the number of stops which led to arrests doubled from 15% to 30%, suggesting the police tended to have good reason.

And yet, Bratton succeeded in greatly improving the LAPD’s relationship with the city’s minority population. He did that, in large part, not by backing down from aggressive policing but by old-fashioned community-relations outreach:

Even before formally taking over a police department scarred by race riots, corruption and brutality, Bratton sought out black leaders like John Mack, then head of the Los Angeles Urban League, and civil rights attorney Connie Rice. Rice warned she would sue him, as she did his predecessors, but he invited her to help him reform a force still tainted by the beating of Rodney King.



“He co-opted us, and he co-opted us into the mission of … the cultural transformation of LAPD,” she told the Los Angeles Times.

Bratton also recruited many more Hispanic police officers. One result of Bratton’s diplomatic outreach was that, at the end of his tenure in 2009, a federal court lifted a consent decree imposed in 2001.

There are various theories as to why de Blasio would bring back a Police Commissioner from the Giuliani era with such a long track record of promoting the very thing de Blasio claimed to oppose. One is that de Blasio was pressured into the pick by New York’s wealthy, liberal Democratic power brokers and bankrollers, who remain more important to his party than outraged leftists who regarded the appointment as a sellout – indeed, de Blasio just appointed a new head of the City Planning Commission whose experience is in gentrifying and Disneyfying Times Square, hardly a Left-populist move. Another is that he was more or less mugged by reality – once he knew he would be held responsible for keeping the City safe, he was forced (like Obama) to stop posturing and grow up. A third possibility is that de Blasio’s Dinkins partisanship is asserting itself, intent on showing that Bratton, not Rudy, should be given the credit for the City’s turnaround. Finally, there’s the possibility that de Blasio – an admirer of Daniel Ortega who honeymooned in Castro’s Cuba and voted to honor Robert Mugabe – isn’t really any sort of civil libertarian at heart, and wants a strong police force to carry out the sort of expanded government powers he craves.

Stop and Frisk is Dead…Long Live Stop and Frisk?

Whatever de Blasio’s motives, the solution that Bratton proposes is, in effect, to continue Operation Impact but replace its pairs of rookies with more experienced (and, by necessity, more expensive) cops:

The changes could include pairing rookies with veteran officers in local precincts and providing a broader training regimen, Mr. Bratton said. New officers may be assigned to radio cars before they are placed on the streets in high-crime neighborhoods, he said.



“Operation impact is not going away. I would hope to potentially expand it using seasoned officers,” Mr. Bratton said during a news conference at police headquarters. “The concern I have right now is that you have 10 or 12 of them assigned to one supervisor. I want to give these kids a much better training opportunity.”

Bratton is promising to reach out to Sharpton and others of his ilk, and is selling the new approach as a focus on a more targeted population of suspects:

He said instead of going after the “general population,” his cops will go after the “known criminal population” of a community. “In Los Angeles, we had a database of 40,000 known gang members,” he says. “We focused on them rather than good kids on the way home from school or work. We stop, questioned and frisked and often arrested those career criminals.

He’s also been making this pitch to the legal community. The police union is, unsurprisingly, pleased with Bratton’s approach:

The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association president, Patrick Lynch, released a statement saying the move is “consistent with the union’s philosophy of training” and that “Using rookies to meet numbered targets under the former system resulted in many of the problems we are now in the process of solving.”

This leaves the question of where – given his many other ambitions for New York City government and the many demands he will face from the teachers and other public employee unions – de Blasio will get the money to pay for this. It also leaves unanswered whether de Blasio’s supporters, who believed he was striking a decisive blow against what they regarded as a racist system, will be satisfied four years from now that law enforcement in the City has changed in a way they consider meaningful.

A Thousand Cuts

That’s the optimistic scenario – well, optimistic if you want the NYPD to keep its focus on improving its winning law enforcement formula rather than scrapping it for purposes of political pandering. But if the arrival of Bratton and his plans to preserve the core of stop-and-frisk and Operation Impact represent continuity, there are still ways in which the City’s hard-won progress could be placed at risk by the new Mayor.

The immediate risk arises from de Blasio’s decision to drop the City’s appeal of a federal district court decision holding the existing stop-and-frisk policies to be racially discriminatory. Mayor de Blasio didn’t drop the appeal because he feared losing – the City already won the first round when the Second Circuit stayed the order and removed the district judge from the case. Rather, he dropped the appeal because he was afraid the City would win. The New York Post’s Bob McManus notes some of the consequences of this and related decisions:

The NYPD shortly will be under the supervision of a court-appointed federal monitor; this will last at least three years, and probably much longer — with all that implies for the command integrity and personnel accountability central to the Giuliani-Bloomberg anti-crime successes.



The department also will soon be answering to a municipal inspector general, thanks to the City Council.



And cops are being targeted for personal liability, in court, for so-called “racial profiling” transgressions — whatever that term even means.

As Heather MacDonald, a long-time defender of proactive policing, explains:

The least of the opinion’s problems is the unnecessary bureaucracy it inflicts on the NYPD, including a federal monitor, burdensome reporting requirements, and left-wing advisory panels, all overseen by the plaintiffs’ attorneys. The most serious problem is [the district court’s] statistical test of racial profiling, which compares police stops to population data, rather than crime data.

The roster of members of that advisory panel, stocked with believers in Critical Race Theory and other race obsessives, should send a chill down the spine of anyone who expects the NYPD to get a fair hearing. Co-opting them, and getting the City out from under this decree, may prove a more difficult diplomatic task for Bratton even than he faced in Los Angeles.

The real risk to law enforcement is thus not that Bratton’s NYPD will turn its back on stop-and-frisk, but that it will suffer death by a thousand cuts from intrusive oversight boards and loss of morale among patrol cops. The Daily News notes that “City cops stopped little more than 3,000 people in January, a far cry from the 50,000-people monthly tallies that were once commonplace under Kelly’s leadership” – a significant falloff, albeit one that is no doubt partly attributable to emptier streets in the bitter weather of the past month. And the biggest imponderable of all in morale is the new Mayor himself: one only need wait for the next controversy (in a city where 34,000 cops patrol 8.3 million people, a lot can happen and it usually does) to see whether he sends the cops the expected signal that City Hall doesn’t have their back in a pinch.

The Beat

New York City isn’t like anywhere else in the United States. One recent study of “high density population” – people living in densities of over 10,000 people per square mile – found that 43.3% of Americans living in areas that dense live in New York:

If you look at people living at the higher density of 25,000 per square mile, New York sticks out even further:

The advantage of high density is that it allows economies of scale in policing – New York not only has twice as many police per resident as Los Angeles, it can concentrate them in much smaller areas, making it a lot harder to hide from the cops. This is, in fact, the argument for why New Yorkers don’t need to own guns: there are already lots of guns on the street everywhere you turn, in the hands of officers of the law. With a large, densely concentrated police force on hand, New York has gone further down the road than anywhere else in the country in accepting the security state in exchange for keeping violence at bay. Mayor de Blasio’s decision to bring back William Bratton and retain the core of stop-and-frisk suggests that it will be harder than de Blasio’s supporters think to unsettle that bargain. But the proof of whether they can undermine it indirectly from the shadows of bureaucracy, and whether that costs the City its hard-won gains, will be told in the CompStat reports and body counts of the next four years.

"Does Climate Change Cause Crime, Or Just Summer Vacations?","Do heat waves cause crime waves? That’s the impression one might get reading media coverage of a recent study purporting to show that climate change will increase crime. As reported in the Los Angeles Times:

The study by Matthew Ranson of Abt Associates, a research and consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., suggests global warming will trigger more crimes including murders and rapes over the next century, with social costs estimated to run as high as $115 billion.



Between 2010 and 2099, climate change can be expected to cause an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 cases of rape, 1.2 million aggravated assaults, 2.3 million simple assaults, 260,000 robberies, 1.3 million burglaries, 2.2 million cases of larceny and 580,000 cases of vehicle theft, the study published this week in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management says.



Compared with the number of crimes expected to occur during this period in the absence of climate change, these figures represent a 2.2% increase in murders, a 3.1% increase in cases of rape, a 2.3% increase in aggravated assaults, a 1.2% increase in simple assaults, a 1% increase in robberies, a 0.9% increase in burglaries, a 0.5% increase in cases of larceny and a 0.8% increase in cases of vehicle theft, the study says.

Other outlets have reported on the new study along similar lines.

The year 2099 is, of course, very far in the future. If you’re reading this in 2014, chances are you will be dead by then (sorry). So how exactly are we supposed to tell the effect of climate on crime 85 years from now?

Looking at the study itself, the estimated increase in crime is derived by comparing the crime rates of U.S. counties based on how hot it was in a given month. As it turns out, many crimes have a degree of “seasonality” – they are less likely to occur when it is cold outside than when it is warmer. Since warmer days have more crime, and climate change leads to more warmer days, the study concludes that climate change will lead to more crime. QED.

The study makes no attempt to control for other variables that might cause a spurious connection between crime and the weather. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once noted that one of the strongest predictors of school quality was the school’s distance from the Canadian border. He might’ve added that school attendance falls sharply during hot summer months. No doubt one could conclude based on these facts that climate change will lead to a sharp decrease in school quality. That might make headlines, but it wouldn’t tell us much.

More interesting, though, is the mechanism by which higher temperatures are supposed to lead to more crime. The study gestures at research suggesting that higher temperatures might make people more aggressive. But, as the study also notes, the connection between warmer weather and property crime vanishes once temperatures hit 50 degrees. And both violent and non-violent crimes tended to be more seasonal in colder parts of the country. Clearly something else is going on here.

As alternatives, the study’s author speculates that “weather conditions are an input that affects both the probability of successfully completing a crime and the probability of escaping undetected afterward,” and that “weather conditions that foster social interactions are likely to increase crime rates.” An earlier version of the paper, puts the matter more plainly: “pleasant evening weather may increase the number of opportunities for mugging,” and “mild weather that encourages people to go shopping would also have the effect of increasing the frequency of property crimes such as larceny.”

In other words, if climate change does cause an increase in crime, it’s liable to be because people are more likely to leave the house when the weather is nice. But aside from a few misanthropes, most people view the advantages of “social interactions” as worth the risk that you might get mugged. If they didn’t, they could easily reduce their risk of being robbed by staying home, even on a beautiful summer day.

Of course, a study that concluded climate change would lead to more pleasant weather might not have attracted the same attention (or at least not the same sort of attention) as the crime and climate study. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the references to climate change leading to more “pleasant” weather have disappeared from the final paper.

If you spend enough time on the web, you may have come across the idea of “clickbait.” Articles are given headlines that are deliberately provocative or surprising in order to drive traffic to the publisher’s website. The substance of the article in question may not live up to the hype, but by the time you’ve read far enough to establish this, it’s too late. You’ve already clicked on the article. While certain websites specialize in this sort of thing (you know who you are), the phenomenon is rapidly becoming universal.

In recent years a similar trend has, sadly, increasingly infected science journalism. If a paper has a counter-intuitive or politically salient conclusion, the media will run with it regardless of any uncertainties or caveats included in the paper itself, or even whether the paper’s underlying methodology is fundamentally sound. In fact, on one level clickbait science is easier to get away with, as virtually no one who reads about the latest shocking scientific study is going to track down the original paper to see how robust the findings are.

The crime and climate study is just one example of how clickbait science can give a distorted picture of the findings of scientific research. And in a society where people increasingly look to experts to form their views on a variety of social and political matters, that’s a problem.

Ukraine Illustrates The Danger Of Entrusting Foreign Policy To Top Men,"The past two days have revealed the dangerous ramifications of the narrow-minded foreign policy elite in Washington, and a media establishment that has for so much of President Obama’s tenure accepted the statements of the administration as gospel. Just as we learned the dangers of the lack of a questioning element – a healthy, serious, skeptical voice in the room – within the administration of George W. Bush, so too we see the consequences of a narrow viewpoint on global affairs which now exists within the Obama administration.

As Eli Lake outlines, the decision of Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine came as a sudden shock to a Washington that less than a day earlier had dismissed such possibilities:

On Thursday night, the best assessment from the U.S. intelligence community—and for that matter most experts observing events in Ukraine—was that Vladimir Putin’s military would not invade Ukraine. Less than 24 hours later, however, there are reports from the ground of Russian troops pushing into the Ukrainian province of Crimea; the newly-installed Crimean prime minister has appealed to Putin to help him secure the country; Putin, in turn, is officially asking for parliament's permission to send Russian forces into Ukraine. It’s not a full-blown invasion—at least, not yet. But it’s not the picture U.S. analysts were painting just a day before, either… U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence on the fast moving situation in Ukraine tell The Daily Beast that analytic products from the intelligence community this week did not discount the prospect of Russian provocations and even light incursions in the Russian majority province of Crimea, the home of Russia’s fleet in the Black Sea. Nonetheless, until Friday, no one anticipated a Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory.

These officials were not alone. At Foreign Affairs, the headline was “Why Russia Won’t Invade Ukraine”; at The New York Times, “Why Russia Won’t Interfere”; and at Time, “No, Russia Will Not Intervene in Ukraine”. Joshua Tucker at The Washington Post has already had to change the now-ludicrous title of his post, explaining:

Those who have already read this post (including the first 15 commentators below) will know that I originally posted with the title “5 reasons for everyone to calm down about Crimea”. Developments in the ensuing hours have shown how poor a title that turned out to be.

It’s no surprise that, given the echo chamber of the media, the administration itself gives all the signs of being caught flat-footed, unable to adjust to the situation that runs against their preconceived notions and those of the chattering class:

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke with Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu on March 1, telling him that there was 'no change' in the U.S.'s military posture toward Ukraine in the hours after Russia's parliament approved a Russian military presence in Ukraine.

If this is the sort of foreign policy anticipation that the establishment delivers, it’s little surprise that no one trusts America’s self-styled policy elites any more. They are too used to judging the world according to the patterns toward which they are already biased, as opposed to seeing it as it is.

As for the situation in Crimea itself: while the 1994 Budapest Memorandum does not require that the United States enter into this current conflict, as it is not a formal treaty, it does make the situation for the Obama administration a great deal more complicated than, say, the 2008 situation in Georgia. The Ukrainian situation has a nuclear subtext which matters in the broader context: because Ukraine had to surrender its nuclear arsenal as part of the 1994 agreement, U.S. inaction now sends a signal that nations ought to maintain their nuclear arsenal as opposed to trusting the Americans to defend their legitimacy. The mix of Polish, Turkish, and Russian interests here make for an all the more dangerous situation given the spillover potential of a major crisis.

What ought to be a first priority in this context is the administration’s opportunity to position itself as ready to use the leverage of international economic policy and energy policy to dissuade the Russians from their current trajectory or, at least, loosen Putin’s stranglehold on European energy markets. U.S. law currently prevents American energy producers from freely exporting natural gas or crude oil to anywhere even remotely near Europe. To remedy this glaring economic and geopolitical mistake, the president (who has shown no qualms about using sweeping definitions of executive power in other areas) could issue blanket executive orders declaring all US natural gas exports to be in the “public interest” and all crude oil exports to be in the “national interest”, the applicable legal standards for both commodities.

While immediate gas exports directly to Europe would be limited by a lack of U.S. export facilities (thanks, again, to glacial government policy), crude exports could begin instantly and US gas could be exported thru Canada and Mexico. At the very least, these moves would serve as a significant signal to global energy markets and to the Russians that the United States fully intends to use its newfound energy abundance to stabilize global markets and counterbalance Russian influence across the Atlantic. At best, they might actually help to weaken Russian energy oligarchs and, by extension, Putin himself.

Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, who have both recently expressed support for US energy export liberalization (Cruz especially), should take up this message at once. It represents an opportunity to use expanded trade freedom and American economic might to prevent further loss of life and signal the United States’ seriousness on the matter, without firing a single American bullet. And, unlike the United Nations or the World Trade Organization, it is a step that can be done unilaterally with, quite literally, the stroke of the President’s pen.

In the meantime, at least the president himself is taking it seriously.

How to Kick Putin in the Teeth,"For the past week, we’ve had to put up with a lot of grey little men from the foreign policy establishment lamenting that there’s really nothing we can do to deter Vladimir Putin from grabbing part or all of Ukraine. This is just a process of rationalization for the fact that they don’t really want us to try.

The do-nothing caucus will get a boost from Putin’s decision to pause as he digests Crimea. Putin may be irrational, but he’s not crazy. He has a good intuitive sense for how the West, and particularly the Obama administration, makes decisions. Or fails to make them. So he knows to act rapidly and decisively, overwhelming unprepared Western analysts and leaders with new facts on the ground. Then, just as they are beginning to formulate a response, stop and calm everything down so that the grey little men can assure us that the crisis is over and there is no need for urgent action.

But the crisis has not passed, because Putin’s larger intention remains. Putin’s authoritarian rule has been described as “Stalin Lite,” and it’s now clear that the goal of his foreign policy is to rebuild a “Soviet Union Lite.” He will keep stirring up trouble and probing for weakness in Eastern Ukraine, looking for the pretext and the opportunity to either grab another chunk of Ukraine or destabilize the central government. Other former Soviet states with significant Russian populations are certainly taking this seriously. They fear they’re next.

What’s at stake for the US is very simple. We’ve forgotten what’s like to have a big, active geopolitical opponent who’s stirring up trouble and supporting hostile regimes everywhere in the world. That is what Putin is doing, and the fact that he’s doing it in Eastern Europe is particularly threatening. We have enough trouble everywhere else in the world, so we need to know that Europe, at least, is civilized and stable, a place where we can find allies and trading partners—and not a zone of conflict. Now Putin is bringing war and aggression back to Europe.

The tragedy is that we’re plenty strong enough militarily, economically, and diplomatically to crush Putin’s ambitions. I have recommended using the Reagan Doctrine of the 1980s as an inspiration, but breaking Soviet Union Lite won’t take nearly as much money or effort as it took to defeat the original article. Putin’s new Russian empire is far smaller and weaker, having been reduced in territory, population, military readiness, and global influence.

So let’s get started. Putin has crossed too many lines, and it’s time to bring down the hammer. I’m not talking about what we can do to send him a warning or maybe punish him a little bit. I’m talking about what we can do to knock him down and kick him in the teeth.

Right now, Russia gets the shirtless manly man, while we’re stuck with Pajama-Boy-in-Chief. But Putin’s action-hero photo ops are staged, and it’s all just a big bluff. It’s time to expose Putin for what he is: a swaggering loud-mouth who talks big but gets his tail kicked the first time a real man decides to fight back.

Here is a list of suggested counterpunches.

First, we should do something that we are already doing: John Kerry should go to Kiev and stay there until Putin pulls his tanks back from the border. We need to do what we did when Putin invaded Georgia in 2008: send in a rotating contingent of Western foreign ministers and heads of state, letting Putin know that if he wants to advance on Kiev he’s going to have to threaten the top leaders of all the Western powers. It’s a way of extending a de facto military umbrella over the Western half of Ukraine and the central government without having to do it officially.

With this implicit defense in place, we should immediately begin helping Ukraine transform itself into a porcupine state capable of filling the Russian bear’s nose with prickles.

Putin’s pause after taking Crimea is a brilliant strategy, if he assumes that Western leaders don’t want to have to think about Ukraine and really don’t want to have to do anything about it. But if anyone in Kiev, Europe, or Washington has any gumption, then this pause is a colossal blunder. It will allow the new Ukrainian government an opportunity to regroup, to assure the loyalty of its armed forces (placed in doubt by a few key defections), and to consolidate its hold over Ukraine’s Eastern provinces. A few days ago, I was concerned that the Russians might be able to drive a column of tanks straight into Kiev without any organized resistance. But Putin’s pause has probably ensured that Crimea is all he can take without a nasty fight.

And Crimea may well be untenable on its own. It is, after all, a peninsula, connected to the mainland by the narrow little Perokop Isthmus, through which moves most of Crimea’s electricity, water, and food. So why not tell the Russians that if they want to occupy Crimea, they will be dark, hungry and thirsty? Putin’s approach to the remaining loyal Ukrainian forces in Crimea has been, not to shoot them, but to lay siege to them and wait them out. Once the government in Kiev feels secure in its hold on the East, it can besiege the besiegers. If Ukraine wants to be more provocative, it should launch a raid to sabotage the ferry terminal at Kerch, the closest point in Crimea to Russia, to prevent Russian reinforcements and resupply, tightening the siege.

The Ukrainian armed forces are much smaller than Russia’s—about 130,000 troops versus Russia’s 850,000. But those Russian troops have a whole lot of other territory to defend, so in practice, a fight in Ukraine would be a lot more balanced, even accounting for some mixed loyalties and defections on the Ukrainian side. Ukraine even makes its own anti-tank missiles, which would come in handy. Where Ukraine is overmatched, and where we can help the most, is with its air defenses. As a start, how about deploying an American-staffed battery of Patriot anti-ballistic missiles to Ukraine?

For that matter, we should revive the anti-ballistic missile facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic that President Obama canceled in 2009. The justification for that action was that the Russians aren’t a threat to Europe, so we shouldn’t be going out of our way to antagonize them. That premise has proven to be more than a little naive.

But military opposition is just the beginning. Just as potent is our economic power.

We should immediately impose economic sanctions on Russia, freeze the assets of its top officials, cut off its banks from the international economy, and impose trade restrictions—and we should require others to do it, just as we did when we were still trying to impose sanctions on Iran. We don’t do a lot of business with Russia, but Western Europe does, so this means we’re going to have to be tough will some of our allies, particularly Britain, which may want to protect the business it does with Russia’s politically connected billionaires, its “oligarchs.”

But Russia is only about 2% of the global economy. They need us a whole lot more than we need them.

Moreover, Putin is weak at home. His rule depends on shutting up his critics, and he may not have public support for his Ukraine adventure. Meanwhile, Russians are snapping up dollars and euros in a panic.

For the past twenty years, Russians have gotten used to the benefits of being connected to the global economy. There is the general benefit of being in an economy that is connected to global trade, and there is the individual benefit of being able to buy goods from abroad and also to seek business and employment abroad. What if we cut off those benefits? Let’s make sure every Russian knows how much Putin is going to cost them.

The only thing we would really miss if we shut off Russia’s economy is its oil and gas. Europe is particularly dependent on it. Fortunately, the fracking revolution in America makes us perfectly capable of solving this problem by flooding the world with cheap oil and gas. We could help provide for the immediate needs of Europe and Ukraine with shipments of liquid natural gas. Over the long run, what would really hurt Russia is an increase in supply that drives down oil and gas prices, reducing one of the Russian economy’s main sources of revenue.

This is what helped bury the Soviet Union. High oil prices in the 1970s propped up the Brezhnev regime—but the lower prices of the 80s left his successors unable to pay their bills. We can do that again. All that is required is to lift restrictions on exploration and production in the US, and to lift the ridiculous ban on exporting American oil. And while we’re at it, we can help the Ukrainians frack their own natural gas.

Then there’s diplomacy. Over at RealClearWorld, Alex Berezow has a good run-down of actions to take against Putin, which includes, “All democratic embassies in Russia should be closed.” But this is perhaps a bit too symbolic. Putin fancies himself a hard man who only respects action. So here’s something more substantive. The United States has entered into a couple of big international agreements, on Syria and Iran, that were brokered by Russia and are dependent on cooperation with Putin. These agreements serve Putin’s interests by allowing him to cultivate client states in the Middle East while blocking US action in the region. What they do for our interests isn’t so clear. So throw out the agreements with Syria and Iran. They’re falling apart anyway. Tell Putin that if he wants those agreements back, he’s going to have to talk to us.

Finally, we should resume the great project of expanding NATO. Certainly, we should renew our commitment to existing NATO nations that are under Russian threat, sending US troops to places like Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia as a guarantee against further aggression. We should then start putting Ukraine on a fast track to prepare it for NATO membership.

In the meantime, we should encourage our NATO allies in Eastern Europe—the ones who are also under Russian threat—to help defend Ukraine. As an intermediate step, I’ll return to a suggestion Jack Wakeland and I offered during the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008: form a new Warsaw Pact against Russia, a US-sponsored military alliance of states which, like Ukraine, are the borderlands between Russia and the West. Such an alliance would have the advantage of being more willing to assert itself in this kind of conflict because all of its members would share the same vital interest in stopping even small acts of Russian aggression.

Finally, we need to do as much of this as we can right now. We shouldn’t start by merely threatening to do these things or offering to negotiate about them. Let’s not treat Putin’s aggression in Ukraine as if it were the first provocation that indicates that maybe Putin’s heart isn’t in the right place. That happened a long time ago. Treat this as the last provocation that demonstrates Putin’s evil intent and makes it an urgent necessity to shut him down.

So far, Putin has been way inside our decision cycle, moving troops on the ground while our leaders are still just trying to figure out what’s going on. In the OODA loop—Observe, Orient, Decide, Act—Putin has been in the “A” mode, while President Obama can’t quite manage the first “O.”

Let’s put the shoe on the other foot. We need to act in a way that is big, sweeping, complex, and fast, leaving Putin as the one who is confused and scrambling to catch up, So implement all of this fully, right away. If Putin wants us to reverse any of it, he can ask to negotiate after we’ve made our move.

These are the things we might do if we had real, decisive leaders in the Washington. Perhaps that’s too much to expect from this administration, but let’s at least stop pretending that good options don’t exist. They do, and if we don’t use them, the fault isn’t our resources. It’s our leadership.

The Crimea Crisis And The Abuse Of History,"Every international crisis brings out the amateur historian in pundits and politicians. The Russian seizure of Crimea has been no different, sparking all kinds of analogies and examples, including the inevitable Hitler comparisons. (Yes, Secretary Clinton, you have a point. But it was still over the top, especially coming from America’s former chief diplomat.)

That is not to say that history itself is not useful. Professional historians have much to tell us about the roots of this conflict, as do political analysts, who (like me) see proximate causes for the crisis in recent events, including serious errors in U.S. foreign policy. But facile historical comparisons are only obscuring more than they are clarifying.

Many of these parallels are put forward by people who understand neither the present situation nor the past to which they’re comparing it. Taking an early lead in the competition for the worst way to open an article in this category, a “senior political analyst” at Al Jazeera began a story recently by writing: “Like most of the people speaking about Ukraine, I am no expert. But I know one or two things about the history of the Cold War to recognize…”

As is so often the case, knowing just one or two things is almost always an invitation to later intellectual trouble.

Sometimes, of course, the goal is intentional obfuscation: Russian apologists, for example, rely on flawed comparisons with Kosovo and Iraq as justifications for the Kremlin’s aggression. In America, meanwhile, some partisans, determined to prevent this disaster from staining the Obama administration, invoke George W. Bush’s tepid reaction to the 2008 Russian attack on Georgia as the precedent for Western inaction.

In the end, however, these historical analogies are mostly nonsense, especially when they are used to draw false moral equivalences. There may be precedents to consider in determining our reaction to the Russian invasion, but they are not to be found among clumsy historical fairy tales. So let’s dispense with them right now.

This is not Kosovo in 1999

Crimea, despite the jibe from Putin that Ukraine is “not even a country,” it is not part of a failing state, or on the verge of a genocide. Ukraine is a nation-state that’s just experienced a traumatic change of government, the result of a popular uprising against an increasingly autocratic president who was duly removed by his own parliament (and repudiated by his own party).

The Ukrainian government is not led by people like the late Slobodan Milosevic, whose forces had already butchered thousands in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and were poised to slaughter yet more. Putin would dearly love to draw that equivalence, but the relative calm of the Ukrainian armed forces to the arrival of his thugs – and if they’re liberators, why are they wearing masks? – has flummoxed him and defeated his attempt to create a faked “refugee crisis.”

This is not Iraq in 2003

This is the one that is, of course, particularly offensive to Americans, whose sons and daughters fought and suffered in a war against a pestilent madman who had started two wars with his neighbors, used weapons of mass destruction, conducted attempted genocide against his own people, and thumbed his nose at repeated demands and resolutions from the UN Security Council.

Whether one supported or lamented the war – I went from the former to the latter – what’s going on in Crimea isn’t even vaguely related to the 2003 war against Iraq, which was an outlaw state led by a dictator already guilty of decades of repeated crimes against humanity by the time he was finally deposed.

This is isn’t Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968

These two have a popularity among folks who are misusing history. Some have used them to show continuity in Russian foreign policy – i.e., that Moscow can’t help invading its neighbors, as though it’s in the Russian political DNA – while others have pointed to the feckless Western responses to the Crimean invasion as nothing more than updated versions of the awful situations faced by Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson in those two crises.

First, the invasions of those two nations were not as much “Russian” as they were “Soviet” actions, and there is in fact a difference. They were driven by a deep ideological insecurity that feared any public repudiation of the Soviet Union’s “alliance,” the Warsaw Pact, which was less an alliance than a multi-state prison camp. The same ideological hypochondria pulled the USSR into Afghanistan, even as Soviet leaders knew they were heading into chaos.

Second, it is pure sophistry to argue that President Obama is in the same jam faced by Ike and LBJ. Budapest and Prague, tragically, were theoretically Soviet allies, and during the tense years of the Cold War any attempt to force them from Moscow’s grip would almost instantly have meant World War III. We face no such danger now, unless we or the Russians decide to escalate to a major war that in turn threatens NATO – which, God willing, no one is even thinking of right now.

This isn’t Georgia in 2008

Finally, this is not a re-run of the Georgian war, and there is little in that experience to help us now, although Bush’s national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, did admit that Bush should have punished Putin more for his adventure in Georgia.

The Georgian war was different, however, in that Washington was faced with the awkward problem that the Georgians struck first (although Tbilisi later disputed that finding.) The Georgian leaders were relentlessly baited into an unwise war by the Russians, who had cleverly laid a trap and sprang it the minute the Georgians opened fire. If there is a lesson here, it has already been learned by the Ukrainians, who have wisely – and miraculously – resisted serial Russian provocations.

But the idea that Putin was encouraged by Bush’s “weak” response is nonsense. Putin actually reached out to Bush early in the crisis, a cagey move that left POTUS 43 in a quandary: he couldn’t ask a friendly country to desist in an effort to reclaim its own territory, but the Georgians had blundered ahead without consulting Washington, and Bush could not put NATO on the line for a war it hadn’t started.

It’s also important to remember that it only took a week or so for the Europeans to get Moscow to desist and agree to pull back. Russian troops still occupy parts of Georgia, but the crisis was defused relatively quickly. This time, however, Putin has shown little interest in anything anyone has to say, even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he is on far better terms than President Obama.

In the end, there is no historical justification or analogy for Russian action. Perhaps the closest examples to what we’re seeing now in Crimea are Argentina’s attempted seizure of the Falkland Islands in 1982, or Saddam Hussein’s attempt to erase Kuwait from the map in 1991. In both cases, one state attempted to redrawn disputed borders by sheer force.

The Argentine junta and Saddam both failed in the face of a military response. There is no such action here (and calls for increased military activity in the West are as ridiculous as they are empty). Putin, it seems, will succeed, but that short-term victory does not prefigure Europe’s future. Putin is not Hitler, no more than President Obama and Chancellor Merkel are modern Neville Chamberlains.

This conflict has its roots in a complex history in the region, to be sure, but the situation itself is not nearly that complicated. But if we are to tolerate the invasion of a peaceful state by another, as it seems we must, then at least let us at least not dress up our discomfort in foolish and awkward analogies.

Putin’s Russia: Gridlock-Free And Getting Stuff Done,"There is no political obstructionism in the Russian Federation – a state of affairs that must make good-government types here in the United States envious.

Without gridlock, Russia is blessed with extraordinarily high levels of bipartisanship – scratch that, transpartisanship. And we’re not talking about a few moderates jumping ship to create the illusion of compromise. Democratically elected leaders are governing. Things get done. And they get done quickly. On March 18, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the parliament to pass a bill to incorporate Crimea and Sevastopol into Russia. On March 19, after the Foreign Minister moved the treaty and urged lawmakers for their support. It passed on a vote of 443 to 1. Ilya Ponomarev, the soon-to-be-former representative from Novosibirsk was the only crack in unity. I hope the guy stays safe.

By March 21st, Putin had his treaty signed and Crimea was Russia.

Without a strong minority voters are awash in self-determination. Without any true division of power, courts function under a weak and malleable constitution and crony plutocrats work closely with Moscow for the collective good. There is little economic uncertainty and lawmakers are able “accomplish” much without hassle. The Russian Constitution, for example, already guarantees a citizen the right to free healthcare and medical assistance provided by the state. Not us. 1918 called, it wants its debate back.

In general, I’m not comparing the ambitions of Barack Obama and Putin. But Russian politics offers us another lesson on why gridlock is more useful than destructive. The Founders erected an elaborate system of checks and balances to impede the flood of power, bad ideas, and passions, the exigency of overcoming “gridlock”—the “fierce urgency” to get things done, as Obama might put it, seems trumps all other concerns here at home. Polarization in Washington is an organic safeguard against one party’s ability to fundamentally changing the institutions of the country, yet we’re schooled to be repelled by it. In a 2013 Gallup poll 78 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Congress was handling its job. The top concern offered was partisan gridlock. Other polls find that upwards of 95 percent have negative view of the GOP congress – who they blame for creating gridlock when, in fact, a diverse electorate is the guilty party.

Putin’s reprehensible play in Crimea exposes some of the problems with our knee-jerk support for majoritarianism, both internationally and domestically. It should be noted that Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov is leader of the “Unity” party. And today, he actually enjoys unity. Over 95 percent of the Crimean voters voted “yea” in the referendum to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia. From what I’ve gathered listening to Washington over the past 15 years, self-determination is a worthwhile enterprise. If 90 percent of voters demand action — say on gun control – it is, as the Democrats have often argued, unconscionable not to move forward. Why shouldn’t Crimean voters have their way? History didn’t begin yesterday, after all. How can you be a Wilsonian idealist one day, and decide that borders are forever static stationary the next? Peter Baker lays our shifting position in the New York Times:

Consider the different American views of recent bids for independence.



Chechnya? No.



East Timor? Yes.



Abkhazia? No.



South Sudan? Yes.



Palestine? It’s complicated.



It is an acutely delicate subject in the West, where Britain wants to keep Scotland and Spain wants to keep Catalonia. The United States, after all, was born in revolution, breaking away from London without consent of the national government — something that the Obama administration insists Crimea must have.

If we support the “Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” as Obama, and other administrations, have argued, why not the ethnic Russians of Crimea? There’s a perfectly good reason to oppose both, of course. But there are things we should value more than self-determination and “democracy”? Yes – over there, and here at home.

Vladimir Putin Is Not The President Of Sim City,"Are you deeply interested in what’s going on in the current crisis between Russia and Ukraine right now, but don’t know much about either Russia or Ukraine? Do you want to get involved in prognosticating what’s going to happen, but don’t want to bother with the tedium of studying Russian and Soviet history, or the interminable drudgery of learning the Russian or Ukrainian languages?

Not to worry. Famous economist Daniel Altman has a solution for you. It’s called game theory, and it explains everything you need to know, without having to know… well, anything, really. Let me say at the outset, I do not know Dr. Altman, and I have no personal issue with him or his body of work as an economist. (He is big, apparently, in international development and globalization circles.) Indeed, I do not work in his field at all, and I am not qualified to judge it. He has gained my attention, however, by working in my field, and doing it poorly.

Altman’s argument is that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a master of game theory. He’s so good at it, in fact, that he’s already won the game he’s playing over Ukraine and we clueless Westerners don’t even know it yet. “Reasoning,” Altman tells us in a recent Foreign Policy article, is Putin’s “strong suit,” and the West “could learn a lot from him.” Putin, he thinks, is working from a set of internal rules that game theorists would recognize, and unless we get up to speed pronto, he’s going to keep taking us to the cleaners. (The idea that Putin is simply running the table against an overmatched and disengaged United States foreign policy team doesn’t enter into any of this, apparently. That explanation doesn’t fit the theory – and isn’t usually bruited about in polite academic conversation.)

Now, to people unencumbered by higher education or formal training in the social sciences, this might all seem silly. Who can divine the behavior of nations, and especially of mercurial leaders like Vladimir Putin, from models? Would anyone actually rely on that kind of analysis? (Sadly, the answer is yes, and some even pay for it quite handsomely, as it turns out. Just ask political scientist Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, who sells the results of an algorithm that predicts all kinds of stuff – a secret and proprietary formula, of course – to business and government for big bucks.)

For those who’ve never sat through a university department meeting or been trapped in the hell of a mediocre academic conference, here’s how this kind of intellectual painting-by-the-numbers works.

First, start with a model or a theory. In this case, it’s game theory, the idea that human beings are reducible (as in some cases they are) to little robots that maximize gain and minimize loss. If you’ve ever played the classic computer game SimCity, you’ve already engaged in a nicely rendered version of game theory: the little citizens, the Sims, act in predictable ways that you, as the mayor of SimCity, can shape with policy choices. Raise taxes or let crime go up, your Sims move away. Lower taxes and provide better public services, and your Sims will make cute little parks and churches and have babies.

Next – and this is key – don’t allow the model to be contaminated by pesky stuff like evidence. It just gets in the way. If a closer look at events and actors produces complexities that can’t be explained, change the scale of the theory to a higher level of abstraction so you can ignore them. (Remember: from a high enough altitude, Massachusetts and California look alike.) And keep it simple: the less specificity, the better.

Altman, accordingly, claims that Putin’s actions reflect “a simple three-step process designed to guarantee success” that “come right out of a game theory textbook.” The rest of us might call them “common sense,” but let’s take a closer look.

Overestimating Putin’s Savvy

First, Putin is making sure to “locate the opportunity.” Putin, Altman tells us, “only plays games that he knows he can win. Like a game theorist, he looks at his possible moves and the moves of his opponents.” This, I guess, is supposed to fly in the face of conventional wisdom about how the rest of us do things, which is…what? That we prefer the games we’re not good at, and then play as though there is no opponent? (“Okay, men, I know you’re all scrabble champs, but take this football out on the field at the 30-yard line, and just play. If there’s another team, we can’t spend a lot of time worrying about what they’re gonna do.”) As long as Putin isn’t a complete idiot, anything he does fits this “rule.”

Next, Altman notes that Putin is applying the maxim that one must “change the status quo.” If Putin doesn’t act, Altman writes, “then the world will go on its merry way, which is not what he wants.” He’s arguing that Putin’s Russia is no longer a status quo power; that is, one satisfied with the nature of the current international order. Fair enough, although I and millions of Ukrainians had already reached that conclusion. But the notion that any world leader is ever content to have the world “go on its merry way” is a ridiculous abstraction. No one, whether running a government or a household, acts that way. Altman is only telling us that Putin is trying as best he can to shape his environment to his advantage, just as you and I, unskilled in the mysteries of game theory, do every month when we pay our bills.

And then there’s this: Putin knows he must “force the opponents to accept the new status quo.” Altman then delivers a Deep Revelation, which will surprise exactly no one: “Putin’s favorite kind of opponent is the one who accepts losing, thus confirming the change he desires. In order to ensure that his opponent accepts the loss, Putin must make any other reaction less desirable.”

Let’s just ponder that. Putin, apparently, is far savvier than the rest of us, in that he likes to play games against people who don’t mind losing. Unlike, say, you or me, who obviously prefer really tough, die-hard opponents who never accept a loss. And he has a point: who hasn’t enjoyed a good game of poker with the fellow who always upends the table at the end of the night, scatters all the chips, and demands all his money back? We all love that guy. We’d much rather play with him than with the cheerful loser who settles up and then quietly skulks out of the room with empty pockets.

All of Altman’s elegant restatements of common sense might serve as a useful heuristic to simplify Putin’s actions if there were some kind of evidence to support his explanations. Instead, Altman’s evidence is the worst kind there is: the tautological use of the outcome of the Crimean crisis itself. Instead of basing his argument on things we might have learned about Putin or the Russian decision-making process, Altman instead merely reverse-engineers conclusions based on what he knows has already happened to prove that Putin knew what he was doing all along. (The fact that the crisis isn’t over yet is, apparently, of no concern.)

This is a serious intellectual error, and surely Altman knows it. It is the equivalent of arguing that because you left your home one morning in Boston and ended up in Philadelphia that night, it must be because Philly is where you meant to go all along. While that might make a logical first pass at an explanation, it makes no provision for any other events, like getting lost, cutting the trip short, or a flat tire. If a leader ends up with a certain outcome, it must have been the one he wanted, because that’s what happened, and all that’s left is to reconstruct the obviously logical and conscious choices that got him there.

Altman’s analysis on this point worth is reading at length, to see just how hard he hammers a big, square peg into a tiny, round hole:

Putin’s actions in Ukraine are a case in point. His overarching goals are to enhance Russian power and push back the West by expanding his spheres of control and influence. His preference might have been to do this in Ukraine peacefully and across the country as a whole, but he was also willing to use violence and take what was available piecemeal.

Note how this carefully covers all of Putin’s possible actions. If he gained Ukraine peacefully, that was his goal. But if he had to use violence…well, that could have been his goal, too.

Altman continues:

Here is how he may have seen the game play out late last year. First, he would offer a package of financial aid to Ukraine. He knew his ally, the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, would accept. If all was well thereafter, mission accomplished — Ukraine would once again be Russia’s client state. If all was not well — that is, if there were political upheaval, protests, unrest, or all three — then the country would be unstable. And an unstable Ukraine would be ripe for the picking, especially since parts of it were strongly sympathetic to Russia. If Ukraine did become unstable, then Putin’s next move would be to invade Crimea and somehow legitimize its return to Russia. This would be the first step in a piecemeal recovery of power over Ukraine. Achieving the change itself would not be difficult. But he would also have to force his opponents to accept it.

Get that? We know Putin is successfully applying game theory because Altman can posit each of his steps as being intentional, because Putin has clearly succeeded, and this success itself is evidence that he’s doing things according to the game theory playbook. Putin had a plan to “somehow legitimize” the seizure of Crimea, and we know this because so far, the seizure of Crimea has been “somehow legitimized.” This is purely circular reasoning.

It is also pure nonsense. The fact of the matter is that Altman has no idea whether anything he is positing is true. He has no way of knowing, and presents no evidence at all, about whether any of this was a plan, whether it was improvisation, or just (at least so far) sheer good luck. Altman’s evidence for his whole case is that so far, things are working out for Putin, and from this, he draws the conclusion that Putin is playing his own version of a careful application of classic game theory. Unless Altman’s had a recent chat with Putin we don’t know about, this amounts to nothing more than guessing.

Game Theory or Petty Revenge?

This is the kind of theorizing that is best facilitated by not knowing too much about the subject. I and others could just as well argue (and have) that Putin is, in fact, acting irrationally because he is risking things he had already gained. Indeed, leave aside the straitjacket of formal theory, learn a bit about the actual historical and political situation in the region, and Putin’s actions can just as easily – if not more so – be explained as those of a vengeful, petty product of the Soviet system than those of a careful game player.

Why? Because Putin could have “won” this crisis by never starting it. Over the course of a decade, especially once the Orange Revolution was defeated, Putin had gotten just about everything he wanted from Ukraine, including a leader in Kyiv who practically had “Property of the Kremlin” stamped on his forehead. Putin’s attempt to force the Russia-or-Europe choice down Yanukovich’s throat (which apparently actually happened in an expletive-filled dressing down Putin gave him in Moscow) was irrational overreach by the Russian President that provoked the Euromaidan movement – exactly the reaction Putin didn’t want. By some reports, Putin was genuinely taken aback, then surprised, and finally enraged by Yanukovich’s ouster, and he reacted with visceral anger, setting in motion events whose end are nowhere in sight even for Putin himself. The Russian invasion of Crimea is now endangering things Putin values – like Russian economic stability purely so he claim something – a base and a military presence in Crimea – he already had.

Not content to reduce Putin to the President of SimCity, Altman packages up some lessons for the rest of us. “Assess vulnerabilities, both present and potential,” he suggests – for those of us, of course, to whom it has never occurred to do risk analysis – because “the games Putin will play are not always readily apparent. Ukraine was not obviously unstable, but Putin had the foresight to see how it might become destabilized.”

Excuse me? Ukraine was not obviously unstable? Perhaps it could seem that way if viewed from outer space, but to anyone who’s spent more than a few minutes studying the former Soviet region, Ukraine was the most unstable place in Europe outside of the former Yugoslavia. A Ukrainian civil war has been worrying all of us who study this area and has been a constant fear among specialists in this subject ever since the Soviet collapse. This is a classic moment where theory is invaluably aided by steering clear of any kind of contact with reality.

Next: “Learn about your opponent’s objectives.” Indeed. How often those of us who write and lecture on strategy have foolishly told our students: “Ignore your opponent and his goals.” But now we’ve been set straight.

Altman predicts, by the way, that “Putin’s remaining moves are fairly straightforward” and that he will not invade eastern Ukraine. Instead, “he will finally appear to listen to reason” and “disown the pro-Russian forces there (whose actions he instigated), while privately reassuring them of his support and explaining that it was not the right time for further action.”

I suppose all of that is possible, although I can think of a lot of reasons Putin won’t invade Ukraine’s east that have nothing to do with game theory and have everything to do with him not being completely crazy and reckless. And if he does invade, I’m sure Altman will have an explanation about why this really fits the theory, because the incentive structures were changed, and Putin saw new payoff expectations, and…well, you get the idea. It’s not that hard to drown a bad prediction in a swamp of theory always teeming with analytical leeches that can drain any meaning from any outcome.

In the end, this is the kind of analysis that gives academic theory a bad name. Theory, when used as a tool instead of pursued as an end itself, does actually serve a purpose. It helps to make order out of random bits of data, and to allow us organize the chaos of events into coherent sets of relationships and explanations. Unfortunately, over the years academic theory has devolved into boring intellectual jousts that explain almost nothing.

When applied to the real world, as in Altman’s thought exercise, the apparatus of theory does little more than act as window-dressing to make guessing seem scientific. Jamming the template of game theory over something like the behavior of Vladimir Putin, especially this early in the crisis, is a kind of stunt: it’s a way of theatrically pushing data into one end of a big box and then pretending to read an objective answer at the other, the way Adam West’s Batman used to punch clues into the “Bat-Computer” and then watch it spit out a little card telling him exactly where the Riddler was about to strike next.

Those of us who think Putin is acting emotionally in an insulated, low-information environment (including Angela Merkel, whom Altman tut-tuts for not getting what Putin is about) are not just making it up as we go or randomly picking motives. We’re reaching that conclusion because we’ve been watching this situation for a long time, and in context, Putin’s actions seem reckless and violent. If Putin’s motives are as Altman describes them, then his actions are not only unreasonable, they run a great risk of being, in the end, self-defeating. But to see them in that context is more in keeping with the nature of the man as we’ve come to know him, the regime he’s created, and the culture in which he lives, all of which explain more to us than positing his choices as just another day at the office for the President of SimCity.

Can Hillary Clinton Recover From Her Support Of The Iraq War?,"With the news that Condoleeza Rice has been hounded from a commencement speaking engagement at Rutgers University by left-wing faculty and student protests on the grounds that Rice “had played ‘a prominent role in the administration’s effort to mislead the American people about the presence of weapons of mass destruction’ in Iraq,” the question that haunted Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign must be asked again: can the Democratic base ever forgive her support for launching that war? The answer, in all likelihood, is that the Democratic Party’s base will forgive and forget – not only out of political expediency and ignorance of history but because, deep in their hearts, they do not really believe their own extreme rhetoric about the Iraq War.

Hawks of a Feather

Unquestionably, if you take the campaign against Rice on its own terms – that “misleading” the nation to war over Saddam’s WMD programs is a war crime or something like it, making one ineligible to be received in polite company – Hillary is similarly guilty. Consider how then-Senator Clinton herself justified that vote:

In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001.



It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.



…In the case of Iraq, recent comments indicate that one or two Security Council members might never approve force against Saddam Hussein until he has actually used chemical, biological, or God forbid, nuclear weapons.



…While the military outcome is not in doubt, should we put troops on the ground, there is still the matter of Saddam Hussein’s biological and chemical weapons. Today he has maximum incentive not to use them or give them away. If he did either, the world would demand his immediate removal. Once the battle is joined, however, with the outcome certain, he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he can’t use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone. We cannot be paralyzed by this possibility, but we would be foolish to ignore it. And according to recent reports, the CIA agrees with this analysis.



…perhaps my decision is influenced by my eight years of experience on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our nation. I want this President, or any future President, to be in the strongest possible position to lead our country in the United Nations or in war…I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the President’s efforts to wage America’s war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.



…Over eleven years have passed since the UN called on Saddam Hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning to the world community. Time and time again he has frustrated and denied these conditions.

The hairsplitting defense typically offered by those who wish to drive Rice and other senior Bush officials from civilized society while pledging their votes, money and support to make Hillary the next President is that Hillary was just one Senator, following the Bush Administration’s lead. Now, if you regard the Iraq War as a question of ordinary politics and statesmanship, that might be a defense, albeit one that shouldn’t inspire confidence in Hillary’s judgment among diehard critics of the war. But if your actual, serious opinion is that the war is some sort of war crime, “I was only following the leaders” is pretty well-recognized as not being a defense.

And besides that, Hillary was not just any Senator. She had been the First Lady of the recently-departed Administration for eight years, and as her floor speech alluded, she was trading on the credibility that came from her husband dealing with intelligence reports on Saddam’s WMD programs throughout those years. Moreover, the Democrats were leaderless and deeply divided in 2002. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Senate Majority Whip Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 2000 Vice Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman and 1988 presidential candidate Joe Biden were supporting the war, but 2000 Presidential nominee Al Gore, House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi, and Senate “liberal lion” Ted Kennedy were opposed. In that setting, the Clintons – the first two-term Democratic president since FDR and his wife – were still de facto the most popular and influential figures in the party. A vigorous statement of opposition to the war by Hillary, bearing at least the implicit imprimatur of her husband (her chief national security adviser at the time), would have carried enormous weight. And with Democratic control of the Senate until the 2002 elections, those votes were critical

Why did she choose, instead, to support and justify a war that Democratic partisans now regard as a war crime, beyond the pale of civilized discourse and disagreement? The New York Times suggested in 2007 that it was her fear of gender politics: “Clinton knew she could never advance her career — or win the presidency, especially — if she didn’t prove that she was tough enough to be commander in chief. Female candidates, it’s presumed, have often suffered as a result of the stereotype that they could never be as strong as men.” That’s a terrible reason to vote to send a nation to war. But as her speech and conduct at the time made clear, there was likely more that went into her thinking than that – thinking not so different, after all, from that of the Bush Administration.

I Read Your Book

In 1998, in the midst of a decade of sanctions on Saddam’s regime, WMD intelligence combined with Saddam’s refusal to cooperate with required weapons inspections had led President Clinton to launch a large-scale air strike against Iraq aimed entirely at suspected WMD sites, as described by President Clinton’s Defense Secretary at the time:

During the course of DESERT FOX, American and British war planes flew more than 650 strike and strike support sorties. Our ships launched more than 325 Tomahawk cruise missiles and U.S. Air Force B-52s launched more than 90 cruise missiles. In all, we attacked almost 100 targets, all related to our overall mission objectives….With respect to the manufacture of chemical and biological agents, as I’ve indicated time and time again, our goal was to diminish his capacity to deliver such chemicals or biological or even nuclear weapons and to strike those facilities we could identify that possibly solely produced them. But we were always conscious of the fact that you could have a facility inside of a hospital or a fertilizer plant, a dual use facility, and we took that into account in seeking to balance the need to reduce his capacity to pose a threat to the region and at the same time, not engaging in the wholesale destruction of the Iraqi people.

The conclusion from that presser? It wasn’t over:

Q: Secretary Cohen, regarding the inspectors, in addition to the UNSCOM inspectors, who call themselves in effect, the IA — International Atomic Energy Agency Inspectors, have also been required to leave Iraq and it’s believed by some they also may not be able to return. And those inspectors were widely considered effective. I mean, is that a price you’re going to have to pay, now having done what you’ve done?

A: Saddam will have to make a determination as to whether or not he’s prepared to fully cooperate with those inspectors as well. To the extent that they remain outside of Iraq, there will be no chance of closing any files in the future. And so, the sanctions, again, will continue to remain in place. So he does not benefit from keeping them out, and he does not benefit from keeping the UNSCOM team out either.

Q: He benefits in terms of an ease[ing] in developing a nuclear program.

A: Well, we are going to continue to watch him very closely. We have — we will make every effort to compensate for the lack of those inspectors. But by the same token, he is going to be precluded from getting relief from the sanctions and that is very important to him. He wanted to get the inspectors out and get relief from the sanctions. He may have gotten the inspectors out at least temporarily. He will not get relief from the sanctions.

Q: Do you think it’s just a matter of time before the United States will have to conduct another such operation against Iraq?

A: Wouldn’t want to speculate on that. We’re prepared to conduct future military operations, but that will depend upon Saddam’s actions.

Of course, those actions had not improved between 1998 and 2002; that’s one reason why even Gore, in a debate with George W. Bush in 2000, had pledged that “I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein.” The intelligence community throughout the United States and around the globe, from one country to the next, agreed in 1998 and still agreed in 2002 that Saddam had non-trivial WMD capabilities and was scheming to obtain more, and scores of leading Democrats believed the same thing. That was the view of the Clinton Administration before Desert Fox, and it continued to be the view of U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies after Desert Fox:

[T]he German Federal Intelligence Service held the bleakest view of all, arguing that Iraq might be able to build a nuclear weapon within three years. Israel, Russia, Britain, China, and even France held positions similar to that of the United States; France’s President Jacques Chirac told Time magazine [in February 2003], “There is a problem—the probable possession of weapons of mass destruction by an uncontrollable country, Iraq. The international community is right … in having decided Iraq should be disarmed.”

Indeed, Saddam’s possession of usable stocks of WMD was believed at the time by senior figures in Iraq’s own military, who were stunned when Saddam disclosed to them in December 2002 that he lacked chemical or biological stockpiles. And from what we learned later on, much of the fault for misunderstanding lay with Saddam himself. He contended, after his capture, that he had deliberately tried to give the appearance of having WMD in order to deter Iran. Ironically, later U.S. analyses found that Saddam’s frantic efforts to scrub former WMD sites in order to give selective access to inspectors had been interpreted as a different kind of cover-up. The very scope of Saddam’s earlier WMD programs made the task of securing all its weapons daunting – a Wikileaks release of previously-secret documents in 2010 illustrated that “for years after [2003], U.S. troops continued to find chemical weapons labs, encounter insurgent specialists in toxins and uncover weapons of mass destruction”:

In August 2004, for instance, American forces surreptitiously purchased what they believed to be containers of liquid sulfur mustard, a toxic “blister agent” used as a chemical weapon since World War I. The troops tested the liquid, and “reported two positive results for blister.” The chemical was then “triple-sealed and transported to a secure site” outside their base.



…Meanwhile, the second battle of Fallujah was raging in Anbar province. In the southeastern corner of the city, American forces came across a “house with a chemical lab … substances found are similar to ones (in lesser quantities located a previous chemical lab.” The following day, there’s a call in another part of the city for explosive experts to dispose of a “chemical cache.”



Nearly three years later, American troops were still finding WMD in the region. An armored Buffalo vehicle unearthed a cache of artillery shells “that was covered by sacks and leaves under an Iraqi Community Watch checkpoint. “The 155mm rounds are filled with an unknown liquid, and several of which are leaking a black tar-like substance.” Initial tests were inconclusive. But later, “the rounds tested positive for mustard.”

And what Saddam was actually doing was hardly harmless. For example, the Congressional testimony of Iraq Study Group head David Kay emphasized some of the threats presented even by a more accurate post-invasion picture of what Saddam had been up to:

Iraq made determined efforts to retain some capabilities for biological warfare. It maintained an undeclared network of laboratories and other facilities within the apparatus of its security services, and as Kay put it, “this clandestine capability was suitable for preserving BW expertise, BW-capable facilities, and continuing R&D—all key elements for maintaining a capability for resuming BW production.” To disguise its biological-warfare programs Baghdad had scientists working on overt projects that were closely related to proscribed activities.



Iraq seemed to have been most aggressive in pursuing proscribed missiles. In Kay’s words, “detainees and cooperative sources indicate that beginning in 2000 Saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with ranges of at least [240 miles] and up to [620 miles] and that measures to conceal these projects from [UN inspectors] were initiated in late 2002, ahead of the arrival of inspectors.” The Iraqis were also working on clustering liquid-fueled rocket engines in order to produce a longer-range missile, and were trying to convert certain surface-to-air missiles into surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 150 miles. Most troubling of all, the ISG uncovered evidence that from 1999 to 2002 Iraq had negotiated with North Korea to buy technology for No Dong missiles, which have a range of 800 miles.

Even after his capture, Saddam insisted to his FBI interrogator that he had planned to reconstitute his entire WMD program – chemical, biological, and nuclear. His efforts to corrupt and emasculate the sanctions regime gave him hope – not an irrational hope – that this strategy would prevail.

Subsequent efforts to condemn the truthfulness of the Bush Administration and the Blair and Howard governments in the U.K. and Australia have tended to focus on the existence of disagreements in the intel community over particular pieces of evidence and the timelines that could be drawn from them. And indeed, there were many such dissents at the time, and more than a few items of evidence that look flimsy or worse with hindsight. But the trees should not be mistaken for the forest. The people who thought the intelligence was completely wrong about Saddam’s WMD programs were, for the most part, people who had no clearance to read any of it. Even Barack Obama, who defeated Hillary in 2008 in part by deploying the Iraq vote against her, refused when running for the Senate in 2004 to say he would have voted against the Iraq War if he had had access to classified intelligence at the time, and insisted, as the battle shifted to countering the insurgency, that “There’s not much of a difference between my position on Iraq and George Bush’s position at this stage” – hardly the language of a crime against humanity. Even Obama had to resort to revisionist history on the issue of WMD intelligence; there’s no record of him questioning before the war whether Saddam had WMD. Here’s what State Senator Obama said at the time:

Now let me be clear – I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power. He has repeatedly defied UN resolutions, thwarted UN inspection teams, developed chemical and biological weapons, and coveted nuclear capacity….Let’s fight to make sure that the UN inspectors can do their work, and that we vigorously enforce a non-proliferation treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe.

In the end, the argument against American policymakers, in the Bush and Clinton camps alike, is that they committed a war crime by failing to read more closely and skeptically the particulars of specific items of evidence in order to call into question the intra- and inter-governmental consensus. But if that is your thesis, it’s hard to excuse Senator Clinton, who apparently did not even read the 90-page National Intelligence Estimate, according to some reports due to the fact that she only had 10 days in which to read it. Given that the NIE was less than a tenth the length of the Affordable Care Act, one is nostalgic for the days when Senators were asked to do so much less reading – and yet, it was too much for her to digest.

Causes and Reasons

If anything, Senator Clinton’s reliance on the WMD rationale is considerably more culpable, viewed through the lens of “war guilt,” than that of the Bush Administration, because it was much more central to her decision. Liberal ire over WMD intelligence was so acute because Democrats and liberals who did support the war – Hillary among them – did so almost entirely as an exercise in disarmament, consistent with the broader liberal tendency to view both war and crime as a question of weaponry rather than a question of behavior.

By contrast, conservative and Republican supporters of the war inside and outside the Bush Administration always saw the WMD issue as merely one part of a broader set of arguments for war. I’ve previously addressed the grand strategy behind that view, which focused on igniting a disruptive regional revolution that would unsettle the corrupt and oppressive status quo across the Greater Middle East and end the dynamic by which that region’s “secular” and religious leaders alike directed terrorism outwards in order to distract from their stagnant despotisms at home. But there were specific reasons as well, which fall under three general headings:

1. The U.S. and Iraq were still formally at war in 2002. The 1991 Gulf War did not end with a peace treaty; it ended with a cease-fire conditioned on Iraq’s compliance with a number of U.N. resolutions, and Iraq was failing to comply with several of those, including shooting at U.S. airplanes enforcing the no-fly zone, refusing to cooperate with weapons inspections, and funding Palestinian terrorists outside its borders. Every element of the decision to go to war with Iraq in 2002-03 must be evaluated in light of this posture. The issue in 2002 was not whether to pre-emptively invade a nation with which we were at peace, but whether to accept, after a decade of Saddam flouting these terms, that we simply would not enforce them – with all the consequences that entailed for the credibility of future agreements with the U.S.

2. Saddam cheered the 9/11 attacks and openly supported terrorism. The September 11 terrorist attacks were such an unprovoked atrocity that regimes around the world, even those implacably hostile to the United States, rushed to offer their support, their sympathy, or at least their willingness to disassociate themselves from the attacks. Almost alone in the world, though, Iraq’s state-run media openly celebrated the attacks while the wounds were still raw. The Ba’athist regime put up murals cheering the attacks. While even Qaddafi, Arafat and (disingenuously) the Taliban were offering condolonces, Saddam was gloating:

Saddam Hussein’s Iraq said the United States deserved Tuesday’s attacks in New York and Washington as the fruits “of its crimes against humanity.”



Under the headline “America burns,” the official newspaper Al-Iraq said that “what happened in the United States yesterday is a lesson for all tyrants, oppressors and criminals.”



Overnight an official Iraqi statement said: “The American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity.”

For myself, I took rather personally people cheering for attempts at murdering me. President Bush undoubtedly felt the same way, given that Saddam had hired terrorists to blow up George H.W. Bush on a 1993 visit to Kuwait:",https://thefederalist.com/2014/05/19/can-hillary-clinton-recover-from-her-support-of-the-iraq-war/,2014-05-19
The Paradox Of Expertise,"Recently in The Federalist we have seen two articles regarding the use of experts in policy making and the place of experts in society. John Daniel Davidson wrote about expert predictions in regard to Obamacare, namely the experts in economics and healthcare who claim that the Affordable Care Act will save so much money or so many lives. These kind of expert predictions are based on theoretical economics (theoretical because the economics of the act have yet to be played out) and statistical wrangling (it is impossible to predict how many people will be “saved” by such legislation).

There is certainly not much science behind the ACA. No one really disputes that increased healthcare for individuals would be beneficial. Rather the dispute arises from how much we, as a society, are willing to pay and whether or not the ACA will be effective in reaching its goals. In essence, the ACA issue is more a problem of bureaucratic administration rather than science. To this end, experts can make as many predictions as they like but it will never be science, much less, “settled” (wink, wink), and based on history they will be far, far off the mark.

The second article came from Tom Nichols lamenting the loss of the value of experts in today’s Google culture where even YOU TOO! can be an instant expert with just a few mouse-clicks and mastery of a keyboard. With this I am sympathetic; it is a matter of knowledge versus the illusion of knowledge. Mr. Nichols has obviously studied the area of foreign relations his entire life. His wealth of knowledge (expertise) regarding the situation in Crimea (just an example) is going to be far superior to my own. Scrolling Wikipedia’s Crimea page will not put me on the same level as someone who has spent years accumulating and processing information, history, and knowledge.

I think, to some extent, everyone laments the current state of the Google-discourse that can be found on nearly every website and most spectacularly in the comments section following a news article. I don’t blame Mr. Nichols for his frustration but I believe that there is an important caveat to make in this regard.

Experts possess knowledge and information but this does not equate to wisdom. An expert’s knowledge of the Crimea situation may help inform a decision but it cannot tell us whether taking a particular action is right or wrong, good or evil. Such rationality is available to every thinking human being.

Experts possess knowledge and information but this does not equate to wisdom.

Right now, a pregnant woman is chained to a wall in Sudan for the “crime” of marrying a Christian man who is an American citizen. She is scheduled to be hanged following the birth of her son. The United States government has yet to even hint at making any kind of demands against this action. An expert in Sudanese culture and Islam may be able to explain to me why she is being put to death and particulars about the legal system of that nation. An immigration expert might be able to tell me that she is not technically an American citizen merely by marriage and that we have no legal right to interfere. An expert on international law and foreign relations may tell me that we have no right to act internationally to prevent this from happening. But none of that would matter to me, because the truth of the matter is that what is happening to this woman is wrong and evil and antithetical to everything that our nation professes to believe. None of the explanations would amount to the final judgment of right and wrong.

This is where experts get into trouble. Some – not all, of course – believe that knowledge and information equal an elevated position of making right/wrong, good/bad judgments. However, these judgments are moral and value-based judgments. They are within the comprehension of the average man or woman and, indeed, the average man or woman’s judgment in this matter holds just as much validity as any expert’s.

Part of the issue lies in the politicization of everything in our current society, including experts.

Part of the issue lies in the politicization of everything in our current society, including experts. The greater knowledge and information that experts possess often affords them the ability to be elevated by both media and politicians to positions that presuppose wisdom. Thus, the passive public may just sit on their haunches and suppose that an expert is a better judge of morality than themselves. But this is an illusion brought about by their elevation in the public eye. Politicians try to piggyback on the knowledge and credentials of an expert to say that their position is ultimately the informed and morally right decision.

Knowledge and information are good to have in complex situations but they are not the final arbiter and, in some cases, may matter nothing at all. The costs of the ACA can only be judged in terms of how much we are willing to pay to administer healthcare to an individual. Everyone wants to pay for the healthcare of a little girl with Leukemia; we might feel differently about the alcoholic wife-beater who is still smoking through his tracheotomy. Likewise, intervention in Crimea or in the case of the Sudanese Christian comes down to moral right/wrong value judgments. To this we welcome the information, knowledge, and predictions of the experts but the decision on how to act and whether or not to act is ultimately a decision that can be made through a rationality available to all average men and women.

Experts, in wanting to stay relevant, must realize this distinction between the possession of knowledge and the acting on rationality and wisdom. To be sure, Mr. Nichols never makes such a claim and Mr. Davidson gave us the wisdom of C.S. Lewis. However, in the media-saturated world, experts who blur these lines and profess themselves to be in greater possession of wisdom and right/wrong value judgments risk trivializing their years of hard work and insight.

Is The War On Drugs Racist?,"Are racist drug laws driving black incarceration rates? Might that help explain why blacks are 13 percent of the population but half of all prison inmates?

In 1986, in response to the crack cocaine epidemic that was crushing American inner cities, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which insti¬tuted harsher penalties for crack cocaine offenses than for powder cocaine offenses. For sentencing purposes, the law stipulated that one gram of crack cocaine be treated as equivalent to 100 grams of powder cocaine. Because crack cocaine offenders tended to be black and powder cocaine offenders tended to be white, critics of the law denounced it as racially biased in hindsight. But it’s worth remembering that black lawmakers led the initial effort to pass the legislation.

The harsher penalties for crack cocaine offenses were supported by most of the Congressional Black Caucus, including New York Representatives Major Owens of Brooklyn and Charles Rangel of Harlem, who at the time headed the House Select Com¬mittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. Crack was destroying black communities, and many black political leaders wanted dealers to face longer sentences. “Eleven of the twenty-one blacks who were then members of the House of Representatives voted in favor of the law which created the 100-to-1 crack–powder differential,” noted Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy. “In light of charges that the crack–powder distinction was enacted partly because of conscious or unconscious racism, it is noteworthy that none of the black members of Congress made that claim at the time the bill was initially discussed.” Kennedy added: “The absence of any charge by black members of Congress that the crack–powder differential was racially unfair speaks volumes; after all, several of these rep¬resentatives had long histories of distinguished opposition to any public policy that smacked of racial injustice. That several of these representatives demanded a crackdown on crack is also significant. It suggests that the initiative for what became the crack–powder distinction originated to some extent within the ranks of African-American congressional officials.”

Despite this history, the crack–powder sentencing disparity would, over the next quarter century, become one of the left’s favorite examples of America’s racist criminal justice system. Barack Obama criticized the law while running for president in 2008 and early in his first term moved to lessen the differential. That effort culminated in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which lowered the ratio to 18 to 1. This was no doubt great news for criminals, but what’s been lost in the discussion is whether such a change leaves law-abiding blacks better off. In 2009 blacks were 85 percent of crack offenders, and sentences for crack offenses averaged twenty-four months longer than those for powder cocaine. Civil rights groups and others who equate racial disparities with racism have used such data to decry the sentencing guidelines as racially unjust, yet they don’t seem overly concerned with whether blacks in the main are helped or hurt when crack dealers are locked up longer for pushing a substance that has devastated urban black neighborhoods. Why is their sympathy with the lawbreakers?

Black crime rates are vastly higher than white crime rates. And it’s hard to see how wishing away this reality, inventing conspiracy theories to explain it, or calling those who point it out “racist” will help improve the situation.

Celebrated left-wing academics like Michelle Alexander reluctantly acknowledge that “some black mayors, politicians, and lobbyists—as well as preachers, teachers, barbers, and ordinary folk—endorse ‘get tough’ tactics” by police and the courts that facilitate the high black incarceration rates that she laments. But is it any great shock that black people without advanced degrees have less sympathy for black thugs? The black homicide rate is seven times that of whites, and the George Zimmermans of the world are not the reason. Some 90 percent of black murder victims are killed by other blacks. Why should we care more about black criminals than their black victims? Still, Alexander dismisses tough-on-crime blacks as ignorant and “confused.”

Liberal elites would have us deny what black ghetto residents know to be the truth. These communities aren’t dangerous because of racist cops or judges or sentencing guidelines. They’re dangerous mainly due to black criminals preying on black victims. Nor is the racial disparity in prison inmates explained by the enforcement of drug laws. In 2006 blacks were 37.5 percent of the 1,274,600 people in state prisons, which house 88 percent of the nation’s prison population, explained Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute. “If you remove drug prisoners from that population, the percentage of black prisoners drops to 37 percent—half of a percentage point, hardly a significant difference.”

It’s true that drug prosecutions have risen markedly over the past thirty years. Drug offenders were 6.4 percent of state prison inmates in 1979 but had jumped to 20 percent by 2004. “Even so,” wrote Mac Donald, “violent and property offenders continue to dominate the ranks: in 2004, 52 percent of state prisoners were serving time for violence and 21 percent for property crimes, for a combined total over three and a half times that of state drug offenders.” Drug-war critics like to focus on federal prisons, where drug offenders climbed from 25 percent of the inmate population in 1980 to 47.6 percent in 2006. “But the federal system held just 12.3 percent of the nation’s prisoners in 2006,” noted Mac Donald. “So much for the claim that blacks are disproportionately imprisoned because of the war on drugs.”

The black inmate population reflects black criminality, not a racist criminal justice system, which currently is being run by one black man (Attorney General Holder) who reports to another (the president). Black crime rates are vastly higher than white crime rates. And it’s hard to see how wishing away this reality, inventing con¬spiracy theories to explain it, or calling those who point it out “racist” will help improve the situation.

"Understanding Ferguson: Fort Apache, Missouri","Like most people who are getting into their 40s, I suffer occasional bouts of nostalgia. But lately, in a cruel irony, the world only seems interested in re-enacting the parts of my youth that I’d rather not relive. A Russian dictatorship that invades its neighbors. A stagnant economy with rising food and gas prices. A giant new welfare boondoggle. An overmatched president who seems too small for his office.

And now race riots.

The whole feel of it is captured by David “Iowahawk” Burge, who jokes about a man who wakes up from a coma after 45 years and asks the doctor about the latest news. The doctor replies: “Nixon is talking about the race riots.” The patient asks if he can be put back into the coma. That about sums it up.

I’ve described the whole Obama era as 20th Century Lite, “an era in which we will have to relive—hopefully in a shorter and shallower form—all of the disasters of the 20th century, as a cultural refresher course.” Because apparently we didn’t learn the lessons of the last century well enough the first time around.

I don’t think anyone can really understand the events in Ferguson without understanding this 20th Century Lite phenomenon, because the whole thing re-enacts in exact parallels all of the major elements of the mid-to-late-20th-century crime wave. It’s Fort Apache, The Bronx all over again.

That 1981 film, which has since lapsed into a probably deserved obscurity, captured the overall sense of how things had been going on the domestic front in the late 1970s, with the police hunkered down in their precincts struggling vainly to establish law and order among a hostile population.

Looking at the past weeks’ upheaval in Ferguson, Missouri, I see seven parallels to the bad old days of my youth.

1) The disconnect between the police and the people. In Fort Apache, the Bronx, based on the real-life 41st Precinct in the South Bronx, the problem was a police force that was virtually all non-Hispanic trying to patrol a Puerto Rican neighborhood. But the bigger racial divide of the era was between blacks and whites. In the decades prior to the 1970s, about a third of the blacks in the South moved (for understandable reasons) to Northern cities, but the composition of city governments and police forces lagged behind.

Megan McArdle explains how a similar thing has been happening recently in the suburbs, which is how Ferguson ended up with a white city council and mostly white police force that is resented by many among the town’s relatively recent black majority.

And it goes both ways. The police tend to feel as if the city they grew up in is being overrun by people they’re not accustomed to and don’t like. Which leads me to the second parallel.

2) The siege mentality of the police. In the face of rising crime, and with a lack of connection to the people they’re policing, the cops see themselves as the “thin blue line” separating decent people from anarchy. The over-militarization of the police, which many people have complained about after seeing photos of suburban cops in full battle rattle, is just a symptom. The underlying problem is that the police feel like occupiers trying to suppress a native insurgency. That’s why they called the 41st precinct “Fort Apache,” after an Arizona cavalry garrison that fought off Apache warriors in the Old West.

Breaking this siege mentality, by the way, was one of the lessons about how to break the late 20th-century crime wave. While aggressive policing methods, including some that have been denounced as intrusive (like “stop and frisk”), are part of the success in places like New York City, this was coupled with increased engagement with the community.

Law and order is an enormous value, and if you provide it to people, they will appreciate it. But law and order in a free society has to be based on earning the trust of the public.

3) Opportunistic politicians. That’s why we cringe when we see the usual race-baiters like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton descend on Ferguson. They’re there to inflame the situation and take advantage of the resentment of the locals to boost their own reputations and political power. And the most inflammatory thing they do is to promote the next big element of the 1960s mentality.

4) The whole system is out of order. No, Al Pacino never quite said that, but it has gone done in popular imagination as the summation of the prevailing attitude of the 1970s. Grievances like the shooting of Michael Brown are used not to reform the system but to delegitimize the system.

That’s the key to whole Ferguson fiasco, and it’s the biggest parallel to the 1960s and 70s. Police abuses, or alleged police abuses, are presented by the political left as an indictment of America as institutionally racist and hopelessly immoral. So what’s the point of waiting for a case to be heard in court, demanding reform of the local police, or waiting for the next municipal election to vote more responsive candidates into office? The whole system is out of order and needs to be torn down.

That’s what explains the riots in Ferguson. You don’t keep rioting because you want justice, certainly not when you’ve already brought the case to everyone’s attention and gained the nation’s sympathy. No, you riot because you feel that all authority has been knocked down, that the whole system is rotten and that there is nothing to stop you from smashing everything and taking whatever you want. Notice the way in which the rioters have threatened reporters, who are, after all, attempting to document them in the process of committing serious crimes. Only a kind of comprehensive delegitimizing of the system can produce this result.

That’s also why we’re getting a whiff of justice by revolutionary tribunal, in which the guilt of the officer who shot Michael Brown has already been determined.

In fact, as I predicted, most of the facts everyone supposedly knew within the first 24 hours of the shooting of Michael Brown have been significantly revised. For example, it turns out that Brown was not an angelic aspiring college student, but a criminal. And not a sympathetic petty criminal but a thug caught on tape earlier that day committing a strong-arm robbery against a convenience store clerk. (Those who call this “shoplifting” are ignorant of legal definitions. This was strong-arm robbery in the most literal sense, as you can see from the surveillance footage of Brown grabbing a guy half his size and shoving him around.) This is relevant because it lends some plausibility to the idea that Brown might have later initiated a conflict with a police officer. It also casts some doubt on the most inflammatory eye-witness account in this case, which was offered by the friend who was with Brown at the time, who apparently left out the part about how he and Big Mike had spent the afternoon mugging store clerks.

Yes, police officers sometimes lie. In Ferguson, as other reports indicate, they might lie more often then most. But criminals lie, too. So let’s just stipulate that everything everyone says in this case will need to be backed up thoroughly by independent witnesses and physical evidence.

On that grounds, it’s not looking good. There are reports (still disputed) that the officer who shot Brown was seriously injured in the altercation, and even some inadvertently captured eye-witness testimony that Brown may have advanced on the officer rather than being shot in the back, which is consistent with autopsy results showing all his wounds in the front.

No, none of this creates a presumption in favor of the officer, but it undermines the presumption in favor of Brown. There’s good reason to be skeptical of everyone, and we’re going to have to wait a good while longer before we can get a systematic and impartial accounting of all the relevant facts in court.

But the protesters and media have already convicted the officer by revolutionary tribunal and will never believe any other outcome. Why? Because the whole system is out of order.

5) Whataboutism. Every bad actor in the world—people who routinely jail reporters, beat protesters, shut down newspapers, behead people, and kill their own citizens by the trainload—every damn one of them starts to lecture us about how bad we are. To date, in ascending order of evil, we’ve heard an earful about Ferguson from the Russians and the military junta in Egypt, Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei, and the lovely gentlemen of ISIS.

Back in the Cold War, we had a term for this: “whataboutism.” Whenever anyone criticized the Soviets about the gulags, their mouthpieces would start a sentence with “What about…” and go on to talk about racism and poverty and whatever bad thing they could think of that was happening in the United States. They understood that when the left sets out to delegitimize our system, they always seem to end up legitimizing the world’s real bad guys.

6) A pro-cop backlash. I was struck by comments from The Federalist‘s Ben Domenech about how this case has divided conservatives and libertarians in their attitude toward the police.

Do you naturally tend to trust them, viewing them as a necessary and needed hedge acting in defense of law and order? Or are you naturally suspicious of them, believing them to be little more than armed tax collectors and bureaucrats with a tendency to violence and falsehood in service of their whims?

This is a bit of a false alternative. You can think that the police are a vital necessity while still thinking that they need to be carefully monitored and brought to justice if they overstep their bounds.

Yet this divide in attitudes is real. This is partly because libertarianism has always had an anarchist undertone. The modern libertarian movement emerged from that same late-20th-century era when the whole system was out of order and both the military and the police were viewed as bad guys. The early libertarians participated in the delegitimizing of the system, imagining that this would somehow bring about a stateless libertarian utopia.

No, I don’t think most young libertarians embrace this attitude or have thought it out thoroughly, and that’s why I think there’s a generational element to this. I’m just old enough to remember the tail end of the great crime wave of the 1970s, a spree of murder, robbery, rape, and general mayhem that wrecked America’s inner cities for decades. (Some of them have never recovered.) I remember the news being filled with sensational murders, random muggings, drive-by shootings, and the general sense that the criminals were taking over the streets. Take a look at this graph, which charts an eight-fold increase in total violent crime from 1960 to 1990. At the time, I can assure you that we had no idea crime rates would drop precipitously afterwards. We thought the line might just keep sloping upward.

People my age remember the stunning turnaround. We remember how Rudy Giuliani was reviled and denounced—including by the same people exploiting the Ferguson tragedy—even as he adopted policing tactics that turned New York City from a murder capital into one of the safest places in the nation.

So all of the new complaints about how we have too many people in jail and how police are too militarized “despite” the fall in crime rates are courting the Fox Butterfield Effect. They don’t recognize that one of the reasons for falling crime is precisely because we have put more bad guys in prison and given more resources to the police.

So that’s why those of us who still remember that era have a more positive view of the cops. They saved us from fear and chaos. And even a few black commentators have had the courage to mention this, because they, too, were saved from fear. When the cities went downhill, many whites fled to the safe streets of the suburbs, while blacks were stuck living in the inner city.

So when I hear young libertarians casually jump onto the anti-police bandwagon, I partly think that these whippersnappers grew up with safe streets—they’re maybe a decade younger than me, but the crime wave broke so sharply that those few years made a big difference—so they’re not as likely to appreciate the “thin blue line.” Whereas I’m from a previous generation that saw the rising tide of crime and fantasized about the kind of cops who would ask the punks if they felt lucky.

That said, I’ve also lived in Chicago, where the police are callous, officious, and opposed to individual self-defense—while pretty much failing to provide public safety. I also understand how the drug war has not only fueled crime in the big cities—a huge portion of the murders in places like Chicago are the product of warfare between rival gangs, just as in the first era of Prohibition—and it has also contributed to the militarization of the police, who up-armor themselves to fight against well-armed gangs.

But remembering the history of the great crime wave helps us guard against presuming the guilt of the police in a case like this one.

There’s one last, tragic parallel to the old crime wave era.

7) The self-destruction of Ferguson. What we can expect next for Ferguson is probably what we saw in the big cities in the wake of the crime wave. The white middle class—and some of the black middle class, too—speeds up its exodus, and businesses whose operations have been disrupted for weeks decide to pull out.

How much luck do you think the Ferguson Chamber of Commerce is going to have for the next ten years? Ferguson was already under-banked, with more check-cashing outfits and sketchy payday lenders than regular bank branches. How many people are going to be eager to open up new shops along West Florissant Avenue, the epicenter of the riots?

How soon are they going to rebuild the QuikTrip? The most poignant part of that story is the conscientious young man who decided to come to work that day, despite the air of menace in the town, because he “he loves his job”—and barely escaped with his life when the store was looted and burned. Will he have any job to return to? In the first go-around, in the 60s and 70s, the answer was frequently, “no.”

That’s the real crime of the rioters. In an attempt to force the authorities to meet their demands, they’re engaging in the self-immolation of their own community. Then again, there are always those who would rather rule in hell than be just another law-abiding sucker in heaven.

Michael Barone, who was there as a reporter the first time around, says this isn’t quite like the 60s—but mostly because it’s smaller. That’s what makes this 20th Century Lite. The first time around, Ferguson was practically every big Northern city. This time around, it’s one Midwestern suburb.

But this is a warning that we need to re-learn the lessons of the 20th century. The police need to be reformed to overcome the Fort Apache mentality—and the rest of us need to recognize the destructiveness of the left’s race-baiting and its attempts to delegitimize and tear down the whole system of law and order.

Ferguson Could Lead To Federal Takeovers Of Local Police,"In response to a white police officer shooting Michael Brown in Missouri, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has announced a broader civil rights probe into the Ferguson Police Department—an action that could lead to a federal takeover of the police.

While such probes might not lead to Department of Justice punishment for past local police conduct, it could pave the way for “systemic legal reform going forward,” according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

“It’s very serious,” Toobin said of the investigation, before it was formally announced, “because it can lead to a virtual federal takeover of the police, as happened recently in New Orleans.”

After Brown’s death, the DOJ descended on Ferguson similarly to its response to the Trayvon Martin shooting in Florida in 2012. Then, DOJ sent its Civil Rights public relations unit—the Community Relations Service (CRS)—to act as “peacemakers.”

But talking wasn’t all CRS did in Florida, and it’s not all in Missouri, either. According to Ferguson Mayor James Knowles, who spoke with the Daily Caller last month, CRS “protest marshals” helped train people demonstrating against police over the shooting.

These are the same people Holder called on after the Ferguson shooting to promote greater diversity in the police departments: “Justice Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community…Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.”

Diffusing, or Provoking, Hate Crimes?

The official mission of the CRS, which was created as part of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, “is to help local communities address community conflicts and tensions arising from disputes, disagreements, or difficulties over race, color, and national origin.”

It seems the Community Relations Service is more concerned with agitating than peacemaking.

Its powers were broadened in 2009 by President Obama when he signed into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The new law gave the CRS—a small, little-known unit in the DOJ—the power to “develop strategies and respond to violent hate crimes.” According to the DOJ’s website, “Through this law, we will strengthen the protections against crimes based on the color of your skin, the faith in your heart, or the place of your birth. We will finally add federal protections against crimes abased on gender, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation.”

This is the same unit Breitbart News caught participating in protests at the Republican National Convention in 2012, where “a CRS representative and a protester” were seen “to high-five each other.” According to Breitbart, CRS representatives were also “seen relaying specific instructions to the activists about the location of prearranged buses that were apparently taking them to their next scheduled demonstration.”

It seems CRS is more concerned with agitating than peacemaking—which contradicts their promise of remaining “neutral.” So, when they showed up in Ferguson, it wasn’t surprising that protests escalated and now Holder is launching more probes to weed out civil-rights violations in Ferguson. Since Holder failed to make the Brown shooting a civil-rights issue, he now needs to advance his agenda another way by broadening the issue to anecdotal complaints by citizens to the CRS about racial injustices.

We Can Fix You

According to Holder, the “conversations” the CRS and its “peacemakers” had with people in the community have revealed extensive racial injustices in the police department—especially its lack of diversity. This has given Holder the green light to open a probe.

‘People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices, and from the lack of diversity on Ferguson’s police force.’

“Over the course of that visit, I had the chance to speak with a number of local residents. I heard from them directly about the deep mistrust that has taken hold between law enforcement officials and members of the community. In meetings and listening sessions—as well as informal conversations—people consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices, and from the lack of diversity on Ferguson’s police force.”

“These anecdotal accounts underscored the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention. As a result of this history—and following an extensive review of documented allegations and other available data—we have determined that there is cause for the Justice Department to open an investigation to determine whether Ferguson Police officials have engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of the U.S. Constitution or federal law.”

“Our investigation will assess the police department’s use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches, and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson’s city jail, in addition to other potentially discriminatory policing techniques and tactics that are brought to light.”

Focus On Race More—Or Else

When Holder called on police departments to check their “diversity problem,” he wasn’t talking only to those in Missouri. Police departments across the nation have responded by taking a harder look at their diversity in wake of the shooting in Ferguson.

Since more than 50 percent of murders are committed by blacks, it’s not surprising that more of them die in police shootings.

In Charlotte, North Carolina, police statistics show the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) has become more diverse in recent years, but the department still doesn’t “reflect the racial makeup of Charlotte”: “Fifty percent of the people who live in Charlotte are white, according to the latest census data; 35 percent are black and 13.1 percent are Hispanic.” Such disparities are common across the country, but with Holder and the CRS breathing down their necks, police departments are sure to hire more minorities.

As the Charlotte police chief said: “We have to be deliberate in targeting minorities [in hiring]. Now our strategy is focusing on an obligation—what they can do to help their community. How do we get away from the stigma of, ‘I don’t want to associate with the police.’”

This diversity “obligation” seems to be rooted in the assumption that the greatest threat to blacks is white police officers. This, however, is not the case. The leading cause of death for African-American males is murder—and not by police, but by “other black men.” The raw numbers show more whites are killed by police officers than blacks, because there are more whites in the population (five to one). When you factor this in, the death rate for blacks due to “legal intervention” is more than three times higher than whites. But once again, you have to look at the broader picture, and since more than 50 percent of murders are committed by blacks, it’s not surprising that more of them die in police shootings.

According to Human Events, “In New York from January to June 2008, 83 percent of all gun assailants were black, according to witnesses and victims, though blacks were only 24 percent of the population. Blacks and Hispanics together accounted for 98 percent of all gun assailants. Forty-nine of every 50 muggings and murders in the Big Apple were the work of black or Hispanic criminals.” How many of these facts will be taken into consideration in Holder’s quest for diversity? Not much, it seems.

The problem, according to Holder, is lack of diversity, and the unit on the front lines to root out Civil Rights violations appears to be the CRS.

An Opening for Federal Takeover

If Toobin is right, and the DOJ investigations could be a pathway for the federal government to take over local police departments, then the role of the CRS and its “conversations” with local officials and activist groups is significant.

Why have the full power and force of the U.S. Department of Justice behind a community relations unit?

Imagine this scenario: Anytime there is a police shooting or any interaction between a white police officer and a non-white person, the CRS swoops in to agitate the situation. Protests ensue. Investigations are done, and police departments are examined to see if they are diverse enough. When they’re not, either the feds bring civil-rights lawsuits against them or step in to run the show because the local police department can’t be trusted to protect minorities. The result is a slow but effective takeover of local law enforcement by the federal government—all in the name of diversity and civil rights, propelled by the involvement of a seemingly benign organization—the CRS—that is supposed to be a neutral “peacemaker.”

Those who say a group like CRS is necessary to help ease racial tensions need to explain why this must occur at the federal level. Why have the full power and force of the U.S. Department of Justice behind a community relations unit? Why threaten a takeover of local law enforcement by the federal government—something that is a greater threat to our liberties in the long run than too many white people in police departments?

Local community race relations groups are already in place doing this job. The Community Relations Committee in Mecklenburg County, for example, is a human relations agency of the city and county—not the federal government. They mirror the mission of the CRS at the local level. Why then, does this federal agency, the CRS, need to do what locals are already doing?

It’s an Excuse for a Power Grab

The answer lies in the design and goals of the Obama administration and Holder’s DOJ, which seem to have little regard for local governments or checks and balances, and are continuing to push the boundaries of federal authority, using racial relations, diversity, and civil rights issues as the excuse.

The Founders understood that consolidation, or bringing all powers into one fold, would inevitably lead to corruption.

Why is this a problem? Why shouldn’t the federal government take control of all local police departments? Because centralized power threatens liberty. As Thomas Jefferson said, “When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.”

The Founders purposely wrote into the Constitution a system of checks and balances in which there would be the federal government with limited powers, and state and local governments with indefinite powers. Local police are part of local governments and play an integral role in the dispersion of power. Imagine if the national government, not local municipalities, controlled all police forces throughout the country. What if all we had was a national police force? Who would stand against the totalitarian state, who would defend the cities and the individual against a consolidated, arbitrary power?

State and local governments are supposed to have sovereignty. Integral to that is a police force accountable to that local community. If the federal government takes over local police departments, local governments lose an integral part of their sovereignty, which puts individuals—who are protected by the dispersion of force—at risk.

We need to heed Jefferson’s warnings. He passionately opposed consolidation of force, because the “greatest calamity” that Americans can face is “submission to a government of unlimited powers.” The Founders understood that consolidation, or bringing all powers into one fold, would inevitably lead to corruption. They understood what we need to remember—that absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Is Kirsten Gillibrand A Racist?,"Is New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand a racist? In a recent interview with Huffington Post, she said, “All of the fans, young boys and girls watching this, are watching the NFL say it’s okay to beat your wife. It’s unacceptable…. It’s not just about Roger Goodell and this one player. There are hundreds of players who are beating their wives, committing assault, committing rape across all sports, and we have to hold them all accountable.”

Really? Hundreds? How does she know this? She makes it sound as if wife-beating and violence are epidemic in the National Football League. But is this really true?

No, according to studies on the rate of criminality in the NFL, the league does not have a “violence against women problem,” or, as the article at RedState says, “At least not one that is worse than the public in general:

As Jim Picht of Communities Digital News shows us, the incidence of domestic violence by NFL players is actually around half that of the same age group in the general United States population. He cites two different studies that show similar results…one done in 1999 by Alfred Blumstein & Jeff Benedict, and another published back in July by Benjamin Morris at fivethirtyeight.com.

Pitch writes:

Blumstein and Benedict found that of the 342 black players in their sample, 97 of them, or 28 percent, had an arrest for one of these crimes. There were 77 whites in the sample; seven of them, or 9 percent, had an arrest.



Those numbers appear high until we compare them with arrest numbers for the general population. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports provided the arrest data. For the general population, the arrest rate for assault for black men was 6,990 per 100,000, and for whites, 2,209.



The corresponding rate for NFL players, black and white, was less than half the rate for the general population.



More recently, USA Today published its USA Today NFL Arrests Database, which goes from 2000, just after the Blumstein-Benedict study, to today. Benjamin Morris at FiveThirtyEight’s DataLab used these data with the Bureau of Crime Statistics’ Arrest Data Analysis Tool to compare arrest rates for NFL players and the general population.



Morris looked only at the 25-30 age group, which most closely reflects the age of NFL players. What he found was that, again, NFL players have arrest rates far below the general population. Their arrest rates for domestic violence are half the rate of the general public, just as Blumstein and Benedict found. In addition, Morris found that NFL arrest rates for DUI were about one-fourth the general rate; for non-domestic assault, about one-sixth; for sex offenses, about one-half; and for non-violent gun-related offenses, about one-half.



Overall, arrest rates in the NFL are only 13 percent those for the general public among men aged 25 to 30.

If the facts don’t back up what feminists like Gillibrand are saying, why do they assume that “hundreds of players are beating women and committing assault”? Could it have anything to do with the fact that 67 percent of NFL players are black? Are they drawing that conclusion based on the fact that black youths, who make up 16 percent of the youth population, account for 52 percent of juvenile violent crime arrests? Or that in a city like New York, 83 percent of all gun assailants are black even though they make up only 24 percent of the population?

Is Gillibrand assuming that because a majority of NFL players are black they must be criminals?

Just asking.

While there are men who commit crimes in the NFL, the league is not a cauldron of misogynist violence. In fact, the NFL does a lot of good. Just look at players, such as Matt Overton of the Indianapolis Colts, who has helped kids with cancer.

Or Carolina Panthers player Greg Olsen, who turned a personal trial into public charity. In 2012, one of his twins was diagnosed with a serious heart defect. The Panthers’s owner, Jerry Richardson, helped the Olsen family every step of the way, providing his private plane and traveling with them to Boston to make sure the family received the best medical care after the diagnosis. Olsen’s son survived, and they named him Trent Jerry after Richardson.

Now, Olsen and his wife added a new arm to a previous foundation (Receptions for Research) they had started in honor of Olsen’s mom, who survived breast cancer. Its HEARTest Yard provides resources for families with single-ventricle babies.

“This is our platform,” Olsen’s wife said. “This is our way to help these families and help these babies.”

The NFL itself has given hundreds of millions of dollars to charities—something you don’t hear feminists talking about as they malign a league that has given more than 3 million individuals opportunities they wouldn’t have had without the NFL’s generosity and support.

While I don’t think Gillibrand and other feminists are intentionally being racist or sexist or football-phobic with such rhetoric, they need to tone it down and put league violence in perspective. No one supports wife beating or child abuse. Men who commit such crimes need to be held to account—and they will be. But these players need to be judged in a court of law and not in the court of public opinion—especially when that opinion is prejudiced, out of balance, and based on statistical errors.

When Political Correctness Endangers Women,"It’s getting exasperating how much the political correctness police have permeated our culture. It’s impossible to outline all of the normal human behaviors, such as assigning a newborn a gender, that people warn everyone against doing now—including calling anything “normal!” While this can be frustrating, few would describe the phenomenon as dangerous. Yet while reading a crime report in Gothamist, a local (and left-leaning) blog covering topics in New York City, my frustration with our increasing politically correct culture turned to fear.

When a crime occurs that meets a particular level of violence, or if it appears to be a part of a pattern, the New York Police Department (NYPD) will sometimes issue alerts to the public for information. These alerts generally come with a description of the crime, victim, time, and location. The role of the media in cases like these is to disseminate the information. Gothamist, however, seems to edit the suspect description in one serious and misguided manner: they omit the race of the perpetrator, a major identifying characteristic. A survey of their most recent reporting on local crime, compared to that of other New York news outlets, highlights what seems to be an editorial decision on the part of Gothamist (which didn’t respond to a request for comment) to avoid reporting on a crime suspect’s race. Compare the descriptions of suspects here versus here; here versus here; and here versus here.

A Nondescript Description

The first story that tipped me off to this editorial policy came after the victim of a brutal sexual assault on the wealthy Upper West Side came forward in an attempt to identify her attacker. She told reporters (emphasis mine): “I know exactly how he looked. I know exactly. He made the mistake of leaving his hat in my apartment…. I’m not afraid and I’m still not going to be afraid and this man is not going to make me afraid.”

This is how Gothamist described the rapist: “The suspect is described as a man standing around 6 foot 2, around 35 to 40 years of age.” From this incredibly vague description we would gather that he could be Derek Jeter, Bradley Cooper, or Jay-Z.

The suspect isn’t described solely in that manner by police or other press coverage of the crime. The New York Daily News, another liberal publication, mercifully described him in full as such: “Police described the suspect as black, about 6-feet-2 and 35- to 40-years-old. He was last seen wearing a white and brown striped shirt.” This expanded information, coupled with the time and location of the crime, could actually make an individual pause to wonder if someone they knew who fit this description in the area at the time could be the perpetrator.

The Gothamist report was published the day after the Daily News report of the same crime. Information regarding the suspect’s race was available at publication time, yet Gothamist refused to give readers an accurate description of a man who forced himself into a woman’s apartment before forcing himself on her sexually, hindering the NYPD’s efforts to apprehend him.

Justice Demands Honesty

We’ve been hearing a great deal about the “rape epidemic” and “rape culture” recently. We’re told one in four women on college campuses is sexually assaulted over the course of her attendance. Kevin Williamson of National Review took the explosion in coverage of this so-called epidemic to task recently, highlighting how sexual assault has actually statistically been on a downward trajectory. The “rape epidemic” hysteria, perpetuated by the Left, always needs to create new victims for its fabricated and ever-expanding war on women.

If justice for the victims of sexually-based offenses was the true objective of Progressives, taking on the mantle of catching this woman’s rapist would be of utmost importance. One would think, then, that a website with as wide a reach as Gothamist, and one whose editors strive to toe the Progressive party line, would bend over backwards to help catch a rapist. One hopes that anyone with a sense of obligation to the greater good of society—a mantle Progressives theatrically and sanctimoniously bestow upon themselves—would understand that, sometimes, life isn’t politically correct, and our desire to strive for a more perfect society should not stop us from bringing justice to victims of violence, for their sake and for the sake of future victims.

In a wonderful brief essay in Time magazine on the nature and recognition of evil, Camille Paglia writes, “The horrors and atrocities of history have been edited out of primary and secondary education except where they can be blamed on racism, sexism, and imperialism — toxins embedded in oppressive outside structures that must be smashed and remade. But the real problem resides in human nature, which religion as well as great art sees as eternally torn by a war between the forces of darkness and light.”

Evil exists, which is unfortunate, but a reality nonetheless. And to acknowledge as much doesn’t blame either the victim or society at large. When women are harmed, it is not because a “rape culture” is embedded in our society. It’s because of the existence of evil. Denying the existence of evil does not erase it, just as denying the race of those responsible does not erase racism. It only serves to protect evil, allowing it to strike again. And that denial sets a frightening and dangerous precedent for any reporting, especially that of violent crime.

"California Just Banned Arrest For Gun Theft, Date Rape Drug Possession","If you want to steal guns or sell date rape drugs and suffer no real consequences, move to California.

Proposition 47, a ballot initiative that California owners just supported with over 58 percent of the vote, requires misdemeanor instead of felony sentences for a number of so-called “non-serious” crimes. And that includes gun theft and possession of date rape drugs. Seriously. That’s not my personal opinion. It’s the official opinion of California state officials. Here’s what the state-sanctioned voter guide said about the “cons” of the ballot initiative:

Potentially releases 10,000 felons from state prison. Reduces penalties for stealing guns. Reduces penalties for possession of “date rape” drugs. Opposed by prosecutors, law enforcement, and the business community. Opposed by crime victims and sexual abuse victims. Vote NO on Proposition 47.

Are you freaking kidding me? I get the need for smarter sentencing laws and all that, but at what point did firearm theft and possession of date rape drugs become non-serious offenses? But it gets worse. It’s not just that gun theft is no longer a felony. The new law required by Proposition 47 now bans arrests for gun theft. Instead of arresting those suspected of stealing guns, police are required to write them a ticket and ask for them to appear in court.

If that sounds like what you would expect from a traffic ticket, it’s because it is. California just forced its law enforcement community to issue tickets for gun theft and date rape drug possession.

Here’s what the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department wrote about the new law on its Facebook page late last night:

1. In most instances, many crimes that were previously “arrestable” as a felony will now only be “citable” as a misdemeanor. That means they may not be booked into jail but rather given a citation (similar to a traffic ticket) with a court date to appear, and released in the field. They will not be held pending trial. Such felony crimes that are now misdemeanors include:

• Commercial burglary (theft under $950)

• Forgery and bad checks (under $950 value)

• Theft of most firearms

• Theft of a vehicle (under $950 value)

• Possession of stolen property (under $950 value)

• Possession of heroin, cocaine, illegal prescriptions, concentrated cannabis, and methamphetamine

This kind of nonsense is exactly what gun rights and self-defense advocates are talking about when they say we need to enforce existing gun laws instead of passing new ones to make life harder for law-abiding citizens who just want to defend themselves and their families.

If gun violence is a real problem (and it obviously is), why did California voters just make it easier for criminals to illegally obtain guns that they can use to perpetrate violence? Out of one side of their mouth, they lecture gun owners on why they’re not responsible enough to own guns, and out of the other side, they support new laws that turn serious gun crimes into non-arrestable misdemeanors.

BUT THAT’S NOT ALL. Seriously, it gets worse. The new California law also reduced penalties for possession of date rape drugs. Instead of being a felony, possessing date rape drugs is now a petty misdemeanor. Here’s what the L.A. Times wrote about that provision:

Opponents point out, though, that in reducing simple possession of most controlled substances from felonies or wobblers to misdemeanors, Proposition 47 covers roofies. Currently, a person caught with Rohypnol in his pocket can be prosecuted for a felony and end up in state prison for three years. If the initiative passes, he would be liable only for a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. But, as a practical matter, he may do no jail time at all. It would be merely a “slap on the wrist,” according to the ballot pamphlet rebuttal arguments signed by, among others, Sandra Henriquez, executive director of California Coalition Against Sexual Assault.

In one fell swoop, California voters just made it a whole lot easier for criminals to commit gun crimes and perpetrate date rape.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/11/06/california-just-banned-arrests-for-gun-theft-date-rape-drug-possession/,2014-11-06
Dear Media: This Elizabeth Lauten Nonsense Is Why Everybody Hates You,"Last week, President Barack Obama pardoned a turkey prior to Thanksgiving Day, as is tradition. And as in previous years, his teenage daughters Malia and Sasha stood by his side. The daughters are cute as can be — and Malia is growing into an absolutely beautiful young woman.

They are, however, teenagers. And they were, I guess, engaged in some mild teenage behavior — eye-rolling and smirking and what not. I watched a video of the event and didn’t really notice anything worth commenting on (apart from the interesting annual practice of Obama signing the cross over the turkey). But one minor Capitol Hill staffer thought the girls were dressed inappropriately and acted a bit churlish. And then, for some reason, she wrote about it on Facebook.

At which point some people lost their everliving minds. Her comments were posted on Twitter where the social media mob fed their hankering for constant outrage. There were petitions calling for her to be punished. And worst of all the media wrote and broadcast story after story after story about the matter. Elizabeth Lauten lost her job for saying mean things about President Obama’s children.

Now, Lauten is in communications and her job presumably included an assumption that she wouldn’t embarrass her boss. Besides, in a city where you can keep your job even if you’re involved in serious scandals at the IRS, State Department, Veterans Affairs or the Department of Justice, an actual job loss is refreshing, in its own way. She even gave a full-throated apology — within hours of the initial post — for being mean, not one of these “I’m sorry if” constructions that politicians frequently use.

Still, what in the world was the media doing reporting on this non-story and firing up the mob? The Washington Free Beacon reported that “major media outlets are pouring resources into tracking her moves and digging into her past.” This included two network news vans camping outside of her parents’ home in North Carolina and a search of Lauten’s leaked juvenile records and college writings.

This is insanity and each and every person involved should be ashamed of himself or herself. If you were involved, you are a big part of what’s wrong with journalism and you need to check yourself.

Explain yourself, Washington Post

A few years ago, I had this exchange with a Washington Post reporter:

@MZHemingway Hi Molly – I cover policy for the Washington Post, not local crime, hence why I wrote about all the policy issues you mention.



Sarah Kliff (@sarahkliff) April 11, 2013

Yes, I was told that the reason why the Washington Post was studiously avoiding any discussion of serial murderer and abortionist Kermit Gosnell was because it was a local crime story. The Washington Post previously avoided or subsequently went on to avoid covering the trial of George Zimmerman, the Grand Jury’s look at Darren Wilson and various other local crime stories. Just kidding. They gave those stories wall-to-wall coverage, as you might expect.

Anyway, the Washington Post ran a somewhat laughable explanation of why the paper failed to cover the story, an explanation I dissected here. A snippet from the Post’s story:

Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, offers a more mundane rationale for the newspaper’s lack of coverage: He wasn’t aware of the story until Thursday night, when readers began e-mailing him about it. “I wish I could be conscious of all stories everywhere, but I can’t be,” he said. “Nor can any of us.” …



Added Baron, “We never decide what to cover for ideological reasons, no matter what critics might claim. Accusations of ideological motives are easy to make, even if they’re not supported by the facts.”

OK, sure, sure. Yes, the Gosnell story was for years one of the biggest stories in the country for millions of Americans who are pro-life, but let’s just assume that “being even vaguely aware of major stories that are interesting and important” isn’t something we should judge executive editors on. Yes, it had angles dealing with late-term abortion, partial-birth abortion, infanticide, pharmaceutical rationing, exploitation of immigrants, racism, and abortion clinic regulations, but let’s just agree that the Washington Post’s struggle to see if any of those things were worth really exploring had nothing whatsoever to do with ideological reasons. Sure.

Now let’s turn back to the Lauten story and see if the Washington Post heard about it or covered it at all.

Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. So for those counting at home, this list includes not one, not two, but three (!) Associated Press reports and another eight articles or posts on the matter by Washington Posties. In four days. And I saved the best one for last.

See, somehow — and I don’t know if this was a reporter idea or an editor idea or just a complete breakdown of journalistic prudence on all sides — but somehow the Washington Post took a “foreign affairs” reporter and put him on the investigation of Lauten.

And that’s a real thing that happened.

Terrence McCoy wrote “One too many opinions from Hill staffer Elizabeth Lauten, who attacked Obama’s daughters and resigned,” a thorough digging up of dirt from her high school and college years. She had opinions on Darfur and Saddam Hussein, y’all.

Yes, the Washington Post had a reporter dig up dirt on a low-level former staffer who dared to criticize the presidential family. Is this real life?

I’d like someone to go ahead and circle back with Baron and have him explain himself. In what world — in what mother-freaking world — does he justify taking a foreign affairs reporter and having him dig up dirt on a low-level former staffer who said nothing worse about presidential children than the Post’s own columnists did in the Bush era? One of the items linked above is a Ruth Marcus column where she bashes this low-level staffer for critiquing the daughters, then notes she herself did it to the Bush girls –including attacking them for showing so much “cleavage”, being churlish, and their speaking style — but that it was OK because she did it under the guise of parody and they had notable busts. I’m not joking. You can read it for yourself. As John Podhoretz said, “Ruth Marcus’s double standard FOR HERSELF is absolutely astonishing.”

Is rape good or bad? I forget.

It’s not just the Washington Post. The Lauten story has been all over other print and broadcast media.

So we know that the national media is deeply concerned about stray insults directed toward the Obama family from Congressional staffers. Is raping people worse than that? Or not? I’m confused. Because a few years ago Congressional staffer Donny Ray Williams, Jr., was indicted for a series of alleged sexual assaults and it got only one “local crime” story in the Washington Post. Yesterday he pled guilty and that also generated one story in the Washington Post. If there’s network coverage of this congressional staffer raping people, I’m not seeing it. Did I mention he was a staff director for Democrats on a Senate panel?

Or what about child rape? We’re still opposed to that, right? I only ask because Terry Bean, a major campaign donor to President Obama — and a co-founder of the Human Rights Campaign — was just charged with sexual assault of a minor. And the Washington Post hasn’t covered it, according to a search of their archives. I mean, there are pictures of him on Air Force One and he was at the White House seven times including for a state dinner. He’s a member of the DNC. I know, I know, he’s certainly not as important as Lauten, but maybe a single story would be in order? Maybe that Terrence McCoy reporter could dig around and see if Bean wrote anything interesting in high school or something?

When do insults matter?

I already noted Ruth Marcus’ stunning hypocrisy regarding treatment of presidential children. On Twitter, S.M. noted that Salon’s Joan Walsh had her own troubles with consistency on whether it’s OK or not OK to go after presidential children. And this is not the first time Walsh has been called out for her double standards on the topic.

Let’s also note another example. When the painfully unfunny David Letterman made a “joke” about Willow Palin getting impregnated by Alex Rodriguez, the New York Times’ “ethicist” Randy Cohen wrote an 1,100-word qualified defense.

See, he explained, it’s OK because Letterman meant to suggest Bristol Palin was a slut, not Willow Palin, the 14-year-old. According to Cohen, David Letterman “should not be fired. He should not even have apologized.” Bristol was fair game even at the age of 17, he said, because she chose to participate in the presidential campaign. Cohen said that Letterman is “an honest guy,” “ethical,” and “determined to do the right thing” (NB: this was written a few months before news broke that Letterman’s multiple affairs caused him to get caught up in a $2 million extortion plot). Further, Bristol was “a legitimate subject” if “a slightly pathetic one.” He conceded the “joke” was a “bit bullying.” Cohen said that Willow and Bristol’s parents were faking umbrage or were unable “to get the joke.”

Only recently, you might remember, a CNN host telling viewers to “sit back and enjoy” listening to woman traumatized by assault, saying it’s “best audio in years.” That woman? Bristol Palin, of course.

It’s almost like you can detect a pattern for whose children can be criticized and whose children can’t be.

How is this news?

But it’s not just about presidential children. Insults in general are covered without any reasonable standard.

Remember when Vice President Joe Biden told a black audience that Mitt Romney was “going to put y’all back in chains”? Do you remember him having to resign? I don’t either. Maybe he’s not as important as a low-level Congressional aide and maybe his comments weren’t as incendiary as Lauten’s critique of fashion and attitudes. Matt Latimer presciently predicted at the time, “Whatever his motivations, he’ll emerge from this brouhaha unscathed. Because he is a Democrat.”



It’s not just Biden. You have your Charlie Rangels and your Al Sharptons routinely saying that Republicans want to enslave people. It barely causes a blip.

Why is it a bigger story for a House press secretary to critique fashion than for elected officials to accuse the other side of hating people to the point of wanting to own them? Could someone unpack the news sense on this one?

What We Don’t Talk About When We Talk About Low-Level Staffers

What’s perhaps most surprising in the media coverage isn’t that the New York Times covered the story or that the Washington Post put one of its eleventy billion stories on the matter on the front page. It’s that even the broadcast networks with extremely limited time constraints covered it.

And they covered it immediately. The Free Beacon reports that networks news combined to give nearly four and a half minutes of coverage on Monday night. These same outlets either dramatically delayed or completely failed to cover Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber saying the healthcare law was passed in 2010 thanks to a “lack of transparency” and the “stupidity of American voters.”

NBC aired a segment on Lauten that lasted more than two minutes and featured White House correspondent Kristen Welker giving a detailed breakdown of the story. Welker interviewed Ruth Marcus — yes, the same woman who made jokes about the cleavage of the Bush daughters — for the piece.

Why all this coverage of someone who made rude comments to presidential daughters? I will take the opportunity to quote Jonah Goldberg’s scathing indictment:

The reason Gruber has been so outrageously under-covered by the mainstream media is obvious: The whole story is an indictment of the entire ecosystem of establishment liberalism, from the supposedly “explanatory journalists” who picked sides from the beginning, to the academic elites who serve as willing mercenaries for the Democratic party (while pretending to be unimpeachably objective followers of the facts) to the press corps that carries water for the whole enterprise. Grüberdammerung runs against the narrative that only lovers of limited government are driven by self-interest and greed. It gives the average person a glimpse into how the sausage is made and embarrasses the sausage makers.

Or maybe there’s a case to be made that Lauten saying something that nobody should have called attention to is more important than Gruber’s “web of lies” funchats (caught on video not by Terrence McCoy or anyone else at the Washington Post, but, by a random dude). Wait, wait, I have a story idea: maybe Jonathan Gruber said something about Darfur in high school? Who can we get to check that out?

Burn it down

There are many wonderful reporters. They work hard to get the story right and provide a valuable service to their readers and viewers. But we have a serious problem — and it’s a problem at the editor level at least as much as it’s a problem at the reporter level.

Republican media operative Rick Wilson went on a beautiful rant last night about this embarrassing Lauten debacle. You can read the whole thing here. This is edited down but he wrote, “Reporters and media folks wondering, ‘Why don’t people trust us?’… The last couple weeks should be clarifying for you… But the endless, agenda-driven games are repellent to readers/viewers. Your sins are of omission and commission both… You used to be able to claim news judgement and ignore stories you hated. You still do, but now people see it, and you loathe it… So you’ll do one piece on Gruber, then pretend you dug in hard. But god forbid a staffer dings the Obama kids. Then you flood the zone… You pick and choose when to provide context… I love pros in the business. Love them. And most of you ARE pros. Most of you DO work stories, look for interesting angles… But you tolerate (and your editors tolerate) a lot of outrageous, absurdly bad practices. Gruber? Unforgivable… the frustration Americans feel about media isn’t getting any less acute, and some introspection might go a long way…”

Indeed it would. There are some tenacious and wonderful reporters. But the overall picture in many newsrooms is getting worse. Under no circumstances should scarce newsroom resources be diverted from real stories onto fake ones that have already been covered more than a Beatles hit.

There is a huge liberal bias problem in the media (fun recent graph related to the problem here). Pretending it’s not there is not going to make it go away. But pointing out the problems year after year isn’t making things better. Some of the media behavior post-election seems more like a toddler temper tantrum than a dispassionate news judgment.

Maybe Baron and his peers can attempt to defend what they did with this story. I would love to hear what they have to say. But if they wonder why journalists continue to be among the least trusted professions, a bit of introspection is in order.

Surprise! Yet Another Poll Shows Widespread Popularity Of Gun Rights,"A new poll released today by the Pew Research Center confirms similar findings from other recent polls that the popularity of gun rights is on the rise.

Since December 2012, when Pew last released a major poll on gun rights, the percentage of those who believe that guns help to prevent people from becoming crime victims has shot up significantly. And for the first time in over 20 years, a majority of those polled by Pew, 52 percent, say it’s more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns than it is to control gun ownership:

In the new Pew poll, 57 percent of adult respondents said guns “protect people from becoming crime victims,” compared to only 38 percent who said guns “put people’s safety at risk.” In 2012, the pro-gun spread between those two responses was 11 percentage points vs. a 21-point pro-gun gap in the latest numbers. And it turns out that a belief in the fundamental right to self-defense now spans partisan, gender, and racial divides.

A majority of independents (62), women (51 percent), and blacks (54 percent) told Pew that guns do more to protect innocent people than they do to endanger others’ safety. In the December 2012 poll, only 29 percent of blacks polled said guns did more to protect people from crime. The numbers have swung from a -24-point gap to a +13-point pro-gun gap, a net swing of 37 percentage points:

Here’s how Pew characterized the results:

Over the past two years, blacks’ views on this measure have changed dramatically. Currently, 54% of blacks say gun ownership does more to protect people than endanger personal safety, nearly double the percentage saying this in December 2012 (29%). By contrast, whites’ views have shown less change: 62% now view guns as doing more to protect people, up from 54% in December.

Significant upticks in support for gun rights were also registered in nearly ever age group, with a big jump in support coming from 18- to 29-year-olds:

Liberal Democrats are the only partisan/ideological group polled by Pew to register a drop in support for the statement that guns can help protect people from crime. The percentage of liberals polled who agreed with that statement fell from 15 percent to 14 percent.

"Ignore Rolling Stone’s Dangerous, Naive Ideas About ‘A Cop-Free World’","Few individuals outside of the music editorial realm consider Rolling Stone a reliable source of journalistic content. In recent years the publication’s rank amateurism has been made patently evident in its coverage of the nation’s criminal justice system. Whether a quixotic exercise in the apologetics of a butcher or whole-cloth fabrication of a serious crime, the magazine has managed to persistently reestablish “rock bottom.”

There was little surprise, then, when a piece entitled “Policing is a Dirty Job, But Nobody’s Gotta Do It: 6 Ideas for a Cop-Free World” appeared in mid-December. Author José Martín, the writer who brought you an impassioned defense of arson and destruction, suggests six policies and programs that would eliminate the need for law officers.

Superficially, a few of these suggestions have merit. Some are even empirically supported and actively advocated by conservative reform efforts. However, it takes little more than a cursory glance to see that Martín’s advocacy for these reforms is based more on their view through a filter—one established by clinging to a pre-established narrative—than upon any critical reading.

Unarmed Mediation and Intervention Teams

The first suggestion Martín offers is to employ boots-on-the-ground mediators, much like those used in New York or Detroit: “Unarmed but trained people, often formerly violent offenders themselves, patrolling their neighborhoods to curb violence right where it starts.” This means employing and training scores of well-respected individuals from high-crime neighborhoods and, in the event of an incident, deploy them to “cool down” the situation to prevent retaliation.

Simple streetworker programs have not been shown to reduce crime.

This is, at best, a naïve reading of the genesis and efficacy of streetworker programs. Simple streetworker programs have not been shown to reduce crime. In fact, an evaluation of the SNUG program in New York—the very one Martín touts—found that crime was wholly reduced in only of the five program sites; the one with the second-worst adherence to the program’s model. To say this outperforms simple random variation is an indefensibly charitable analysis.

Perhaps the grand irony of this suggestion is that the only instances where the streetworker strategy has been part of a notable drop in crime is when they are a tertiary approach to a focused deterrence policing initiative like CeaseFire or CIRV. These programs focus the resources and efforts of law enforcement on serious offenders and have been shown to improve public safety when used in very high-crime areas. Streetworker strategies “work” because of, not in lieu of, the police.

Decriminalizing Almost Every Crime

“There is no real conversation about what constitutes a crime and what permits society to put a person in chains and a cage.” This idea has some merit. While Martín belies his credibility on the issue by saying this is discussed “only in critical criminology seminars,” many groups from across the ideological spectrum are coming together to oppose the over-criminalization.

Ohio has recently adopted a default mens rea provision, mandating that outside of strict liability offenses, legislators must establish the degree of mental culpability that one must possess before being found guilty of new crime. Even the U.S. Supreme Court has shown a modicum of disdain toward over-criminalization, as evidenced in the oral arguments in Yates v. United States. However, simply because there are too many laws or they currently do not function as intended does not mean that law per se is no longer in full use.

It should be noted that an anti-overcriminalization agenda would weaken the coercive efficacy of the state—the very entity of which Martín and his ilk are so fond.

Restorative Justice

“From hippie communes to the IRA and anti-Apartheid South African guerrillas to even some U.S. cities like Philadelphia’s experiment with community courts, spaces are created where accountability is understood as a community issue.” Again, a topic area capable of bearing fruit, if it were not for its billing as a community-based panacea.

Imagine: a rape victim being forced to confront her assailant and hear, in vivid detail, why he chose to force himself upon her.

Restorative justice programs can be effective in reducing recidivism in certain types of offences for certain types of offenders, but cannot be seen as an exhaustive approach to justice. Selection bias, ignoring risk, and selective application of due process make it a terrible primary model of reaching the most just outcome, but make it an effective tool for handling a small subset of cases.

Where Martín misses the mark is that participation in restorative justice programming must be voluntary for all parties. Coercing a victim or offender into mediation is far more harmful than any formal proceedings. Imagine: a rape victim being forced to confront her assailant and hear, in vivid detail, why he chose to force himself upon her. Conversely, imagine a wrongfully-accused individual being forced to answer for a crime he or she did not commit, in which no evidence exists outside of a made-up story and a vociferous mob. And what is to be done when one of the parties fails to abide by the mediated agreement?

Perhaps it is of little surprise that Rolling Stone would support a wholesale adoption of this type of inquisitorial system.

Direct Democracy at the Community Level

Martín suggests that political engagement will reduce crime as marginalized parties would now have “a sense of purpose”: “A more healthy political culture where people feel more involved is a powerful building block to a less violent world.” If the relationship between crime and political self-efficacy were so, would not the crime rate have been on a persistent decline since African-Americans were given their due right to vote? Would white-collar crime exist?

Decades of research into the risk factors of criminal behavior have shown that antisocial personality traits, beliefs, and associates make up most of an individual’s propensity to offend.

Sadly, neither are so because political engagement is not what drives individual criminal offending. Decades of research into the risk factors of criminal behavior have shown that antisocial personality traits, beliefs, and associates make up most of an individual’s propensity to offend while loosely-specified grand sociological constructs make up very little.

Political integration is a good thing on the whole. Just do not think that it will at all directly influence the crime rate.

Mental Health Care

“We have created a tremendous amount of mental illness, and in the real debt and austerity dystopia we’re living in, we have refused to treat each other for our physical and mental wounds.” Few disagree that we have a mental health-care problem in the United States. Few also disagree that noncriminal, seriously affected individuals in crisis often end up in the hands of the criminal justice system.

A recent study estimated that no more than 17 percent of mentally ill offenders are incarcerated due to actions that closely follow the symptoms of their diagnosis.

However, a myopic conclusion to reach from these facts, as many activists often do, is that mental health routinely triggers criminal behavior. Ergo, once mental health is no longer a concern, crime rates will drop precipitously. While this would hold true for a minute segment of the criminal population with severe mental health issues, it would not eliminate crime and thereby obviate the need for police officers. A recent study estimated that no more than 17 percent of mentally ill offenders are incarcerated due to actions that closely follow the symptoms of their diagnosis. It is the most pernicious of fallacies to think that one is criminal simply because of his mental illness.

This type of fanciful thinking with only the most rudimentary of analyses shows why the Left has abdicated so much of its credibility in discussing criminal justice reform. Not once in the article’s 900-plus words did the words “public safety” appear. Activists of this persuasion see no problem with an individual who assaults an elderly person, sexually abuses children, or murders in cold blood. Alas, it the system that pushes people act as they do. Even when pressed, the best one could expect from the social-justice community is a begrudging acceptance of Durkheimian anomie and strain theory.

What Happens When Communities Don’t Work?

Heavy in bombast and rhetoric and short on justification, Martín’s suggested reforms have a façade of legitimacy built up around little substance. His article can be easily boiled down to “how to live without police: everybody cooperate to enforce social norms.” As simple and placating as that may be, the author fails to explore what happens in instances where communities, or even large swaths of one community, are at odds in normative values or how to address violations thereof. It is a system that allows—no, mandates—vendetta, vigilantism, and (actual) capricious use of force. These are not hallmarks of an evolved society, but a descent into barbarism.

Conservatives, on the other hand, are burdened with the precarious task of ensuring justice to all parties and protecting the public safety, all while doing so at reasonable costs. Groups like Right on Crime are leading the way in the states, showing legislators there are policy options that can save money, lower crime, and even get rid of costly, unused prison space. The policies Right on Crime and similar groups advocate are evidence-based and oriented towards principle. To seriously advocate that the police are no longer necessary because alternatives exist is an unsophisticated argument, indeed.

Vox Sets Out To Prove All Religions Are Equally Violent. And Fails,"“This study obliterates the myth that Muslims are more violent” says a trolly headline over at Vox, where Zack Beauchamp combines a strawman and an absurd study to tell us absolutely nothing about Islam.

He begins:

Whenever the subject of Islamist terrorism comes up, the national conversation almost always circles back to a somewhat bigoted question: are Muslims more violent than other kinds of people because of their religion?

Actually, no serious observer argues that “Muslims” are inherently predisposed to violence—certainly no more than anyone else. Since Muslims encompass not only different racial and ethnic groups, but various factions and temperaments, this would be ridiculous argument. Almost as ridiculous as arguing any criticism of a religion is “somewhat bigoted.”

And no serious person argues that Muslims more prone to be criminals. Critics do, however, argue—with great amount of evidence to back them up—that right now, in this particular era in history, large movements within political “Islam” are prone to export violence and target innocent people elsewhere to fulfill various theocratic aims. They argue that this kind of terrorism is mostly the province of factions found within a single religion, one that has caused immense political upheaval around the world.

Beauchamp continues:

What these conversations usually lack is data; that is, evidence that Muslim societies are actually more violent than other ones. And it turns out, according to UC-Berkeley Professor M. Steven Fish, that judging by murder rates, people in Muslim-majority countries actually tend to be significantly less violent (bolding is mine): Predominantly, Muslim countries average 2.4 murders per annum per 100,000 people, compared to 7.5 in non-Muslim countries. The percentage of the society that is made up of Muslims is an extraordinarily good predictor of a country’s murder rate. More authoritarianism in Muslim countries does not account for the difference. I have found that controlling for political regime in statistical analysis does not change the findings. More Muslims, less homicide.

Really, is it that simple? For one thing, the debate is about external political, sectarian, and religious violence, not internal crime statistics—which tells us nothing about the nonviolent tendencies of any religion. The measure of a religion isn’t how it treats its own, but how it treats everyone else. Some data on the experience of Jews or Christians in Islamic nations might help clarify this point.

Beyond that, comparing the crime rate in a free society to those living in a tyranny is a giant waste of time. Crime rates in totalitarian regimes always tend to be low. Eastern European countries claimed to have far lower crime rates than Western European nations during the Cold War. Was East German society just as moral as West German society? What did those numbers tell us about Christianity or the German people?

Rather than making calibrations for Muslims in authoritarian states and those Muslims living in super-duper authoritarian states, as Fish does, it would be better to compare the number of theocratic beheadings and state-sanctioned gang rapes in Saudi Arabia to the Netherlands.

But let’s for a moment concede the unlikely scenario that Fish is offering a nonbiased look at the numbers and that those numbers matter. Let’s ignore that tyrannies lie about crime stats. Let’s forget that some nations, like the United States, have technological advantages in apprehending violent criminals that may skew the numbers. Let’s put aside the vital distinction between theocratic violence that is approved and funded by states and crime that has absolutely no political or religious motivation. Even if we used Vox’s own parameters it would be immoral to measure violence in the way it proposes.

If this study definitely proves that “Muslims” are less violent (“More Muslims, less homicide”), is Vox also suggesting that blacks are more prone to violence than whites? Because in, say, Jamaica the murder rate is 39.3 per 100,000. In the African continent the murder rate is 12.5—with sub-Saharan countries often featuring far higher percentages. Does that “obliterate the myth that whites are just as violent as blacks”? Or are there thousands of other factors—widespread poverty, corruption, or rule of law, for starters—in determining these rates?

Beauchamp says:

If Islam itself were in fact the key cause of Islamist terrorism, you’d expect ordinary Muslims to be more violent than ordinary non-Muslims.

No, you would not. But if you truly believe all the world’s great religions are equally violent (“intrinsically” speaking) there is social experiment one could undertake to find out. A Vox reporter could walk around Washington DC or Dallas or Atlanta holding a sign that says “Jesus is a myth” and see what happens. And then that reporter could head to Medina or Karachi or Gaza City and do the same thing with a corresponding sign about Islam. Afterwards, let’s compare results.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/02/vox-sets-out-to-prove-all-religions-are-equally-violent-and-fails/,2015-02-02
How Conservatives Are Getting Right On Crime,"Crime has long been a conservative issue. In the 1970s and 80s, conservatives answered the rising tide of crime by promising to “take back America’s streets” from thugs and gangsters. They offered clear solutions: more guards, more bars, and more prison beds. Put the fear of the law into would-be criminals, and lock the dangerous ones away.

Twenty years later, crime is down but corrections budgets are way up. About 2.3 million Americans are behind bars right now (think of them as “the other 1 percent”), costing their compatriots approximately 60 billion a year. Although sentences are often harsh, recidivism rates remain depressingly high. The war on crime has been successful, sort of, but it’s left us with a new set of problems.

Now conservatives are asking different questions. Can we maintain public safety on a more reasonable budget? Are there better ways to encourage reform, while still holding people accountable for their mistakes? Answering those questions in the affirmative, conservatives are spearheading another kind of criminal justice reform. Today, it isn’t just about getting “tough on crime.” It’s about getting right.

A Template for Criminal Justice Reform

Texas is the acknowledged leader in criminal justice reform. In recent years, Texas has been closing prisons and saving taxpayer money while watching crime rates continue to fall. Working through the Texas Public Policy Foundation, Right On Crime (ROC) is a national organization which has been helping promote similar reforms throughout the country. Many conservative states are following Texas’ lead, closing prisons and balancing state budgets.

In recent years, Texas has been closing prisons and saving taxpayer money while watching crime rates continue to fall.

Its signatories include numerous ranking conservatives, including Jeb Bush, Ken Cuccinelli, Asa Hutchinson, and Newt Gingrich. (Gingrich in particular has been an enthusiastic promoter.) Given its conservative bona fides, ROC’s policy statements may not be what people expect.

ROC favors more use of parole and probation as less-expensive alternatives to prison, especially for non-violent offenders (or re-offenders). It advocates giving judges more discretion to assign reasonable sentences, rather than holding them to strict minimum-sentencing laws. For juveniles in particular, incarceration should be used only when truly necessary, and courts should prefer community-based programs (such as vocational programs and group homes). ROC supports victim-offender mediation, and calls for voluntary drug courts along with more funding for drug treatment programs.

In short, today’s conservative reformers are aiming for less guards, bars, and prison beds. Incarceration is necessary in some instances, but it shouldn’t be our default punishment for every crime. Instead, we should use evidence-based methods to increase the effectiveness of our corrections spending. This can save taxpayers money, while opening opportunities for offenders who want to reform their lives.

What’s Changed Since 1994?

Fundamentally, conservatives haven’t abandoned any of their basic principles concerning crime. We value personal responsibility. Individuals should be held accountable for what they do, regardless of their childhood. Accountability is essential to justice, but also to moral improvement. Conservatives are rightly wary of the kind of “compassion” that involves treating adult human beings like machines liable to malfunction.

It isn’t conservative to punish mistakes in ways that further facilitate the offender’s moral decline.

We value the safety of the innocent, and also the rights of victims. It’s not fair to build a justice system around the needs of the guilty. The perspective of the victim should be respected, and when possible victims should be given the opportunity to accept reparations and to participate in the corrections process.

Finally, conservatives value the integrity of law. A society in which laws are not respected will predictably struggle with criminality and disorder.

Right On Crime doesn’t call for compromise on any of these points. Rather, it examines ways to realize them more fully, while also recognizing the relevance of other conservative principles that were somewhat neglected in the reforms of the 1990s. It’s not conservative to sit idly by while our government squanders money and fails to answer for the outcomes of that spending. It’s not conservative to build institutions on a model that rewards failure instead of encouraging success. Finally, it isn’t conservative to punish mistakes in ways that further facilitate the offender’s moral decline.

Our justice system should encourage accountability, restitution, and reform, and it should make efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Now that crime has fallen to more manageable levels, we can focus more attention on minimizing the cost of public safety, both in dollars and in lost human potential.

Putting Prisons In Their Place

Incarceration does have some benefits. It gets dangerous people off the streets. Sometimes, it interrupts wildly unhealthy or violent life patterns and gives convicts an opportunity to change. At the same time, there are a number of significant drawbacks. It’s expensive. It erodes convicts’ connections to their families and communities, making it harder for them to establish healthy life patterns after their release. Ex-convicts are also less employable in light of their criminal past, and often find themselves trying to start new lives with no marketable skills and no employment history.

It isn’t easy to put inmates on the path to reform, and most prisons aren’t particularly motivated to try.

It isn’t easy to put inmates on the path to reform, and most prisons aren’t particularly motivated to try. From the standpoint of a prison warden, recidivism means job security. The system needs to be revamped to incentivize reform-oriented prisons, as measured in lower recidivism rates. A “successful” prison should be one that helps inmates conquer addictions and develop job skills, preparing them for successful re-integration into society. Private prisons may be a promising alternative to state or federally-run prisons, since they can be more easily incentivized to explore evidence-based methods for diminishing recidivism.

Of course, for many offenders the best solution is to shorten sentences, or not to incarcerate at all. Parole and probation can often be excellent alternatives to incarceration, particularly in light of new technologies and evidence-based methodologies. GPS tracking can enable more effective monitoring of parolees. Ignition interlock devices and SCRAM bracelets (which monitor alcohol levels by measuring sweat) can deter drunk driving without keeping convicts behind bars. Advances in risk assessment make it easier to determine which convicts are likely to re-offend, and which can safely be moved to parole or probation programs.

Particularly for convicts with substance-abuse issues, traditional parole systems have been fairly ineffective at encouraging reform. When offenders violate the terms of their parole, correctional officers have no real recourse except to recommend that the offender be re-incarcerated. This isn’t necessarily an effective deterrent for people with poor impulse control and long-term planning skills. Minor offenses (like missing an appointment) are allowed to slide, and problems escalate until the offender is eventually re-incarcerated.

Private prisons may be a promising alternative to state or federally-run prisons, since they can be more easily incentivized to explore evidence-based methods for diminishing recidivism.

Evidence has shown that for many offenders, sanctions for parole violation need not be harsh so long as they are swift and certain. Hawaii’s HOPE program pioneered a new and notably more successful approach by subjecting former addicts to randomized drug tests and immediately punishing non-compliance with brief jail stays. Recognizing the benefits, other states have been piloting similar programs to help drug offenders overcome their addiction and re-integrate into their communities.

Reforming our criminal-justice system should be a lengthy process. It takes time and experimentation to see what works and what doesn’t. But with the help of organizations like Right On Crime, the building blocks are in place. Building a better, more humane, and more efficient system now seems like a completely realistic goal, and it needn’t involve any sacrifice of public safety.

Looking Forward

For many conservatives, prison reform may be the most exciting conservative issue they haven’t heard about. This isn’t necessarily surprising. For state governors, prison reform has been driven first and foremost by the bottom line. It hasn’t been a major electoral issue.

Liberals have long been lamenting the evils of mass incarceration; conservatives have done something about it.

As Texas and other red states have demonstrated, these reforms can work. Liberals have long been lamenting the evils of mass incarceration; conservatives have done something about it. Now may be the time to bring prison reform out of the shadows. There’s plenty to talk about, including some enticing opportunities for bipartisanship.

Criminal justice reform offers us a chance to embrace core conservative values by balancing budgets and shrinking government. Because it has appeal across the political spectrum, it should be politically viable. It’s not often that liberals and conservatives agree on major cost-saving measures. Let’s seize the opportunity.

At the same time, these reforms could open some windows to impoverished communities that suffer from a dearth of responsible men. As marriage declines, middle America is starting to exhibit the same dysfunctional tendencies that have long plagued inner-city slums. That means we’re likely to see many more young offenders who stand at the crossroads between a possibly-productive life, and years of criminality and costly correctional control. Reforming even some of these could make an enormous difference to our country’s future.

There’s much to be gained by getting right on crime. There’s much to be lost if we can’t.

14 Things You Should Understand About Guns Before Writing About Them,"Guns can be dangerous in the wrong hands. But so are articles about guns written by people who don’t understand anything about them.

There’s sadly no excuse to be ignorant about firearms. They’ve been around for hundreds of years. They’re owned and operated safely by tens of millions of Americans each year. Our Constitution guarantees our individual right to possess guns so that we might be able to defend ourselves from those who would violently take away our freedom. Many gun controllers, however — some of whom have bylines for major media organizations — don’t actually know the first thing about firearms.

Here’s a good example of the kind of self-inflicted injury that can result from weaponizing an ill-informed opinion about guns and gun-related paraphernalia, courtesy of Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post:

I believe these are rubber bullets, can anyone confirm? #Fergurson pic.twitter.com/iCsFi6qoIa



Ryan J. Reilly (@ryanjreilly) August 17, 2014

Unfortunately, Reilly is hardly alone in his complete ignorance of how guns work. Our nation is facing an epidemic of gun-related misreporting. As a public service to those who have opinions about guns but don’t really want to spend much time learning anything about them, I’ve compiled a simple list of 14 basic things everyone should understand before writing or talking about guns.

1) Don’t Lecture Anyone On Gun Safety Until You Understand The Basic Rules

These are rules literally every person should understand, because you never know when you might be in a situation that requires you to handle a firearm. To seasoned gun owners, these basic gun safety rules are gospel. If faithfully followed, they will prevent the likelihood of you ever shooting someone who did not pose an immediate and mortal threat to an innocent person.

1. Treat all guns as though they are loaded.

2. Never point the muzzle at anything you don’t intend to destroy.

3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you’re prepared to fire.

4. Always confirm your target, as well as what’s in front, behind, and around it.

Each rule is effectively a backup in case you ignore a previous rule. If you always assume a gun is loaded, then you’ll never have to say, “Your Honor, I didn’t know it was loaded.” If you screw up the first rule, the rule #2 will prevent you from shooting someone unintentionally, because your muzzle will always be pointed in a safe direction. If you screw up the first and second rules, rule #3 will ensure that the weapon is never actually discharged. And in the event that you believe your life is in mortal danger, rule #4 will prevent you from firing on an individual who’s a non-threat, or prevent you from firing through a threat into an innocent person.

These gun safety rules are to be practiced all the time, without exception. At the range. In your home. When you are carrying. When you’re not carrying. When a gun is loaded. When a gun is empty (remember: it’s never empty). The rules exist to protect you and everyone around you from harm. Memorize them. Practice them. And don’t lecture anyone on “gun control” or “gun safety,” the new gun-controller-approved euphemism for gun control, until you can effortlessly recite them and explain why they are so important.

It’s a simple test: if a gun controller wants to tell you what is or isn’t safe, ask them to tell you the four basic rules of gun safety. If they can’t or won’t, then you’ll know they’re more interested in demagoguery than they are in promoting safe gun handling.

2) Guns Are Inanimate Objects

“Guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” may be widely mocked by ignorant gun controllers, but it’s true (also true is the fact that guns don’t kill people, bullets do, if we want to be really pedantic). A gun cannot load a magazine by itself. A gun cannot secure a loaded magazine by itself. An empty gun cannot chamber a round or rack the slide by itself. A gun cannot pull a trigger by itself. Each of these actions requires agency by a human being.

These are all reasons why I personally dislike the term “accidental” shooting, because it suggests a lack of accountability and responsibility. A more appropriate term is “negligent” shooting, since human action is required to load a magazine, secure the loaded magazine, chamber a round, and pull the trigger. It’s why the basic gun safety rules are so important: if followed religiously, they reduce the probability of negligent shootings to 0%.

But what about intentional shootings where innocent people are targeted? Those don’t just require human agency, they require criminal intent. That’s why we try and punish criminals, rather than their weapons. It’s why gun criminals are sent to prison, while the criminals’ guns are often sent to the auction block. Criminal will is a far more dangerous and eternal thing than a simple firearm. It explains why so many criminals use illegally obtained weapons in their crimes. Why, it’s almost as though they don’t care about laws at all!

The mind that wishes to snuff out an innocent human life is far more terrifying than whatever inanimate object he or she decides to use. Don’t blame the tool; blame the individual who wishes to use it for evil.

3) Modern Guns Do Not Accidentally “Go Off”

As noted in the previous example, in order for a gun to go “BANG!” a specific sequence of events must occur, and each event requires human intervention. Modern handguns do not accidentally go “BANG!” That’s just not how guns work. Even a loaded gun, with a chambered round, with the safety off and the hammer/striker cocked will not just “go off” by itself. The trigger must still be pressed to release the firing pin or striker.

One thing that drives me nuts when I read it in the news is how a gun “went off.” Note the passive voice.

Whether intentional or not, this type of phrasing implies that the gun itself is the hazard, rather than the person handling it. Guns don’t “go off.” They’re fired by people. This is why the term “accidental shooting” is a misnomer. Unintentional, perhaps. Inadvertent, maybe. But guns don’t accidentally end up in a state that allows them to be fired, and they certainly don’t fire themselves.

A better term is “negligent shooting.” Negligence is the proper characterization because it accurately reflects the fact that an individual neglected to follow each of the basic gun safety rules. And for gun owners, the term negligence helps foster the proper mindset for gun handling: if this weapon is discharged, it is because of something you did. Therefore, don’t ever allow your weapon to be discharged unless it is to neutralize a mortal threat to you or another innocent individual.

4) “Semi-Automatic” And “Automatic” Are Not Synonyms

If you want people to understand that you have no clue what you’re talking about, by all means conflate “automatic” and “semi-automatic.”

An automatic firearm is one in which a single trigger pull can discharge multiple rounds. In the U.S., civilians are virtually banned from owning automatic weapons. If a truly automatic weapon is used in a crime, you can almost guarantee that it was obtained illegally.

In contrast to an automatic weapon, a semi-automatic weapon will at most discharge one round with a single trigger pull. What makes it semi-automatic rather than fully automatic is that the recoil generated from firing one round results in the weapon chambering another round, assuming the magazine is not empty, but without firing the second round (as opposed to a fully automatic, which both chambers and fires multiple rounds with one trigger pull). If we’re being really technical, a semi-automatic weapon is one in which a single trigger pull 1) discharges at most one round, 2) cocks the hammer or striker after the round is fired, and 3) chambers an additional round after the weapon discharges a round and extracts/ejects the shell casing, all without requiring any additional mechanical energy from the gun’s operator.

The second part of that definition is important because it is what differentiates a typical revolver from a semi-automatic pistol. Although a revolver is capable of chambering a round after a previous one is fired, the hammer must still be cocked by the user before another round can be fired (either via a double-action trigger or a manual cocking of the hammer).

5) “Clip” And “Magazine” Are Not Synonyms

If you watch the news or movies in which firearms are used, you’ll often hear the terms “clip” and “magazine” used interchangeably. They’re not synonyms, though. Here’s a helpful illustration of the difference:

A clip is exactly that: it clips rounds together so that they can more easily be fed into a magazine or directly into a weapon’s chamber. A clip has zero moving parts. All it does is clip ammunition together.

Magazines contain moving parts, most often springs. They are inserted directly into and remain in a firearm, unlike clips. The springs move another round into position so it can be chambered when necessary. In a traditional semi-automatic pistol, when a round is stripped from the top of a magazine and chambered by the rack sliding forward, the spring-powered magazine automatically pushes the next round into position to be chambered. When the round in the chamber is fired, the recoil propels the slide backwards and ejects the spent shell casing. Then, as the slide moves forward into battery, it strips the top round from the magazine and inserts it into the chamber.

This animation of the firing cycle of a 1911-style pistol clearly illustrates how a semi-automatic pistol generally works:





6) Gun Safeties Can And Will Fail

Although it’s become something of a cliche in firearm handling courses, it is absolutely true that “the only safety that matters is the one between your ears.” Like any inanimate object, no gun is foolproof. Mechanical devices can and will fail. If you rely on your gun’s external safety as a substitute for following the four basic gun safety rules, you’re going to get yourself into trouble. This doesn’t mean gun safeties are bad. They’re not at all. They’re incredibly valuable. But a mechanical safety in and of itself is not a guaranteed way to prevent a negligent discharge. Some manufacturers such as Glock do not even install external mechanical safeties on their firearms. The only way to prevent a negligent discharge from a firearm is to follow the four basic gun safety rules 100 percent of the time.

7) So-Called “Smart Gun” Technology Is Not Reliable

So-called “smart guns” are all the rage among gun controllers these days. What are “smart guns”? In theory, they’re guns outfitted with technology that renders the weapon inoperable if it is wielded by anyone other than its lawful owner. In theory, “smart gun” technology sounds like an interesting concept. But some gun controllers want to make it mandatory:

There has been renewed interest in smart guns since the Newtown school shooting, which reinvigorated the gun-control debate. However, there is immense pressure not to be the first to sell them. That’s because of a New Jersey law passed in 2002 known as the Childproof Handgun Law, which says that all guns sold in New Jersey must be state-approved smart guns within three years of a smart gun being sold anywhere in the country. The goal was to make smart guns mandatory as soon as the technology existed. Officially, no smart gun has been sold in the US yet — meaning if Raymond had sold one, it would have triggered the clause in New Jersey.

@johntabin @seanmdav Not so. Smart gun technology advances gun safety. Yet it encounters severe opposition by the gun lobby that wishes,



David Frum (@davidfrum) November 5, 2014

In practice, the unproven and unreliable technology demanded by gun controllers is a disaster waiting to happen. As noted in a previous example, mechanical safeties fail. So do electronic devices. Now imagine putting an electronic device subject to radio interference in charge of whether a gun can be fired. Heck, simple biometric gun safes are not even 100% reliable. Batteries fail. Software fails. Circuits short out. Fingerprint readers can quickly become unreliable. And what happens if your smart-gun triggering wristband is shot or otherwise damaged by a home invader? You and your family are completely out of luck.

There’s a reason there’s absolutely zero market for “smart guns” among people who actually understand how guns work: the technology is completely unreliable. The basic gun safety rules, though, are airtight. It shouldn’t surprise us that people who don’t even understand basic gun mechanics or safety rules want to mandate completely unreliable technology.

This isn’t to say the underlying technology isn’t useful. It can be. One police force is considering using the technology to alert the department whenever an officer’s gun is unholstered or discharged.

If individuals or organizations decide on their own to implement a new, untested technology, they’re free to do so. But mandating unreliable “smart gun” technology is a very dumb thing to do.

8) Handing Someone A Badge Doesn’t Make Him A Good Shooter

Accurately shooting a gun is not like using a camera. It’s not a simple “point and click.” Like any skill — yes, shooting is a skill — shooting a gun accurately requires constant practice and discipline. Firearm presentation, sight acquisition and alignment, trigger discipline, and follow-through are each skills that must be painstakingly developed before one can consider himself an accurate and reliable shooter. Shooters who can go from the holster to breaking multiple shots on target in less than a second didn’t get there by accident. It likely took hundreds of hours and thousands of rounds of practice.

The same is true for police. The badge does not confer magical shooting abilities. And contrary to much public opinion, the level of training received by most everyday patrolmen is not close to being enough to make an individual a highly reliable and accurate shooter. Moreover, the annual or semi-annual firearms qualifications required in most departments are hardly stringent. Here are the qualification standards for Wisconsin law enforcement officials:

Over 40 percent of rounds are fired within 3 yards. Over 85 percent are within 7 yards. Officers are required to fire only 12 shots at a distance of 15 yards or greater, and only ten of those must hit a target. Quite simply, you do not need to be a proficient shooter to pass a test like that.

In 2007, the New York Times wrote about systemic problems with police shooting accuracy:

New York City police statistics show that simply hitting a target, let alone hitting it in a specific spot, is a difficult challenge. In 2006, in cases where police officers intentionally fired a gun at a person, they discharged 364 bullets and hit their target 103 times, for a hit rate of 28.3 percent, according to the department’s Firearms Discharge Report. The police shot and killed 13 people last year.



In 2005, officers fired 472 times in the same circumstances, hitting their mark 82 times, for a 17.4 percent hit rate. They shot and killed nine people that year.



In all shootings — including those against people, animals and in suicides and other situations — New York City officers achieved a 34 percent accuracy rate (182 out of 540), and a 43 percent accuracy rate when the target ranged from zero to six feet away. Nearly half the shots they fired last year were within that distance.

Does this mean that all cops are terrible shots? Absolutely not. Cops who want to be good shooters, rather than cops who wear a gun only because they have to, are generally terrific shooters. The police officers that I’ve competed with in defensive pistol shooting competitions are incredible. Many enjoyed shooting to begin with and became cops because the job gave them the ability to practice and develop their skills as shooters more than any other line of work. But they didn’t become highly proficient shooters just because they chose to wear a uniform and a badge. It’s because they put in the time necessary to develop and maintain their shooting skills.

Unfortunately, police budget constraints make this type of training unfeasible for most departments.

9) The “AR” In “AR-15” Doesn’t Stand For “Assault Rifle”

That’s right. The “AR” in the name of the popular AR-15 doesn’t stand for “assault rifle.” It stands for ArmaLite, the company that developed the rifle platform back in the 1950’s. Today, the “AR-15” trademark is owned by Colt, which bought the rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 from ArmaLite in 1959. However, the term AR-15 has come to represent just about any type of conventional M4- or M16-variant rifle.

10) High Capacity Magazine Bans Are Completely Counterproductive

In the wake of the Aurora movie theater shooting in Colorado, lawmakers in the state swiftly enacted bans on high capacity ammunition magazines. Just as that state’s rush to close the inaccurately named “gunshow loophole” following the Columbine massacre failed to prevent the Aurora shooting, so to will the magazine ban fail to prevent future mass shootings.

Member of Congress pushing for a ban on high capacity magazines does not appear to understand what a magazine IS. http://t.co/15uDAh6REs



Scott McGrew (@ScottMcGrew) April 4, 2013

Why? For the same reason that gun bans don’t prevent criminals from possessing and using guns: they don’t care about gun laws. A psychopath intent on murdering a roomful of innocent people is not going to care if it’s illegal to possess a 16-round magazine. And there’s a good chance he’s going to bring with him an armory of high capacity magazines loaded to capacity.

That’s not the case for people who obey laws, though. The woman who lawfully carries a concealed weapon to protect herself from would-be rapists is going to follow the law, because she doesn’t want to put herself in jeopardy. Furthermore, the desire to legally carry a concealed weapon already puts a law-abiding citizen at a disadvantage against a murderer who’s armed to the teeth. How? Because the requirement of concealment almost by definition limits the amount of ammunition you can carry. In most cases, that means one magazine in the gun along with one spare magazine.

As the police statistics above showed, a few rounds may not be enough to neutralize multiple attackers. In some cases, you could empty a magazine against an assailant without neutralizing the threat (this is especially true against attackers who may be hopped up on drugs or wearing body armor). Contrary to the movies, merely shooting someone in the chest may not immediately incapacitate the threat. Only a direct shot to the central nervous system can instantly incapacitate an attacker (generally a shot inside the triangle formed by the eyes and nose), and those shots are incredibly difficult, especially against a target that may be moving.

Just like gun bans serve only to prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves, high capacity magazine bans put lawful gun carriers at a distinct disadvantage against well-armed assailants. As a result, it’s really not all surprising that Colorado, which twice voted for Barack Obama, voted to oust the Democratic state Senate president who pushed through that state’s mag ban.

11) “Shoot To Wound” Is Absurd And Dangerous

Whenever you hear about a fatal police shooting, you’re almost guaranteed to see a commentator wonder aloud why police aren’t trained to “shoot to wound.” The simple answer is that it’s because the police aren’t idiots. “Shoot to wound” is a terrible idea that also happens to be incredibly unsafe.

Do police Ever Shoot “2 Wound?”Can Arms, Legs,Shoulders b Targets?The STRESS MUST B UNBEARABLE,but is there Enough “Judgement”Training?

To begin with, a gun is considered a deadly weapon for a reason. Merely firing a gun constitutes the discharge of deadly force, and the discharge of deadly force is only legal if the person discharging it reasonably believes that his or her life (or that of an another innocent individual) is in mortal danger.

Now, if you believe yourself to be in mortal danger, would you fire at someone’s foot, or hand, or knee? Of course not. Why? Because shots to those areas do not prevent an assailant from shooting back at you. Instead, you would shoot at center mass, and in the event that those shots failed to neutralize the threat, you would aim for the head and the individual’s central nervous system. The notion of “shooting to wound” flies in the face of only shooting to neutralize a mortal threat. If you believe a threat can be neutralized without the use of deadly force, then you just lost your legal justification for discharging deadly force — in this case, firing a gun.

Furthermore, shooting at a moving appendage like an arm or leg is incredibly difficult, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stray round that could injure an innocent bystander. Bullets that hit those body parts are also more likely to overpenetrate, rather than stopping inside the intended target’s body. This doesn’t mean that you should necessarily shoot to kill. You are not justified in killing a person who has been clearly neutralized and no longer poses a threat. Your goal in discharging a deadly weapon is not to end a life. Your goal is to neutralize a mortal threat.

Never discharge your weapon unless you believe your life or that of another innocent person is in imminent mortal danger. And then, if you choose to shoot, shoot to neutralize the threat.

12) Hollow Point Bullets Are Actually Safer Than Standard Full Metal Jacket Ammunition

Whenever a reporter, gun controller, screenwriter, or general ignoramus wants to make ammunition sound super dangerous and sketchy, they’ll talk about “hollow point bullets.” What these people don’t understand is that hollow points are actually far safer than standard full metal jacket (FMJ), or ball, ammunition. Why? Because they’re less likely to overpenetrate.

Because of their shape and the speed at which they’re traveling, standard bullets have a tendency to go through things like walls, cars, people, etc. The result is that while you might hit your intended target, that bullet could continue to travel through the target and into someone or something you didn’t intend to hit. This is why rule #4 of the basic safety gun rules exists.

Ninth Circuit blesses San Fran's trigger lock requirement and ban on the sale of hollow-point bullets http://t.co/N6wdGtrDvp



Joe Palazzolo (@joe_palazzolo) March 25, 2014



So what does this have to do with hollow points? Because of how they’re designed — the hollow point opens upon impact, similar to how a flower blooms, thereby increasing drag and greatly reducing projectile speed — they greatly reduce the chance of overpenetration (for the same reason, hollow points are also not even close to being “armor-piercing”). How does that make them safer? The reduced bullet penetration reduces the likelihood of the bullet you fired on target hitting someone or something it wasn’t supposed to hit. Now, hollow points are definitely not safer for the person who’s hit by them. The opening of the bullet upon impact increases the effective diameter of the bullet, which leads to greater damage to the target.

That also makes it safer for all innocent bystanders, though. Why? Because you likely will not need to put as many shots on target in order to neutralize the threat. Fewer shots needed on target means fewer shots that need to be fired, which means a lower likelihood of an innocent person being hit. If you keep a gun in your home or on your body for personal protection, you absolutely should be using some type of hollow point ammunition, not FMJ ammunition, because FMJ ammunition is more likely to penetrate through walls and endanger whoever happens to be on the other side of them. FMJ ammunition should be reserved almost exclusively for the gun range.

13) Most Gun Owners Understand Gun Laws A Lot Better Than Gun Controllers Do

While I don’t doubt the desire of many gun controllers to reduce gun violence in the country, I do doubt their understanding of federal, state, and local gun laws in the U.S. A person who carries a weapon every day is far more likely to know the particulars of his or her state’s gun laws, because that person is in legal jeopardy in the event that he or she gets the law wrong. People who get paid to talk on TV for a living will not pay any real penalty if they completely screw up a state’s gun laws. An individual with a gun, however, can pay a very severe price if they don’t follow every gun law to the letter. Just ask this man, who faces a decade in prison for possessing an antique 18th-century flintlock pistol.

The controversy around the so-called “gun show loophole” is a perfect example of basic ignorance about the nation’s gun laws and their effects.

@scott_stephen 90% of Americans favor ending the gun show loophole but NRA owns enough Dems and GOPs to block even having a vote.



John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) December 27, 2014

There is no gun show loophole, period. The vast majority of gun show sales are conducted by federal firearms licensees, or FFLs, and FFL sales are strictly regulated by the federal government. Every FFL sale must be accompanied by a background check. No ifs, ands, or buts. Every sale of a firearm across state lines — for example, a resident of State A buying a gun in State B — must be processed by an FFL in the purchaser’s state. And what did we just learn about FFL sales? You can’t buy a gun from an FFL without undergoing a background check.

At the federal level (this is a key distinction), the only type of purchase that doesn’t require a background check is a private transaction between two individuals who reside in the same state. Gun shows have absolutely nothing to do with it. And if you think a federal universal background check is going to keep criminals from buying guns from each other, then I’d like to know why it hasn’t prevented them from buying drugs from each other.

14) “Universal Background Checks” Are Already The Law In Many States

What gun controllers won’t tell you is that “universal background checks” are the norm in a large number of states, notwithstanding the lack of a federal law requiring universal background checks. The gun controllers know this, but they’d rather force a one-size-fits-all federal policy one time than take the time and effort required to convince each state that it’s a good policy for that state.

Take Illinois, for example. Illinois requires universal background checks on all firearms purchases. Until recently, the city of Chicago virtually banned gun possession. Did those laws do anything to curb violent crime in the state? Of course not. Other states that require universal background checks on all firearms purchases include California and New York. How’s violent crime in those states, other than really high?

Some states require universal background checks only on handguns. North Carolina is one of those states. It requires either a concealed carry permit or a government-issued purchase permit, both of which require background checks, before an individual can purchase a handgun. In this case, two background checks are completed if you purchase a handgun from an FFL in North Carolina: once by the county that issues your purchase permit, and once by the FFL that sells you your handgun. Why do I single out North Carolina? Because it was in North Carolina that a crazed leftist armed with a handgun allegedly murdered three young Muslims over what appears to be a parking dispute. He passed his background check with flying colors.

The takeaway? No amount of gun laws or do-goodery is going to keep guns out of the hands of evil people. But those laws can keep guns out of the hands of careful, safe, law-abiding citizens who just want to protect themselves and their families. And that should be a crime.

Seven Reasons Conservatives Are Leading Criminal Justice Reform,"Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Times ran an opinion piece on criminal-justice reform. The title pretty much says it all: “Conservatives Are Still Trouncing Liberals on Prison Reform.” That’s the buzz on prison reform, which we find repeated in major news outlets like Mother Jones and the Daily Beast. Criminal justice reform is happening! But wait, it’s not what you think. Conservatives are doing it. Miraculous, no?

Not really, actually. We all understand the reasoning, of course. Liberals are supposed to be the nicey-nice ones who want to love and rehabilitate everybody; conservatives can hardly wait to throw away the key. Liberals are the ones who denounce mass incarceration as a racist, classist stain upon the soul of our nation. Conservatives go on issuing reminders that regardless of your age, race, class, or sex, crime doesn’t (and shouldn’t) pay.

Nevertheless, it’s conservatives who are pragmatically implementing policy changes that are shrinking inmate populations and in some cases actually closing prisons. This makes perfect sense. Justice reform should be a conservative initiative, and conservatives who aren’t yet on board consider whether their views on crime might need a refresh. Though they aren’t as sympathetic to the sob stories, conservatives are the ones with the proper motivations and philosophy to make our justice system better. Here’s why.

1. Prisons Are Expensive

And who cares most about that? Conservatives are ever the nation’s watchdogs when it comes to wasteful spending. Thus, we notice that federal corrections budgets have increased 56 percent since 2001. We care that prisons are soaking up about 85 percent of most state corrections budgets… and that those budgets have increased fourfold over the past 20 years. We also recognize that our nation is already facing a major fiscal crisis, and simply can’t afford to ignore government bloat. Saving money isn’t the only reason for reforming our prison system, but it’s a good one.

2. Conservatives Love Freedom

We’d much rather see people order their own lives than have government do it for them. No conservative should be happy to see large numbers of his compatriots under direct government control.

No conservative should be happy to see large numbers of his compatriots under direct government control.

Some people, of course, can’t be trusted to be free. They’re dangerous. Everyone cares about preserving public safety, which is why the “tough on crime” campaigns of the 1990s addressed the problem of rising crime with harsher penalties designed to restore the rule of law. But while these initiatives arguably worked (crime is down), we’ve reached something of a point of diminishing returns, such that beefed-up sentences and skyrocketing corrections budgets no longer buy us significant rewards. It’s time to look for responsible, practical ways to “slim down” our corrections system.

As conservatives, we should always prefer to see people living free, independent lives, to the extent that this is possible. Even when it isn’t, a less-invasive government program is (all else being equal) clearly preferable to one that gives the state ever more power to control, intimidate, and impose its will on the general population. Some people do need to be in prison, but incarceration should be understood as a serious punishment, to be used only when truly necessary. With approximately 1 percent of our population behind bars, it’s hard to believe that we can’t do better.

3. Conservatives Are Serious about Personal Responsibility

At the same time, we believe in redemption. Both are critical components of successful justice reform.

If we excuse serious misbehavior on the grounds that the offender was materially disadvantaged or had a bad childhood, we send the message that offenders are something less than rational.

When people do bad things, they need to be held responsible. This is critical to upholding the integrity of the law, but it’s also absolutely necessary for the offender’s own moral growth. A basic condition of being a morally responsible person is that you have to take responsibility for your own actions. If we excuse serious misbehavior on the grounds that the offender was materially disadvantaged or had a bad childhood, we send the message (to him and to other possible offenders) that he’s something less than rational. He’s not a mature morally responsible being so much as a machine liable to malfunction. He literally can’t help himself.

Unhappy people can often be persuaded to accept this view of their own behavior. They come to see their mistakes, not as an aberration to be eliminated (“that’s not who I want to be”), but rather as a bug in their personal programming over which they have no control. Shame is painful, and excuses can provide a welcome refuge from that shame. Liberals, with their longstanding attraction to social models of crime, are particularly prone to offer this kind of relief, particularly to criminal offenders from impoverished backgrounds or from minority groups that liberals like to champion.

The social arguments are more compelling than some like to admit. Certainly, people with bad, negligent parents are far more likely to get into trouble. A sociologist walking through a maternity ward could (given some basic facts about family background and so forth) make some excellent guesses about which children were most likely to end up incarcerated, and which to end up earning six figures. At the end of the day, the playing field of life is never totally level. Still this sobering fact remains: when we excuse wrongdoing as “society’s fault,” this cripples the individual’s efforts towards personal development. If my therapist tells me that I can’t help myself… why try?

Conservatives are the right people to reform criminal justice, because unlike so many of their liberal counterparts, they fully understand the necessity of holding people accountable for their mistakes. Getting right on crime doesn’t mean letting people off. It means giving them a chance to atone for their missteps, and do better.

4. Conservatives Know Justice Should Be Colorblind

This is a huge stumbling block for liberals. It’s understandable that they would be sensitive about it, because in prisons we see the unlovely fruits of so many of their favorite policies.

We’re not going to fix our justice system by inserting racial biases where they obviously don’t belong.

In your average prison, the inmate population does not look like America. Blacks and whites are represented in very nearly equal numbers; each make up about 40 percent of our inmates. That’s wildly different from the general U.S. population, in which whites represent 64 percent and blacks 13 percent. Statistically, about one in three African American males will spend some period of their lives behind bars.

Should we be concerned about this? Of course. Those numbers obviously speak to some severe cultural malady, and all patriotic Americans should be anxious to understand what’s gone wrong. Still, uncomfortable as it may be, the most immediate explanation for black incarceration rates appears to be… black criminality. And we’re not going to fix our justice system by inserting racial biases where they obviously don’t belong.

That’s not something liberals like to hear. They spend a lot of time manufacturing comparisons between modern penitentiaries and eighteenth-century Southern plantations. It’s hard to think seriously about criminal justice reform when you’re that reality-averse.

5. Conservatives Value Family and Community

One fundamental problem with incarceration is its tendency to remove people from environments that might facilitate reform, placing them instead in the company of other offenders who are likely to have a negative effect on their character. Effective probation and parole programs (sometimes combined with ankle monitoring or other technological solutions) often make it possible to keep families together, and enable communities to be involved in the process of restitution and reform. Fewer broken families? More community-based solutions to problems? Sounds like conservative thinking to me.

6. Conservatives Are Eager to See Victims Compensated through Just Restitution

Too often, victims are ignored in our deliberations about criminal justice. That’s unfair, because they are the ones who most obviously deserve solicitude and respect. It’s also unfortunate, because working with victims can be a particularly effective form of rehabilitation for offenders as well. It’s good to be reminded that our offenses have hurt someone, not just a faceless system.

Victim relief often comes in the form of financial restitution, but inmates have a very limited capacity to pay this. Probationers can do much more by way of compensating their victims directly. For less-serious crimes, mediation is often an effective way of compensating and empowering victims, while also giving offenders a better chance at improving their lives.

7. Conservatives Care Whether Policies Actually Work

Many liberals are perplexed when they see conservatives working to change policies that they themselves once helped to implement. For example, “truth in sentencing” policies (which include mandatory minimum sentences and three-strike policies) were broadly supported by conservatives in the ’90s. Today, those are the laws reform-minded conservatives would like to strike.

I don’t see this as an egg-on-face moment so much as a chance to show that, unlike so many progressives, we’re willing to walk away from strategies that aren’t working. Public policy is a world of imperfections. Reasonable people are prepared to make adjustments in light of new evidence and observed results. That’s the goal of getting “right on crime,” and it’s something we should welcome as an excellent example of sound, strategic, conservative thinking.

Justice Reform: Georgia’s Bipartisan Cinderella Story,"Tonight, at the Georgia Pacific Auditorium in Atlanta, a group of panelists will meet to discuss one area of American policy where smart thinking and bipartisanship are actually making things better. The topic is criminal justice reform. A lot is going right in the state of Georgia, and the panelists will explain why we should do more of it.

Assembled by the Charles Koch Institute, they come from across the political spectrum, with serious policy thinkers from both right and left-leaning nonprofit groups. Despite that, that the tone will likely be genial. Although their priorities and connections are very different, all of these panelists appreciate how much Americans have to gain by reforming a corrections system that is bloated, inefficient, and often needlessly destructive to American families and communities.

Georgia has distinguished itself as a front-runner on this issue. Although the overhaul of its justice system is far from complete, the Peach State has joined its Lone Star cousin as a success story that’s raising eyebrows across the nation. There’s something here for everybody to like. By reforming its corrections system, Georgia has already saved more than $20 million, with much bigger savings likely on the horizon. Its general inmate population is down, and juvenile detention rates have fallen even more. Through it all, crime rates have remained low.

Conservatives have long been leading the charge in justice reform, especially in southern states like Georgia and Texas. The time is now ripe for Republicans nationwide to embrace this issue. Both fiscally and socially, there’s much to be gained, but we should also see this as a valuable political opportunity. Justice reform opens the door to some smart policy changes that almost nobody seems to hate. It demonstrates that conservatives can to be both smart and proactive about policy reform. Best of all, it shows how fiscally sound policies can also be compassionate and humane.

How Georgia Learned That Tough Isn’t Enough

In the not-distant past, Georgia claimed the dubious distinction of being the number-one “toughest” state in the nation when it came to crime. The state was fully on board with the reforms of the 1990s, which attacked crime aggressively with mandatory minimum sentences and three-strike laws. Georgia even took this a step further, with Democratic Gov. Zell Miller’s two-strike law, under which thousands of Georgians were sentenced to life terms.

One in 13 Georgian adults was under correctional control of some sort, and the state’s inmate population had more than doubled since 1990.

Crime dropped. But by 2010, this regime had taken a serious toll on the state. One in 13 Georgian adults was under correctional control of some sort, and the state’s inmate population had more than doubled since 1990. State spending was increasing by over $500 million annually. Corrections were the state’s second-highest state expenditure, after the Department of Education.

The budget considerations alone were daunting. But the human cost was also significant, says Jay Neal, executive director of Georgia’s Office of Transition, Support, and Re-entry. More and more Georgians started noticing as the overaggressive system upended the lives of people they people they knew.

“When I first started doing this job,” says Neal, “people kept coming to me and saying (of a friend or relative), ‘He’s a good boy. He’s not like that other crowd,’ or ‘She’s a good girl. She’s not like those others.’”

Everyone cares about public safety. But it was becoming clear to people that incarceration was being used as a one-size-fits-all punishment for people who were not dangerous. This carried a real cost both for them and for their communities, especially because inmates emerging from prison face serious obstacles in their efforts to go straight. Few have marketable skills, and they also must contend with the stigma of a criminal record.

Finding the Sweet Spot Where Policy Meets Politics

Republican Gov. Nathan Deal agreed there should be a better way. He opened the issue in January of 2011, in his very first speech before the state legislature. At the same time, conservative nonprofits stepped in to offer support, both in crafting workable policy and in educating the public.

As all policy-makers know, it can be hard to ‘market’ good policy because the measures that make the most sense often aren’t the ones that energize voters.

“I have to credit the Texas Public Policy Foundation with this, because they approached us,” said Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation. With the help of TPPF, his foundation staged a panel to present the issue, featuring TPPF’s Marc Levin and Texas state Rep. Jerry Madden. “Looking back on that,” says McCutchen, “I think this whole issue is fascinating as an incredibly successful effort by nonprofits to impact policy. You had the perfect combination of politics and policy.”

In politics, this might be as close as you can come to a “Cinderella story.” As all policy-makers know, it can be hard to “market” good policy because the measures that make the most sense often aren’t the ones that energize voters. “Policy can be a little boring,” admits McCutchen, “and politicians get nervous because sometimes good policy is controversial.”

In this case, the Texans and Georgians came together to find some harmony. “Marc [Levin] can answer any question; he can give you the facts and figures on why this makes sense and how much savings they had. But Jerry [Madden] put it in very simple terms that people can understand. He said, ‘You know, what we’re doing is turning tax burdens into taxpayers.’”

An expanded use of ‘accountability courts’ enabled many drug users to avoid prison if they got serious about treating their addiction through community-supervised programs.

This advocacy started to get traction. Georgia began looking at sentencing reform and other initiatives to rehabilitate inmates and keep non-violent offenders out of prison. An expanded use of “accountability courts” enabled many drug users to avoid prison if they got serious about treating their addiction through community-supervised programs. These programs cost dramatically less than incarceration ($13 per day per person, as compared to about $50 per day for state prisoners) but have proven significantly more effective at converting addicts into law-abiding citizens.

Legislatively, it really was a tour de force of sensible bipartisanship. “We continued to broaden the coalition,” said McCutchen, “by bringing on the ACLU and others that normally don’t agree with us on a lot of things, and we created this great coalition, which was really amazing, and fun to do. And that’s why the thing passed unanimously. And nothing passes unanimously in Georgia. I could have a resolution honoring Miss Georgia and it wouldn’t pass unanimously.”

All Aboard the Justice Reform Train

Among conservatives, the initial transition from “tough” to “smart” was tricky. Many conservative politicians were understandably nervous about justice reform. Could they transition from “tough” to “smart” without alienating voters? Would Democrats skewer them with “hug a thug” caricatures and whip the voters into a panic?

Many conservative politicians were understandably nervous about justice reform. Could they transition from ‘tough’ to ‘smart’ without alienating voters?

It didn’t happen like that. Initially, nonprofit groups helped bolster their case through the sanction of big-name conservative supporters. “Our fellow conservatives were worried,” McCutchen relates, “about the risk of being soft on crime. So we decided what we could do best was to focus on recruiting some well-respected conservative leaders here in Georgia to sign onto the principles of Right on Crime. That gave our elected officials cover.”

Texas’ Right on Crime initiative continues to make progress there, most recently claiming Gov. Rick Perry as a new signatory, adding to an already impressive list of conservatives that includes Jeb Bush, William Bennett, Asa Hutchinson, and Newt Gingrich.

Much of the project’s success has hinged on the leadership of Deal, whose sustained commitment to the project has by all accounts been critical to its success. Deal was also one of the first to incorporate his position on justice reform into his successful 2014 re-election campaign.

‘Governor Deal had a unique background because he was an attorney, he understood the issue, and he had a son who headed up an accountability court.’

“It helps a lot when you have a governor on your side,” said McCutchen, “and Governor Deal had a unique background because he was an attorney, he understood the issue, and he had a son who headed up an accountability court. So he had seen firsthand how you could have alternatives for non-violent offenders that were more effective than prison, and it really was changing people’s lives.”

Neal agrees that the governor’s support has been essential. Justice reform, he says, is “a daunting project, just given the magnitude of what needs to be done. And you need a lot of coordination all across the state, so without strong leadership it’s almost impossible to make it happen. We’ve been blessed with that strong leadership from the governor’s office.”

Policy-Makers, Politicians, and the Public

It’s hard enough to get policy-makers and politicians on the same page. In the longer run, the public will have the final say. In the case of justice reform, voters seem enthusiastic and anxious for more.

This may be one rare issue in which the lack of controversy is the biggest obstacle to getting political traction.

“We’ve had almost no pushback from people who don’t think we should be doing what we’re doing,” says Neal, whose office is in the middle of an aggressive new prisoner re-entry initiative. Instead of fielding criticism from skeptics, Neal says his office gets regular complaints from people who want to see them work faster, and implement their project in more regions.

In Texas, where conservative justice reform first began, the voters have clearly spoken. A recent poll released by the Right on Crime unit shows strong support for sentencing reform, drug treatment programs, and the increased use of community supervision as an alternative for non-violent offenders.

Ironically, this may be one rare issue in which the lack of controversy is the biggest obstacle to getting political traction. The talking heads and rabble-rousers have trouble making hay from an issue where so many interests seem to align. Cooler heads should notice, however, that criminal justice reform is one area of policy in which conservatives can claim some clear, feel-good wins. And these are exactly the sorts of wins that Republicans currently need.

While Congress bickers and stalls, conservatives in multiple states have been engaged in the honest, old-fashioned work of crafting good policy, educating the public, and implementing prudent reforms. Budgets are balanced, lives are transformed, and struggling communities find more grounds for hope. This is the picture of conservatism we should want Americans to see.

Ending The Real Rape Culture,"Despite the pretense of relativism or moral uncertainty among many Americans, there remain certain moral touchstones that few if any are uncertain about. One of these is that Hitler was evil. Using the Nazis as moral goalposts is so ubiquitous that the Internet has described the phenomenon as Godwin’s law: “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.”

Another of these moral touchstones is the fact that rape is about as heinous a crime as anyone is capable of committing. Before pronouncing judgment, cultural relativists do not first need to dialogue with other cultures which have condoned or even enjoined rape in certain circumstances. Nor do utilitarians first need to scientifically poll rapists and their victims about the relative amounts of pleasure and pain that they’ve experienced. Rape is simply wrong, and we all know it apart from our philosophies.

It is therefore curious that rape has become the topic of so much recent controversy. That controversy includes well-intentioned but intemperate surrendering to fears of rapists going without punishment and victims going without vindication. This is part of the motivation behind ongoing attempts to combat rape by revoking the rights of the accused—particularly on college campuses. While the goal is admirable, the means center around 1) facilitating accusations and punishments until their frequency matches the blatantly false claims of one in five college coeds being raped and 2) responding to failures to take accusers seriously by going to the opposite extreme of reflexively believing them.

The reason that the accused have rights is to protect against the severe harm that false accusations bring. It has yet to be demonstrated why rape is the one allegation for which the accused should be offered no such protection. It is not uncommon to hear claims that false accusations are practically non-existent, but there is no evidence this is actually true, and plenty of examples to the contrary.

Dehumanizing Sexual Consent

There is, however, a deeper reality behind the fervor to convict, the bogus statistics, and the guilty-until-proven-innocent mentalities. Nowadays, the idea of sexual violation is expressed entirely through the concept of “consent.” However, the ability of this single factor to exclusively undergird our concept of rape is complicated by attempts to divorce consent from every other facet of human experience.

Ambiguous situations are created when weak no’s are intermingled with words and actions that seem to say yes.

One of the most famous of these attempts is the “no means no” standard, which sought to more firmly establish a woman’s refusal. This standard is not without its problems, however. Though deliberate refusals are what they are and should be treated as such, the standard also promotes myopia when it comes to the tendencies of many women to be coy and of many men to be boldly persistent—complimentary character traits which facilitate romance and have many innocent incarnations.

It also leads to its fair share of absurdities, the most infamous of which is probably the one-free-grope policy feminists were forced into whilst defending some of President Clinton’s alleged dalliances. After all, who is to say that a sexually liberated woman isn’t allowed to enjoy the occasional unsolicited fondle? Surely men need fair warning to the contrary when their attempts to provide such services are unappreciated. The only important thing is that the men take no for an answer. Accordingly, this kind of standard not only divorces consent from male-female sexual complementarity, but also made a mockery of the crime of rape itself.

Another attempt to refine and purify consent can be found is Mary Adkins’ response to the suggestion that a woman’s resistance to the use of force play a role in the legal identification of rape. In it, the author suggests that such a standard is unfair because many women do not resist specifically because their relative lack of strength means they probably won’t prevail. In response to an advocate of the force requirement, she writes:

He wants that she should push back, require her rapist to show his full strength so she can accuse him later. Under Rubenfeld’s preferred definition for the law, she should dehumanize herself further for it to be considered a true act of rape (because, by definition, there is no force unless there is resistance). Despite the terrible, visceral knowledge that she is unlikely to win any physical match against him, she has to try and fail.

Her response is problematic. First, to describe physical resistance to rape as “dehumanizing” is surely unjust to those who actually have pushed back. Are they really less human for having done so? Though horrible, the red badges of courage earned by those who fought against their violation are surely worthy of more respect than that. Rather than dehumanizing, the character to resist evil even in the face of defeat is one of the bright spots of humanity.

More problematic from a legal perspective, however, is the presumption of violent intent on the part of the alleged rapist. Ambiguous situations are created when weak no’s are intermingled with words and actions that seem to say yes. A physical “no” cuts through that ambiguity and can just as easily result in an end to the encounter as it can in violence.

Refusing to give such a clear signal out of fear of a possible future outcome takes a great deal for granted. In many cases, all that is then left to identify a rape are the fears of the alleged victim and a handful of mixed messages. The attempt to cleanse consent from the need for a clear physical manifestation thereof makes it highly subjective. Such is hardly a sound basis on which to condemn someone for a heinous crime—particularly when maintaining a legal presumption of innocence.

Only A Special Yes Will Do

More comprehensive attempts to distill consent can be found in the recent pushes for affirmative consent laws. By feminist reckoning, the expectation of maintaining an ability and willingness to deliver a clear refusal places too heavy a burden on a woman’s sexuality, and so no-means-no must give way to only-yes-means-yes. But not just any “yes” will do. To adequately purify consent, the yes must meet a host of quality control standards.

By feminist reckoning, the expectation of maintaining an ability and willingness to deliver a clear refusal places too heavy a burden on a woman’s sexuality.

The “yes,” for example, must be ongoing. In California’s law, “Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time.” Furthermore, this revocation cannot depend on a no, but only on continued delivery of the yes, for the law also states, “Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.” The intent here is to divorce consent from any form of commitment.

Committing to marriage has long been considered too extreme a requirement to legitimate a sexual encounter. In turn, long-term relationships were also deemed too confining. Now, apparently even one-night-stands and hookups constrain the sexuality of a liberated woman beyond reason. It must be terminable at any time, for any reason, and without notice.

In other words, a consensual encounter can turn into rape between one thrust and the next without the “rapist” even knowing. Indeed, nothing in the law says that either partner need realize it at the time. If recognizing consent requires cold-sober analysis, then why not use the 20/20 hindsight provided by post-coital reflection? And when last night’s encounter leaves without buying breakfast, maybe that’s what it takes to realize that the consent wasn’t pure enough after all.

In some versions of affirmative consent, consent must be granted anew at each escalation of the encounter. But what counts as escalation? Are there now legally accepted definitions for first, second, and third base? Or perhaps such categories are too restrictive and even harder, deeper, or faster must count as escalation.

Two computers might negotiate data transfer by explicitly requesting and confirming each step in the process, but this is far removed from authentic sexuality.

Such criteria divorce consent even from human sexuality itself. Two computers might negotiate data transfer by explicitly requesting and confirming each step in the process, but this is far removed from authentic sexuality. Standards like this classify most sexual encounters as rape. They leave the matter of guilt or innocence almost entirely in the decision to prosecute rather than in the act itself. As Ashe Schow recently found, the proponents of affirmative consent laws are unable to offer any suggested means by which the accused could prove that consent was actually granted. Now, this may be precisely what feminism seeks—granting women arbitrary legal power over men—but it cannot be what any just society seeks.

Perhaps the most absurd attempt to distill consent comes from Valerie Tarico’s seasonal piece about how “rapey” Christmas is. The holiday revolves around God having His way with a young virgin’s womb—a violation second only to His unilateral creation of that womb in the first place without so much as a by-your-leave. I’m sure many Christian rape-apologists are ready to object that the virgin birth (by definition) involved no sexual intercourse in any sense or that Mary consented—she even sang a song about how wonderful it all was (which is perhaps unusual in rape situations.)

Although the first point is lost on Tarico, she does acknowledge the one about consent. Unfortunately, it doesn’t count because Mary’s consent was not pure enough. “Mary assents after being not asked but told by a powerful supernatural being what is going to happen to her.” Apparently even God Himself is not allowed to impugn on a woman’s consent by choosing her as integral part of mankind’s salvation, for this might sway her opinion on the matter. Much like the color-blind are incapable of distinguishing red from brown, feminists seem to possess a mental defect rendering them imperceptive of anything other than power and coercion when they encounter things like hierarchy, authority, and even godhood.

The Cost of Reducing Consent to Whim

In their attempts to purify consent from all contamination, feminists have inadvertently turned it into something else. A consent that may flit to and fro from moment to moment and which ought not be subject to any external influence or pressure is, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable from mere whim.

A consent that may flit to and fro from moment to moment and not be subject to any external influence is, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable from mere whim.

But is whim even something worthy of respect? When critiquing George Bernard Shaw’s worship of human volition in “Orthodoxy,” G. K. Chesterton observed, “You can praise an action by saying that it is calculated to bring pleasure or pain, to discover truth, or to save the soul. But you cannot praise an action because it shows will; for to say that is merely to say that it is an action. By this praise of will, you cannot really choose one course as better than another. And yet, choosing one course as better than another is the very definition of the will you are praising.” In other words, choice is not meaningful apart from judgment.

Now, respecting even poor choices is still a sensible concept, for we treasure the meaningful human capacity to choose better over worse. Whim, however, is a different animal altogether. It does not choose better or worse; it does not really choose at all. It is simply an arbitrary impulse. Choices have criteria, but a consent divorced from any other consideration necessarily has none.

Perhaps this explains the feminist complaint that while parents teach their daughters to avoid rape, they fail to teach their sons not to rape. I always found this puzzling; I was raised Lutheran, and Luther’s explanation of the fifth commandment included “do not hurt or harm your neighbor in his body” and of the sixth included “lead a chaste and decent life in word and deed,” both of which preclude rape. But Lutheran or not, most religious and irreligious traditions include some version of “do unto others…” or even “don’t be a jerk,” which also precludes rape. Only when consent is hermetically sealed from anything which might humanize it—when it is reduced into pure whim—can we fail to recognize such obvious instruction.

Yes, Sex Is Special

For that is not, by a long shot, all that rape is. Forcing oneself onto a woman against her will is one thing; having sex in a way that does not accommodate momentary whims is something else entirely. Accordingly, understanding rape solely in terms of dehumanized consent undermines the moral sensibilities upon which our ubiquitous condemnation of rape depends.

The only reason for considering rape a particularly heinous crime is because, unlike shirts, sexuality is something special and set apart.

Borrowing a roommate’s blouse without permission violates consent, but it is trivial. No feminists complain about a blouse-borrowing culture nor call to revoke due process for accused blouse-borrowers. The only reason for considering rape a particularly heinous crime is because, unlike shirts, sexuality is something special and set apart.

But if sex is something special and set apart, then it ought not be treated so casually at all. This brings us back to chastity—precisely the moral virtue that feminism’s myopic focus on consent is meant to bypass. Tarico, for example, tries to shame Christianity because the Bible “fails” to talk about her dehumanized understanding of consent. However, it talks about far higher and deeper concepts on which to understand the horror of rape: purity, chastity, fornication, propriety, carnal knowledge, and so forth.

For instance, the Bible talks about sex functionally making a couple “one flesh.” It doesn’t matter whether it is a husband with his wife or a prostitute with her john—sex does what sex does whether we use it rightly or not. Such an understanding provides one vantage point (among others) from which rape is clearly perceived as heinous, for establishing that kind of relationship against the will is abhorrent. Grievous wounds of this kind can be survived and overcome, but they are what they are and demand retribution. Rape based solely on whim does not trigger than kind of reaction in the human conscience.

There is no routine soul-smear by which movements of the will can be scientifically detected; we can only rely on one’s actions to express her will.

But doesn’t “without her consent” mean the same thing as “against her will?” It could, but not when consent is divorced from every other factor. There is no routine soul-smear by which movements of the will can be scientifically detected; we can only rely on one’s actions to express her will. The key question in determining beyond a reasonable doubt whether rape has been committed is therefore whether the accuser refused sex—in a more human sense than preferences regarding granular sexual mechanics.

Answering that question well will always be more complicated than seeing whether a “no” ever crossed her lips or whether a “yes” dutifully crossed them at every escalation. It requires looking at the nature of the existing relationship between the people involved, the characters of both accuser and accused, the nature of the refusal, evidence of resistance, and so forth. In short, it requires looking at all the very human aspects of sexuality that feminists seek to make off-limits.

‘Rape Culture’ Is just Unchaste Culture

It is clear that we have problem when women begin thinking that saying “no” is just not worth it. In the aforementioned article, Adkins gives the impression that saying no to an aggressive sexual advance is an almost extraordinary act of strength and bravery that most women cannot muster. So what do they do instead?

In order to avoid victimhood and maintain simple, victimless personhood, women can be extraordinarily, stunningly rational; we can rationalize away acts of violation simply because we don’t want them to have been real. Perhaps if I decide it didn’t happen, it didn’t; perhaps if I decide it doesn’t matter to me, it doesn’t.

Indeed, if whim is all that makes a rape, then avoiding rape is simply a matter of adjusting one’s whims. Think of it as “surprise sex,” and it’s not so bad anymore. The advocates of affirmative consent likewise seem to think that refusal is beyond the capability of too many women.

But whereas feminism inadvertently paints women as being too feeble to deliver a clear “no,” chastity empowers women to refuse by giving them a foundation greater than whim. Chastity highlights the higher values associated with sexuality and trains people to act accordingly in a way that whim never could. A chaste woman who knows the value of her sexuality can say no to a proposition with confidence. In contrast, a woman who dutifully goes to town when a stranger pushes her head towards his crotch at a party—who thinks refusal isn’t worth the potential trouble—has a shallow and impoverished understanding of her own sexuality.

Chastity offers women a protection that laws never can.

Chastity also offers women a protection that laws never can. Legal retribution must be available, but it is better to avoid the need for it in the first place. Much of the drive toward affirmative consent comes from the increasing prevalence of hard-to-prosecute situations such as drunken hookups in which participants were too intoxicated to adequately gauge consent. This is part-and-parcel of a dehumanized sexuality that operates on whim, but the chaste know better than to enter such situations in the first place.

The common rejoinder is that a woman should even be able to walk down the street naked without fear of rape, dress as provocatively as she wants without provoking an unwanted response, and even travel to unfamiliar city to sleep in a stranger’s bed without any sexual repercussions. However valid (or not) one may consider such arguments, trading away due process, the presumption of innocence, and even an understanding of the seriousness of rape to secure these privileges is a poor deal for women and society.

The chaste, in contrast, understand the value of propriety because they understand the higher values that propriety is meant to guard. To them, it is simply how one treats her sexuality with respect. None of this means that the wanton deserves to be raped—just that the wanton has already casually abandoned protections far better than any affirmative consent law could ever provide. Redundant protections can be good, but they aren’t always worth throwing the rest of society under the bus.

In contrast to popular rhetoric, if there was ever a “war on women,” it was carried out by those feminists who deemed chastity burdensome. Their myopic view of rape as the absence of a form of consent from which all trace of humanity has been boiled away does women no favors. There is no rape culture—there is only a culture in which the sexual revolution has so skewed our perspectives that undesirable gray areas like drunken hookups have become a matter of everyday life for some women. But expanding the scope of rape beyond all good sense is not a solution, for if “rape” truly describes everyday college life, then it simultaneously ceases to be a big deal in the public consciousness. If women feel sexually disadvantaged in contemporary America, their best bet for improving their position is to do the hard work of reclaiming the virtue of chastity.

America Needs To Stop Jailing So Many Non-Violent Offenders,"There’s a growing debate in America today about criminal-justice reform, and the best way to address non-violent, drug-related crimes. Unfortunately, nationwide our focus has centered more on growing our prison populations than on getting to the root cause of these crimes: addiction.

This has taken its toll in many ways, from the families that are torn apart when a loved one is sent to jail to the taxpayers who are left footing an ever-increasing bill for our criminal-justice systems.

But there is a better way. I am a firm believer that the states are laboratories of innovation—that, given the flexibility, they will implement policies that work most efficiently to address the needs of their citizens. And the criminal-justice debate is no different.

Consider the Texas Experience with Criminal-Justice Reform

I know this first-hand. You see, Texas was one of many states that spent billions locking up kids for minor offenses. In jail, these individuals learned how to become hardened criminals. Out of jail, they often repeated their crimes.

For many low-risk, non-violent offenders, incarceration is not the best solution, and can increase the odds that an individual will commit additional crimes after release.

The result was a significant fiscal burden on taxpayers and a segment of society shut out from hope and opportunity. And while arrests for violent and property offenses steadily declined throughout the 1990s, drug-related arrests increased by more than 60 percent.We knew we needed to do something, and do it quickly. That’s why, when John Creuzot, a Democratic judge from Dallas, shared an idea that would change the way we handled cases of first-time, non-violent drug offenders, I listened.

As the founder of one of the first drug courts in Texas, Creuzot argued that, for many low-risk, non-violent offenders, incarceration is not the best solution, and can increase the odds that an individual will commit additional crimes after release. Just as importantly, he emphasized that by treating addiction as a disease, rather than simply punishing the crimes it compels, we could give new hope to people trying to get their lives back.

His evidence was compelling. Recidivism in his program was 68 percent lower than other state courts, and every dollar he spent saved $9 in future costs. So in 2007, with broad support from Republicans and Democrats, Texas changed course.

Here’s What We Did that Worked

We expanded our commitment to drug courts that allow offenders to stay out of jail if they agreed to comprehensive supervision, drug testing, and treatment. We invested more in treatment and rehabilitation programs for drug addiction and mental illness, and shifted our focus to diversionary programs like community supervision. We reformed our approach to parole, imposing graduated sanctions for minor violations instead of immediate re-incarceration.

The results have been extraordinary. Texas’s crime rate has dropped to its lowest point since 1968.

We also implemented common-sense policies, such as allowing individuals to earn their way off probation through exemplary conduct and by achieving benchmarks, such as obtaining a degree. We passed legislation allowing nonviolent offenders to earn up to 20 percent of their terms by completing treatment and vocational programs proven to reduce recidivism.

The results have been extraordinary. Texas’s crime rate has dropped to its lowest point since 1968 and, during my tenure, Texas’ crime rate shrank by almost 24 percent. In fact, for the first time in state history, Texas is closing prisons without replacing them—three units since 2011. On top of that, this more efficient approach has saved Texas taxpayers $2 billion.

The Best Benefits Are Personal

But perhaps the most significant result is the countless individuals and families who are better off today because these Texans were given a chance to minimize the damage they had done to their lives. And for some people, a chance is all they really need.

With more than 4,500 crimes on the books and a federal prison system that has grown 750 percent since 1980, it is time for Washington to act.

We need more of this forward-thinking policy making around the country to continue to improve our criminal-justice system, which is why I have joined Right on Crime in the fight for criminal-justice reform.

Their focus on individual liberty, personal responsibility, transparency, and limited government is the foundation for the type of real, life-changing reform that benefits all Americans. By working with policy makers and conservative leaders in dozens of states to provide conservative solutions for their individual challenges, we all benefit.

These efficiencies don’t end at the state level. The smart policies in states like Texas, Georgia, and Mississippi can also have a significant impact on the federal criminal-justice system. With more than 4,500 crimes on the books and a federal prison system that has grown 750 percent since 1980, it is time for Washington to act.

Right on Crime is on the forefront of defining what it means to be smart on criminal justice. I look forward to working with them to make America freer, safer, and truer to our core values of limited government and personal responsibility.

Can Gays And Christians Coexist In America? Part V,"In parts I, II, III, and IV of this essay, I examined the problem: why Christians face increasing demands to accept same-sex marriage and homosexual sex not as voluntary conduct but as essential components of personal identity, and why the nature of Christian theology would require Christians to renounce their own faith identities to do so. In this final part, I look at the prospects for a solution or, at any rate, an armistice.

As I noted at the outset of part I of this series, we do not live in a live-and-let-live society; we live, increasingly, in one in which organized pressure campaigns and administrative and legal proceedings are brought to bear on people who take a traditional religious approach to same-sex relationships. As I noted in parts III and IV, the root cause of that conflict is the insistence on modeling the “gay rights” battles after the litigation strategy used against Jim Crow. You could cite examples all day of how this leads to aggressive efforts to force religious believers to renounce their own consciences:

The New Mexico Human Rights Commission prosecuted a photographer for declining to photograph a same-sex ‘commitment ceremony.’ Doctors in California were successfully sued for declining to perform an artificial insemination on a woman in a same-sex relationship. Owners of a bed and breakfast in Illinois who declined to rent their facility for a same-sex civil union ceremony and reception were sued for violating the state nondiscrimination law. A Georgia counselor was fired after she referred someone in a same-sex relationship to another counselor….

This is to say nothing of more radical efforts on the Left to seek more fundamental changes to the institution of marriage, by severing its link to children and redefining its rules about monogamy, or viewing marriage itself as a form of inequality that privileges the married over the unmarried. Such efforts may seem a longer shot right now, but we know they will never lack for media, academic, and entertainment friends eager to “mainstream” them.

Outside the United States, with its residual constitutional protections for speech and religion, the situation is even grimmer, ranging from a U.K. lawsuit to force churches to perform same-sex weddings to a Canadian “hate speech” case against a Christian pamphleteer, which ended with the Supreme Court of Canada ruling against the pamphleteer, albeit while beating back efforts to deem Biblical quotations themselves to be “hate speech.”

But while powerful forces already in motion lead us further into conflict, it does not need to be our inevitable and permanent condition.

Christianity Birthed the Ideas of Religious and Political Tolerance

At this point, it is useful to step back and review the historical roots of the Western ideas of Christian liberty and religious tolerance. At its origin, Christianity began as a minority religion, persecuted by the Roman and Jewish authorities. Jesus, unlike the earthly founders of some other world religions, never sought civil or military authority, and was ultimately put to death by the government. He insisted at all times that his kingdom was of heaven, and not of this world. He essentially invented the concept of separation of church and state by the injunction, radical in its time, that his followers pay to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s. His only direct teachings on government were against corruption and abuse of power by tax collectors and soldiers who used their positions to extort money from subjects under their thumb.

While all legitimate Christian morality derives from God, all legitimate civil law must rest on a foundation of popular consent.

The rest of the New Testament is not much more engaged on the topic, although Paul and the other apostles did devote a lot of attention to guiding how the new community of Christian believers should live. As discussed in part II, while Christianity’s individual moral teachings are mostly quite clear, this has left a lot of room for contention and criticism over Christianity’s role in shaping society as a whole.

The distinction between the City of God and the City of Man was developed at much greater length by St. Augustine of Hippo, the great North African Catholic philosopher. Augustine wrote in the early fifth century when the church had gained control of much civil authority only to see it disintegrating under barbarian invasion. It remains a wise distinction today: Christian moral philosophy can and should inform the governing authorities (as it has always done in Western society in general and America in particular), because it is wise and just and humane, and because, in the real world, the faith of the governed is always relevant to self-government.

But ultimately, while all legitimate Christian morality—including the natural-law basis of our individual rights—derives from God, all legitimate civil law must rest on a foundation of popular consent. We should be under no illusion that the two will always be in harmony, but when they come directly into conflict, terrible things can happen.

In Search of a Westphalian Peace

Following the Protestant Reformation in the early sixteenth century, Europe erupted in religious wars; not for the first time, but surely the bloodiest. Christians, by then ensconced in civil authority and accustomed to civil power (and sometimes its corruptions), sought by the sword to stamp out what Catholics regarded as heresy and Protestants regarded as fundamental corruption within the Catholic Church. The carnage reached its apogee in the Thirty Years’ War of 1618-48, which by some estimates killed anywhere from a quarter to 40 percent of the population of what would later be Germany and set back its political development by two centuries.

The Christian nation-states of Europe agreed amongst themselves to accept different religious doctrines and to cease going to war in order to change them.

The war ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia. While many aspects of the Westphalian order would be crucial to European and world history, the important point for the history of religious pluralism is that the Christian nation-states of Europe agreed amongst themselves to accept different religious doctrines and to cease going to war in order to change them. Issues of sectarian tolerance would be localized to within states, rather than being the main driving force in cross-border wars among them.

It would take time for that principle to trickle down to pluralism within a nation’s population. The next few decades would see nations like England and France turn the screws on their religious minorities (the British Isles would be convulsed with religious strife, and the persecution of Catholics in particular, for most of the seventeenth century). Moreover, the Westphalian settlement was never accepted by Europe’s Muslim neighbors, and mostly was not applied to them by the powers of Christendom, either. But the core principle—we are willing to live with the reality that some of our neighbors do not share our view of the deepest truths—led in the fullness of time to a better, more stable accommodation of sectarian differences.

Eventually, the idea of religious freedom within a state would find its greatest flowering in our own country, which was originally colonized by people far more urgently concerned with religious liberty than with, say, democracy, free speech, or free markets. Contrary to what twenty-first-century liberal-progressives would have you believe, neither the original colonists nor the Founding Fathers were strict devotees of a separation of church and state.

The Pilgrims, to pick the most obvious example, came to America mainly so they could find establish their own community with their own religion as its organizing principle. At the time the First Amendment was written, several states still had their own established state churches, and the Establishment Clause was written as much as anything to protect them from being supplanted by a federal established church. Even in later years, as the states abandoned established churches, groups ranging from the Mormons to the Amish to the Hasidim have worked to create communities in which they could set the dominant governing tone reflecting their own principles. This, too, is a form of religious freedom.

The Crucial Principle Is Accepting Differences

But the old Westphalian settlement, as refined by American practice, always demanded that every religious group accept that the existence of the others. Vibrant religious communities could exist in a pluralistic society so long as they did not see one another’s insistence on practicing their own faith as an affront to themselves. Distinct communities with distinct values could coexist so long as they all accepted a baseline of pluralism. The more government and its inherently value-embodying rules were set at the local level, the easier this settlement was to sustain. The Peace of Westphalia could never have existed in the Roman Empire, or even the modern European Union.

Distinct communities with distinct values could coexist so long as they all accepted a baseline of pluralism.

We are in danger of losing that settlement in America today, as illustrated both by the furious reaction to the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision and by the rhetoric deployed in fights over religious liberty in the LGBT-rights context, to the point where the liberal and progressive writers rarely mention religious liberty without scare quotes, and the president for years now has pointedly talked about “freedom of worship” instead of the more robust freedom to practice faith. The governor of Utah even faced an uproar over the seemingly uncontroversial view that state executives should defend and enforce their own states’ laws.

Given the tendency in some corners to regard the existence of traditional, orthodox Christianity as an affront that must be stamped out via boycotts and public and legal pressure, the old Westphalian settlement is more endangered now than it has ever been. The activists who relish the prospect of this conflict are certain they can win, but as the Thirty Years War illustrated, such conflicts often produce no winners. But if good fences are needed to make good neighbors, where to build the fence? Where does it all stop?

Is There A Way Forward?

In war—and all political and legal conflict is war by other means—the easiest way to prop up the morale of your opponents once their defeat becomes obvious and inevitable is to convince them that there is no safe way to surrender. To choose the ugliest example, some of the bloodiest and bitterest fighting of the European theater of World War II was in the final weeks of the Eastern Front, culminating in the Battle of Berlin.

The easiest way to prop up the morale of your opponents once their defeat becomes inevitable is to convince them that there is no safe way to surrender.

The German Army, without hope of victory or truce, fought with desperate, cornered ferocity because hundreds of thousands of German civilians were evacuating behind its line of retreat, and because the victorious Soviet Red Army was utterly merciless in its advance, reaping revenge for extensive prior German atrocities with a vast campaign of rape and savagery. There was no upside in a soft retreat before such an advance, even if Germany had been ruled by a less psychotic regime in spring 1945. (Most political battles aren’t waged between Hitler and Stalin, but the lesson applies in any conflict).

It is, by now, inevitable that same-sex marriage will be the law of most if not all states in the United States, and recognized nationally by the federal government. The political opposition to same-sex marriage has been collapsing in the past three to five years, and is now sustained primarily by fear that Christian opponents have not been offered any way in which to protect their own competing interests.

At this point, the chief obstacle to conservative acquiescence in same-sex marriage, however grudging, is a very well-founded fear that there is no stopping point—that today’s concession of the legal legitimacy of same-sex marriage will be taken as an invitation for tomorrow’s invasion of any remaining preserve of conscience in which people can reserve their own dissent. The florid rage of Democrats and liberal-progressives over the Supreme Court’s comparatively modest and narrow Hobby Lobby decision just drives home how emboldened the opposition has become to any safe haven for Christian conscience in any walk of life. It also reminds us how little regard the active parts of the Democratic Party have for the notion that Christian beliefs are worthy of being treated by the government and society as legitimate and real, as opposed to superstitious, backwards, and pretextual.

Defending the First Amendment

Behind the facade of a flurry of defensive activity, weariness with this topic is everywhere among Christians and conservatives. One of the iron laws of political gravity is that, if you’re not on offense, you will just keep losing ground until you have nothing remaining to lose, and thus we see conservative Christians filing religious-liberty lawsuits and proposing religious-liberty legislation.

Defenders of religious liberty have allowed themselves to be divided, isolated, and defeated in detail by smaller but more cohesive, angrier adversaries who have consistently dictated the time and terms of engagement.

These are indeed necessary steps, and they will succeed only if we have the courage of our convictions not only to propose them but to defend them with the same unashamed zeal as the opponents of religious liberty. That has not been in evidence: governors like Mike Pence, Jan Brewer, Nathan Deal, Asa Hutchinson, and Pat McCrory, who are in principle supportive of the idea, have either lacked the courage to follow through on religious-liberty protections or lacked a strategy to plainly and openly defend them against what are now predictable organized pressure campaigns by social activists and their allies in large corporations.

Defenders of religious liberty have allowed themselves to be divided, isolated, and defeated in detail by smaller but more cohesive, angrier adversaries who have consistently dictated the time and terms of engagement. But boycotts collapse when they have to be applied to too many targets at once. If proponents of liberty band together in these fights like the slaves at the end of Spartacus, they will do just fine (of course, the slaves got crucified together, and that is always a possible outcome—but then, the Romans were no ordinary adversary).

But offense is just a tactic; the end goal must be a stable, Westphalian line of armistice. If there is a way forward, if it is possible for Christians to be tolerated in twenty-first-century America rather than treated like bitter-ender opponents of desegregation, it will only be found if supporters of same-sex marriage decide at some point that things have gone far enough, should not go much further, and that the time for conciliation and compromise has come.

The impetus for this will never come from the zealots, but it is possible that it will emerge from the broader mass of voters who have followed them in recent years, and it will likely become visible only in retrospect from election returns, and from the actions of nominally apolitical institutions. The fact that the outcome is mostly out of Christian hands does not mean there is nothing we can do. An affirmative agenda for compromise means demanding respect and protection for religious liberty, but it also requires offering something in return.

What would that something look like? One element, of course, is for Christians, conservatives, and Republicans to demonstrate a greater personal ease with gay Americans, as people. As frustrated as we may get with the flagrantly one-sided nature of the public, media debate, we need to be happy warriors, keeping our calm and our cool and showing with deeds, not just words, that our disagreements on matters of deep principle do not prevent us from treating others with the love and respect that the Gospel demands of us. That’s not always easy in an emotional political fight; we have to work at it, and we must.

Hate the Crime

On a concrete political level, there are two particular areas in which ideological combat has obscured the potential for bridge-building common ground. One of these is hate crimes. Violence may not be a day-to-day threat for most gay Americans, but anyone who has been—or seen a loved one be—on the receiving end of violence can testify to the outsize impact it has.

Hate crimes are disproportionately harmful for exactly the same reason terrorism is: targeting strangers for violence out of the blue over an animus or a cause sends a message of terror

While sensational stories like the Matthew Shepard case tend to turn out to be more myth than reality, hate crimes against homosexuals (especially gay men) are a real thing, and cracking down on violence to ensure that all enjoy the equal protection of the laws is the first duty of government. Much of that can be done simply by executive enforcement priorities at the local, state and occasionally federal prosecutor level, and by raising law enforcement awareness, but legislation can at times be an appropriate tool as well.

Some conservatives instinctively dislike “hate crimes” laws for two related reasons. First, they risk creating “thought crimes” that punish motive, rather than punishing the same violent act the same way. I used to be more sympathetic to this view pre-9/11, but the reality is that hate crimes are disproportionately harmful for exactly the same reason terrorism is: targeting strangers for violence out of the blue over an animus or a cause sends a message of terror to anyone who could envision the same thing happening to them.

The “thought crime” aspect can be resolved by the simple expedient of writing such laws to punish, not “hate” as a motive, but rather crimes whose objective circumstances look to a reasonable observer like a hate crime. After all, the harm caused by a gay-bashing attack is done by the public act of, say, yelling slurs while jumping a guy outside a gay bar, not by the private act of what the attacker may have read in books or on the Internet.

Second, hate-crimes laws are criticized for creating unequal “protected classes” of crime victims. But like the thought-crimes problem, this is mainly the fault of poor drafting of such laws (which encourages their uneven application) rather than an inherent flaw. Rather than enumerate a series of exclusive categories, it’s entirely proper to cover all forms of hate crime that appear to an objective observer to have resulted from selecting a victim based on some observable or perceived characteristic rather than due to financial or sexual motives, escalation of a pre-existing or personal conflict, etc.

Freedom to Work

Another area where common ground is possible, but harder to forge, is employment discrimination. Again, at a general level, the majority of Christians and the majority of conservatives and Republicans would all agree that gay people should not face discrimination in finding work, due either to their orientation itself or due to disapproval of their sexual choices and relationships.

Outside of government, Christians can help alleviate that with a mindset of inclusion, even at some risk to ourselves of the potential for hiring someone who might end up setting the machinery of the law against us—something people are less likely to do to a boss who treats them with respect and decency.

The problem of translating the non-discrimination principle into legislation is threefold, but again, none should be insurmountable if there exists anyone with whom good-faith compromise is possible. First is the slippery-slope problem: many conservatives fear that enshrining sexual orientation next to race and gender in the law’s list of protected categories for one purpose will encourage the courts to treat it the same way for all purposes, even when there are rational distinctions to be drawn. This is where our experience with the Seven Stages of Liberal Legal Activism become a factor:

It’s a free country, X should not be illegal. The Constitution prohibits X from being made illegal. If the Constitution protects a right to X, how can it be immoral? Anyone who disagrees is a bigot. If X is a constitutional right, how can we deny it to the poor? Taxpayer money must be given to people to get X. The Constitution requires that taxpayer money be given to people to get X. People who refuse to participate in X are criminals. People who publicly disagree with X are criminals.

In the words of Dune’s Muad’Dib: “When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.” Given the frequency with which the Seven Stages have been deployed by liberal-progressives over the years, it is the wisdom of experience never to believe the sincerity of any liberal-progressive promises of a stopping point or a limiting principle, and that mistrust makes compromise difficult.

But it’s also a reason to act now to enshrine a middle ground in legislation rather than trust in the courts. The biggest-ticket question of all—marriage—is a horse that may have left the barn by the end of this month. The goal for Christians and other faithful now must be to drain the momentum of the activists by picking more defensible terrain and winning over their less-committed allies—a time-tested defensive strategy in politics as in war.

Second and relatedly is the fact that our anti-discrimination laws, especially in employment, are already dysfunctional, burdensome, and the cause of too much federal overreach, too much unwarranted litigation, and too much litigation-avoidance behavior. This is why even some supporters of same-sex marriage are skeptical about the federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act. But Republicans in Congress and the states, in many cases elected with the support of Christians and other religious people, have a governing majority now and should act like one. New anti-discrimination laws don’t need to repeat the mistakes of the old ones, but can instead be written as a model for reform.

It is the wisdom of experience never to believe the sincerity of any liberal-progressive promises of a stopping point or a limiting principle, and that mistrust makes compromise difficult.

The third problem is the direct, practical one, also a challenge of creative drafting but a hill worth dying on for those who oppose having the courts dictate everything: coming up with legislative ways to distinguish (or more carefully guide courts in distinguishing) between situations of improper discrimination (e.g., denying a gay person a job as an accountant) and situations in which religious interests should legitimately take precedence (e.g., a Christian school exercising the right to decide it would cross the line into scandal to employ a teacher who is openly in a same-sex marriage, or indeed who openly dissents from church teachings).

This kind of line-drawing is what we pay legislators to do, and not so far in the past, it was a bipartisan occupation. The 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act at issue in Hobby Lobby was largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer and signed into law by Bill Clinton. In fact, the recently written state RFRA laws have made some efforts at doing this. Again, the biggest obstacle to compromise is that proponents of such bills need to speak up for their virtues without embarrassment if they want to give opponents a political downside for obstructing them.

Stop the Quacks

An example of a smaller issue on which there also ought to be a sensible middle ground is “gay conversion therapy.” On the one hand, the various quasi-medical efforts to “convert” gay people into having heterosexual desires are dominated by quackery, and state medical establishments should have a free hand in prohibiting them from passing themselves off as any sort of legitimate scientific or medical discipline, including by banning licensed doctors from participating. (The same should be done for the same reasons to “gender-reassignment” surgeries; that day will come in time, but don’t hold your breath on empirical science winning that battle over ideology in the near term).

The various quasi-medical efforts to ‘convert’ gay people into having heterosexual desires are dominated by quackery.

I don’t exclude the possibility that some people might in some cases be able to alter their sexual desires (human willpower and self-control are variable and not always well-understood; thus, if it is possible for some people to do an extraordinary and difficult thing, this does not prove that it is possible for all people; likewise, if some people cannot do a thing, this does not prove that nobody can), but there’s no scientific evidence that this can be done commonly or reliably.

On the other hand, gay Christians in particular should remain free to choose less formal forms of therapy—whether or not those are faith-based or contain some elements drawn from psychology or psychiatry—without the state stepping in to ban it.

Global Persecution

There should also be common ground on the persecution of homosexuals, which – like persecution of Christians – is open and bloody in many parts of the world. Some of that comes from more or less Christian jurisdictions like Uganda and Putin’s Russia. Much of the worst comes from the Muslim world, especially theocratic fanatics like ISIS, who are in the habit of stoning gays to death or tossing them off towers. Working together to protest the worst atrocities is a good way for Christians and gays to be reminded of the areas where their values and interests can overlap.

Extend Charity

Finally, there are many situations in which gay people, especially refugees and gay youths, are in need of charitable assistance, and not just monetary—teen runaways, asylum seekers, etc. Common efforts to provide charity may be hard to organize, because both Christians and secular gays are inclined to see people in soul-aching trouble as proper targets for the most well-intentioned sorts of proselytizing, and that means direct conflict. But Christians have long experience with interfaith relief efforts that skirt these sorts of fundamental conflicts, and can be creative here as well in meeting immediate needs for shelter and a welcome embrace.

There are many situations in which gay people, especially refugees and gay youths, are in need of charitable assistance, and not just monetary.

This is not an exhaustive list, and of course peaceful coexistence is easier with political allies, so gay Republicans and conservatives, and the dwindling minority of Christian liberals, also have a role to play in de-escalating the tendency to seek unconditional surrender rather than preserving space for liberty, dissent, and free exchange of ideas.

The likely friends of freedom also need to be of more help in standing up for a live-and-let-live ethos that gives breathing space to free exercise of religion. Many libertarians have tended, unfortunately, to retreat to slogans about getting the government out of marriage entirely, a stance that is 1) totally unrealistic, especially given the government role in divorce and child custody, and 2) further proof that same-sex marriage produces momentum for changes in government, law, and society that reduce the status of marriage generally.

Worse yet, many libertarians have chosen the side of big government on LGBT issues, rather than the side of protecting religious liberty. The more pro-SSM libertarians stand up for religious liberty, the more they can contribute to a broader social acceptance of liberty as a force for social peace.

Create Demilitarized Zones

Working together on common ground is a good first step to the two sides humanizing each other and learning the habits of compromise. But the final piece of the puzzle of armistice and coexistence is the need to demobilize the institutions that have been engaged in LGBT causes: Hollywood, the universities, media and entertainment companies like Disney/ESPN, and other big corporations. So long as those various entities are run and staffed by people who see Christians only in caricature and see LGBT causes through the prism of Jim Crow, conflict will never end.

So long as institutions are run and staffed by people who see Christians only in caricature and see LGBT causes through the prism of Jim Crow, conflict will never end.

Corporate pressure has been especially prominent in the recent culture wars on these issues. It was pressure from Guinness that made the biggest difference in the New York St. Patrick’s Day Parade controversy. Ditto Disney and the Boy Scouts, or a long list of corporations in the Indiana and Arkansas religious liberty fights.

It will be hard for Christians working in big companies to speak up in favor of religious liberty and against one-sided cultural and ideological activism; one of the leading lights of my profession was essentially driven out of his firm for representing the House of Representatives in defense of a federal law on this topic. That will take courage, but at some point, the Long March of progressive culture warriors can’t simply be conceded if we are ever to have a stable peace and broader cultural respect for the values of free expression and independent conscience rather than groupthink.

I think—I hope—that penning this essay is my own little contribution to that process; I would be a poor representative of my Biblical namesake if I didn’t try.

The Obstacles to Peace

All of these efforts may be helpful, or they may come to naught. One obstacle to any effort towards peaceful co-existence, as I noted in parts III and IV, is the momentum generated by seeking a resolution in the courts. If we were dealing solely with a democratic movement to rewrite the law premised on a weighing of society’s changing values—such as the recent referendum on marriage laws in Ireland—there might be no need to have this conversation.

Democrats no longer have any incentive to seek anything but constant, zero-sum conflict on these issues.

It is yet possible that the Supreme Court will more or less admit in its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that it is simply making a value-driven policy decision that should have no other precedential effects, but that is not normally how the court works (even in Bush v. Gore, when the Supreme Court attempted to limit the decision to its facts in light of the haste of its decision and its grounding in stopping a runaway state court, the underlying principles took on a life of their own in subsequent election law cases). So the inertial force of litigation will likely make it hard to stop what has been set in motion.

Another obstacle is the Democratic Party. Even as recently as 2006, the Democrats as an institution were interested in persuading culturally moderate voters by appeals to broad-based issues of governance like economics and foreign policy. But the Obama era has thoroughly re-oriented the party around culture war as a tool for motivating young, liberally-inclined voters with little knowledge or interest in other issues.

In the past few years, the declining salience of the Iraq War has elevated LGBT issues to the party’s number one cultural wedge-issue priority (if you don’t believe me, spend a few days reading their fundraising emails). As a result, the Democrats no longer have any incentive to seek anything but constant, zero-sum conflict on these issues. So a Westphalian peace will, if it is to succeed, need to be imposed over the objections of one of the two major political parties. That, too, is an obstacle not easily removed, but like the Obama strategy itself, it will last only so long as it is seen as electorally successful.

The Time We Are Given

‘I wish it need not have happened in my time,’ said Frodo.

‘So do I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.’

Many Christians today would doubtless rather live in less turbulent and trying times for the faith. For the moment, the number of young American atheists and agnostics is growing, and they are aggressive with the zeal of the new convert in preaching their creed and seeking to establish it in the law and the culture. It is unsurprising, though still deeply sad, that gay people disproportionately belong to their ranks, exacerbating our cultural divide in ways that even America’s epic battles over race never had to bridge. This is particularly difficult for gay Christians (especially those who choose a celibate life), who may find themselves doubly isolated.

But Christians have faced, and continue to face to this day around the world, far worse fates for their faith than yet exist in America. If we are to keep this country that way for our children, we can best do so by standing openly and forthrightly for our faith; by treating all our neighbors with individual love and respect; by seeking common ground; and by having hope, even in the face of rational counsels of despair. We can only do our best to see to it that the lights of faith, hope, charity, reason, family, and liberty will endure.

Gun Control: The Killer’s Best Friend,"Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez is suspected of murdering four unarmed Marines in Chattanooga and wounding others. As I write this, we still don’t know how Abdulazeez obtained his gun or what his motivations were—though, we can take an educated guess on the latter. What we do know is that Abdulazeez shot his victims in a “gun-free zone,” which is a useful illustration of the absurdity of gun-control laws: we constrain conscientious Americans but offer free rein to killers. In this case, even our best trained warriors were helpless.

Surely, we are in for a new round of emotional pleas for more gun-control laws. And, helpfully, in this week’s Newsweek cover story by Kurt Eichenwald we already have a compendium of muddled and misleading anti-Second Amendment talking points that dominate the Left these days.

The confusion begins with headline, which is based on an absurd premise, and bleeds into the lead:

Let’s start with an undeniable truth: In the United States, the people have the right to keep and bear arms. And let’s then acknowledge that the childish interpretation of that constitutional amendment—that Americans have the right to whatever accessory they can put on, in or over a gun for the sole purpose of making it more deadly—is a dangerous falsehood.

First off, can you imagine a pro-Second Amendment writer being offered space in a major publication to begin a piece (I’m not sure if this is a column, article, or a feature at Newsweek) like so:

Let’s start with an undeniable truth: In the United States, the people have the right to keep and bear arms. And let’s then acknowledge that this judicious interpretation of a constitutional amendment—that Americans have the right to individual freedom, to protect themselves and their family from bodily harm, and the right to stand up against abuse of tyrants, if necessary—is a beautiful truth.

But beyond the palpable bias, what’s he talking about? Eichenwald builds his entire bloodcurdling narrative around the notion that no limitations to the Second Amendment exist; which is, of course, absurd. What American anywhere has the freedom to put “whatever accessory” they want, in or over a gun, for the sole purpose of making it more deadly? Not one.

We limit other constitutional rights, he says. Newspapers, for instance, can stay in business “thanks to the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech,” but yet they cannot print child pornography. Which is true. Because in the United States has laws that protect children from coercion and physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, not ones that target the First Amendment. In the same way, we have federal and state law prohibiting people under 18 from possessing handguns or handgun ammunition or being sold handguns. As there will always be criminals who abuse children, there will always be irresponsible gun owners.

Interspersed throughout the piece, which has almost nothing to do with accessories, Eichenwald offers numerous well-worn laments about America’s overindulgence in these useless freedoms. He intermittently drops examples of scary activity (a twit at Wal-Mart walking around with a loaded shotgun, etc.), events that might aggravate his sensibilities and play on the urban fears, but have nothing to do with perpetuating violence.

For good measure, Eichenwald throws in rampages that no gun-control law would have prevented, short of confiscation.

We need more background checks because of Dylann Roof even if we already have background checks that should have stopped Dylann Roof, he argues. Until July 20, 2012, he writes, James Holmes was what “the NRA would describe as a responsible gun owner.” Well, then I guess Eichenwald every “responsible gun owner” should treated as a budding homicidal maniac. And every American who seeks psychiatric help in his life must now beg a judge to give him back his constitutional rights.

If you worry about this sort of thing, Eichenwald informs us you’re paranoid about the intentions of people like him. When I say people like him, I mean people who write pieces titled, “Let’s Repeal the Second Amendment.”

But, then again, Eichenwald argues—and he does it all the time on this issue—in bad faith. “Unfortunately,” he writes, “the NRA has been working for years to make sure lunatics and felons can obtain guns as easily as possible.”

Yo u can believe the NRA is misguided. You can believe the NRA’s positions manifest in terrible realities. But does anyone other than the most zealous gun-grabbing activist believe that the National Rifle Association intentionally wants lunatics to have guns so that they can kill people? Seems pretty obvious that, at the very least, such outcomes hurt the organization and its cause.

Oh, the accessories. Well, Eichenwald is concerned about high-capacity magazines and silencers. “There is no reason anyone outside of law enforcement or the military needs one except to kill people without attracting attention,” he says about silencers. Who decides what gun owners “need” and don’t? Eichenwald? Ten states already ban silencers and, for those that don’t, buying one requires a photo and fingerprints, and a $200 “tax.”

According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, civilian sales of silencers spiked 37 percent in 2013— to 500,000 from 360,000 in 2012 and 285,000 in 2011. Yet, in this world of unfettered world of gun ownership, there is a 30-year mandatory sentence for the use of a silencer in the act of a violent crime. Do you know how many silencers were used in the commission of a violent crime in 2013? I don’t. No one is keeping track, as far as I can tell. Probably because there are too few to care.

On the issue of high-capacity magazines, here my colleague Sean Davis not long ago:

Just like gun bans serve only to prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves, high capacity magazine bans put lawful gun carriers at a distinct disadvantage against well-armed assailants. As a result, it’s really not all surprising that Colorado, which twice voted for Barack Obama, voted to oust the Democratic state Senate president who pushed through that state’s mag ban.

If Americans adhere to magazine limits, they’ll have to pray that criminals do, as well.

What gun-control advocates fail to explain are two things: How their proposed laws would stop rampages? Why there are more guns but less gun crime? Despite the proliferation of guns, firearm crime has fallen precipitously over the past few decades—49 percent, according to Pew. And though permits for concealed-carry handguns have risen by 178 percent in the last eight years, murder rates have dropped, according to Crime Prevention Research Center.

Yet, every time there is a shooting, we act like gun violence is soaring, rather than focusing on the problem of mental illness, or domestic terrorism, or whatever it is that drives these people to murder. Instead, we have pundits who have an aversion to the Second Amendment plunge us into a pointless political squabble over ideas that would do nothing more than restrict access to guns for law-abiding citizens.

Libertarians Need Not Support The Confederacy,"Philip Magness authored an article in Newsweek entitled, “What Should Libertarians Think About the Civil War?” He claims the two “common interpretations” of the Civil War—libertarian support for the North or for the South—“stand out as particularly problematic.” He suggests that libertarians adopt two propositions, instead: “One needn’t be for the Union to be against slavery,” and “One needn’t be for the Confederacy to object to the North’s prosecution of the war.”

It is true that one need not support the Union to be against slavery and that one need not support Confederate states to object to war crimes—ask any non-American. Magness generalizes the moral considerations—slavery, war crimes, etc.—out from their historic context to avoid any “problematic” interpretation of who was right. In effect, his argument leaves the reader thinking nothing about the Civil War.

To accomplish this generalization, Magness completely conflates two ancient doctrines of warfare: jus ad bellum (justice in going to war), and jus in bello (justice in the conduct of warfare). However, the justification for war is distinct from the justifications for various acts of war. Some argue, for example, that “World War II was just, but Truman unjustly dropped the bomb.”

Neither Case Against the North Is Strong

When broken down, the jus ad bellum case against the North is objectively weak, and the jus in bello case against the North is not nearly as strong as Magness makes it out to be. To briefly address the jus ad bellum question, the case for the North is within libertarian philosophy. Southerners attacked a northern fort, and several million people lived in bondage in the Southern states in violation of the few universal laws of nature.

To be sure, the North let its generals perform what would today be called war crimes, and that is morally repugnant. Yet, the South’s actions were hardly better.

Regarding jus in bello, Magness considers the issues with libertarian moral philosophy in terms of supporting the North: “its indulgences in unrestricted warfare, suspension of civil liberties, centralization of power, or any of the other charges often made against the Union’s wartime cause or its outcome.” To be sure, the North let its generals perform what would today be called war crimes, and that is morally repugnant.

Yet, the South’s actions were hardly better—Camp Sumter, the Fort Pillow massacre, the Shelton Laurel massacre, and the Centralia massacre are just a few examples of the South’s violations of the customary laws of war. Reprisals and abuses were common on both sides; the jus in bello case is largely a wash on this issue.

Magness touches on the “suspension of civil liberties,” yet the only civil liberty he mentions in discussing the North is President Lincoln’s 1861 habeas corpus suspension. In any event, Congress ratified both this and a subsequent suspension in 1863, curing any constitutional defect. Any arguable jus in bello defect here is negligible. Moreover, the South denied the habeas corpus rights—and many other rights—of its millions of slaves for the entire war.

The South Used States’ Rights as a Façade

Magness also discusses the “centralization of power,” or the “dramatic weakening of the constitutional federalism laid out in 1787.” Leaving aside the “dramatic weakening” that Southern officials accomplished by seceding, this claim touches on two issues: federal power and states’ rights. Federalism changed, and federal power expanded once the Civil War Amendments were passed—but in a libertarian direction.

Libertarians cannot ignore the reality that their philosophy implicates: The South was wrong to wage war.

Finally, individuals could appeal to the federal government for protection against their own state’s abuses—against “grassroots tyranny,” as Clint Bolick has put it. The attack on civil liberties and state power that libertarians should worry about began in the Progressive Era, was constitutionalized by the New Deal Court, and continues to this day.

Moreover, as discussed in an article Jared Meyer (no relation) and I published in The Federalist, Northerners were the actual defenders of states’ rights. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 impressed northern citizens into southern slave-catching gangs. The Southern response to Northern assertions of states’ rights was to dispatch federal marshals and to enforce the offensive federal law against objecting states. The “state right” that the Confederacy was defending was that of its citizens to reclaim human “property” that fled the state.

When it comes to taking a moral view of the Civil War, libertarians cannot, with real intellectual force, argue that the North loses the jus ad bellum moral case. One can condemn the unjust actions of individuals like Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman or Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Conflating injustice in carrying out the conflict with justice in entering the conflict gives growing room to veiled southern apologia. Libertarians cannot ignore the reality that their philosophy implicates: The South was wrong to wage war.

How Close Was Donald Trump To The Mob?,"Donald Trump is running for president. Many believed or hoped that the Donald’s latest foray into national politics was nothing more than a public-relations move, not a serious attempt to reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

But now that Trump holds the lead in national polls, as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, it’s time to take his campaign seriously. Media outlets like Huffington Post and the Wall Street Journal, which are covering Trump’s run as an entertainment story, not a news story, are making a mistake. If Trump wants to be a serious candidate for president, and has the numbers to back it up, he must be vetted like a serious candidate for president. A good place to start is to take a hard look at Trump’s ties to Philadelphia and New York organized-crime families.

Donald Trump’s Connections to Organized Crime

Trump was building his eponymous empire of hotels, casinos, and high rises in the early 1980s in New York City and Atlantic City. In both places, the construction industry was firmly under the thumb of the mafia. And in both places there are literally concrete connections between La Cosa Nostra and Trump’s lavish projects. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, who has covered Trump for decades, has written a very useful list of questions for Trump. Many focus on his ties to the mob. In addition in his 1992 book, “Trump, The Deals and the Downfall,” author Wayne Barrett lays out a slew of suspicious dealings and associations.

The Atlantic City story starts with Trump’s purchase of a bar, at twice its market value, from Salvatore Testa, a made man in the Philadelphia mafia and son of Philip “Chicken Man” Testa, who was briefly head of the Philly mob after Angelo Bruno’s 1980 killing. Harrah’s casino, half owned by Trump, would be built on that land, and Trump would quickly buy out his partner, Harrah’s Entertainment, and rename the casino Trump Plaza.

Author Wayne Barrett lays out a slew of suspicious dealings and associations.

Trump Plaza’s connection to the mob didn’t end with the land purchase from Testa. Nicademo “Little Nicky” Scarfo (who became boss after the elder Testa was blown up) and his nephew Phillip “crazy Phil” Leonetti controlled two of the major construction and concrete companies in Atlantic City. Both companies, Scarf, Inc. and Nat Nat, did work on the construction of Harrah’s, according the State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation’s 1986 report on organized crime. In addition, Scarfo, whose reign as head of the Philly mob was one of the bloodiest in history, controlled the bartenders union, which represented Trump’s workers in Atlantic City, according to George Anastasia’s book, “Blood and Honor.”

One more link to organized crime lurks in Trump’s past Atlantic City dealings. He had a close association with Kenny Shapiro, an investment banker for Scarfo. According to secret recordings of then Scarfo attorney Robert F. Simone, Shapiro was intimately involved with bribing Atlantic City Mayor Michael J. Matthews, whose term would end in 1984 with a conviction on extortion charges. On the tapes, in 1983, Simone, talking about Leonetti, states: “He’s a nice-looking boy…Nicky’s nephew, he can sit with the…mayor. Ah, and Kenny’s (Shapiro) got the mayor through this kid Phillip.”

The Connections Don’t End in Atlantic City

Trump’s association and business dealings with known mafia figures was not limited to his Atlantic City projects. In New York City, several of his buildings were built by S&A Concrete Co., a concern partly owned by Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family. In addition to this business relationship, Trump and Salerno were both represented by high-power attorney Roy Cohn. In his book, Barrett cites an anonymous source who confirms that on at least one occasion Trump and Salerno had a sit-down in Cohn’s apartment. Trump has denied this claim in the past.

How can the candidate who promises to secure the border and bring good jobs back to America explain having farmed out good-paying jobs to a bunch of illegal immigrants?

Is it reasonable to assume that Trump had no idea that S&A was run by Salerno’s Genovese borgata when Trump’s own attorney was so closely linked to that organization? After all, if Trump (who likes to point out that he has “one of the highest IQs”) is as smart as he would have everyone believe, how could he have been so naive?

Another issue that needs to be addressed in Trump’s New York operations is the use of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the Bonwit Teller building, which made way for the Trump Tower. Only a handful of union workers from Housewreckers Local 95 were employed on the site, the vast majority were illegal Polish alien workers, toiling under inhumane conditions, and wildly underpaid. Trump and his associates were found guilty in 1991 of conspiring to avoid paying pension and welfare fund contributions.

Two questions arise from this. First, how did Trump get away with using such obvious scab labor without raising the ire of local 95? More importantly, how can the candidate who promises to secure the border and bring good jobs back to America explain having farmed out good-paying jobs, legally entitled to American workers, instead to a bunch of illegal immigrants? When the rubber hit the road Donald Trump didn’t walk the walk, he lined his pockets and sold out American workers.

Is it possible that Trump was simply involved in an industry which in the early 1980s was so infiltrated by the mafia that he couldn’t help but have tangential ties? Could this myriad of associations, points of contact, and shared affiliations with known mobsters just be the price of doing business in that business at that time? Sure. And if Trump were just a private citizen, businessman, and reality TV star, he would be under no obligation to explain any of this. But he isn’t. He is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president of the United States.

Donald Trump Has Explaining to Do

As one of a handful of people within reach of the most powerful office in the world Donald Trump must explain why so much of his early career is peppered with appearances by powerful underworld figures. Had Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, or Scott Walker bought so much as a used car from a known mafioso, it would be front-page news. Trump bought a piece of land for $1 million from the son of Philadelphia’s former mafia Don, and used it to launch a gambling empire.

The major investigative news outlets in this country with the resources and wherewithal to seriously scrutinize Trump’s ties to the mob need to start doing so.

It isn’t only Trump who has a responsibility here. The news media, which is enjoying his playful romp through electoral politics, needs to wake up on this story. Trump isn’t just fooling around this time. He wants to play in the big leagues, and in the big leagues they play hardball. The major investigative news outlets in this country with the resources and wherewithal to seriously scrutinize Trump’s ties to the mob need to start doing so, sooner rather than later.

Former mafia members need to be interviewed. Transcripts of wiretaps and interviews with the major players in Atlantic City and New York crime syndicates need to be reviewed. The work of Barrett and Johnson, among others over the past decades that show Trump’s underworld connections, need to be re-examined. Gary Hart and John Edwards learned that a serious run for president exposes all the dirty laundry, Trump needs to know that truth applies to him, too.

It’s time to stop treating Trump as a sideshow. He is being treated with kid gloves because nobody thinks he can win. Everybody is simply waiting for him to implode under the pressure of his own enormous ego and unfiltered motor mouth. But rather than plunging his run into chaos, his racist ramblings about immigrants and undignified digs at John McCain’s military service have excited some supporters. They think he speaks truth to power. They think he is the only honest man in politics. And no degree of exasperation from level headed news people and party officials seems to tamp his populist surge.

Being a loudmouth bigot, the Archie Bunker of 2016 who says what people are too afraid to say, is working well for Donald Trump. But it’s time to hold his feet to the fire. This is a man who did a significant amount of business with mass murderers whose plunder of public and private funds added up to billions. What did he know about them? Maybe more importantly, what do they know about him?

We need to welcome Donald Trump to his new place in serious national politics with a cold, hard look at the crooks, conspirators, and criminals who peopled his early career. Either the Donald will attempt to weather such scrutiny, or he will disappear from the race under it. Either way, that scrutiny needs to start now.

Will Joe Biden Have To Answer For His Long Record of Terrible Decisions?,"Maybe he’s the one you’ve been waiting for?

So let’s for a moment imagine that Biden is a principled politician and wouldn’t say absolutely anything just to become president—this would be the third time he’d be running for the position. And let’s, for a moment, concede that Biden, after his flirtation with Elizabeth Warren and hiring of new staff, is the sort of candidate that can knock off the front-runner. But then let’s suspend our disbelief and pretend the media will hold the new candidate responsible for his previous positions and votes at least as strictly as they hold Marco Rubio accountable for his wife’s parking tickets.

If they did, they would find that Joe Biden has had, in some sense, more consequential conservative votes on record than any candidate running for president from either party. Or a better way to put it: his greatest legacy is a lack of coherent philosophy and a ton of politically convenient grandstanding.

The one issue that has generated some attention is that Biden authored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which not only expanded the number of crimes subject to the federal death penalty, but also played a pivotal role in the explosion of incarcerations and the disproportionate criminal prosecution in poor black communities. Joe’s always been a tough-on-crime sort of guy, and as The New York Times pointed out recently

Despite reservations, Mr. Biden, who has served as the Obama administration’s unofficial liaison to the law enforcement community, has not only stood by the 1994 legislation, but has also frequently taken credit for it. As recently as this spring, in an essay on community policing for a book of bipartisan reform proposals put together by the Brennan Center for Justice, Mr. Biden referred to the legislation as the “1994 Biden Crime Bill.”

In addition to the “1994 Biden Crime Bill,” the vice president was one of the biggest proponents of the War on Drugs, taking a leading role in creating federal mandatory minimum laws that have put scores of non-violent criminals in prison. The kind of policies President Obama, Elizabeth Warren, every progressive, and many others have claimed are destructive. Biden also helped create the Drug Czar, a government official that oversees all anti-drug operations. As Biden explained to Time back in 2008, “I am not only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar, but I’m also the guy who spent years when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chairman trying to change drug policy relative to cocaine, for example, crack and powder.”

On the social front, Biden voted for the bigoted, anti-equality Defense of Marriage Act that has since been found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Biden voted in favor the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy which pushed members of the American gay community who wanted to fight for their nation deeper into the closet. Surely he will be asked to defend these votes by explaining how he evolved to his current position.

Biden has not only come out against federal funding for abortions, but also voted in favor of a 1999 bill to ban most partial-birth abortions, and in favor of the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Surely if he supported a bill that protected post-viable babies, he must also support Republican efforts to protect viable babies and believe it’s wrong to harvest a baby’s body parts after she’s been born. I look forward to the Catholic Biden’s clarification.

On issues of war and peace, Biden didn’t simply vote for the Iraq War, he was a vocal proponent of going to war. In 2002, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden said that Saddam Hussein was “a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security.” Biden went on to say that there was “no choice but to eliminate the threat.” In October of 2002, he gave a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate advocating for going to war. How Americans–liberals especially–can vote for someone who, when confronted with most important issue of his age, voted the wrong way? “A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics,” as Obama put it.

Before joining the administration, Biden was not only for increasing federal domestic spying programs, but he used to boast that the Patriot Act was essentially a copy of his own the anti-terrorist legislation from 1995. Either this is not true, or Democrats would be supporting the author of the Patriot Act. And Biden was a proponent of expanding the power of FBI wiretaps long before 9/11.

So, as we mock Donald Trump supporters for their ambivalence to the actual policy positions of their candidate, let’s remember that the other party may feature both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Biden’s erratic voting record–he supported the embargo on Cuba, for instance, promising in 2009 that the administration would not overturn it–makes all the sense in the world when you view it in context. When we set aside Biden’s smarmy Mr. Magoo-ishness, it’s worth remembering that although Biden may cast himself as some kind of dependable alternative to Clinton, and he would almost certainly be a stronger candidate than Hillary, he is also an escape hatch for those concerned about the ethical problems of an equally calculated candidate.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/08/25/will-joe-biden-have-to-answer-for-his-heresy-against-liberals/,2015-08-25
The Australian Gun Ban Conceit,"As they’re wont to do, in the immediate aftermath of the brutal and calculated murders of two Virginia reporters many gun-control advocates pointed to Australia’s gun ban and confiscation as a successful model America should adopt.

The idea wasn’t just limited to the fringe Left, either. It was put forth in places like the The New Republic and Vox. The Gray Lady herself published a column advocating Australian-style gun confiscation less than 24 hours after the killings.

Now, the practical problems of instituting an Australian-style gun ban and mandatory buyback program have been well flushed out. But I think it’s important to examine the main claim about Australia’s gun control. Namely, that it worked. The argument, as Vox’s headline puts it, is “Australia confiscated 650,000 guns. Murders and suicides plummeted.”

Murders and Suicides Didn’t ‘Plummet’

The piece, along with many gun control advocates, cites a Harvard University study whose conclusion begins with this line: “It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States.” Not a great start for Vox’s angle, but I digress.

America was more than doubling how many firearms it manufactured and seeing a nearly identical drop in gun homicides.

The study doesn’t conclude that “murders and suicides plummeted” in Australia after the 1996 gun ban, as Vox claims in its headline. Instead, it focuses solely on firearm-related murders and suicides. In that category they found a marked decline (although, interestingly, it still makes up nearly 20 percent of all homicides nearly two decades after most guns were banned by the island nation).

But at the same time Australia was banning guns and experiencing a decline in gun homicides, America was more than doubling how many firearms it manufactured and seeing a nearly identical drop in gun homicides. That throws a bit of a wrench into the idea that Australia’s gun ban must be the reason for its decline in gun crime.

However, what’s more important is the fact that overall suicides and murder have not “plummeted” in the years after the gun ban. Yes, as with the gun-happy United States, the murder rate is down in Australia. It’s dropped 31 percent from a rate of 1.6 per 100,000 people in 1994 to 1.1 per 100,000 in 2012.But it’s the only serious crime that saw a consistent decline post-ban.

In fact, according to the Australian government’s own statistics, a number of serious crimes peaked in the years after the ban. Manslaughter, sexual assault, kidnapping, armed robbery, and unarmed robbery all saw peaks in the years following the ban, and most remain near or above pre-ban rates. The effects of the 1996 ban on violent crime are, frankly, unimpressive at best.

Violence Declined Stateside Without A Gun Ban

It’s even less impressive when again compared to America’s decrease in violent crime over the same period. According to data from the U.S. Justice Department, violent crime fell nearly 72 percent between 1993 and 2011. Again, this happened as guns were being manufactured and purchased at an ever-increasing rate.

While Australians kill themselves with firearms less often, it seems they don’t actually take their own lives any less often.

The Australian gun ban’s effect on suicide in the country isn’t any better. While Vox repeats the Harvard study’s claim that firearm-related suicides are down 57 percent in the aftermath of the ban, Lifeline Australia reports that overall suicides are at a ten-year high. The Australian suicide prevention organization claims suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians 15 to 44 years old. So, while Australians kill themselves with firearms less often, it seems they don’t actually take their own lives any less often than before the ban.

Whatever you think of the merits of Australia’s gun ban or the practicality of using it as a model for American gun control, it most certainly has not caused suicide or murder rates to plummet. Furthermore, Australia has seen violent crimes peak in the years following its ban while the United States experienced the exact opposite phenomenon.

Australia isn’t much of a model for Australia, let alone for America.

7 Gun Control Myths That Just Won’t Die,"After every shooting, politicians and activists rush to the cameras or their keyboards to tell people exactly what should be done to stop mass shootings in the future. Gun control proponents demand more gun control. Gun rights advocates dig in their heels and explain why new laws won’t stop evil people from doing evil things, especially when current laws aren’t adequately enforced.

Unfortunately, the debate between the two sides is rarely illuminating, as it usually devolves into tired recitations of worn-out talking points about the issue. These talking points are invariably littered with myths and factual inaccuracies. Here are 7 myths about gun control that just won’t die.



1) The ‘Gun Show Loophole’ Allows Anyone, Even Criminals, To Get Guns

In reality, the so-called “gun show loophole” is a myth. It does not exist. There is no loophole in federal law that specifically exempts gun show transactions from any other laws normally applied to gun sales. Not one.

If you purchase a firearm from a federal firearms licensee (FFL) regardless of the location of the transaction — a gun store, a gun show, a gun dealer’s car trunk, etc. — that FFL must confirm that you are legally allowed to purchase that gun. That means the FFL must either run a background check on you via the federal NICS database, or confirm that you have passed a background check by examining your state-issued concealed carry permit or your government-issued purchase permit. There are zero exceptions to this federal requirement.

If an individual purchases a gun across state lines — from an individual or FFL which resides in a different state than the buyer — the buyer must undergo a background check, and the sale must be processed by an FFL in the buyer’s home state.

What does exist, however, is a federal exemption for sales between two private, non-FFL residents of the same state, regardless of whether that transaction happens at a gun show or not. The identity of the parties involved in the transaction, not the venue of the sale, is what matters under federal law. This federal exemption makes perfect sense: there’s no federal nexus for a purely private transaction between two private individuals who reside in the same state. Many states, including Oregon, Colorado, and Illinois, have enacted universal background checks in order to eliminate the exemption for same-state private firearms transactions.

Federal universal background checks may or may not be a wise idea — the U.S. Senate in 2013 explicitly refused to enact them — but referring to the federal exemption for private, same-state sales as a “gun show loophole” is misleading and factually inaccurate.



2) Nobody’s Demanding Gun Confiscation

We’ve all seen how this one plays out. In the wake of a shooting, a politician demands “common sense gun regulations.” Gun rights supporters then respond with something along the lines of, “He just wants to take our guns!” That criticism is then followed by mockery from various corners of progressive blogdom that no, you stupid hick, nobody wants to take your guns.

In 1996, Australia confiscated guns. It didn't work there and it wouldn't work in America. http://t.co/ks4wjml3Ch



National Review (@NRO) October 5, 2015

But that’s not true. A number of progressives do actually want to take your guns.

TPM’s Josh Marshall finally admitted earlier this week that progressives care a whole lot more about gun confiscation than they do about nibbling around the edges of existing gun laws.

“In other words, yes, we really do want to take your guns,” he wrote. “Maybe not all of them. But a lot of them.”

He’s not the only one. There’s also E.J. Dionne at the Washington Post, who scolded Republicans for refusing to endorse a nationwide gun confiscation program similar to one instituted in Australia in the mid-1990’s.

It’s not just leftist bloggers pushing for gun confiscation, though.

Take the president of the United States, for example. After the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Barack Obama made a statement that “we should politicize” shootings. He then cited radical gun confiscation laws in Australia and Great Britain as examples that the U.S. should follow:

We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.

The intent of Obama’s reference to Australia’s nationwide gun confiscation law, its ineffectiveness notwithstanding, couldn’t have been more clear. Yes, they really do want to take your guns.



3) Buying A Gun Is As Easy As Buying Groceries

Last March, President Barack Obama was asked about guns during a press conference, and he responded by saying, “It’s easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable.” Ignoring for the moment that the president does not understand the difference between a clip and a magazine, his claim is not true.

It is not easier to buy a gun than it is to buy a fresh vegetable, or any canned vegetable for that matter. Never in my life have I been required to fill out federal form 4473 and have the cashier run a background check on me before being allowed to buy an onion.

There are no federal laws requiring onion dealers to register with the federal government prior to selling onions. There are no state laws requiring that you apply for and receive an onion purchase permit, complete with background check, prior to purchasing an onion. There are no onion waiting periods or limits on how many onions you can purchase within a certain period of time. Nor are there, to my knowledge, any state or local laws prohibiting the possession of onions in schools or government buildings.

Firearm manufacturing and sales are highly regulated by the federal government. Numerous complicated laws govern virtually every aspect of the process. Anyone who has purchased a gun before can you tell you in great detail that it is not as easy as buying a vegetable at a grocery store. It is an expensive and time-consuming process.

Some people may think gun control is a great idea and that it should be harder to buy a gun than it currently is, but they should refrain from suggesting that legally purchasing a firearm is easier, cheaper, and less time-consuming than buying a carrot. Because it’s not.



4) Concealed Carriers Don’t Prevent Mass Shootings

“Do armed civilians stop mass shooters?” the liberal magazine Mother Jones asked in 2012. “Actually, no.”

Mother Jones justified its assertion by citing its own analysis that of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012, not one was stopped by a civilian with a gun. Shocking, right? Not really, once you consider the logical fallacy underlying the Mother Jones claim.

The fact of the matter is that shootings that happen in an area where concealed carriers can immediately respond don’t generally become mass shootings. It’s a bit like saying locked doors and alarms don’t prevent burglaries by only citing burglaries that happened in buildings with no locked doors or alarms as proof of your thesis. It’s no coincidence that so many mass shootings happen in areas declared to be “gun-free zones” by authorities.

Instances of concealed carriers stopping shooters in their tracks are too numerous to count. Here are just a few examples found from a few seconds of Googling.

July 27, 2015:

A 62-year-old man with a gun in each hand fired at four people – including a 1-year-old boy – before a civilian with a concealed carry permit returned fire and wounded the shooter, cops told FOX19.

April 20, 2015:

Authorities say no charges will be filed against an Uber driver who shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people in Logan Square over the weekend.



The driver had a concealed-carry permit and acted in the defense of himself and others, Assistant State’s Attorney Barry Quinn said in court Sunday.



A group of people had been walking in front of the driver around 11:50 p.m. Friday in the 2900 block of North Milwaukee Avenue when Everardo Custodio, 22, began firing into the crowd, Quinn said.



The driver pulled out a handgun and fired six shots at Custodio, hitting him several times, according to court records. Responding officers found Custodio lying on the ground, bleeding, Quinn said. No other injuries were reported.

September 22, 2015:

A 63-year-old autoworker with a concealed weapons license shot a gunman who was robbing a Warren, Michigan, bank, according to Fox 2 Detroit.

Concealed carriers can’t be expected to stop every shooting, just as police can’t be expected to prevent all crime. It is a fact, though, that concealed carriers regularly put an end to violent shootings.



5) The Second Amendment Only Applies To Muskets

This trope is a popular one among gun control advocates who imagine themselves as strict constructionists when it comes to Constitutional interpretation. Piers Morgan, the failed CNN host and British tabloid editor accused of hacking into celebrity voicemails in search of tabloid gossip, is the foremost advocate of the notion that the Second Amendment protects only the rights of Americans to carry muskets:

Friends don't let friends follow in Piers Morgan's footsteps. pic.twitter.com/eMyzlowSYC



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 4, 2015

As Carol Roth noted, the refusal of the Founding Fathers to precisely name the types of arms which citizens have a right to keep and bear was intentional. The same can be said of their refusal to constrain our right of free expression to quill pens and bulky printing presses. The Second Amendment protects our right to own handguns just like the First Amendment protects our right to criticize the government using the Internet.

Both the text of the Second Amendment and the intent behind it are clear: the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Law-abiding citizens have the right not only to own weapons, but to carry them as well. The Second Amendment isn’t about muskets or bayonets. It’s about the right of a free people to defend themselves with arms if necessary.



6) Gun Violence Is Skyrocketing

If you’ve spent any time on social media, you’ve seen the lamentations: gun violence is skyrocketing. It is an epidemic. Constant TV coverage of shootings can certainly make it seem that way. But the truth of the matter is that gun violence is actually way down. It hasn’t skyrocketed; it’s plummeted.

A 2013 study from the Pew Research Center found that gun violence had fallen by nearly 50 percent since its 1993 peak:

Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate was 49% lower in 2010, and there were fewer deaths, even though the nation’s population grew. The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults, robberies and sex crimes—was 75% lower in 2011 than in 1993. Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall (with or without a firearm) also is down markedly (72%) over two decades.

A 2014 analysis from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) showed a significant decline in violent crime over the last five years:

In 2013, the latest year for which complete data are available, the number of homicides in which a firearm was involved totaled 8,454, representing a 12 percent drop compared to the number of gun homicides in 2003. And the 2003 figure represented a 41 percent drop from the gun homicide total in 1994, the earliest year for which data are readily accessible on the FBI’s website.

All told, the number of gun homicides in the U.S. has fallen by nearly 50 percent over the last two decades. Any amount of violent crime is too much, but it’s wrong to assert in the face of all evidence that gun violence in the U.S. is skyrocketing.



7) Gun-Free Zones Prevent Gun Violence

Nothing represents wishful thinking in the face of evidence like the proliferation of so-called gun-free zones. These are areas in which guns have been explicitly banned by law, or banned by property owners or local authorities. They are almost always accompanied by a sign notifying passersby that guns are banned on the premises. The intent behind the idea of gun-free zones is simple and noble: what better way to prevent gun violence than by banning guns?

Unfortunately, the reality of human nature tends to stomp all over those good intentions. Time and again, deadly mass shootings occur in gun-free zones. Why? Because the evil mind intent on wreaking havoc wants nothing more than the ability to do so without getting shot back. What better place to go than a gun-free zone?

The sad fact of the matter is that gun-free zones are anything but.

The Oregon shooting happened in a gun-free zone. The Lafayette movie theater shooting happened in a gun-free zone. The Chattanooga shootings happened in gun-free zones. The Ft. Hood massacre even happened in a gun-free zone, believe it or not.

Gun-free zones may be backed by pure intentions, but the reality is that they just end up being soft targets for evil killers hellbent on destruction.

The Conservative Case For Criminal Justice Reform,"Remarks at The Heritage Foundation, October 7, 2015.

Applying timeless conservative principles to fix today’s broken government policies, and help all Americans in their pursuit of happiness, has always been the bread and butter of what Heritage does. It’s how I’ve tried to approach my work in the Senate for the past five years. And it’s what brings me here today to talk about the need for criminal-justice reform.

I’ll never forget when I first began to appreciate the magnitude of this problem. It was 2004; I was working in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Utah. In some cases, I witnessed judges forced by federal law to impose punishments that did not fit the crime—first-time offenders sometimes being locked up for longer than murderers and rapists.

These were real people, with children, spouses, and dreams for a better life. Yet in too many cases the so-called “system” that was supposed to correct their mistakes only compounded them. This “system” wasn’t just wasting money, it was wasting lives.

So when I got to the Senate and was assigned to the Judiciary Committee, I started looking for partners, on the Right and the Left, who shared my concerns and commitment to reform. Until recently, progress was slow. But more and more today, from Capitol Hill to the campaign trail, support for criminal justice reform is cropping up everywhere.

Introducing the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act

All of the most serious candidates in the Republican presidential field have made statements or speeches supporting the reform effort. Then there’s the Democratic frontrunner, whose website declares, “We must reform our criminal justice system to ensure fairness and justice[.]” If you want to see for yourself, you can go to: www.berniesanders.com. I haven’t looked, but there’s probably something similar on Hillary Clinton’s website—or maybe on a private server somewhere.

All of the most serious candidates in the Republican presidential field have made statements or speeches supporting the reform effort.

And finally, just last week, I was honored to stand with several of my Senate colleagues to announce the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which I’ll be talking about in a few minutes, and which may well be the most important step forward on this issue in a generation.

This bill is the culmination of many years of effort by policymakers, scholars, and activists on both sides of the aisle. Like most legislative compromises, it isn’t perfect. But it’s a great start, and it’s a testament to the long-overdue, bipartisan momentum that’s now building on this issue.

But I’m not here to make the bipartisan case for criminal justice reform. I came to the Heritage Foundation to make the conservative case for criminal justice reform, to discuss—on our terms—what’s wrong with our criminal code and penal system today, and to tell you what I think a conservative approach to policing and punishment should look like in the twenty-first century.

Criminal Justice Reform Is Conservative

Now, I realize that most people, including many conservatives, might think criminal justice reform is a progressive cause, not a conservative one. But this has never been true.

The most successful criminal justice reformers in the twentieth century advocated for conservative goals: law and order built on the responsible use of government’s coercive powers; tight-knit communities; a vibrant civil society; strong, intact families; and personal responsibility. Yet many on the Right have accepted the conventional wisdom and, as a result, are skeptical about calls for reform.

When there’s a major problem tearing at our economy and civil society, conservatives don’t just shrug and expect a bunch of outdated laws and bloated government bureaucracies to take care of it.

And in one sense, I can’t blame them. Listening to some of the rhetoric on the Left today, you’d think our criminal laws and penal system are not just in need of reform, but fundamentally—if not intentionally—unjust and discriminatory. That even goes for some liberals who have been good partners in the movement for reform. In a recent speech, President Obama spoke about the “long history of inequity in the criminal justice system in America,” as if the problems today were no different than the problems of the past.

And it’s not just the Left’s sweeping indictment of our system that’s unappealing to conservatives. Many of the so-called reforms offered by progressives seem more concerned with lowering the incarceration rate than lowering the actual crime rate. But, as criminal law scholar Stephanos Bibas puts it, “just because liberals are wrong does not mean the status quo is right.”

Think about it: when there’s a major problem tearing at our economy and civil society—a problem that’s threatening our most vulnerable families and communities—conservatives don’t just shrug and expect a bunch of outdated laws and bloated government bureaucracies to take care of it. We know better.

Respect for Life, Law, and Communities

And we have seen what happens when conservatives surrender an issue entirely to the Left—as we did for many years on poverty, and health care, and education. We know who paid the price for our failure to lead: the same struggling families, fraying communities, and at-risk kids who will continue to suffer if we do so again on criminal justice.

Respect for the equal dignity of all human life, no matter how small or weak, and for the redemptive capacity of all sinners, no matter how calloused, is the foundation for everything that conservatives stand for.

If there is one thought I can leave with you today, it’s this: criminal justice reform doesn’t call on conservatives to compromise our principles, but to fight for them. It’s about making our communities—the little platoons of service and cooperation at the heart of our republic—safe and prosperous and happy.

It’s about basing our laws, our court procedures, and our prison systems on a clear-eyed understanding of human nature—of man’s predilection toward sin and his capacity for redemption—along with an uncompromising commitment to human dignity.

Respect for the equal dignity of all human life, no matter how small or weak, and for the redemptive capacity of all sinners, no matter how calloused, is the foundation for everything that conservatives stand for. Our approach to policing and punishment should be no different. So, as I see it, criminal justice reform properly understood represents principled conservatism at its best.

For conservatives, the question isn’t whether we punish those who break the law, but how we punish them—for how long, under what circumstances, and toward what end. Just as the government has the power to punish those who break the law, it has a corresponding duty to use its coercive powers responsibly—to sentence offenders on an individualized basis and no longer than necessary.

The Prison Bureaucracy Hurts People

The real problem today is not simply that penalties are too harsh or sentences too long—though in many cases they are. The problem is that, over the past several decades, we have industrialized and bureaucratized our criminal, judicial, and penal systems. Which is to say, we’ve turned them into large, unaccountable, short-sighted, self-interested institutions that often treat offenders as statistical units, instead of human beings.

We have a criminal code so big that no one knows how many crimes are even on the books.

We have a criminal code so big that no one knows how many crimes are even on the books—not even the Congressional Research Service, which pays people to measure these things. An increasing number of these criminal offenses are written not by legislators at the state level, but by bureaucrats in Washington. And far too often they’re written without a mens rea requirement, leaving law-abiding citizens guilty of crimes without intending to do anything wrong.

We have federal sentencing laws that too often prohibit judges from exercising their human and legal judgment while punishing offenders. And we have a penal system that isolates offenders from the only people and responsibilities in their life that have the power to facilitate true rehabilitation and redemption. No wonder an estimated three-quarters of offenders released from prison every year are re-arrested within five years.

Of course, for many offenders, isolation from these vital sources of human and social capital began long before—and may well have fueled—their criminal activity. Which is why, for conservatives, criminal justice reform must be part of a broader agenda of opportunity and mobility.

A Broader Agenda of Opportunity

That agenda must expand access to the networks of opportunity within our free-enterprise economy and voluntary civil society, for all Americans, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized. This isn’t an “either/or” proposition; it has to be “all of the above.” There are principled conservative policy responses reaching education, welfare, housing, transportation, health care, and beyond.

For conservatism to serve the whole nation, it has to serve the whole person, and fight for everyone Washington’s broken status quo is leaving behind.

For conservatism to serve the whole nation, it has to serve the whole person, and fight for everyone Washington’s broken status quo is leaving behind. Restoring equal opportunity to all Americans depends on reforming America’s judicial, policing, and penal systems on the basis of human dignity.

That goes for the victims of crime and their families, who are too often cut out of the process; for the neighborhoods that are denied the basic safety most of us take for granted; for the families, especially the young women and single moms, who have to face every day without so many of their young men, whom they, and their children, and our entire society desperately need to live as husbands and fathers and anchors of their communities; and finally, for the perpetrators, who are, after all, no less human than the rest of us.

For conservatives, the process of reform begins by recognizing not the mistakes of our past, but the successes, because the dysfunction that we see in today’s status quo is more often the product of good intentions gone awry and sound policies grown old than the manifestation of historical or structural inequities.

Full Prisons Mean Lots of Crime

The case for reform can’t rest exclusively on statistics about incarceration. With more than 2 million Americans behind bars today, and one in every 28 American children with an incarcerated parent, the figures are truly startling. But this tells only half the story. Incarceration doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s a direct response to crime.

Between 1960 and 1991 violent crime rates increased by a factor of four, and homicide rates almost doubled across the country.

The reason we have an incarceration problem in America today is that, for much of the second half of the twentieth century, we had a major crime problem. Through good economic times and bad, regardless of which party won elections, and no matter how generous we made our welfare programs or how tough we made criminal penalties, the scourge of violent and drug-related crime stubbornly persisted for three decades.

Contrary to popular mythology, some of the strongest advocates of the stern penalties for heroin and crack cocaine in the 1970s and 80s were the primary victims of crime: residents of urban, working-class communities who were the most directly and routinely threatened by the violence that grew out of widespread drug addiction and family breakdown.

But the combination of deterrence and incarceration was not the answer that many had hoped it would be. Even as sentences became stiffer and incarceration rates rose, violent crime rates continued to climb. All told, between 1960 and 1991 violent crime rates increased by a factor of four, and homicide rates almost doubled across the country.

This was no “crime wave.” It was a flood of lawlessness and violence, compounded by an unprecedented drug epidemic, that left shattered families and frayed communities in its wake. And there was nothing inevitable about its retreat.

Crime Is a Feature of the Human Condition

Starting in the early 1990s, violent crime rates in America began to recede, a trend that continued for the next 20 years, through the present day. This dramatic drop in crime was one of the greatest domestic triumphs of the post-World War II era. But it wasn’t simply a function of locking up more offenders. In fact, we know from the experience of places like New York City that it’s possible to reduce the crime rate and the incarceration rate at the same time.

The only way to mitigate our innate inclination toward criminal behavior is to protect and promote our most reliable sources of virtue.

Rather, it took a generation of iconoclastic reformers—conservatives—to finally stem the tide. And they did so by revolutionizing the nation’s approach to policing and punishment.

One of those iconoclasts was the theologian Michael Novak. Novak expressed the key insight of his reform-oriented generation when he wrote in 1986: “What is amazing is not that human beings are sometimes criminal. What requires explanation is the fact that all are not. What requires explanation is virtue.”

Novak’s point was that criminal behavior is not a curiosity that requires complex theories to understand. It is a natural feature of human life. And the only way to mitigate our innate inclination toward criminal behavior is to protect and promote our most reliable sources of virtue, where all of us, throughout our lives, learn—and when necessary are forced—to be honest, decent, kind, and conscientious.

The most important of these character-forming institutions are: family, faith, work, and community. The innovative policing and punishment reforms of the ’80s and ’90s that grew out of Novak’s insight succeeded precisely because they were designed to strengthen and increase access to these invaluable networks of trust and opportunity.

Rebuilding Fractured Communities

There was broken-windows policing—the single most effective crime-reduction policy of the era—that helped rebuild fractured communities from the bottom up. As it was originally conceived by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling, broken-windows policing was a collaborative project. It called on law-enforcement officers and neighborhood residents to work together to maintain public order—following local standards, not rules imposed from above.

These are all the little things neighbors do—to mind the gaps, help each other out, and set expectations for everyone else to do the same.

This kind of order maintenance wasn’t about maximizing arrests, but working together to reinforce what Wilson and Kelling called the “informal control mechanisms of the community.”

These are all the little things neighbors do—to mind the gaps, help each other out, and set expectations for everyone else to do the same. Together they form the connective tissue of tight-knit, safe communities.

These informal social bonds—always anchored by the ultimate formal bond of marriage—are formed and strengthened through faith, family, work, and community. And they are corroded by violence and public disorder, which then foster the conditions that breed crime.

Broken-windows policing disrupted this negative feedback loop, reducing the frequency of criminal behavior. And it did so by repairing and supporting the homegrown, social foundations of neighborhoods—especially those that had been hit the hardest by the violence and disorder unleashed by the drug epidemic.

Faith-Driven Efforts to Love Prisoners

Then there was the growth of prison ministry efforts—inspired by the example of Chuck Colson—that catalyzed the rehabilitation and redemption of countless wounded souls languishing behind bars. Chuck Colson was formerly President Nixon’s infamous “hatchet man.” But he became one of the most successful prison-reform advocates in America, and the founder of Prison Fellowship, after his life took two unexpected turns.

In 1973 he committed his life to Jesus Christ. The following year, he pled guilty to Watergate-related charges and served seven months in prison. As he explained it, these two experiences—coming to know Christ and coming to know his fellow convicts—taught Colson that,

The solution to crime is no different from […] the solution to the human predicament as a whole. We are at odds with God; we cannot repair this situation ourselves; God has repaired it for us and offers us a part of that great eternal solution.

Colson had the credentials—as a conservative, a born-again Christian, and a convicted felon—to live as a witness, teaching those on the outside about the indignities of prison life, and inviting those on the inside to seek moral transformation through faith.

Expanding Alternatives to Prison

Finally, starting in the late 1970s, there was a proliferation of prison alternatives, like therapeutic communities, long-term residential treatment centers, and drug courts. All of which enabled offenders to stay connected to community, family, and work while serving out their sentences.

The traditional penitentiary approach to punishment severs the offender’s ties to their family and work life.

Studies estimate that nearly three-quarters of inmates were gainfully employed in the month prior to their arrest. And we know that a majority of prisoners are also parents—most of whom lived with their minor children before they were arrested or incarcerated. Yet the traditional penitentiary approach to punishment severs the offender’s ties to their family and work life.

To make matters worse, prison doesn’t just isolate offenders from networks of trust—it plugs them into networks of distrust. It takes them from a community of law-abiding citizens, where most people work and have families, to a community of convicted criminals, where idleness is the norm and families are separated not just by walls and barbed wire, but often by hundreds, if not thousands, of miles.

That physical distance is often compounded by limited access to outrageously expensive phone calls home. In an era of FaceTime, texting, and ubiquitous telecommunications, this kind of isolation is as cruel as it is unnecessary.

By contrast, prison alternatives challenge the long-standing presumption in favor of incarceration and mitigate its most damaging consequences. This was a grassroots movement, often led by former inmates who knew first-hand the dysfunction of government-run or government-funded correctional institutions. And it succeeded where prisons so often fail: in preparing offenders to reintegrate into their communities as productive and law-abiding citizens, as spouses, parents, neighbors, and employees, instead of career criminals.

A Path Towards Reforming Federal Law

This history shows that criminal justice reform can be, and traditionally has been, a conservative project that accomplishes conservative goals of balancing retribution and rehabilitation, justice and mercy, the rights of victims and of perpetrators.

We are at the beginning, not the end, of this generation’s story of criminal justice reform.

These same goals animate the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which my colleagues and I released earlier this week. Our bill expands federal judges’ now-limited discretion, so they can treat offenders like human beings, not statistics, and punish them according to their particular circumstances.

It broadens the federal “safety valve”—a provision that allows judges to sentence a limited number of offenders below the mandatory minimum. Contrary to what many critics claim, this doesn’t absolve offenders of their crimes. Nor will it suddenly and indiscriminately release legions of violent predators into our communities. In fact, under this reform, the status of offenders with serious drug or violent convictions won’t change. They will remain ineligible for federal “safety valve” relief.

Finally, the bill improves the quality of our federal prisons by increasing access to vocational training, therapeutic counseling, and reentry services, so that we have fewer first-time offenders turning into career criminals.

All of these are commonsense and long-overdue reforms. But make no mistake: we are at the beginning, not the end, of this generation’s story of criminal justice reform. There is still work to be done if we truly want to rebuild the system according to the principle of human dignity and upon the proven successes of recent reforms at the state level.

Utah Leads the Way

There may be no better example to emulate than that of my home state of Utah, where judges are generally not bound by mandatory minimum sentences. While they still send many offenders to prison, Utah judges have the discretion to impose other sanctions—smarter sanctions—in appropriate cases. And sometimes that includes people like Paul Morris.

As Paul tells it, this was a choice not of punishments but of lives—between hopelessness and hope, criminality and change.

Before Paul was charged with aggravated robbery and assault, he was a successful salesman, earning close to six-figures a year, and a proud husband and father of a beautiful little girl. But he threw it all away when he started using methamphetamine.

What began as experimental quickly became habitual. Before long, Paul was addicted to meth and to petty theft—the quickest and easiest way to fund his addiction. Paul’s story is the familiar downward spiral of his own making. It ended in divorce, separation from his daughter, unemployment, criminal conviction, and, ultimately, to one last choice; this one from a judge: either go to prison or enroll in Odyssey House, a long-term residential treatment center in Salt Lake City.

As Paul tells it, this was a choice not of punishments but of lives—between hopelessness and hope, criminality and change. He knew Odyssey House would be the more demanding and difficult choice. Getting through prison is often a matter of survival, of simply “serving time.” But Paul knew there were only two ways to leave Odyssey House: dropping out, which would send him to prison, or changing his behavior.

And, with the help of a lengthy prison sentence hanging over his head, Paul knew he wanted to change. He wanted to get clean, to support his daughter, and to recover the dignity and pride—the natural high of service-based success—available only through lawful work. So he chose Odyssey House. And, since moving in ten months ago, Paul has flourished.

He knows that, whatever else happens, he’ll always be a recovering drug addict, just as he’ll always be a reformed offender.

Like most therapeutic communities, Odyssey House is essentially run by the recovering addicts residing there. So everyone has to pitch in, not just to earn success, but to earn trust. After starting as a cook in the kitchen, Paul soon moved to a job with a higher profile and more responsibilities: supervisor of the department that receives, processes, and introduces new residents to Odyssey House.

This role, along with the community setting for much of his counseling, has been critical to Paul’s recovery. They are helping him learn—or relearn—those fundamental social skills and habits of the heart that are essential to being a member of a healthy community.

Paul understands he still has a long way to go. He knows that, whatever else happens, he’ll always be a recovering drug addict, just as he’ll always be a reformed offender. He knows that moral transformation is a life sentence. But, with the tools provided by Odyssey House, it’s the sentence he’s pleading for.

Forgiveness Isn’t Making Excuses

Reforming our federal laws so that judges have the option to send people like Paul to a place like Odyssey House doesn’t mean we should avert our eyes from what he has done or the crimes he has committed; or pretend like it never happened; or make excuses that blame someone, or something, else for the choices he made.

Forgiveness requires assigning blame and, when necessary, imposing just punishments.

Instead, it requires looking squarely at the facts of the case, no matter how ugly or wicked, holding offenders directly and personally accountable for their crimes, and devising a punishment—neither too lenient nor too harsh—that fits both the crime and the criminal.

We do this all the time in our daily lives when we recognize the humanity of hating the sin and loving the sinner. It’s called forgiveness. Forgiving is not the same thing as excusing. And it’s not incompatible with punishment. Forgiveness requires assigning blame and, when necessary, imposing just punishments.

Which is to say, forgiveness requires treating offenders not as blameless victims, but as morally responsible individuals; as human beings who, like the rest of us, have the propensity for vice and for virtue, and who must be held accountable for their choice of one or the other.

Some crimes are so heinous, and some criminals so monstrous, that the only responsible and fair use of the state’s coercive powers is to prevent an offender from ever reentering the society that he has so routinely or so violently threatened. But the reality is that almost every offender who goes to prison will one day get out. We do ourselves a disservice when an offender’s punishment does more to promote criminality than penitence.

Everyone Needs a Second Chance Sometimes

Forgiveness doesn’t determine who is guilty or dictate what an offender’s punishment should be—that’s what police, juries, and judges are for. But real forgiveness also doesn’t discriminate. As a matter of morality, I believe we are called not to forgive those who love us and foreswear those who hurt us, but to accept that to be human is to be in need of forgiveness.

And morality and religion aside, considered strictly as a matter of human nature and self-government, the pursuit of happiness depends on the opportunity to earn second chances. That is doubly true for Americans trapped from youth in government-imposed dysfunction and inequality, who barely have one chance as it is.

Treating our fellow citizens, our “fellow passengers to the grave,” as disposable is a price too high to pay for a society that truly believes that all lives matter. We know that no man is without sin. Now, we must remember, in our hearts and in our laws, that no man is without hope. This is why I’m involved, and invite you to join me in the conservative movement for criminal justice reform.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/07/the-conservative-case-for-criminal-justice-reform/,2015-10-07
We Can’t Reform Our Justice System Without Lifting Families,"Common-sense criminal sentencing reform is gaining momentum. Presidential candidate Jeb Bush and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins are among the signers of the Right on Crime Statement of Principles, which argues for applying “conservative principles to criminal justice policy” as “vital to achieving a cost-effective system that protects citizens, restores victims, and reforms wrongdoers.” Earlier this year, a collation of extraordinary political bedfellows—ranging from Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz—published a book of essays titled, “Solutions: American Leaders Speak Out on Criminal Justice Reform.”

What’s going on? Perkins, a former police officer, knows firsthand what is at stake when sentences are arbitrary, harsh, and simply unjust. He explains why so many political and other leaders are coming together on this critical issue.

Writing in 2013 about how to deal with nonviolent criminals, Perkins said, “Violent and career criminals must be locked up to protect society, and we must also exclude offenders whose crimes endanger their own children … But for many nonviolent offenders, we should do all we can to keep families together while maintaining public safety.”

One of us (Ken Blackwell) has been active in the “Fair Justice” movement, and noted recently, “Over the last decade, states like Texas, Utah, Georgia, and my home state of Ohio have been leaders in criminal justice reform, embracing policies that focus prison beds on serious and violent offenders. The results of these initiatives are staggering: lower costs for taxpayers alongside declining rates of incarceration, recidivism, arrest, and crime rates have continued to fall to decade lows.”

Don’t Forget Families

Encouraging violent criminal behavior through excessive punishment and long and close association of the non-violent with the violent is not only unjust but unwise. Yet in considering how we deal with offenders of all kinds, we have to confront a grim reality: A disproportionate number of offenders are African-American. Why? Is it because there’s something innate in black men that leads them into lives of crime?

‘Relative to other groups, blacks commit more crimes.’

Of course not. Racial injustice plays a role in the incarceration of so many black men, but so does what Kay Hymowitz, writing in The Atlantic earlier this month, calls “the breakdown of the black family.” She notes, “Relative to other groups, blacks commit more crimes. To understand why is to tackle some very hard-to-talk-about realities of black family life.”

Hymowitz, a senior fellow at The Manhattan Institute, observes that “violent criminals continue to make up by far the largest cohort of the freshman class of prisoners—black, white, and Hispanic … The numbers are shocking but it seems worth noting that compared to other advanced nations, the United States also has by far the highest homicide rates even after years of decline.” Why? The black family’s deconstruction has a profound and undeniable correlative effect. We quote Hymowitz here at length:

Children suffer when their parents go to prison … the suffering of black children (accelerates by their) growing up in chaotic families, though that suffering is itself highly correlated with the scourge of ghetto crime and incarceration. Seventy-two percent of black children are born to unmarried mothers. The majority of those children will see contact with their fathers “drop sharply”; within a few years, about a third of dads will basically just disappear. Children don’t take well to the succession of partners, step- and half-siblings that follow their parents’ breakup. Studies, not just a few, but a slew of them, connect “multi-partner fertility” and father absence to behavior problems, aggression, and later criminality among boys even when controlling for race and income. Doesn’t that suggest black-family disruption could have some bearing on crime and incarceration rates?

Of course! Boys raised without involved, committed, and loving fathers who model and teach honorable behavior but who, instead, obtain their moral instruction from the streets will be much more prone to crime than otherwise.

Children Need Their Fathers

“Four decades of research and hundreds of studies have proven what should be obvious to everyone,” writes Skye Loyd at Parenting.com. “The more involved a dad is, the more successful his children will be. A father’s influence can determine a child’s social life, grades at school, and future achievements.”

It’s clear that fatherhood, perhaps most especially in the black community, is not what it should be.

The social science data demonstrate that “Boys close to their fathers have better attitudes about intimacy and the prospect of their own married lives than boys who do not feel close to their fathers, while adolescents who live without their father are more likely to engage in greater and earlier sexual activity, are more likely to become pregnant as a teenager, and are more likely to have a child outside of marriage.”

“Good fathering is characterized by warmth,” writes Dr. Jim Henderson. That’s why, in part, “Recognition of the importance of fathers to children’s development is increasing. Fathers play many roles: supporting the mother-infant relationship, nurturing, acting as mother surrogate, encouraging separation and individuation, setting up core sexual identify and developing sex role, and encouraging the development of conscience.”

Yet it’s clear that fatherhood, perhaps most especially in the black community, is not what it should be. According to Phillip Jackson, executive director of the Black Star Project, “Father absence in the African American communities, across America, has hit those communities with the force of 100 hurricane Katrinas. It is literally decimating our communities and we have no adequate response to it.”

In a study published earlier this year, Marriage and Religion Research Institute (MARRI) scholars Pat Fagan and Christina Hadford found that “Today, only 17 percent of black teenagers reach age 17 in a family with both their biological parents married. In no state does this percentage exceed 30 percent.”

More Government Programs Aren’t the Answer

In a subsequent study, MARRI (a department within Family Research Council) notes that expanded or new government programs are not the answer:

Top-down government reform has largely failed and will likely continue to fail until leaders of other institutions in society (not just policymakers) promote intact married families, the strongest generator of educated youth, low delinquency, economic growth, and sexual mores. Major federal and state public policy outcomes illustrate government’s incompetence as an independent actor in maintaining social order, as well as its dependence on the intact married family for the achievement of its policy goals. Government will continue to fail to reduce these social problems as long as it sees itself as the primary actor. Other major institutions – churches, schools and universities, and even businesses – all need to play their role in restoring and supporting marriage where it is most vulnerable: among the poor.

Sentencing reform is needed. FRC’s friends at Justice Fellowship, a division of the late Chuck Colson’s Prison Fellowship, have some great ideas about how to “reform the criminal justice system so communities are safer, victims are respected, and lives are transformed,” and we urge all concerned with this key issue to visit their website to learn more. Criminal justice reform must get a fair and open hearing as Congress and the administration consider how to proceed.

Yet too much crime, whether violent or not, is committed both against and by men in the black community. That’s largely because, without a dad in the home, African-American boys are far too often raised amidst pain, brokenness, loneliness, and danger. Restoring the black family surely must be a priority for churches and all races and ethnicities throughout our country.

For an example of what one church can do to help strengthen the African-American family, go to the First Baptist Church of Glen Arden’s Shabach! Ministries website.

Bernie Sanders Voted For Crime Laws He Denounces,"Bernie Sanders has made ending “mass incarceration” a big part of his campaign. We have too many people in prison, he says, and we don’t invest enough in communities. On July 15, Sanders spoke in support of an education bill: “The result of kids not being in school and kids not having jobs is that tragically, today, we in this country have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.”

He tweeted similar thoughts in September.

We need to end the tragic reality that the United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth.

— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) September 28, 2015

But is this stated aspiration just more empty words?

Sanders Votes to Lock ‘Em Up

Twenty-one years ago, Sanders was saying very much the same thing before voting for bills that caused the prison population to skyrocket. In Congress on April 13, 1994, in a speech a Sanders supporter shared at the Daily Kos, Sanders denounced America’s prison system and blamed crime on poverty.

But it is also my view that through the neglect of our Government and through a grossly irrational set of priorities, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence. And Mr. Speaker, all the jails in the world, and we already imprison more people per capita than any other country, and all of the executions in the world, will not make that situation right. We can either educate or electrocute. We can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails.

That was April 13, 1994. After uttering those words, Sanders went on to vote for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (1994) and the Ominibus Crime Bill of 1994, a hallmark of Bill Clinton’s “tough on crime” agenda.

The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 passed the House just one week after Sanders made his impassioned speech, and Sanders voted for it. That act called for expanding the application of the death penalty on many more crimes, including large-scale drug trafficking. It also included a federal version of the “three strikes law,” requiring a mandatory life sentence for anyone convicted of a third serious crime.

That version of the bill ultimately didn’t become law, but instead a similar bill, the Omnibus Crime Bill, which not only expanded the death penalty but also decreased the minimum age for minors to be tried as adults, passed the House, once again with Sanders’ vote, and became law.

Does Sanders Want Longer Sentences Or Not?

Most significantly, it included incentives for states to adopt truth-in-sentencing (TIS) laws that lengthened prison sentences. The bill provided money, with strings attached, for states to build more prisons, but only if they required that convicts for the most serious crimes would have to serve at least 85 percent of the sentences imposed on them (the “85 percent rule”). That might be a good policy if you want to make criminals serve a requisite amount of time for the injuries they inflict on individuals and society. It will, however, increase the size of the prison population by doing just that.

Prisoners serving longer sentences means that at any given time there will be more people in prison.

According to a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 27 states and the District of Columbia applied TIP standards that met the Clinton administration’s standards. The average sentence served under those standards would increase from 45 months in prison for violent offenders released in 1996 to 88 months for those convicted in 1996. A chart shows the number of prisoners in state prisons sentenced to mandatory 85 percent sentences increased from less than 20,000 in 1994 to more than 40,000 the next year with the passage of the bill.

Prisoners serving longer sentences means that at any given time there will be more people in prison. The report found that the number of prisoners in state prisons increased by 7 percent annually between 1990 and 1997, even as the rate of new prisoners admitted dropped.

Then in 1998, Sanders voted again to increase the length of sentences criminals must serve. The Minimum Sentences for Gun Crimes act that passed House would have set a mandatory minimum of 10 years for crimes committed while in possession of a gun, 15 years for crimes committed while brandishing a gun, and 20 years for crimes committed while firing a gun. In the final version of the bill, the length of the sentences were cut in half.

Actions Speak Louder than Words

At the same time, Sanders voted against a bill that would have “demilitarized” the police. The Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995, sponsored by Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Florida), called for establishing drug courts and prohibited local governments from purchasing tanks or armored personnel carriers.

When the police responded to protests that morphed into riots in Ferguson, Sanders said they looked like ‘an occupying army.’

When the police responded to protests that morphed into riots in Ferguson, Sanders said they looked like “an occupying army.” “I think we gotta rethink a lot this heavy equipment that police departments around the country are utilizing,” he told MSNBC’s Ed Schultz.

Later on in his career Sanders did vote against some bills aimed at increasing criminal sentences. In 1999, he voted against the Juvenile Justice bill, which established minimums for selling guns to kids. He also voted against the Unborn Victims Violence Act of 1999 (sponsored by fellow presidential candidate Lindsey Graham), which would have added additional charges for attacks on a pregnant woman that resulted in injury to the fetus.

FeelTheBern.org, an independent website supporting Bernie, says, “Bernie has been a long-time critic of our justice system’s over-reliance on incarceration,” and while that may be true, he hasn’t done enough besides critiquing. If he turns criminal justice into a false choice between “educat[ing] or electrocut[ing],” his record shows he has come down on the side of electrocuting. He may be right that the number of inmates in the United States has quadrupled since 1980, and he was part of the reason.

"Yes, You Can Call A Thief A Criminal","Language shapes thought, so of course now no linguistic matter is too small to evaluate for sufficient progressive bona fides (and signaling value). Recently, some frustrated San Franciscans learned this lesson the hard way when online commenters took them to task for daring to call thieves “criminals” on a popular website established to help neighbors get and stay in touch with each other in our increasingly socially fragmented world.

But they were in the right. You can call a thief a “criminal.” In fact, you should. Norms of behavior, even roughly applied to strangers, are indispensable to social life.

To make a long and ridiculous story very short, an online discussion of neighborhood crime amongst residents of Noe Valley and Glen Park in San Francisco hit the rocks when a resident suggested that, instead of calling local thieves “criminals,” others should refer to them as, for instance, “the person who stole my bike.” This turn of phrase, Malkia Cyril argued, will help re-humanize the discussion of local problems without disparaging members of the community who just so happen to be disobeying basic social rules.

To be sure, not everyone agreed with Cyril (who is no stranger to social activism and works as the executive director of the Center for Media Justice). But her don’t-call-a-thief-a-criminal position definitely garnered 61 “likes” and a variety of approving to jaw-dropping responses (“We must look at ourselves and our values and do what we can to create community, not just worry about our own ‘security’”).

If You Can’t Help Yourself, We Will

If this linguistic policing of law-abiding people (and reticence to actually police non-law-abiding people) strikes you as absurd, well, it absolutely should. If and when “microaggressions” are real, they harm the innocent, not the guilty. People who object to calling a thief a “criminal” basically place themselves on the worse side of a two-horned dilemma regarding their view of the, uh, entrepreneurs in question.

Moral personhood has implications for praise, blame, and how to include a being in our moral fold.

If the criminals genuinely, literally cannot help but commit more crime (because inequality rose, or they use drugs, or whatever), then they are not the types of agents who bear responsibility for their actions. They may deserve our sympathies and help, but this should affect the forms those will take—forms that won’t thrill the same social-justice activists who insisted the criminals are passive victims in the first place.

A lack of agency means the solution for these people who steal bikes is, perhaps, compulsory health care or institutionalization. Beings without agency can be treated kindly, but since they are not engaged in deliberate choice-making, they cannot give or withhold consent to conditions that affect them in a fully human fashion. Paternalism is therefore in order.

The alternative is to continue to see most (probably not all) criminals as persons in the full moral sense, as moral agents who make their own autonomous choices and are therefore responsible for their actions. But to ascribe moral personhood to someone isn’t just a feel-good phrase: moral personhood has implications for praise, blame, and how to include a being in our moral fold.

Moral persons must own up to the ways they’ve betrayed a community’s trust, and they must choose to act in ways that re-establish them as community members in good standing. This means no stealing (other than through the ordinary tax collector-sanctioned channels).

We Can’t Have Community If You’re Victimizing Me

San Francisco has a growing crime problem, which makes Cyril’s fantasyland proposal more threatening than laughable. In the real world, rather than providing a profound moment for dialogue and healing, crime simply begets more crime. It is not possible to put “creating community” before ensuring security. Instead, the latter is a condition of the former.

In the real world, rather than providing a profound moment for dialogue and healing, crime simply begets more crime.

Even theorists of restorative justice recognize that forgiveness and abridged punishment aimed at restoring community (rather than meting out retribution) require more truthfulness and accountability from perpetrators, not less. Garden-variety social-justice enthusiasts make a mockery of this legitimate philosophy when they suggest that literally nothing is required from perpetrators of crime—not stopping, not confessing, not making restitution—and that the entire material burden of recreating community falls on everyone else.

There are some times and places when it makes sense to tread lightly on labeling criminals. Journalists and lawyers, for instance, are obligated to refrain from prematurely identifying the accused as proven guilty. These are appropriate norms of professional speech, but they do not bind the rest of us in our ordinary lives.

I saw a man pushing a shopping cart stacked with bicycles moseying through my South of Market neighborhood here in San Francisco at 4 a.m. last night. It simply defies logic to resist mentally categorizing him as a thief.

There are benefits to living in areas too dense to know everyone, but there are certain limitations, too. For example, you can’t behave as if you are a threat to people’s property and persons without being labeled as such by strangers. Maybe in a smaller town we’d know more about my block bike collector’s extenuating circumstances, such as either his lifelong struggle with mental illness or his serious lack of cashflow for heroin. But for urban life to remain at all workable, we need strong norms of public behavior and the attendant social pressures of calling a spade a spade.

Democrats' New Secret Weapon Vs. Terrorists? Gun Control,"Having overwhelmingly lost the public debate about whether the Obama administration’s Syrian refugee screening policy should be enhanced, Democrats have retreated to more comfortable rhetorical ground: demanding more gun control.

Their new secret weapon? A bill that would ban anyone whose name appears on a terror watch list from buying or possessing a firearm. The idea sounds reasonable enough until you dig into the details and realize that the proposed Democratic legislation is a shocking assault on the constitutional right to due process. What makes the proposal even worse is that the Democrats’ assault on due process isn’t necessary to accomplish what they say is their only goal: preventing “dangerous terrorists” from legally purchasing or possessing a firearm.

The new bill, which Democrats have dubbed the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015, gives the U.S. attorney general the authority to “deny the sale, delivery, or transfer of a firearm or the issuance of a firearms or explosives license or permit to dangerous terrorists.”

According to several Democratic sponsors of the bill, the proposed law would allow the attorney general to deny a criminal background check clearance to any individual whose name appears on the national terror watch list. The huge problem with this expansive new power is that there are precisely zero statutory criteria for inclusion on this massive list. In fact, when statutory authority for the centralized government database was first codified into law via the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Congress gave all authority for determining criteria for inclusion in the watch list to unelected, unaccountable government bureaucrats. If some faceless Beltway bureaucrat decides you might be a terrorist, then you’re a terrorist. End of story.

It gets even worse, though. If your name erroneously appears on that watch list, which as of 2013 included nearly 900,000 names, the Democrats’ proposed legislation renders you virtually powerless to find out why your name is on there, let alone to have it removed. And having your name erroneously or fraudulently added to that list isn’t as far-fetched as you might think.

In 2014, for example, Weekly Standard writer and Fox News contributor Stephen F. Hayes was informed that somebody added his name to the Department of Homeland Security’s terrorist watch list. There is zero credible evidence that he has any ties whatsoever to terrorism or to any terrorist organizations. Yet, under the Democrats’ new bill, he and everyone else who is erroneously listed would be banned from ever purchasing or possessing a firearm. Hayes’ apparent crime was traveling overseas for a cruise. Hayes is not alone. Each year, thousands of names end up on the terror watch list for no good reason whatsoever.

Under the Democrats’ proposal, the government doesn’t have to tell you why your name is on the list. The proposed law allows the government to keep that information secret. And if you decide to take the government to court over it, the Democrats’ bill creates a brand new legal standard that tilts the scales of justice against you.

Unlike a standard criminal trial, in which a jury must decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether you have violated a criminal law, under this proposed law the government must only show a preponderance of evidence–evidence which will almost certainly be redacted–in order to strip you of your Second Amendment right to defend yourself and your family from terrorists:

In any case in which the Attorney General has denied the transfer of a firearm to a prospective transferee pursuant to section 922A of this title or has made a determination regarding a firearm permit applicant pursuant to section 922B of this title, an action challenging the determination may be brought against the United States. The petition shall be filed not later than 60 days after the petitioner has received actual notice of the Attorney General’s determination under section 922A or 922B of this title. The court shall sustain the Attorney General’s determination upon a showing by the United States by a preponderance of evidence that the Attorney General’s determination satisfied the requirements of section 922A or 922B, as the case may be. To make this showing, the United States may submit, and the court may rely upon, summaries or redacted versions of documents containing information the disclosure of which the Attorney General has determined would likely compromise national security.

Remember, you don’t have to be convicted of any crime whatsoever to end up on the terrorist watch list. You don’t even have to be charged with a crime to lose your constitutional rights under the proposed law. If this proposed legislation were to become law, some DHS bureaucrat–perhaps the type of bureaucrat who wrote earlier this year that “right-wing terrorists” pose the biggest threat to American national security–only needs to snap his fingers and add your name to the blacklist in order to immediately deprive you of your Second Amendment rights and your constitutional right to due process. You don’t even get to review the entirety of the evidence against you.

The blatant unconstitutional deprivation of due process is more than sufficient reason to oppose this piece of legislation, but it’s not the only reason. There may actually be an even bigger reason to reject it: it is completely unnecessary, because the U.S. attorney general already has the power to prevent “dangerous terrorists” from legally buying guns, and that power can be exercised without unconstitutional deprivation of due process.

All the attorney general has to do to prevent “dangerous terrorists” from legally purchasing firearms is to indict them. That’s it. Charge these terrorists with terrorism, and their legal right to purchase firearms goes up in smoke. That’s because existing federal law states that anyone who’s been indicted for any crime that carries a prison sentence of more than one year–and felony indictment for conspiracy to commit terrorism certainly satisfies that standard–automatically becomes ineligible to purchase or possess a firearm:

The Gun Control Act (GCA) makes it unlawful for certain categories of persons to ship, transport, receive, or possess firearms. 18 USC 922(g). Transfers of firearms to any such prohibited persons are also unlawful. 18 USC 922(d).



These categories include any person:



Under indictment or information in any court for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;



convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;



who is a fugitive from justice;



who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance;



who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution;



who is an illegal alien;



who has been discharged from the military under dishonorable conditions;



who has renounced his or her United States citizenship;



who is subject to a court order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of the intimate partner; or



who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (enacted by the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208, effective September 30, 1996). 18 USC 922(g) and (n).

The language in the Democrats’ new gun control bill certainly suggests that these “dangerous terrorists” should be indicted for terrorism. After all, it gives the attorney general authority to deny background check clearance to anyone “known (or appropriately suspected) to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism, or providing material support or resources for terrorism[.]”

Engaging in terrorism is a federal crime. Providing material support for terrorism is a federal crime. Preparing to engage in terrorism is a federal crime. If there is sufficient evidence to show that these individuals are engaged in terrorism, the best way to make America safer is to indict these terrorists and arrest them.

The attorney general absolutely has that power, which raises a very troubling question given the premise of the Democrats’ proposed legislation: why are hundreds of thousands of known, dangerous terrorists walking free in America right now? Why have they not been indicted for their crimes? Why is American law enforcement not working 24/7 to secure indictments for these terrorists, to arrest them, and to convict them for their crimes against America?

Why won't Obama's DOJ indict these terrorists and arrest them? Why is Obama so intent on letting them roam free? https://t.co/Rsn14C8jSz



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) November 21, 2015

The simple answer is that there’s not sufficient evidence to indict, let alone convict, the hundreds of thousands of names included on the terrorist watch list. Once you realize that fact, you realize that the purpose of this bill isn’t to prevent “dangerous terrorists” from possessing guns–the attorney general can already accomplish that with a simple indictment–it’s to prevent evil Republicans from possessing political power. The proposed legislation from Democrats is nothing more than a clumsy attempt at wedge-issue politics: rather than dealing with an actual terror threat from ISIS, just pretend that Republicans and the monstrous National Rifle Association are hell-bent on protecting a “loophole” that allows dangerous terrorists to get guns.

Due process isn’t a “loophole,” though. Due process is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. It states that the government cannot permanently deprive you of your constitutional rights unless and until a jury of your peers has decided beyond a reasonable doubt that you have committed a criminal act.

The silly gun control proposal from Democrats attempts to turn the principle of due process on its head. Instead of requiring a jury of your peers to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that you have committed a crime, Democrats have decided that power should belong to a handful of Washington, D.C.-based bureaucrats. Instead of allowing you to review and challenge all evidence presented against you, Democrats have decided that evidence should be kept secret. Instead of requiring a legal standard that all reasonable doubt must be eliminated prior to the government-sanctioned revocation of your rights, Democrats have decided that a mere preponderance of evidence should be plenty.

Democrats aren’t doing this because they think it’s the only possible way to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons. We know this because we’ve established that the attorney general already has all the power she needs to indict, arrest, convict, and sentence known, dangerous terrorists. Democrats are doing this because they think it will benefit them politically. In the wake of a massive terrorist attack on free, innocent people in Paris, Washington Democrats have decided that their real enemy isn’t ISIS. Just like Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton declared in a recent debate, their real enemies are Republicans.

And they’ll do whatever they can to defeat these dangerous electoral terrorists…even if it requires the wholesale elimination of the constitutional right to due process.

Why The New York Times’s Gun Ban Is Utter Fantasy,"The New York Times published an editorial on its front page for the first time since 1920. Entitled “End the Gun Epidemic in America,” its placement and strong language reflect the editors’ outrage over the recent mass shootings and their sense of urgency that something needs to be done.

But “doing something” for the sake of “doing something” is not a sound reason to enact any policy proposal. Moral outrage does not turn a bad idea into a good one. And a careful reading of the editorial reveals a vague and unrealistic policy suggestion that, if enacted, would come with high costs while barely doing anything to prevent gun violence or gun deaths generally.

Beyond the heated rhetoric (“moral outrage,” “national disgrace,” “weapons of war”), the Times suggests “eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammunition” by outlawing them. It states that “[c]ertain kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in California, and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian ownership.”

Gun Ban Logistics Are Staggering

Setting aside the political impracticalities of the Times’ proposal, it faces serious practical and logistical problems. First, there is no easily defined category of long rifle called a “combat rifle” or “assault weapon” that can be banned. These weapons are semi-automatic rifles that fire one bullet with one pull of a trigger, like countless other rifles. Fully automatic weapons are already heavily regulated and almost never used to commit a crime. Legislation banning assault rifles generally focuses on style (pistol grips, detachable magazines, and other features deemed military-like) rather than substance (the semi-automatic rifle itself).

As James Jacobs, director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, argues in a recent article, “banning assault weapons is pointless” because they are “functionally equivalent to other semi-automatics and . . . figure hardly at all in violent crime.” In 2013, of the 8,454 gun homicides the Federal Bureau of Investigation tracked, only 285 were traced to rifles of all kinds, as opposed to 5,782 that were tied to handguns.

Every rifle would need to be registered, and additional costs would derive from the coercive measures needed to force people to register.

Perhaps one could solve the definitional problem by outlawing the sale of all semi-automatic rifles. Ignoring the political realities of this, it would still probably not stop the use of these weapons because so many U.S. households already own at least one of them. And any actual movement towards such a ban would lead to an incredible surge in sales, considering the sales spikes that have occurred when talk of much less restrictive gun control measures occurred after previous mass shootings.

There would also be the logistical problem in the form of huge administrative costs for citizens and the government. The costs would be large because every rifle would need to be registered, and additional costs would derive from the coercive measures, such as fines or jail time, needed to force people to register. Those who accidentally or intentionally failed to register properly would face criminal penalties.

Additionally, all private-party sales, gifts, or other transfers, including loans, would have to be tracked. This would generate an incredible amount of paperwork for law-abiding citizens and for the government, which would have to both set up and manage this system.

Inflating Bureaucracy Won’t Stop Violence

Even if we pretend all of this could be done in a reasonably cost-effective manner, someone willing to commit mass murder can just break a few laws to obtain the guns, so these policies would actually stop few shootings. Surveys of inmates show that most criminals obtain guns on the black or grey market, and they could still do so after such policies are passed. A potential mass murderer is not likely to fill out a form if it would stop him. If they can legally purchase the gun, then commit mass murder, they will.

A potential mass murderer is not likely to fill out a form if it would stop him.

The Times does have a solution to the already purchased weapons problem: “Yes, [our proposal] would require Americans who own these kinds of weapons to give them up for the good of their fellow citizens.” This solution would cost billions of dollars, but would be unlikely to save many lives.

In a world of perfect compliance, just the cost of buying back the semi-automatic rifles will be large. A few years ago, Slate tried to estimate the cost of buying back certain types of firearms. Using some numbers from the article, such as there being 110 million rifles in the United States, and my estimate that 10 percent of them, or 11 million, would be of the banned types, and estimating an average cost of $700 per rifle (which is conservative), the price tag just for the buyback portion would be $7.7 billion.

Even if officials ignored the takings clause of the Constitution along with the Second Amendment, which carries its own intangible costs, the loss of wealth would be real. It would just be borne by a class of citizens instead of all taxpayers.

One could only imagine the far-right backlash and potential violence.

This excludes costs associated with running the program, enforcing compliance, and disposing of the weapons. It also ignores the lost utility from gun owners who can no longer derive pleasure from owning the weapon. Additionally, the cost of coercion would not only involve fining or imprisoning those who fail to comply intentionally or accidently, but it would likely involve heavily armed government agents having to seize these weapons from holdouts.

Considering the scope of the backlash to far less-intrusive government actions, such as the Cliven Bundy incident, one could only imagine the far-right backlash and potential violence. While this type of behavior is deplorable, the reality that it would occur and create additional costs cannot be ignored.

Stop Making Impossible Demands

Attempts to narrow the ban and confiscation to assault weapons would leave millions of semi-automatic rifles in circulation that could easily be turned into assault rifles, while still costing billions and imposing many of the other costs listed above. For example, the Slate article calculated there are more than 3 million of just AR-15-style rifles in the United States.

The cost in money, violations of civil liberties, and the related political realities of making any version of the Times’ program work are not justified.

Either a narrow assault-weapon ban and confiscation or a broader semi-automatic rifle ban and confiscation miserably fail any serious cost-benefit analysis. The cost in money, violations of civil liberties, and the related political realities of making any version of the Times’ program work, when weighed against the meager benefits, are not justified.

Additionally, a total ban would not even stop many of these attacks. Despite extremely stringent gun control laws, the French terrorists just purchased illegal weapons smuggled in from another country. Attackers could switch to handguns—a recent Times article about how 15 recent mass shooters obtained their weapons shows that more shooters used handguns than rifles.

One might now wonder what the United States can do to reduce mass shootings, or gun violence in general. Steps can be taken, but there are no easy, costless answers. Potential policy choices include more gun control, different law enforcement strategies, and changes in the American mental health system.

Gun-control measures could be anything from restrictions on magazine sizes to broader bans on those with mental illnesses from possessing guns. But they have some of the same issues as discussed above. More aggressive law enforcement against potential terrorists (Islamic and right-wing) and those most likely to commit gun crimes, such as those with a violent crime record, would probably be more effective—but that also involves monetary and civil liberty costs. Ditto for changes in the mental health system. However, policy proposals from all three of these areas exist that would be much more effective than the Times’ proposal, since few could be worse.

Why Congress Cut The CDC’s Gun Research Budget,"Not long ago, after the mass shooting in Sandy Hook, President Obama issued an executive order that lifted the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) ban on researching gun violence. Despite this, some say the CDC has still not touched gun violence because Congress has blocked funding for this.

Congress removed the CDC’s $2.6 million budget for research into this subject in 1997, after the National Rifle Association (NRA) asked for congressional intervention. But why?

If you were to ask mainstream media outlets that have weighed in, they would tell you the NRA and gun-rights advocates are afraid of what the studies would find, and that the ban came after a damning study concluded guns do cause violence. For this reason gun-rights advocates lobbied to effectively ban the CDC from conducting research on firearm violence altogether.

Firstly, CDC was not banned from doing the research. In fact, CDC articles pertaining to firearms have held steady since the defunding, and even increased to 121 in 2013.

CDC very recently released a 16-page report that was commissioned by the city council of Wilmington, Delaware, on factors contributing to its abnormally high gun crime, and methods of prevention. The study weighed factors such as where the guns were coming from, the sex of the offenders, likeliness of committing a gun crime, and how unemployment plays a factor. In other words it studied, the environment surrounding the crime.

This did not go over well with some in the media, who were disappointed it didn’t implicate firearms as a cause and not an effect. Kate Masters of VICE.com wrote, “If the CDC wasn’t going to consider the role of firearms in Wilmington’s gun crimes, why do the study at all?” That sounds an awful lot like, “If you have nothing bad to say about guns, then don’t say anything.”

Regardless, the narrative here is that gun lobbyists are injecting politics into a serious health issue for the American public. The truth is something a bit less clandestine, at least coming from NRA and Congress.

CDC Leaders Admit They Want to Ban Guns

In the late ’80s and early ’90s, the CDC was openly biased in opposing gun rights. CDC official and research head Patrick O’Carroll stated in a 1989 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, “We’re going to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes deaths.” This sounds more like activist rhetoric than it does scientific research, as O’Carroll effectively set out with the goal of confirmation bias, saying “We will prove it,” and not the scientific objectiveness of asking “Does it?”

‘It used to be that smoking was a glamour symbol — cool, sexy, macho. Now it is dirty, deadly — and banned.’

O’Carroll went on to deny he had said this, claiming he was misquoted. However, his successor and director of the CDC National Center of Injury Prevention branch Mark Rosenberg told Rolling Stone in 1993 that he “envisions a long term campaign, similar to tobacco use and auto safety, to convince Americans that guns are, first and foremost, a public health menace.” He went on to tell the Washington Post in 1994 “We need to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like what we did with cigarettes. It used to be that smoking was a glamour symbol — cool, sexy, macho. Now it is dirty, deadly — and banned.”

CDC leaders were not shy about their intentions of banning guns from the public. Sure enough, they acted on their desires. In October 1993, The New England Journal of Medicine released a study funded by the CDC to the tune of $1.7 million, entitled “Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home.” The leader author was Dr. Arthur Kellermann, an epidemiologist, physician, and outspoken advocate of gun control.

In the study, Kellerman concluded that people who kept guns in their homes were 2.7 times more likely to be homicide victims as people who don’t. Major media outlets, such as the New York Times, still cite these statistics.

Unreliable Gun Research

However, the research was beyond flawed. For one, Kellermann used epidemiological methods in an attempt to investigate an issue dealing with criminology. In effect, this means he was treating gun violence the same as, say, the spread of West Nile, or bird flu.

It provided no proof or examples that the murder weapon used in these crimes belonged to the homeowner or had been kept in that home.

Furthermore, the gun victims he studied were anomalies. They were selected from homicide victims living in metropolitan areas with high gun-crime statistics, which completely discounted the statistical goliath of areas where gun owners engage in little to no crime.

Other factors that lent to the study’s unreliability were: It is based entirely on people murdered in their homes, with 50 percent admitting this was the result of a “quarrel or romantic triangle,” and 30 percent said it was during a drug deal or other felonies such as rape or burglary; it made no consideration for guns used in self-defense; it provided no proof or examples that the murder weapon used in these crimes belonged to the homeowner or had been kept in that home.

These problems prompted objections and questions from leading scientists in the field of criminology, such as Yale University professor John Lott, Florida State’s Gary Kleck, and University of Massachusetts sociology professors James D. Wright and Peter H. Rossi. Their research had come to vastly different conclusions, and they found the methodology unsound.

As Lott says of Kellermann’s study in his book, “More Guns, Less Crime”:

To demonstrate this, suppose that we use the same statistical method—with a matching control group—to do a study on the efficacy of hospital care. Assume that we collect data just as these authors did, compiling a list of all the people who died in a particular county over the period of a year. Then we ask their relatives whether they had been admitted to the hospital during the previous year. We also put together a control sample consisting of neighbors who are part of the same sex, race, and age group. Then we ask these men and women whether they have been in a hospital during the past year. My bet is that those who spent time in hospitals are much more likely to have died — quite probably a stronger relationship than that between homicides and gun ownership in Kellerman’s study. If so, would we take that as evidence that hospitals kill people?

He summarized, “it’s like comparing 100 people who went to a hospital in a given year with 100 similar people who did not, finding that more of the hospital patients died, and then announcing that hospitals increase the risk of death.”

The final nail in the coffin came in 1995 when the Injury Prevention Network Newsletter told its readers to “organize a picket at gun manufacturing sites” and to “work for campaign finance reform to weaken the gun lobby’s political clout.” Appearing on the same page as the article pointing the finger at gun owners for the Oklahoma City bombing were the words, “This newsletter was supported in part by Grant #R49/CCR903697-06 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

Tax Dollars Shouldn’t Aim to Influence Politics

After these blatant attempts at gun control, the NRA blew the whistle on the CDC and prompted Congress to take action. They did, stripping CDC’s funding for research into firearm crime.

Political bias was already present, and the NRA and Congress acted to remove it.

Those who accuse the NRA, Republicans, and gun advocates of attempting to inject their political bias into federal research on gun crime are not telling the whole story. With the picture complete, we can see that political bias was already present, and the NRA and Congress had acted to remove it.

In effect, the CDC was using taxpayer money to inject a biased and false narrative into the American discussion on firearms. It wasn’t doing research, it was creating propaganda.

CDC was being used as a political tool to become the Center for Gun Control, and while there are firearm-related elements the CDC’s expertise would be well-suited for (take the Wilmington report, for instance), the subject of gun crime should not be turned into an epidemiological issue.

A gun will not give you cancer, nor cause you to contract AIDS. Guns do not carry viruses like mosquitos. Gun crime should be dealt with as the thing that it is: crime.

You Can Support The Police And Racial Justice,"Is it rational for black men to fear they may be killed by police? The Washington Post has just released a new, groundbreaking study on police violence that may help answer that question. It investigates every fatal police shooting in the United States in 2015. You can see the data here.

Plenty of arresting details come out of this study. Those who followed the Tamir Rice case may be interested to know that realistic-looking toy guns were involved in fully 3 percent of the shootings. Almost 10 percent of victims were unarmed when they were killed, and a very disproportionate number of these were black. About a quarter of the suspects were fleeing when they were shot, while a quarter struggled with mental illness.

The headliner, though, is something we already knew: a lot of Americans get killed in police shootings. As of Christmas Eve, police in America had fatally shot 979 people across the United States. (The Guardian, with a similar study, puts the number over 1,000.)

That’s a lot, when you consider that multiple European countries can count on one hand the number of fatal police shootings each year. Every country is different, of course, in innumerable ways. Nevertheless, such enormous disparities should prompt some probing questions.

Are Cops Racist?

This of course is the question on everyone’s mind. The study won’t definitively answer it, but it may help flesh out the picture of what’s really happening in America’s more crime-ridden districts.

Some contend this data puts to rest any reasonable concern about widespread racial bias in America’s police departments. It’s true of course that young, black men are far more likely to be shot and killed by police. That’s easily explicable, however, in terms of disproportionate crime rates, and there’s no evidence that white-on-black violence is in at all disproportionate to levels of crime. David French summarizes the argument neatly as follows:

Crime doesn’t break down on neat, proportionate demographic lines. Criminals are overwhelmingly male (police killed very few women this year, but no one argues that law enforcement is sexist), and violent criminals are disproportionately black. In fact, blacks ‘commit homicide at close to eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined.’ Even worse, ‘among males between the ages of 14 and 17, the interracial homicide commission gap is nearly tenfold.’ In 2014, for example, while black Americans constituted only about 13 percent of the population, they represented a majority of the homicide and robbery arrests. 82 percent of all gun deaths in the black community are from homicide. For whites, 77 percent of gun deaths are suicides.

On face, this is a compelling argument. Blacks commit more violent crimes (dramatically more, in fact) than whites. Is it surprising they are disproportionately shot by police? If anything, racial disparities should be seen as a good sign, that police are going after the folks who are really committing crimes.

So if you’re raising a black son in America (so the logic goes), you should simply teach him to be a law-abiding citizen. That should be protection enough from the hazards of law-enforcement.

Black Lives Matter May Still Have A Point

As usual, the obvious explanation is a little too obvious. Let’s consider a slightly more nuanced explanation of the data, which may give some credence to the anxieties of Black Lives Matter, without assuming that police officers are raging bigots.

Black men really are responsible for a wildly disproportionate number of America’s homicides. In some neighborhoods, these mostly go unsolved. They are primarily committed in the context of gang rivalries, and police find these cases challenging to close, because available witnesses are too afraid to testify. (Their families live in these neighborhoods, and are liable to be targeted if witnesses come forward.)

Many of the cops who patrol these neighborhoods are really just doing their time until they can get a better assignment.

Law enforcement tends to be less aggressive about prosecuting “insider violence” (committed among mafiosos, gangsters, or members of criminal organizations). That’s readily understandable, of course. We all realize that violence is an occupational hazard of being a criminal, and most of us would agree that a police force should prioritize the safety of the law-abiding.

Still, one consequence is that the cycle of vengeance tends to continue, since gangsters have a high level of confidence they can (literally) get away with murder.

The police that work these neighborhoods are frequently undertrained and overwhelmed. There are some quiet, mostly unsung heroes who go on working the cases with few thanks, under harrowing conditions. But many of the cops who patrol these neighborhoods are really just doing their time until they can get a better assignment.

Others may care, but just not be up to the difficult task of imposing order on violence-riddled subcultures. They’re genuinely scared for their own lives. So (particularly if the climate of their department has not discouraged this) they get skittish, and sometimes make bad decisions. When guys with guns are making erratic decisions, people die.

Are Statistics Victimizing Law-Abiding Innocents?

Now, let’s return to the question of statistics. We know that lots of black men commit crimes, and that lots of black men are shot by the police. At first glance, the rough parity seems to make sense.

We needn’t see the police as racist in order to suspect that a youngster like Rice would have had better odds if he’d been white.

Thinking more about the dynamics of neighborhoods in which these shootings take place, we might want to ask more questions. Are the people getting shot the same ones who are committing crimes? The majority probably are, but remember, we’re talking about neighborhoods in which homicides are committed in large numbers, but mostly not solved, while too many officers remain undertrained and skittish.

It isn’t silly for innocent people who “look like criminals” in obvious ways (like being young, black, and male) to worry they may be at significantly greater risk of being mistaken for criminals, even if they aren’t doing anything illegal.

Taking all of this into account, we should probably be interested in the fact that unarmed black men are seven times more likely than whites to be fatally shot by police. Unarmed doesn’t mean innocent, of course, but that’s still a very big number.

Is it really strange that residents of high-crime neighborhoods often view the police with fear and resentment? Is it wrong for parents to feel that it might be dangerous to let their black sons play with water pistols or wear hoodies? That’s a depressing thought.

We needn’t see the police as racist in order to suspect that a youngster like Rice would have had better odds if he’d been white. That’s a grim thought, too.

More Resources and Higher Standards

Let’s be clear. An 18-year-old black man is in far more danger than I am of being shot by the police. That likely holds even if we’re standing on the same street corner, behaving the same way. At the same time, black men are far more likely to be shot by other black men than by cops.

We should be bothered by a justice climate that leaves even law-abiding blacks feeling personally threatened, with some justification.

Those two facts are related. Insofar as police make bad mistakes, that’s largely because they’re being asked to tackle big problems with limited resources. They deserve to be cut some slack (though, crucially, not an infinite amount).

We don’t have to choose between a pro-police stance and a pro-racial-justice stance. We should support law enforcement and the rights of minorities. Even if we agree that most police officers probably aren’t personally bigoted, we should be bothered by a justice climate that leaves even law-abiding blacks feeling personally threatened, with some justification.

It’s a problem, and instead of mulling over the complexities of moral responsibility, we should be looking for ways to address it. The most obvious conclusion is that we should invest more resources in better-quality law enforcement in high-crime areas.

Real police reform is going to involve a lot of tit-for-tat. Raise salaries, so police forces can recruit talent more aggressively, and push for merit-based pay scales that reward the sorts of officers who do useful and needed things (de-escalating tense neighborhood situations, closing homicides). Invest more in training programs that help officers learn to defuse tense situations, and to keep themselves safe without using excessive force.

Law-abiding Americans should be able to move safely through public spaces, regardless of what they look like.

At the same time, strip union contracts of provisions that hinder Internal Affairs divisions from investigating use-of-force complaints. (If you think this will frighten talented people away from policing, consider that juries in general are very sympathetic to cops, even despite the public relations fiascos of the past few years. They are reluctant to convict cops unless the abuse of power is truly egregious.)

If you’re wondering where the money will come from to pay for these improvements, consider that both crime and incarceration are very expensive. By reducing both, effective policing tends to pay for itself.

Raise transparency with body and dashboard cameras, and respond seriously to complaints of low-level police bullying. Think of this as the flip side of the “broken window” theory: bully cops can do far more damage to the force’s reputation than immediate ramifications might suggest.

Crucially, we must get away from using the police as a major source of revenue. As Ferguson, Missouri, clearly shows us, pressuring cops to act as your niggling tax-collectors is not worth it given the cost in public resentment and reduced police effectiveness.

Law-abiding Americans should be able to move safely through public spaces, regardless of what they look like. Black kids shouldn’t have to get tutorials from their parents about staying safe from cops. Shouldn’t we all be able to agree on these things? Let’s support our police by giving them the resources they need, and demanding that they be the good guys.

How To Stop Police Problems Before They Become Shootings,"Rahm Emanuel is a liar who is eyeball-deep in corruption. He almost certainly used $5 million of taxpayers’ money to pay off the family of a murdered teenager, for the sake of preserving his political campaign. We can’t prove this. Everyone knows that it’s true.

Here are some other unpleasant facts everyone knows (at least if they’re paying attention). Chicago is drowning in debt and corruption. It’s a sinkhole of crime and cronyism, and the police have been riddled with problems, quite literally, for decades.

As with so many “everyone knows” problems, there are ways to fix this. Emanuel’s resignation would be a good start. (Sorry, but a lying apology is just an insult to all of us.) But that’s really just the beginning. The Chicago PD needs some serious restructuring. With marchers demanding action and the feds moving in, will things finally improve? That may be up to the people of Chicago.

Let’s Talk About Chicago’s Police Problem

It’s serious. That’s been clear to interested observers for a long, long time. It’s painful to say this, because I’m sure Chicago has many dedicated officers who are trying very hard to protect the public in difficult circumstances. Here’s the harsh truth, though. If the Chicago Police Department makes the news, the story is either unflattering or literally unbelievable.

The Chicago PD decided to leave certain murders unsolved and unpunished, for the sake of juking the stats.

Chicago’s reputation for police brutality goes back some years. We were recently reminded of this when the city offered millions in “reparations” to torture victims who suffered at the hands of Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge’s infamous “midnight crew.” Burge is a particularly dark spot in Chicago’s police history, but the list of “indiscretions” goes on (and on and on).

This year the department has been hit with a lawsuit from two officers who claim they were harassed, demoted, and deliberately put in danger for working with Internal Affairs, trying to catch corrupt cops who were believed to be taking kickbacks from drug dealers. A 20-year police veteran issued an affidavit corroborating their claims.

In what appears to be good news, Chicago has been boasting that its crime rates are finally (and very suddenly!) dropping. They credit CompStat, a widely hailed crime-control system that has had impressive results in New York City.

If that sounds a little too good to be true, that’s probably because it is. Chicago Magazine has documented evidence that the city, desperate to reverse its reputation as a hotbed of violent crime, was massaging the stats, most likely with encouragement from Emanuel. Multiple homicides appear to have been reclassified on various spurious grounds. In other words, the Chicago PD decided to leave certain murders unsolved and unpunished, for the sake of juking the stats.

Corruption Is No Secret

I’ll tell you a secret. Police corruption really isn’t so secret. Sometimes the details can be difficult to obtain. That’s aggravating for Internal Affairs, because unlike, say, your corner drug dealers, dirty politicians and ranking police officials have good lawyers, and powerful friends. You need a strong case to bring them down.

Statistics can give us a reasonably good sense of which departments have corruption and abuse-of-power issues.

If you’re looking for the big picture, though, you don’t need a security clearance to see it. Statistics can give us a reasonably good sense of which departments have corruption and abuse-of-power issues.

For the semi-informed public, particular high-profile cases end up looming large in our imagination. Was Michael Brown going for the gun when he was shot? Was Jamar Clark really handcuffed on the ground? What really happened to Freddie Gray?

Everybody loves a good whodunit, but realistically, the details of these particular cases may or may not tell us anything interesting about policing, poverty, or urban crime. Some police shootings are justified. On other occasions, bad cops do reprehensible things, for which they should be punished.

It’s a given that both things do happen in America; our interest should be in ensuring that the latter kind of incident is rare, and strongly discouraged by law enforcement’s structure and ethos. But when the details of a handful of cases radically form public opinion, we’re likely to end up with a badly distorted picture. It’s as if we decided to gauge the state of public health by yanking five people off the street and giving them physicals.

Signs A Police Department Is Corrupt

What does it look like when a police department develops an unhealthy culture that permits abuses of power? For a disturbing peek, consider this recent story from The Guardian, documenting the troubles of Kern County, California, where 13 of the 875,000 residents were fatally shot by police over this past year. By contrast, the Big Apple had only nine fatal police shootings in the same period of time, although it has ten times as many residents and 23 times as many cops.

The Big Apple had only nine fatal police shootings in the same period of time, although it has ten times as many residents and 23 times as many cops.

Of course, statistical trends can’t definitively prove anything. Perhaps Kern County is home to an unusually aggressive band of desperadoes (though if so, it doesn’t show up in its homicide rate, which is right around the national average). But if I were a resident of Kern County, I’d want to know why, in comparison to a member of the New York Police Department, a cop in my county is exponentially more likely to use deadly force.

Our analysis needn’t end there, of course. Blogging at the Washington Post, Radley Balko notes there is a troubling statistical correlation between counties with an unusually high number of death sentences, and counties that have disproportionate numbers of fatal police shootings. “It isn’t difficult to see,” Balko suggests, “how when a DA takes a ‘win at all costs’ approach to fighting crime, that philosophy would permeate an entire county’s law enforcement apparatus, from the beat cop to the DA herself or himself.”

Balko’s observations point to a broader truth the concerned public should remember. Specific cases can raise troubling epistemic questions as the public decides whether to trust the conflicting claims of cops and bystanders. But we needn’t be paralyzed by the ambiguities of a particular he-said-she-said situation, because there are a number of telltale signs that help indicate when law enforcement is sliding into lawlessness.

Digging into the numbers, we can see that police departments and courts vary widely throughout the country. These differences aren’t necessarily explicable in terms of disparate crime rates. Sub-cultures develop within the justice system, such that some counties respect due process far more than others.

When people move into a new neighborhood, they tend to ask about the schools, parks, and pollution rates. Does anyone ask about the number of fatal police shootings, or the percentage of court cases that end in plea bargains? Probably not. But maybe they should.

Support Real Reform, Not Just ‘Community Policing’

Let’s say your county has a police brutality problem. What can you do about it? What changes would actually help?

When city officials talk about improving their police departments, you’re liable to hear the term “community policing” repeated ad nauseum. It’s the perfect buzzword. Most people aren’t sure what it means, but it seems to speak to what they want: the kind of police who will serve the community instead of harassing and bullying.

Like most buzzwords, ‘community policing’ is a nebulous term that can cover a multitude of sins.

Like most buzzwords, “community policing” is a nebulous term that can cover a multitude of sins. Pretty much every department in the country already claims to do it, so clearly the term doesn’t tell you much about the facts on the ground. Don’t give politicians any points for pumping “community policing.”

A reform-minded politician should have a lot to say about transparency. But don’t give people too much credit for using that word, either. You should be hearing words like “body cameras” and “public access.” The real badge of honor goes to the man willing to utter the name of the sacred cow: unions.

Police unions pose a huge obstacle to transparency, consistently opposing transparency measures and often negotiating contracts with measures to protect officers from thorough investigations.

Campaign Zero, in one of its more sensible initiatives, has combed through many police union contracts looking for these clauses. They’ve found such fishy measures as: “waiting periods” requiring investigators to let the evidence against accused officers go cold for two days before documenting anything, measures to slim down the range of civilian complaints that can be investigated, and requirements that complaints against officers be purged every two years.

It’s true, of course, that policemen sometimes need to use force on the job. No one wants to see cowardly departments hang good cops out to dry. But how can it reasonably serve the cause of justice to hobble investigation in this way?

Despite their general hatred of public-sector unions, conservatives have long had a soft spot for police unions, because conservatives respect the law. Chicago shows us what can happen when the guys with the guns aren’t held accountable for what they do.

Go for Transparency

Not every police operation can be completely transparent. Ironically, though, some of the latest research suggests that crime control is often more effective when police are upfront about their activities and enforcement priorities. When would-be criminals know that police are cracking down on particular offenses, they’re liable to modify their behavior to avoid being caught red-handed. That can make it easier for police to address the problems that are a community’s highest priorities.

Crime control is often more effective when police are upfront about their activities and enforcement priorities.

The bottom line is that citizens shouldn’t be satisfied with a police force that uses security concerns as an excuse for keep the public at arm’s length. In general, law enforcement is more successful when the police have an open, working relationship with the communities they serve.

In many contexts, conservatives are energized by security concerns. We’re interested in military questions, and deeply invested in our Second Amendment rights. We tend to feel (rightly!) that it’s our responsibility to be vigilant about ensuring adequate protection for our children and other vulnerable citizens.

Good policing, however, is just as critical to keeping our neighborhoods and families safe. To get it, we need to support our local law enforcement while also demanding that they be held to high standards. Chicago should serve as a reminder of what can happen when we fail to watch the watchers.

Making A Murderer And The Importance Of Popular Crime,"One of the most interesting books I have read in the past few years is Bill James’ Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence. It explores the countless incidents of crimes that became national phenomena over the course of the past century or more, and it does so with James’ trademark combination of snark and specificity. A major point he highlights, though, is how quickly these incidents are swept under the rug – they are viewed as tawdry or tabloid, and even though they may be very popular in the sense of attention (people love to read about them, and the media loves to cover them), the elites view this as gauche and not appropriate for conversation. James makes reference to bringing up JonBenet Ramsey at a party and being looked at as if he had forgotten his pants. Thus, very few lessons are taken away from these experiences as regards America’s system of criminal justice, and critiques of cases are further dismissed if they come from intelligent laypeople, like James, as opposed to actual lawyers.

This, in James’ view, is as big a crock as it was to dismiss the views of sophisticated data analysts in favor of the views of experienced scouts in the world of baseball. It is just as possible for lawyers and investigators to screw up as it is for baseball scouts or software engineers or doctors to screw up, if not more so given the incentives. The difference is that there is a veneer of oratorical protection built into the legal system – that you don’t understand the way the rules work, or the burdens of proof, or the process of appeal – which turn out to be, unlike some of these other professions, mostly bunk.

The presumption of innocence is no longer a real thing. The grand jury indictment system in particular is geared toward producing the outcomes a prosecutor wants, which is how you get a single DA’s office finding it impossible to indict the police officer who killed Eric Garner getting an indictment less than a month later of the man who filmed the footage of his death. James believes that the lay public ought to be more aware of how the justice system actually works, and brought into a currently latent discussion about reforming it. Documentaries like Serial and now Making a Murderer have perhaps helped to take a few steps toward this goal.

What We Talk About When We Talk About Murder

As it relates to Making a Murderer: the core critique of the system is heard in the conversation in a later episode, where Steven Avery – having been jailed for so long for a crime he did not commit, claiming his innocence to his parents – spits out the fatalistic line “poor people lose.” This is not the first time this belief has taken hold regarding our justice system. What crops up frequently in James’ book, and more frequently in times of economic distress, is the convenient scapegoat of the other. The family that doesn’t fit in. The immigrants. The rednecks. The people with yards full of trash, and who have rumors of inbred behavior. It goes away in times of economic plenty, and returns in times of economic stress. Sometimes Justice is blind – sometimes, she weighs the money on those scales. And once the justice system starts its process in popularly noticed crimes, people must choose sides.

The force of attention in crimes that achieve popularity focuses on the ones who don’t fit in. And when that attention comes, it comes quickly and severely, often with terrible ramifications. James uses the example of what would happen if everyone in an office of a hundred people decided together to suddenly start paying a great deal of attention to a certain copy secretary. By noon, you can imagine the secretary would already be behaving differently than normal. When the crush of attention came for a member of the household staff in the case of the Lindbergh baby’s abduction, she committed suicide before her second police interview. It was later found that she was innocent of anything other than having gone on a date with a man who was not her fiancé on the night in question. Attention changes behavior – for cops, for lawyers, and for the accused.

In this case, having read and watched a good bit outside the documentary, I am of the opinion that Steven Avery is the likeliest party to have done it; that local police, including some very obviously corrupt ones, were convinced he did it, and had other motivations to put him away; and that they purposefully forged or altered a good deal of evidence – including the forcible Brendan Dassey interview, the most prominent act of professional misconduct by the prosecution and the investigators – in order to make sure he went away. (Their problem from the beginning was an absence of evidence – especially given their theory of the case, there should have been an absurd amount of bloody evidence compared to what they found.) The local priority was not to solve the crime, but to extirpate this troublesome family. The defense interviewer’s line remains the most disturbing expression of this: “This is truly where the devil resides in comfort. I can find no good in any member. These people are pure evil. A friend suggested this is a one-branch family tree. Cut this tree down. We need to end the gene pool here.” And this is someone ostensibly working to serve the legal interests of that family! No wonder people believe our systems of law are corrupt.

Now of course, none of this means Steven Avery is innocent. There is a great deal of evidence that he is guilty. But there are simply so many things you have to believe to buy either theory of the case, either that of the prosecution or the defense, that require you to suspend belief. The case as the prosecution presented it in Brandon Dassey’s trial does not stand up at all and requires you to believe the theory they presented in the first trial is thoroughly false; it is unconscionable he was convicted. It requires you to believe she was murdered in a different place, that she was murdered in a different way, that she was moved in a different way, and indeed that the entire timeline has to be rejiggered with multiple eyewitnesses ignored. That’s the real travesty here.

Were Dassey and Avery to be retried in different venues, the case against Dassey would be thrown out in a day. Avery, on the other hand, could potentially be convicted again, and perhaps rightly. What that conviction ought to be based on is not the grandstanding of corrupt prosecutors, but the solemn command that such a conviction ought to be based on evidence which places guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a concept that we may not have any more in this country. Perhaps that is a temporary problem brought on by the declines of the past 15 years. Perhaps it is more permanent. And if that is so, the system of justice and of juries that we have here may at some point need to be reconsidered.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/01/11/making-a-murderer-and-the-importance-of-popular-crime/,2016-01-11
"Barry Latzer on Violent Crime, Drugs, and #BlackLivesMatter","In the late 1960s, violent crime rates exploded in the United States, and then dived down decades later. Today the Federalist Radio Hour spoke with Barry Latzer, whose new book, The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime in America, covers this trend and how the fear of murder, rape and robbery affected American civilians.

Latzer is a criminologist and professor emeritus at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. The author said the three big factors he found in his research on crime trends were demographics, the caving of the criminal justice system, and the migration of African-Americans to northern and western cities in the U.S.

“The system was caving because it was swamped with cases. This sudden and massive rise in crime simply overwhelmed the system,” he said.

Later in the hour, he discussed the #BlackLivesMatter movement, how the loss of legitimacy, criminal justice reform, and whether the government is capable of creating a solution. “A lot of people in the media tend to jump at the racial narrative,” he said. “I must say, it didn’t help that the Obama administration bought into that same approach.”

The Latest ‘Batman’ Doesn’t Depict Police Brutality,"Last fall “Batman #44” hit the comic book stands, and a number of voices, including its authors Scott Snyder and Brian Azzarello, claimed it was an attempt to address the intersection of police brutality and gentrification or, more bluntly, that Batman was confronting institutionalized police racism. Some even noted the story holds “white readers accountable for their complicity in the real-world situations that the comic analogises.” But is that really the case?

The main point of this contention comes from the idea that Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) Officer Ned Howler shot dead a young African-American boy, Peter Duggio. However, Snyder and Azzarello confirm on the third page of the book the boy was not killed by gunfire. In Batman’s own words, “I’d agree if the shots had killed him. But I scanned him. He died from a fall. Dropped here. From about a thousand feet up.”

The book does confirm Howler shot and wounded Duggio, but the context in which the shooting occurs disputes the idea that this issue delves into institutionalized police racism. Instead, this book examines Duggio’s terrible choices and crimes.

It’s Not Clear the Police Were Especially at Fault

The first of those mistakes was turning to the crime-lord Penguin to protect his bodega from Penguin’s rivals, the Four Fives gang. The Four Fives gang had been moving in on the store after Bruce Wayne’s announcement he would redevelop the entire neighborhood where it was located. Penguin accepted Duggio’s deal and took control of the bodega; except, once he took control, he gifted the property to the Four Fives gang to end their feud.

Duggio got in bed with criminals, and he paid the price. However, this didn’t sit well with him. He decided to enact his own vengeance, storming the bodega and picking a fight with the Four Fives, even setting the store ablaze. This gang fight and blaze sent Officer Howler down to the neighborhood to restore order. Upon Ned’s arrival at the fire, Duggio exited the building. Duggio was bent over, one hand on his head; the other was by his waist out of the officer’s sight. Howler asked Duggio to get on the ground twice before he ended up opening fire.

It is hardly cause to be claiming Batman is confronting institutionalized racism or even claiming the GCPD is racist.

Was Howler right in shooting an arson suspect and supposed gang member who might have been going for a gun? Snyder believes, “You want Batman to beat this officer up, and be like, ‘How could you?’” However, this is not an emotion I experienced at all. I’m not even sure Officer Howler did anything wrong. He ordered an arsonist to get on the ground twice before firing, although his decision to pull the trigger was hasty.

Snyder does acknowledge that continued violence against Howler “wouldn’t solve the problem. Batman throwing the officer off a roof or throwing the officer in jail, it wouldn’t get to the heart of the matter at all.” While I agree that having Batman throw Howler off a roof wouldn’t solve the problem, I find it difficult to comprehend his suggestion about jail time failing to. If individuals commit a crime, they should be punished accordingly, and prison might not be a terrible solution. In this specific case, I do not believe Howler was in the wrong.

This event is also just one specific example of a police officer shooting an African-American. It is hardly cause to be claiming Batman is confronting institutionalized racism or even claiming the GCPD is racist. For one, Howler’s actions are hardly racist. He responded to a crime in progress and shot a suspect who had failed to heed his multiple warnings. The comic does include newspaper clippings hinting at a significant number of officer-involved shootings of black individuals. However, it does not provide any context about the reasons for the shootings.

This ‘Batman’ Doesn’t Rip Gentrification, Either

Now that the myth of Batman confronting police brutality in “Batman #44” has been dispelled, let’s examine the idea that he is also confronting gentrification. He is in fact not confronting it, but could be promoting it. Towards the end of the book, Bruce Wayne announces plans to renovate Duggio’s neighborhood, providing an infusion of capital and creating Wayne Apartments with upscale living conditions.

Azzarello used his experience with a public housing project in Chicago to influence his ideas on gentrification within the book.

The idea that Snyder and Azzarello believe gentrification is wrong comes from a newspaper clipping within the book stating, “Wayne Apartments…might drive up property values and force out longtime residents.” However, the article also notes Wayne Apartments will be “designed to provide upscale living conditions for lower-middle class families in the Corner.” Thus, Bruce Wayne and Wayne Enterprises might actually be building these new homes to help the people already living there. It is unclear what the actual process will be to find tenants.

Even if Wayne isn’t aiming at providing better accommodations for the current residents, gentrification isn’t some vile or evil act. Economist Walter Block notes that property owners like Duggio “will have so much money thrust down their throats that they will prefer their new digs to their old ones. Otherwise, they will stay put, and not be ‘run out of town’ by the newcomers.” Unfortunately, Peter chose to make deals with criminals like the Penguin instead of bankers and investors who might be interested in his property.

In the case of renters, opposing gentrification is “an attack on the marketplace.” It would mean that bidding for goods in general is wrong. Block also argues that gentrification does not mean a landlord can keep tenants within his building, restricting their ability to move freely. In a similar argument, one does not have the right to another’s property; landlords are free to do with their property as they will.

Peter chose to make deals with criminals like the Penguin instead of bankers and investors who might be interested in his property.

Azzarello used his experience with a public housing project in Chicago to influence his ideas on gentrification within the book. The problem is that Chicago and Gotham have two different issues. In Gotham, Bruce Wayne, a private citizen, announces a planned redevelopment using his own finances. In contrast, Chicago turns to the government to alleviate poverty with welfare. The Cato Institute’s Michael Tanner discusses how government welfare leads to increased poverty and how Wayne’s charitable actions are able to “individualize approaches and can target the specific problems that are holding people in poverty.”

In conclusion, Duggio’s own actions bring on the real-world situation analogized in the story. He made his choices, and they involved making deals with criminals, assaulting another individual, and committing arson. “White readers” are not responsible or complicit for the actions another individual takes. “Batman #44” also shows the tough and dangerous position many law enforcement officers face while on the job—not to mention how criminalizing drugs can lead to crime and violence, but that is an article for another day.

"Bill James on Baseball, O.J. Simpson, and Improving Political Analysis","Baseball writer, statistician, and historian, Bill James, joined today’s episode of the Federalist Radio Hour. James explained how baseball has changed since his writing career began, his thoughts on crime stories like “Making a Murderer” and “The People vs. O.J. Simpson,” and his perspective on 2016 polls and coverage. You can read more of his writing at Bill James Online.

In his book, Popular Crime, James examines our cultural obsession with murder and crime. “There’s a serious issue there that a lot of people aren’t talking about because it seems distasteful to a lot of people,” James said. “These famous crime stories play a large role in shaping how the public thinks about crime. Many of the very famous cases set legal precedents that bind ordinary cases.”

When it comes to bringing sabermetrics from sports analysis into political analysis, James said he think politics is behind. “Politics is difficult to analyze in the same ways that sports is because it is broader and more complicated,” he said. “There’s a long way to go in which people think about politics in a more organized ways, or in sometimes less organized ways.”

Why Vladimir Putin’s People Love Him,"By certain traditional measures, Russian President Vladimir Putin is the pre-eminent statesman of his time. When he took power in the winter of 1999–2000, his defenseless and bankrupt country was being carved up by its new kleptocratic elites, in collusion with its old imperial rivals. Much as Kemal Atatürk had done in Turkey seven decades earlier, Putin rescued a nation-state from the ruins of an empire and gave it coherence and purpose.

He disciplined his country’s unaccountable plutocrats, restored its military strength, and refused, with ever-blunter rhetoric, the subservient role in an American-run world system that foreign politicians and business leaders had drawn up for Russia. His voters credit him with having “saved his country.” So do many of his Russian detractors, although they worry he has stayed in power too long.

He is among the more popular democratically elected leaders in the civilized world and, incidentally, a hero to certain right-wing rebels against the international order, particularly in Europe. This is awkward for him and for them, since, unlike Atatürk, Putin has no programmatic ideology.

Losing Vladimir Putin in Translation

But traditional measures of statesmanship have, since the end of the Cold War, cut little ice with Western leaders and the pundits who judge them. We have rebaptized as “human rights” the system of identity-group and interest-group politics by which America is ordered, and by which America orders the world. Putin, who plays by an older set of rules, is cast as a brigand or a desperado. Or even as a madman. After Russia’s incursion into Crimea in early 2014 the New York Times reported:

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama by telephone on Sunday that after speaking with Mr. Putin she was not sure he was in touch with reality, people briefed on the call said. ‘In another world,’ she said.

This snippet has become part of Putin folklore, with the implication that those who know him best think him a psychopath. But the chances that things took place as described are slim. We have a conversation between the fluent Russian-speaker Merkel and the fluent German-speaker Putin, conveyed (to our monoglot president) through a translation, thence (somehow) to a briefer, and thence to a leaker whose goal is to promote U.S. strategic interests, which grow ever harder to tell from domestic partisan ones.

If the phrase “another world” was used, it was likely meant in the sense of “another context”—the context being, as Putin would have seen it, the armed overthrow of the elected Ukrainian government on Russia’s border, with the diplomatic (and, eventually, military) support of the United States.

There is a standing invitation to think of Putin in terms of caricature, an invitation that most biographers have accepted, though there are exceptions. “Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,” by the Brookings Institution scholars Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy (2012, updated in 2015), showed Putin as a multifaceted leader reacting to real problems. Now we have two more new works of genuine subtlety: “The New Tsar,” a biography by former New York Times Moscow correspondent Steven Lee Myers, and “Putinism,” a study of contemporary Russian ideology by the polymath historian and reporter Walter Laqueur.

Demonstrating Loyalty and Risk

Putin rose out of nowhere. Born in Leningrad in 1952 to parents who had lost their other two children by the end of World War II, he grew up in a communal apartment without hot water. He was bookish, with a taste for the Russian classics, and diminutive. He threw himself into sports, particularly karate, in which he acquired a black belt.

Romantic ideas of the secret service led him to join the KGB. This was not, as one might assume, a good career track for an authoritarian or an ideologue. The KGB was, in a sense, the most cosmopolitan wing of the Soviet state. The man who hired Putin in the 1970s, Yuri Andropov, then the ruthless head of the KGB, was the only top Communist open-minded enough to question whether a Communist economy could ever work in the first place. It was his protégé, Mikhail Gorbachev, who finally grew convinced that it could not.

How accidental his ascent seems. He showed little outward ambition.

As Myers notes, spying required “deeper and deeper training in local [Western] customs that often betrayed foreign origins—basic aspects of capitalist life, like mortgages, could stump and betray a Soviet operative.” The enemies the KGB wound up monitoring during Putin’s time in Germany, which coincided with the era of Gorbachev’s reforms, were mostly those considered too zealously Communist. One thing about Putin stood out as bizarre: he told his fellow agents he believed in God. In the KGB of the time, this was, one of them noted, “an inconceivable thing.”

How accidental his ascent seems. He showed little outward ambition. When the Berlin Wall fell, he moved his family back into his parents’ St. Petersburg apartment. Someone sent him to the upstart city councilman (later mayor) Anatoly Sobchak, who was looking for an advisor from the intelligence world. He wound up learning the ins and outs of a succession of jobs.

In St. Petersburg, he worked as a state property controller, then as an economic liaison to Otis Elevator and other businesses, as well as to Ted Turner and Jane Fonda’s Goodwill Games. After Sobchak was chased from power in 1996, Putin considered working as a martial arts instructor. But when his Petersburg colleague Alexei Kudrin signed on with President Boris Yeltsin, Putin went to Moscow, slept on Kudrin’s sofa, and looked for work. Kudrin found him a post as a manager of presidential properties. Putin moved on to become a financial investigator and then head of the KGB’s successor agency, the FSB.

Inheriting a Kleptocracy

You can get a better idea of why certain Russians not only tolerate but revere Putin if you remember that, within a few years of Communism’s fall, average life expectancy in Russia had fallen below that of Bangladesh. Putin did not found a kleptocracy; he inherited one. The ignominy falls on Boris Yeltsin, whose opportunism made him an indispensable foe of Communism in the late 1980s, but made him an equally poisonous founding father for any modern democratic state. “Most Russians have come to believe that democracy is what happened in their country between 1990 and 2000,” Laqueur writes, “and they do not want any more of it.”

Within a few years of Communism’s fall, average life expectancy in Russia had fallen below that of Bangladesh.

Yeltsin “made” Putin, even though the two were never close. Putin combined two traits that almost never appear together: iron loyalty and an appetite for any kind of risk. The zealous prosecutor Yuri Skuratov had leaked compromising details from an investigation into Sobchak’s city government, an irregularity that appalled Putin. In 1997, Skuratov was on the verge of arresting Sobchak, when Putin, then in his job as investigator, spirited his old boss out of the country on a plane.

This act of loyalty—risking his career, his reputation, everything, for a onetime mentor who had already fallen from power and could no longer help him—wowed Yeltsin, even though he disliked Sobchak. Other political operatives may have been demoralized. Putin understood that the Russian government still held a few trumps.

When Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov tried to topple Yeltsin, Luzhkov’s wife’s business came under investigation. In March 1999, Russian media obtained videotapes showing the crusading Skuratov at an orgy. Whether or not the tapes were genuine, the reassertion of political power was. That is surely part of the reason why Yeltsin named the relative political novice as prime minister that summer, then shocked the country on New Year’s Eve by resigning as president and naming Putin to succeed him.

Rejecting ‘State-Appointed Billionaires’

At a time when billionaires spent lavishly to buy politicians, Putin did not line his own pockets. Boris Bere-zovsky, a media oligarch with whom he would later clash, recalled that when he, Berezovsky, tried to open a car dealership, “Putin had refused even to consider a bribe.” As the number-two man in St. Petersburg’s government, Putin built a house in an exclusive lakefront cooperative—but it was only 1,600 square feet, the dimensions of a modest urban apartment. When it caught fire in 1996, he rushed into the burning house to rescue a briefcase containing his savings: $5,000.

At a time when billionaires spent lavishly to buy politicians, Putin did not line his own pockets.

At the FSB, Putin did not move into the palatial office that had been occupied by spymasters from Lavrenti Beria to Andropov. He made their office a museum, and chose humbler quarters elsewhere in the building. By the time he became prime minister at the turn of the century, Putin’s fortune amounted to $13,000. His wife was making $1,500 a month as a rep in a telephone company. Ordinary Russians saw him as one of them. Despite abundant allegations that Putin has enriched himself in power (one sensational account credits him with a fortune of $70 billion), many ordinary Russians still do.

Young men on the make are favored when revolution sweeps all the chips off the table. The natural-resource oligarchs who would turn Russia into an armed plutocracy within half a decade of it defeating Communism in 1991 included men who had been groomed as the Communist nomenklatura of the next generation. With their understanding of the scope of state assets, their control of privatization programs, their access to Western financing, and their willingness to use violence and intimidation, they took power as planned—but as owners, not bureaucrats.

Since the state had owned everything under Communism, this was quite a payout, one that leaders of Western financial institutions were eager to abet. At the World Economic Forum in Davos Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and other billionaires met in 1996 to arrange financing for Yeltsin’s re-election. This was a top priority. So many fortunes depended on Yeltsin that he had become a ruler who could be permitted any liberty except that of giving up power.

Young men on the make are favored when revolution sweeps all the chips off the table.

These “state-appointed billionaires,” as Putin came to call them, were a conduit for looting Russia, and they were too entrenched to root out. But Putin was able to avoid an outright oligarchic takeover of the state, of the sort that happened in neighboring Ukraine. It was for reasons good and bad that Yukos oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who served ten years in prison before being released on the eve of Russia’s 2014 Winter Olympics, became the center of Putin’s crackdown. Khodorkovsky’s was among the most obscene of the privatizations: Myers calculates that Khodorkovsky and fellow investors paid $150 million in the 1990s for the company’s main production unit, which was valued at about $20 billion by 2004.

Khodorkovsky began leveling accusations of corruption at the very Russian state from which he had appropriated one of the world’s great fortunes. Putin saw his own task as restoring to the country what had been stolen from it. In his view, here was Khodorkovsky preening before his powerful American friends, hoping they might help him consolidate his theft.

But no matter what Khodorkovsky did, he would have fallen afoul of Putin. The two wound up in arguments over, for instance, whether building a new pipeline to China was the prerogative of the state or of Khodorkovsky. As Putin saw it, the Russian government could not afford such arguments. It needed to reclaim control of its vast reserves of oil and gas, on which much of Europe depended, because that was the only geopolitical lever it had left.

No More Humiliations

Putin sealed his bond with the public by beating back, with the utmost brutality, the military advance of Islamist separatists in the Russian border regions of Chechnya and Dagestan. Like Margaret Thatcher in Britain in the 1982 Falklands War, he sensed his people’s fury at seeing their country counted among the has-beens of history. He sensed it because he shared it.

Like Margaret Thatcher in Britain, he sensed his people’s fury at seeing their country counted among the has-beens of history.

“We will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians,” he said on the eve of becoming president, “or any threat to the integrity of the country.” NATO had, months earlier, bombarded Serbia in order to back a nationalist-Muslim independence movement in Kosovo, and had used the opportunity to show Russia its lowly place in the international order, treating it as a nuisance and an afterthought. This degradation—not any desire to return to Communism—is what Putin meant when he described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.”

Putin has a gift for making the best of a bad strategic hand. But he was not a natural defense-policy whiz. When the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in Arctic waters in his first year in office, he dithered, and refused Western offers to help raise it. The refusal was understandable, given the primacy he placed on the country’s autonomy. The dithering may have cost dozens of sailors’ lives.

Unorthodox Foreign Policy Works

Over time, though, Putin’s unorthodox foreign policy worked, particularly in the Caucasus. Part of his strategy was a decision not to negotiate with hostage-takers, even in secret. In the autumn of 2002, armed Chechens occupied a musical theater in Moscow and took 912 spectators hostage. A Russian special operations team flooded the theater with a sleeping gas and killed all 41 terrorists; 130 hostages died. Myers, like almost all journalists who covered the episode, is inclined to see this outcome as a “disaster”:

Officials refused to discuss how forty-one fighters with arms and explosives managed to slip into the capital undetected. They refused to divulge the formula for the gas used to anesthetize those inside the theater. The Duma, under pressure from Putin, refused to authorize an investigation…. The doubts—even the questions—infuriated Putin.

The raid on the theater was not a disaster, certainly not as the Russian public saw it. It was a victory, won in battle, under high pressure, against a particularly heinous foe. If the price was high, it was not Putin who willed it to be high. C’est la guerre.

A siege just as horrible followed two years later, in the North Ossetian town of Beslan, when Islamists took more than a thousand hostages, including elementary school children. Almost 400 of the hostages were killed in the raid. In his address to the nation, Myers says, Putin “offered no apology and accepted no responsibility. He did not use the occasion to defend, justify, or explain his policies in Chechnya.”

Again, Russian citizens saw it differently: where does one get the idea that terrorists willing to kill schoolchildren are entitled to any such explanation?

A World Power Reborn

Now Russia has re-emerged as a geopolitical power, both through its intervention to protect the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and in its reincorporation of culturally Russian Crimea from Ukraine in the wake of the revolution there. Myers’s account of the Ukraine conflict is one of the more balanced to have appeared from a mainstream Western reporter.

He does not ignore that, while the 2013-14 overthrow of the corrupt Russophile Viktor Yanukovych began with a peaceful occupation of Kiev’s main square, it culminated in armed violence. He does not dismiss as theatrics Putin’s description of the revolutionary government as “fascist.” (The anti-Semitic Svoboda party held three cabinet posts in the first post-uprising government, and armed members of the right-wing Pravy Sektor patrolled polling stations outside Kiev during that spring’s elections.)

Myers’s account of the Ukraine conflict is one of the more balanced to have appeared from a mainstream Western reporter.

Nor does Myers dispute that Russian historical claims to the Crimean peninsula are strong. The historian Perry Anderson recently reminded readers of the New Left Review that Russian armies lost more men defending the Crimean city of Sebastopol in two sieges than the United States lost in both world wars. In the end, strategic considerations were decisive. Putin seized Crimea because it is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, and it was on the verge of becoming enemy territory.

If Myers has certain liberal biases common to Western reporters, he never assumes that people hardened by 75 years of tyranny and two decades of robbery will share them. Still, as “The New Tsar’s” narrative advances towards the present, it gets very focused on movements of money. Myers suspects that Putin’s crowd, and Putin himself, have been motivated by self-dealing and greed.

Corruption there surely is, but Putin’s decade and a half in power has been too successful for graft to have been its primary motivation. Hugo Chávez ruled the same sort of oil-dependent economy over the same years with a similarly strong hand. The result for the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PdVSA) was bankruptcy, not flourishing. The focus on money corruption may stem from a historiographic problem. Putin has made the Russian presidency less transparent. Those who report on it tend to consult international authorities, who focus on such things as financial flows.

Neutral Skepticism about State Assasinations

Myers strikes the right note between analytical neutrality and skepticism when he discusses the high-profile murders that have become a part of Russian political life in the past decade: Anna Politkovskaya, the crusading Chechnya correspondent shot in her apartment building in Moscow in 2006; Alexander Litvinenko, the spy poisoned with polonium-210 in London months later; Sergei Magnitsky, an ailing lawyer for American investors who died in prison under murky circumstances in 2009; the anti-Putin activist Boris Nemtsov, shot on a bridge in Moscow in early 2015.

It was passed off as a training exercise, although government officials denied having known of it.

“No direct evidence has yet emerged that Putin had any involvement in Litvinenko’s death, or Politkovskaya’s, or any of the other mysterious and unsolved crimes that bore the hallmarks of political assassination during his rule,” he notes. Arguments for Putin’s involvement tend to be of a cui bono nature. They involve what a British report into Litvinenko’s death, released to fanfare in January, calls “strong circumstantial evidence.”

Myers never ignores there is a lot of it. (The British report largely follows the arc of his own narrative.) He spends much time on a bizarre incident in the city of Ryazan that took place just days after a series of apartment bombings in Moscow. FSB agents were alleged to have hidden explosives in an apartment building’s basement. When they were discovered, it was passed off as a training exercise, although government officials denied having known of it.

“Independent lawmakers and journalists who pursued the question died with such disturbing regularity,” Myers writes, “that it was difficult to consider their deaths mere coincidence.”

Is There Any Alternative?

Perhaps it is unreasonable to expect better of Russia. The country is less aggressive than when it led the Soviet Union, and calmer than it was during the violent and penurious Yeltsin years. Despite austerity dictated by low energy prices and Western sanctions, Russian gross domestic product is still almost ten times what it was in the late 1990s, and life expectancy has risen to over 70 for the first time in the country’s history. Its mass media are trammeled, even if there is a lot of independent journalism on the Internet.

The ideology that drives Putin, Laqueur argues, unsavory and illiberal though he finds it, is not fascism.

Its party system is anemic. Opposition leaders are harassed and thwarted. Russian conservatism in an age of mass media is necessarily populist, and this, Laqueur writes, “is bound to bring it fairly close to fascism.” But the ideology that drives Putin, Laqueur argues, unsavory and illiberal though he finds it, is not fascism. Its roots are elsewhere.

Putin is an avid and a rather deep reader who has built a worldview from the work of pre-Communist and anti-Communist thinkers, chief among them Ivan Ilyin, Vladimir Solovyov, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He has made reading the “Gulag Archipelago” compulsory in secondary schools.

Nor should we take Putin’s anti-Communism for granted. Laqueur has long argued that, had Russia been led by someone steelier than Mikhail Gorbachev when falling oil prices drove it into crisis in the 1980s, the collapse of Communism “might have happened only two or three decades later in a world situation quite different from the one in 1991.” Putin’s Russia is a system of “sovereign democracy” moored between Orthodox Christianity and Machiavellian realism.

Making Sense of Russia’s Views of the U.S.

Putin’s defensive stance towards U.S. hegemony can sound paranoid to Westerners. Russians find it commonsensical. They have come to believe the West is not content to live with a weakened and humbled Russia; it wants Russia broken and humiliated. Are they wrong?

They have come to believe the West is not content to live with a weakened and humbled Russia; it wants Russia broken and humiliated.

Executives at Yukos, the company stripped from Khodorkovsky, got a judge in Texas to block Russia’s auction of it. They lacked standing to do so, but the delay threw Russia’s financing of the sale into question. The Obama administration has harassed Putin’s government over laws that forbid promoting homosexuality to young schoolchildren, even though Russia’s laws on homosexuality are, in general, more liberal than those that prevailed in the United States until the Supreme Court’s Lawrence v. Texas decision in 2003.

In 2012, new ambassador Michael McFaul met opposition leaders on his second day on the job. At the Normandy celebration of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in 2014, in the wake of the Crimea incursion, Putin was “ostracized” by Western leaders, Myers recounts; the Soviet Union’s 24 million war dead apparently did not suffice as an anti-fascist credential under Western eyes.

Myers describes a meeting of Russian soccer-team owners discussing what they should do in the aftermath of Putin’s annexation of Crimea. One asked whether they should go out on a limb and welcome Crimean teams into the Russian soccer league. Might Western authorities impose sanctions on them? Of course they will, another club owner said, but that was no reason to stop. “No matter what you do, even if you crawl before them on your stomach—they’ll do it! Understand? So either bug out of this country or behave appropriately, like a citizen of this country.”

Sovereignty plays the role for today’s Russia that secularization did for Atatürk’s Turkey.

Sovereignty plays the role for today’s Russia that secularization did for Atatürk’s Turkey. The ability of U.S. and other Western authorities to intrude abroad into what once were thought strictly domestic, and even local, arrangements has confounded and challenged those who still see a use for national autonomy.

Putin is one of these. He views his job as every leader outside the Communist bloc did a generation ago, and as pretty much every head of state outside of the United States and the European Union does today: as defending the interests of his people, the first of which is its independence. At this task he has succeeded against long odds.

Since the Ukrainian revolution, this success has come at a considerable price, in both diplomatic isolation and lost trade. We will understand nothing about Putin until we realize that, in the eyes of most of his countrymen, he has been right to pay it.

Bill Nye Epitomizes The Left’s Authority Complex,"Feminist journalist Jill Filipovic recently made a hilariously un-self-aware comment on Twitter.

One advantage the left has over the right is we don’t value bowing to authority. But I see a kind of Messiah worship in Sanders supporters.

— Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) April 15, 2016

I wonder: was she around when Barack Obama was running in 2008? (Yes, she was.) Nothing about Bernie’s messiah complex should be remotely new to you if you followed the Obama phenomenon.

The Left still clings to this old view of themselves as bold free-thinkers who “question authority,” when they have long since set themselves up as the authorities everyone else is supposed to bow to.

By coincidence, I came across this at about the same time as a video of Bill Nye, the supposed “science guy,” taking a break from asking big and important questions like “What if the Earth were a cube instead of a ball?” and declaring that maybe global warming skeptics should be thrown in jail.

He does it through a series of rhetorical questions: “Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron? Was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive, and so on.”

Enron was a case of provable fraud, in which executives lied about specific facts about the operation of their own company—not about complex scientific conclusions. As for tobacco executives, none of them did go to jail (much to the consternation of anti-tobacco fanatics), and for good reason. To ban one side of a political debate from making its case is to condemn them in advance, denying them an opportunity to speak in their own defense.

Courts as Tools of Political Coercion

But Nye isn’t just speculating about putting people in jail. He is referring to a specific attempt to use the model of those old tobacco lawsuits to prosecute any company that has ever funded research or advocacy skeptical of claims about global warming. This campaign was started last year and has taken its newest steps recently with a meeting of state attorneys general who vowed to launch “investigations into whether fossil fuel companies misled investors and the public on the impact of climate change.”

‘There is a chilling effect on scientists who are in extreme doubt about climate change, I think that is good.’

The attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands—whom you would think would have enough to deal with at home straightening out a notoriously dysfunctional office—has subpoenaed a leading free-market think tank, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, demanding all of its internal communications from 1997 through 2007. Why? Because CEI once committed the presumed crime of accepting money from a major oil company.

This is what you call a “fishing expedition.” The prosecutors are not demanding any specific evidence of criminal activity, because they have no specific grounds to suspect it. They’re just demanding everything, in the hope that once they fish through it, they will find something they can cast as incriminating, or at least embarrassing. It’s a well-known form of legal harassment.

To those who object that this will create a “chilling effect” on scientific debate over global warming, which is the obvious goal of the investigation, Nye says that’s just fine. “That there is a chilling effect on scientists who are in extreme doubt about climate change, I think that is good.”

Goodbye, Free Speech

As bad as that is, Nye’s justification for it is worse. “As a taxpayer and voter, the introduction of this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen. So I can see where people are very concerned about this, and they’re pursuing criminal investigations.” I could make the case that Nye’s continued existence “affects my quality of life.” Should I get the government to do something about that?

‘The introduction of this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen.’

But wait, there’s more. “The extreme-doubt-about-climate-change people—without going too far afield here—are leaving the world worse than they found it because they are keeping us from getting to work. They are holding us back.” It used to be that the Left wanted to limit “commercial speech,” but “political speech” was sacrosanct. Now it is considered acceptable to suppress other people’s speech precisely because they might have an impact on the political debate.

In other words: Bow to authority. My authority.

Bill Nye is just one entertainer, a third-rate popularizer of science. But he is totally representative of the Left’s real attitude about authority. Their fundamental conviction is that the conscience of the individual must be forced to yield to the demands of the collective, as decided by the authorities who presume to speak for it.

Try refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding, and tell me whether you will be forced to bow to authority. Try running a fast-food joint or comic-book shop that can’t afford to pay its employees $15 an hour, and tell me whether you will be forced to bow to authority. Try keep men dressed as women out of your ladies’ restroom, and tell me whether you will be forced to bow to authority.

You should check out the Twitter feed A Crime a Day, which draws from the vast depths of the US criminal code to inform us of all the actions and decision of private individuals that have been transformed into crimes for no readily apparent reason. Take this one:

21 USC §§331(m), 333 & 347(b)(2) make it a federal crime for a retail establishment to sell margarine in packages larger than one pound.



— A Crime a Day (@CrimeADay) March 30, 2016

There is no real rhyme or reason to the vast patchwork of regulation except: bow to authority.

Thanks to the Left, we live in an era of authority. Authority is their entire agenda, in politics, in economics, in culture, in religion, in science. It’s grimly amusing when they try to hide this, and a lot less amusing when the pretense falls away, and they try to make us bow.

The Forgotten History Of ‘The Black Silent Majority’,"At a 1973 bill-signing session, the pistol-packing Reverend Oberia Dempsey of Upper Park Avenue Church in Harlem praised Republican Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for heeding the calls of his community to get rid of drugs. The “Rockefeller drug laws” mandated life imprisonment for drug dealers.

Acknowledging that addicts needed treatment, Dempsey asserted, “We are not going to stand any longer and see decent citizens brutalized or subjected to punishment because someone is out there sick.” He added sarcastically, “And I’m sorry for the bleeding hearts, I’m sorry for all of the people who are over-sympathetic with criminals and under-sympathetic with decent citizens.”

Only one African-American legislator, Sen. Vander Beatty, voted for the legislation, although it fell short of his aim: capital punishment for drug dealers. But Dempsey was joined by the “black silent majority,” working- and middle-class citizens who saw their once-vibrant cultural center terrorized by drug pushers. Two hundred Harlemites took up firearms with Dempsey and patrolled their streets, tracking and reporting drug pushers to the police in “Operation Confiscation” and “Operation Interruption.” They also escorted women to church and to the market.

Such extraordinary stories are told in City University of New York sociologist Michael Javen Fortner’s “Black Silent Majority: The Rockefeller Drug Laws and the Politics of Punishment” (Harvard University Press, 2015). Fortner uses newspaper archives, meeting minutes, polls, surveys, oral histories, interviews, legislative hearing records, and even fiction and drama to piece together a compelling narrative about a community fighting for its life. Except for the occasional lapse into academic jargon (“the ebb of Fordism,” for example), this is fascinating reading. It is changing the conversation about mandatory minimum drug laws.

A Surge of Interest in Controversial Black History

The book began receiving attention in advance of its release in September, with the Chronicle of Higher Education devoting a long feature article to it in August, which led to an interview later in the month on radio station WIND, in Chicago, then one on WNYC in September.

It pushes against the narrative about the ‘new Jim Crow,’ drug laws that have led to the disproportionate rate of African-American incarceration.

A first book, it garnered immediate attention from quarters that would make any author envious, including The New York Times, New Yorker, New York Magazine, Daily Beast, and Salon. A couple weeks after its release, Fortner wrote an op-ed for the The New York Times, addressing police shootings of black men that had spurred protests and sometimes riots. In January, he spoke at the Manhattan Institute. The New York Academy of History gave him the award for the best book of 2015.

The pace is continuing, with invited appearances coming up at places as varied as the Miller Center at the University of Virginia and the African American Studies Department at Columbia University. In a recent interview, Fortner told me happily, “My dance card is full.”

Reasons behind the attention include the fact that the book features subject matter that has been univocally promoted in the academy. It pushes against the narrative about the “new Jim Crow,” drug laws that have led to the disproportionate rate of African-American incarceration (six times that of whites). The theory holds that a white backlash against civil rights gains led to such discriminatory laws.

To the contrary, Fortner shows that the “black silent majority” pushed back against “the criminologies of the welfare state espoused by the white middle-class reformers who had monopolized the debate over drug addiction and crime during the 1950s and early 1960s.” The 1973 Rockefeller drug laws repudiated the liberal 1962 Metcalf-Volker Act.

African-Americans Oppose Their So-Called Advocates

The beleaguered residents of Harlem received little help from the new class of black politicians and activists, overwhelmingly Democrats. A. Philip Randolph’s Emergency Committee for Unity and Social and Economic Problems featured stars like Percy Sutton, Malcolm X, and Bayard Rustin; they considered drug users casualties of racism and decried police brutality and racial attitudes. The committee formed in 1961 but was short-lived, as members switched their attention to the national civil rights movement, specifically the 1963 March on Washington.

The silent majority took advantage of the expanded opportunities in entrepreneurship, public sector jobs, white-collar jobs, and political office that came about between 1940 and 1960.

Representatives like Sutton expressed ideas in “white-dominated public spaces” that contradicted pleas they heard from constituents, those who felt that the “‘wounds of centuries’ had been partially treated and partially healed by their industry and probity.” The black community suffered from the loss of labor-intensive work and continued residential segregation and unscrupulous landlords as the 1960s approached; but the silent majority took advantage of the expanded opportunities in entrepreneurship, public sector jobs, white-collar jobs, and political office that came about between 1940 and 1960.

Fortner tells their stories with empathy, if not approval, claiming they were “motivated by fear and advised by indigenous values.” He leaves the reader to agree or disagree with their blaming “the community’s downfall on individual behavior, the self-indulgent, irresponsible actions of the disadvantaged, rather than racial or economic inequality.” He offers no solutions but evidence to peel away layers of ideology. Dispelling the dominant belief that the majority of blacks approved of urban riots, militancy, and black nationalism, he cites poll after poll showing disapproval of such figures as Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, and approval of the NAACP’s moderate tactics.

Doubly Victimized, By Criminals and Their Champions

He also presents surveys that contradict assumptions about a racist white silent majority. One in 1970 showed that among the 63 percent of respondents who described themselves as the “silent majority” 22 percent thought “Negroes” were treated unfairly, as opposed to only 12 percent who thought it was “working men” or “the lower middle class.” Blacks were twice as likely as whites to be worried about drug use. White Catholics and police officers were more concerned about student protests than black crime. Police found it harder to take the “scions of the upper middle class in the best universities” hurling bricks and bags of feces and denunciations as “pigs” than ghetto inhabitants’ usual crimes.

White Catholics and police officers were more concerned about student protests than black crime.

All this happened before Fortner was born in 1980, but he suffered the consequences. When he was only two years old, one of Fortner’s older brothers was stabbed with an ice pick at a party. Their father, a machinist, cradled his dying son in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. The brother’s name, Dexter, was never spoken again, and when young Michael tried to surprise his mother by taking photographs of Dexter out of the closet and putting them on the walls, they were quietly taken down. (Another of his three brothers is imprisoned.)

Mark Parry visited Fortner’s old Brownsville neighborhood, where Fortner grew up with the “’constant and subtle terror’” of drug dealers loitering in front of his housing project, addicts knocking on the apartment door peddling stolen goods, and gunshots.

Fortner escaped. He received scholarship money to attend boarding school, then earned a PhD from Harvard University. As he explained to me, he set aside the typical project of revising his dissertation (a comparison of racial and class politics in New York and London) into his first book. He turned to the topic that was “calling” him.

Opposition to Alternative Explanations

He had read Michelle Alexander’s influential “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness” (The New Press, 2010) and was vexed by the discounting of “black agency.” Alexander blamed a white backlash, but Fortner wondered, “’Where are the black folks in this story?’”

Some feared what they believed to be his politics—as a ‘right-wing black conservative.’

Parry notes that Fortner’s early research published as articles had already “met resistance from critics who felt he was trying to justify mass incarceration, which he loathes.” Parry’s article, however, featured some of Fortner’s critics. Yale law professor James Forman Jr. praised the book for giving agency to the black community, but said Fortner overstated his claims. University of Michigan history professor Heather Ann Thompson didn’t dispute Fortner’s research, but insisted that he did not adequately capture the nuances.

Rutgers history professor Donna Murch maintained that blacks had little power; she curiously pointed out that the Voting Rights Act did not pass until 1965 (eight years before the passage of the Rockefeller laws). Murch expanded her criticisms of what she called Fortner’s “revisionist project” in the October 16 Boston Review. Fortner replied in an article of nearly equal length, offering his definitive response.

Fortner told me Chronicle and New York Times reporters sought out professors who “hold and protect racial arguments most fiercely” and are most devoted to a “radical vision of mass incarceration.” As a result, they are closed to “alternative interpretations and unintended consequences, unexpected things.” Some feared what they believed to be his politics—as a “right-wing black conservative.”

An Appreciation for Nuance

This made it difficult for them to see the nuances in the book, including points about what Fortner calls “white liberal privilege.” Such privilege allows liberals “to evade all the problems of street crime, of heroin addiction. . . .” He told me, “I don’t necessarily applaud what the people in the book do but I try to tell their story. For me their story is about dealing with one of the most difficult challenges one could face and not having options. It’s important to understand where the politics are coming from, to understand the anger and the pain.”

Let’s hope that this points to a turnaround in scholarship, an openness to the ‘unexpected consequences’ that evidence brings.

Fortner says the positive response has far outweighed the negative. Jason Riley, writing in City Journal, called the book “urgent and extraordinary.” Kudos also comes from liberal quarters. As Fortner notes, Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson praised it in print and in talks. Johns Hopkins political scientist Lester Spence listed Fortner’s book in his top five shortlist of 2015 books, alongside Ta-Nehisi Coates’ “Between the World and Me,” Marlon James’ “A Brief History of Seven Killings,” a collection of “science fiction stories from social justice movements” titled “Octavia’s Brood,” and Jabari Asim’s “Only the Strong.” Columbia University professor John McWhorter called it “the most important black book of 2015” on bloggingheads tv’s “Glenn Show.” It made the editor’s choice in the New York Times Book Review.

Such bipartisan appreciation is a positive sign. Let’s hope that this points to a turnaround in scholarship, an openness to the “unexpected consequences” that evidence brings. I am looking forward to reading Fortner’s next book, about the crack epidemic of the 1980s.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/05/the-forgotten-history-of-the-black-silent-majority/,2016-05-05
How About Some Wine With That Nanny State?,"Even the worst of men have their moments. Take the Roman Emperor Nero. Mixing wine and honey with mountain snow, he created the first sorbet.

Of course, were Nero to make that sorbet in modern America and then sell it, he could be hauled off to a federal hoosegow. That’s because federal law—actually, several laws: 21 U.S.C. §343, 333, and 21 C.F.R. §135.140(e)(4)—impose a maximum one-year jail sentence or $1,000 fine for the sale of wine-flavored sherbet with too much wine in it.

How much is too much? Well, that’s not entirely clear. 21 C.F.R. §135.140(e)(4) stipulates that “optimal nonfruit characterizing ingredients” for sherbet may include a “[d]istilled alcoholic beverage, including liqueurs or wine,” but no more than is “required for flavoring.” If your sherbet fails a federal taste test (or a federal taste-tester fails a sobriety test), that could be a federal crime.

Many sherbet and ice-cream recipes call for wine, and a heavy hand won’t land you in jail so long as you never sell your frozen creation. But for small businesses that do sell, like Milwaukee’s Purple Door Ice Cream, vague “taste-test” regulation offers little guidance to avoid potential criminal liability.

The Muddling Doesn’t End There

Adding a bit more wine than the absolute minimum a bureaucrat may think is “required for flavoring” is just one of many oddball wine-related crimes in the federal law. To uncork a few more:

It is a crime to ride your bike while holding a glass of wine in a national park, 18 USC §1865 and 36 CFR §4.30(h)(5).

It is a crime to sell a wine bottle that is in any way “disparaging of a competitor’s product,” 26 U.S.C. §5606 and 27 C.F.R. §5.42(a)(2).

Or with a label that looks like a stamp, 27 U.S.C. §207, §205(e) and 27 C.F.R. §4.39(e)(1), or with the word “zombie” in the brand name, 27 C.F.R. §4.39(a)(9).

It is a crime to sell wine through subliminal messages, 27 U.S.C. §§205, 207 and 27 C.F.R. §4.64(k).

It is a crime for winemakers to not report any “extraordinary or unusual loss” of wine, 26 U.S.C. §5661(b) and 27 C.F.R. § 24.268.

Perhaps most surprisingly, it is a crime to advertise wine with “[a]ny statement, design, device, or representation . . . which tends to create the impression that a wine . . . has intoxicating qualities,” 27 USC §§205, 207 & 27 CFR §4.64(a)(8).

From 37 to 41 AD, before Nero held sway and created wine sorbet, Caligula ruled Rome. No stranger to the grape, he consumed “legendary amounts of wine” and may even have suffered from lead poisoning as a result. But he remains infamous for another reason.

English jurist William Blackstone recorded that Caligula “wrote his laws in a very small character, and hung them up upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare the people.” Arcane criminal regulations buried deep within the federal code can ensnare unsuspecting citizens just as surely today.

Heaven help the small-business owner who unwittingly pours in a little more wine than a vacationing federal agent prefers.

Large companies perhaps can afford to have armies of scientists and attorneys pore through and understand obscure federal regulations. But heaven help the small-business owner who unwittingly pours in a little more wine than a vacationing federal agent prefers. He or she could be branded a criminal.

A criminal law based on taste preferences rather than the core moral code everyone knows by heart—thou shalt not kill or steal, and so on—is a symptom of excessive criminalization. It signals that it’s time to reconsider how and why criminal laws are written.

When the feds can’t resist attaching criminal penalties to vague regulations regarding “optimal nonfruit characterizing ingredients” in sherbet, it’s time for Congress to stop the madness, step in, and reclaim “[a]ll legislative powers” granted in Article 1 of the United States Constitution.

Life is too short—and wine sherbet too tasty—to risk a reign of countless Caligulas.

"No, Mandatory Minimums Aren’t Preventing A Crime Wave","Last week, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas gave a speech on criminal justice reform in which he mixed the banal—“Criminals are not victims. Criminals are criminals”—with the fatuous—the United States suffers from an “under-incarceration problem.” He blithely accused colleagues who support reducing one-size-fits-all sentencing mandates, including conservatives like Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul, of being “criminal-leniency advocates.” The speech cemented the impression one gets that Cotton thinks the only thing standing between the American people today and a crime-ridden, blood-drenched hell on earth is, well, Tom Cotton.

The opposite is true. Congress would be better able to protect the public from violent, dangerous crime if Cotton would stop defending 30-year-old federal sentencing schemes written by Tip O’Neill and George Mitchell. The chief problem with those schemes is not that they produced “mass incarceration” or “under-incarceration,” but rather, they have resulted in misincarceration.

They do not allow federal courts to impose more serious punishments for more serious offenders and lesser penalties for less culpable offenders. Cotton might think one-size-fits-all is the right approach for government-mandated wages, but the consequences for criminal justice are disastrous.

We Need to Focus on the Worst Criminals

If federal sentencing mandates simply resulted in an inefficient allocation of limited government resources, perhaps the effects would not be so frightening. After all, no one expects much efficiency from the government. But the resources at issue here are anti-crime resources, and they are supposed to protect innocent Americans from murderers, rapists, terrorists, drug kingpins, and others who would do them serious harm.

For years, Congress has been stealing money from those on the front lines of that fight to keep nonviolent drug offenders in federal prison, sometimes for decades. Since 1988, Congress has increased spending on federal prisons by 45 percent while slashing spending on state and local law enforcement by 76 percent. This tradeoff is irresponsible and terrifying, since the states prosecute and detain the overwhelming majority of violent felons.

A similarly dangerous tradeoff is taking place at the federal level. The Department of Justice’s inspector general has been warning Congress for years that important, anti-violent crime programs and personnel, like FBI agents, prosecutors, and victims’ services, are being cut to pay for incarcerating drug offenders, who make up half of the federal prison population today. Congress’ misguided priorities have allowed thousands of violent criminals to escape punishment, and denied justice to their victims.

Tradeoffs Are A Real Thing, and Deadly Serious Here

In his remarks, Cotton asked of those who support reform, “How many more crimes will be committed because of sentencing reductions? How many more lives lost?” The answer is: there will be fewer, not more. But since he began by rightly lamenting that “for the vast majority of crimes, a perpetrator is never identified or arrested, let alone prosecuted, convicted, or jailed,” the more immediate question for Cotton is: how many of these crimes go undetected and un-prosecuted as a result of the dangerously misguided tradeoff in federal anti-crime resources you want to perpetuate?

Failing to apprehend so many dangerous offenders because we hammer the nonviolent ones we catch undercuts the certainty of punishment.

How many murders go unsolved because you insist that someone like Leo Guthmiller serves 10 years in federal prison instead of seven or five? How many rapes go unsolved so we can afford to keep Mandy Martinson in federal prison for 15 years instead of ten or even seven? And how many corrections officers’ lives are you willing to endanger to keep federal prison populations above capacity? (By the way, do you really believe these corrections officers and America’s chiefs of police are “criminal-leniency advocates”?)

Cotton gets these easy questions wrong because he misreads the experts he cites, like scholar James Q. Wilson. Whereas almost all criminologists agree that the swiftness and certainty of punishment is more important than severity, Cotton focuses on severity. He does so although Wilson believed “resource constraints”—like a limited federal budget—sometimes make severity the enemy of certainty. Failing to apprehend so many dangerous offenders because we hammer the nonviolent ones we catch undercuts the certainty of punishment. Wilson was right, and Cotton is wrong.

In the end, we should reject the false choice Cotton and other opponents of reform present: keep all of our current policies or risk a new crime wave. Such demagoguery ignores the American experience. We can learn from the mistakes of earlier periods, use the tools many states have discovered to reduce both incarceration and crime, and enact commonsense reforms that actually make us safer. We can get tough on crime instead of just talking tough.

Conservatives Shouldn’t Blink On Criminal Justice Reform,"What position should conservatives take on ongoing efforts to reform our criminal justice system? Two recent articles, run simultaneously at National Review, effectively present the alternatives.

One essay, by Jeffrey H. Anderson, contends that a demagogue like Donald Trump could probably generate some Nixon-esque electoral momentum by unleashing a torrent of bruising criticism on reformers. The other, by Vikrant Reddy, points out that over-incarceration is still a problem in the United States, and that prudent, moderate adjustments to our penal codes could probably save resources and improve lives without sacrificing public safety.

Both writers are substantially right.

Beating the Tough-On-Crime Horse

Trump isn’t going to overcome his vast negatives by going to war with drugs and crime. Americans are far less bothered about crime than they were in Richard Nixon’s day, for the obvious reason that we have less of it. Further, the measures Nixon initiated to combat drugs and crime have already done much to expand state power, with a number of troubling ramifications. Republicans won’t win the White House by time-warping a 1970s agenda to 2016.

Still, it’s possible Trump could squeeze a few more drops from the tough-on-crime agenda. It’s dated and bad policy, but that wouldn’t exactly make this a standout plank of the Trump platform.

As Anderson points out, it makes some sense for an immigration hardliner to embrace tough-on-crime. It’s “a silent majority issue.” It plays to aggrieved whites’ sense that somebody out there is wrecking their society and getting away with it. Also, President Obama is in favor of justice reform, and Jeff Sessions opposed. What else do you need to know?

Although crime has fallen significantly since the late twentieth century (and continued to fall through most of Obama’s administration), a recent spike in homicides could give Trump a pretext for dusting off the old playbook. The streets running with blood! Social justice warriors to blame! It does sound like a tailor-made Trump narrative. Given that Trump has already promised to personally see to it that anyone who kills a cop receives the death penalty, it’s entirely possible he might take Anderson’s advice.

Or We Could Make Good Policy

Here’s the thing about criminal justice reform. It’s a good idea. We should pursue it cautiously, following data rather than ideologies. Do what works; stop doing things that don’t work. My own experience suggests most people working within (or in connection to) the justice system are pretty committed to finding data-driven methods.

Reddy presses this point by tackling a list of “criminal justice myths” Sean Kennedy lists at RealClearPolicy. Contending that reform-minded conservatives are “imagining more problems than they solve,” Kennedy looks to explode the “myths” that he believes drive reform. The broader implication, obviously, is that conservatives like Sen. Mike Lee have been seduced by the siren song of social justice.

Reddy shows that Kennedy’s “myth list” is mostly composed of straw men and red herrings. For instance, Kennedy is right to point out that we may not really incarcerate a larger percentage of our citizenry than any other country on earth. Sure, reported statistics indicate that we do, but North Korea could very well be lying. They probably are! Maybe Turkmenistan is too! No worries, guys. We totally aren’t Incarceration Nation!

Here’s a good rule of thumb. If you have to rely on projected dictatorial dishonesty to avoid a shameful booby prize, you probably should not be celebrating that all is well. We may not actually be No. 1 in incarceration, but we really do incarcerate an enormous number of people. (As Reddy points out, our incarceration rate is six times Canada’s.) Is it really necessary to do that?

Looking at the data from state-level reform efforts, it seems likely that it isn’t. In true glass-half-empty fashion, Kennedy offers a spirited argument that a substantial share of our inmate population does threaten public safety. Reddy makes the obvious counter-point: even if that’s true, there may still be a sizable minority that doesn’t pose a serious threat, in which case we’re wasting a lot of resources by incarcerating them.

Incarceration certainly does need to play a role in our justice system, but past a certain point it can become counter-productive to uproot not-very-dangerous people and place them in communities of criminals. The data give us reason to believe we’ve moved past that diminishing-returns point, so conservative reformers are looking for ways to make the system better.

They aren’t recommending that we throw open the prisons and invite everybody to walk free. Instead they’re scrutinizing penal codes, analyzing our ever-growing wealth of data, and testing ideas for how to make the system more efficient, functional, and fair. Some have been on this project for many years now, pursuing reform for fundamentally conservative reasons. It’s not a social-justice coup.

The Price of Demagoguery

From an electoral narrative perspective, Anderson’s case looks like the easier sell. But what if Reddy and his wonky fellow reformers are actually right? What might we lose in making electoral hay through sacrificing prudent policy initiatives?

We lose the opportunity to influence developing policy. That’s bad for a number of reasons. For one thing, it ultimately facilitates the Left’s long march through our public institutions. The future usually belongs to those who help build it. Along those lines, staying involved in reform efforts is the best way to ensure the process isn’t hijacked by an irresponsible social-justice agenda.

The future usually belongs to those who help build it.

The real myth about criminal justice reform is that we somehow have a choice in whether it happens. It’s already happening. It will continue to happen. With some determined foot-dragging, conservatives might slow things down for a while, but the truth is that reform efforts really aren’t primarily driven by social-justice angst. They’re driven by the basic reality that a fraying social fabric leads to a lot of disorder, and that prisons can’t be the whole solution to that. They’re too expensive and too community-invasive.

A more multifaceted approach to social disorder was needed, so states got to work developing one. Conservatives have already made some sterling contributions to this process. We should take credit for those, and keep the momentum going. Disavowing the whole process will hurt us in the longer run.

As lovers of order, conservatives may appreciate the cognitive simplicity of trying to lock away all the bad guys. As lovers of liberty, though, we should prefer that people be free if they possibly can. Justice reform is one of the best contemporary examples of how liberals and conservatives can sometimes work together for common goals, even if their motivations are somewhat different. We may want to return to that template in the years to come. Must every conservative achievement be tossed on the Trumpian pyre?

As a Robert Novak Fellow, she is currently researching criminal justice reform. Her non-academic work can be found in Touchstone Magazine, the Public Discourse and Crisis Magazine.

It Isn’t Conservative To Rush Criminal Justice Reform,"A conservative, said its father in modern America, Russell Kirk, is one who “endeavors to conserve the best in our traditions and our institutions, reconciling that best with necessary reform from time to time.” Thus, when Rachel Lu appeals to “conservatives” in her latest argument for “criminal justice reform,” she leans heavily on the “necessary reform.”

The problem is that even Kirk’s definition fails to account for the second pillar of conservativism: skepticism in the face of liberal innovation (that is, the new for the sake of new). Reform or change in this case can be embraced but only when necessary and when change is demonstrably an improvement.

To work backwards from Lu’s conclusion to her arguments is useful in unpacking her flawed conceits. The broad first principle Lu concludes with is deeply conservative: “As lovers of order, conservatives may appreciate the cognitive simplicity of trying to lock away all the bad guys. As lovers of liberty, though, we should prefer that people be free if they possibly can.”

Would that it were that simple. The call for both order (and inherently justice) and liberty is laudable, but Lu reasons her way there by eliding over the details her political opponents (including myself) cite, misconstruing their arguments in the process.

I’m Attacking Real Arguments, Not Strawmen

The two separate but often conflated proposals that Lu calls “criminal justice reform” are distinct. One is the state-level efforts advocated and advanced by Right on Crime and Koch brothers’ umbrella groups as well as a myriad of left-wing organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and George Soros’ front groups (i.e. the Open Society Foundation). The second is the federal Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, co-sponsored by senators Mike Lee, Richard Durbin, Cory Booker, and John Cornyn, among others.

It is the latter which my article for RealClearPolicy last month concerns and what Vikrant Reddy of the Koch Institute and myself engaged over in National Review.

First, Lu attacks my RCP article by arguing, without quoting me directly, that I use “strawmen” to advance an argument that Lee and federal reformers are invoking myths. Yet I specifically quote individuals and organizations that have explicitly invoked the myths I responded to (i.e., The White House Council of Economic Advisors, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and President Obama).

Lu doesn’t quote from my original op-ed or even acknowledge the response to Reddy I offered on May 20 in National Review. Moreover, she suggests Reddy actually criticizes my “myths” as not factual when in reality Reddy writes that my piece “expertly filleted some of the worst arguments made by overzealous criminal-justice reformers on both the left and the right.”

So there are no strawmen in my arguments, but Reddy and Lu do suggest I am distracting from the problem of mass incarceration—with, in Lu’s word’s, “red herrings.” Again, both of my articles address the Senate’s sentencing reform bill specifically, which neither Reddy nor Lu actually defend in name or substance. Instead, they both simply repeat the need for “criminal justice reform,” an umbrella term so broad that anyone can project almost anything onto it, rendering it meaningless.

Our Incarceration Rate Tracks the Crime Rate

Furthermore, Lu zeroes in on my rejection of the myth that the United States is “the world’s largest jailer” in absolute or relative terms. But again, she simply attacks the example I use of statistical sleight of hand by, you guessed it, information from the White House and a Soros-backed group that mislead the public about the nature of foreign incarceration statistics. North Korea’s prison population is an unknown, and China’s is almost certainly doctored, so it’s reasonable to conclude that data set used to compare them with the United States is useless.

In fairness to Reddy (on whom Lu seems to rely), he acknowledges that “these figures are hard to trust, and so comparisons with these countries are of limited value.” If Lu had closely read either of the pieces I wrote, she would see that I note clearly:

[W]here there is genuine disparity in the incarceration rate between the U.S. and other countries around the world, the most likely reason is two-fold: the U.S. is more violent than most other developed nations, and it possesses a well-functioning and honest criminal justice system.

And:

The real reason the U.S. has a mammoth prison-industrial complex is that we have a massive crime-control problem. The U.S. comes in above most other developed nations on almost every violent-crime metric (murder, rape, etc.) — above Reddy’s example of England and Wales, let alone Japan. We lock up more bad guys because we have more of them, for various and myriad reasons.

So Lu (and Reddy) are left with the argument that our incarceration rate is simply “too high” because it feels too high.

Next comes the most troubling problem with any argument for “criminal justice reform” Lu advances, saying that “[conservative reformers are] scrutinizing penal codes, analyzing our ever-growing wealth of data, and testing ideas for how to make the system more efficient, functional, and fair. Some have been on this project for many years now, pursuing reform for fundamentally conservative reasons.”

Here, Lu allows readers to trust our elected leaders, something very un-conservative indeed, without actually examining the data or floating the specific ideas being considered (that she doesn’t cite). I’m all for a “more efficient, functional, and fair” criminal justice system, but that is not what is on offer federally. I remain skeptical and would like to be convinced that the benefits promised will actually materialize and not be outweighed by the harms incurred. I suspect I’ll be waiting a while.

Until then, I’ll be happily standing athwart (criminal justice reform) history, yelling stop!

We Need Sentencing Reform And This Bill Is A Good Start,"What’s really going on with the federal Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act? This bipartisan legislation has been in the news lately, prompting a strange and confusing exchange between conservatives who support justice reform (notably Vikrant Reddy and myself) and critics of the movement (Sean Kennedy and Jeffrey Anderson).

These articles kicked up a sizable cloud of dust without communicating much about the legislation’s content and goals. It’s time to explain more clearly: what does this legislation actually accomplish, and why is it suddenly generating controversy?

Politics Versus Policy

The Federal Sentencing Act is not perfect. No legislation is. But it represents a good-faith, bipartisan effort to improve our prisons and courts, making the former more efficient and the latter more fair. It is broadly in line with state-level reforms that have already yielded considerable success. The proposed measures are also modest, making it exceedingly unlikely this law will precipitate a crime wave. It is a well-conceived and responsible piece of legislation.

Unfortunately, it’s also the kind of legislation that can easily fall prey to political maneuvering. It’s complicated and technical, and adjusts scores of statutes. Unless you have an intimate familiarity with the federal penal system, it’s hard to assess what’s really changing. Many voters still find it funny that conservatives are working to reform our justice system, and in a Jacksonian-spirited election year, the temptation to resurrect tough-on-crime memes was predictably strong.

Donald Trump has been comparatively quiet thus far on the crime issue. That may reflect the fact that some of his likely vice presidential candidates (most notably Newt Gingrich and Nathan Deal) have already established themselves in the pro-reform camp. Nevertheless, this initiative could still fall prey to the dreary realities of partisan base-beating. That would be sad to see, especially since justice reform is almost the only bipartisan issue we’ve got left in these bitter times.

Of course, for some that is itself a strong motive to kill the bill. They hardly even pretend to know or care about the content of the legislation itself. Consider Jeffrey H. Anderson’s “What, are we the sort of people who work with Democrats?” rebuttal to my last essay for an example of this thinking.

What Does S.B. 2123 Actually Do?

If passed into law, this bill would modestly reduce the number of people serving lengthy sentences for drug-related crimes. It’s a pressing issue at the federal level because federal prisons (though they account for only a fraction of our nation’s total inmate population) have very disproportionate numbers of drug-related criminals. Murderers, rapists, and burglars are mainly found in state prisons. By contrast, about half of federal prisoners are drug offenders. Think of this as the Richard Nixon legacy.

The past two decades have seen ramped-up sentences for drug criminals, which have cost us billions in taxpayer money, while yielding few benefits. Between 1988 and 2012, federal sentences more than doubled in length, at the cost of more than $2 billion a year. If there was an upside for public safety, it’s not clearly visible in the data. Longer prison terms don’t notably deter crime, which is unsurprising given that criminals don’t tend to be long-term planners. Recidivism remains high regardless of sentence length, up until the point when inmates start to “age out” of the cohort of likely criminals. In other words, 65-year-olds don’t commit many felonies, but a 25-year-old is no less likely to re-offend because we incarcerated him for four years instead of two.

The moral of the story is that prisons are beneficial primarily insofar as they keep dangerous people off the streets. That’s a huge benefit with respect to murderous psychopaths. Yet if we’re talking about minor, subsidiary figures in the drug trade, we should recognize they are easily replaced. Hitting small-time distributors or smugglers with decades-long sentences will not solve our drug problem.

Even recognizing those principles, it’s always best to be cautious about public safety. The Sentencing and Corrections Act is cautious. We certainly won’t be seeing the immediate release of thousands of drug criminals. Rather, the bill takes modest steps to soften some of the more drastic measures in federal drug laws. Sean Kennedy’s recent missive cautioned against “rushing” conservative justice reform, but looking at the bill currently in front of us, I’m truly at a loss to imagine what might satisfy him if this does not.

Why This Is Prudent Reform

Let’s consider some examples. Under current law, a person convicted of his second high-level drug crime triggers a mandatory 20-year prison sentence, while the third triggers a life sentence. Under S.B. 2123, those would be reduced to minimum 15- or 25-year sentences, respectively.

Note that “high-level” drug crimes are often distinguished by bulk. If a kid is caught with a kilogram of heroin that he plans to sell at his high school, he could be charged with a “major” drug crime even if the blend is actually 80 percent powdered sugar. Drug mules are another example of “major drug offenders” who in some cases may be less than fully aware of what they’re doing when they commit their crimes.

It’s true that major drug offenders are generally involved in the drug trade in some way; they aren’t just run-of-the-mill college potheads. On the other hand, it’s hard to think of reasons why a 25-year sentence would be insufficient for a nonviolent drug criminal. How many people, after spending half their lives in prison, will get out at 50 and start looking for an on-ramp back into the drug trade?

Another provision of S.B. 2123 expands slightly the “safety valve” that allows federal judges a bit more discretion in deciding whether mandatory minimum sentences can appropriately be applied. Basically, a safety valve is designed to bring human judgment into the courtroom, allowing judges to decree that mandatory minimums are, in particular cases, very unnecessarily harsh. Kennedy makes much of this in a recent piece at National Review, implying that bleeding-heart liberal judges are hungry for opportunities to release dangerous criminals with a slap on the wrist. The Sentencing and Corrections Act is just the excuse they need to put drug lords and kingpins back on the street with minimal accountability.

Even if we accept that federal judges are as tender-hearted and feckless as Kennedy claims, we should recognize that S.B. 2123 is carefully constructed to prevent that kind of abuse. The safety valve can only be applied to a narrow range of cases involving mostly clean offenders. If you already have a lengthy rap sheet (specifically, four or more criminal history points), no bleeding-heart judge can help you, because you won’t qualify. If you’ve ever been convicted of a violent felony, you won’t qualify. If you were a leading or organizing member of a criminal gang, or if you refused to cooperate with authorities after your arrest, or if anyone died or was seriously injured in the commission of your crime, you won’t qualify.

Do these sound like drastic measures? More complete summaries of the bill’s provisions can be found here, here, and here, but in broad form, S.B. 2123 is a solid example of responsible, prudent reform. It makes modest adjustments to multiple statutes, working towards a reduction of the number of nonviolent people serving punishing sentences for drug crimes. That in turn reflects a sound, research-supported consensus that draconian drug sentences aren’t doing much good, and that the relevant resources can be better used elsewhere.

What’s Your Plan, Reform Critics?

If you’re unsure whom to trust in the justice-reform debate, consider this. Reform-minded conservatives have ideas, an agenda, and recent legislative accomplishments to their names. They’ve been elbow-deep in the relevant policy issues for many years now. By contrast, their critics can’t even seem to agree on the most fundamental point: is over-incarceration is actually a problem in America?

In many ways it’s unsurprising that this would be a fuzzy point for critics. Mass incarceration was the rock against which tough-on-crime finally foundered. For decades, conservatives called for tough, consistent sanctions as a response to rising crime and disorder. This approach did yield some benefits: crime fell through the ’80s and ’90s.

As prison populations exploded, however, the price tag likewise grew steeper, and the social effects of imprisoning about 1 percent of our population became ever harder to ignore.

As prison populations exploded, however, the price tag likewise grew steeper, and the social effects of imprisoning about 1 percent of our population became ever harder to ignore. Crowded prisons are bad for any number of reasons. They’re miserable and unsafe (for guards as well as inmates), and they do a poor job of rehabilitating offenders.

Eventually, it became clear to policy-savvy conservatives that they needed a more multifaceted approach to crime control. Red states have been leading the way for years now in using data-driven methods to reduce incarceration without sacrificing public safety. Many of the same people and organizations have helped to craft and promote federal sentencing reform, eventually giving rise to the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.

As policy, it’s been an impressive effort. Politically, it requires a paradigm shift that some haven’t yet made. As the data pile up indicating that prudent reform is possible, William Otis has gone on defending large-scale incarceration, regularly repeating his maxim that a criminal justice system is judged not by its incarceration rate, but by its crime rate. That no-limit position is too drastic for most, so we see figures like Kennedy and Anderson taking softer but more confusing stances, vacillating between tough-on-crime rhetoric and vague complaints that the legislation in front of us is too quick, too drastic or too bipartisan.

Kennedy warns us, in the spirit of Otis’ critique, that the real problem with our society is the number of criminals, not the number of inmates. Then he goes on to imply that state-level justice reform has been healthy but that the federal bill somehow goes too far. (How? Why? What provisions would he change?)

Anderson implies that federal sentencing reform represents an irresponsible lapse of conservative principles, but then later concedes that some reform may be good, on the condition that we scrap the present bill and replace it with exclusively Republican-authored legislation. (Why would we do that when reform-interested conservatives have been involved in writing and promoting this bill?)

It’s hard to have a serious debate when critics are bringing so little to the table. Through promoting successful state-level reforms, conservative justice reformers have demonstrated that they are prudent, cautious, and highly attentive to data. Unless critics can offer something more substantive than dated political platitudes, we should trust that this statute is moving us a step in the right direction.

Correction: An earlier version of this misquoted Otis’s maxim as applying to nations rather than criminal justice systems.

4 Major Problems With Gun Control Arguments,"Every mass shooting and act of terror is an opportunity for liberals to push gun control. Something must be done to stop gun violence, but there are four problems with the liberal argument for gun control. These are: (1) hypocrisy; (2) reality; (3) misapplication of blame; and (4) discrimination. In the end, there is a better, more reasonable solution.

1. Gun Control Hypocrisy

Gun control contains three types of hypocrisy. The first is the contradiction of protection (value of human life), the second is the contradiction of solution (terrorism and criminals), and the third is the contradiction of right-control.

The argument for gun control is, essentially: human life is valuable, killing humans is wrong, guns kill humans, so, limit access to guns to protect human life. Liberals’ wish to protect human life, however, does not apply to everyone, since under their policies some life is not valuable, like those of the preborn.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said whether a baby in the womb is human doesn’t have anything to do with policy. To win over pro-abortion women, Hillary Clinton said the Constitution does not protect the unborn. Liberal policy is to ignore the value of some life to advance a perceived “right” to attain votes.

When society arbitrarily dictates which life has value, it does two things: (1) fosters a culture where not all human life has value, so some humans can be discarded or treated less than others, to the point of killing them; and (2) says humans can arbitrarily decide which human life has value. So, aborting some (preborn) is warranted and morally acceptable because they do not have value, while aborting others (born) is unwarranted and immoral because they have value.

It’s contradictory to argue that access to an instrument (guns) should be limited because a class of people (born) have value, but simultaneously that access to other instruments (vacuum, uterine currette, syringe, embryotomy scissors, Dubois embryotomy decapitating scissors) should not be limited because a class of people (preborn) have no value.

The second problem is the contradiction of solutions. The liberal answer for defeating violent extremism (i.e., radical Islamic terrorism) is jobs and social programs. Vice President Joe Biden, at a three-day White House summit on terrorism, opened by stating societies must provide economic alternatives to terrorism. Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, told Chris Mathews on “Hardball” that we must counter terrorism by providing job opportunities. In February 2015, President Obama’s framework for fighting violent extremism was education, jobs, and social programs. So if the root cause of violence and the solution to violent extremism overseas is job opportunities, education, and social programs, it should be the political solution to violence in America. Not gun control.

Third, liberals ensure Americans that government control of guns is not a restriction on Second-Amendment rights. This is a contradiction in right-control.

When Hillary spoke this year at the Hartford Connecticut YMCA, she said that as president she would change the “gun culture,” and could do this consistent with the Second Amendment. Liberals wouldn’t tolerate language like, “As president I would change the death culture, controlling abortion consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment,” or, “As president I would change discrimination toward women by limiting access to pornography.” When some states or organizations want to change the “death culture” or “porn culture” consistent with the Fourteenth or First Amendments, liberals accuse them of sending America back to the Stone Age, and Planned Parenthood or the ACLU sues.

2. Gun Control Doesn’t Respond to Reality

Some want to turn what’s illegal into a right (e.g., drugs, prostitution, or illegal immigration) or argue that decriminalizing certain things (e.g. drugs or prostitution) lessens crimes. About guns, however, the argument is the opposite. Either it’s viewed as a “right” not to protect or argued that criminalizing it would lessen crimes.

Making guns illegal or restricting access to them won’t end gun violence. By analogy, possession and use of many controlled substances is illegal, yet people possess and use them. Indeed, illegal drug overdose is the leading cause of death in America (a study released by the Drug Enforcement Agency found that overdose death is the leading cause of injury death in the United States, over vehicles and firearms).

Obama has used Australia and England as lofty examples of Western societies ending gun violence. However, depending on the study cited, there is no clear and convincing evidence that gun homicides in Australia have declined since the ban on certain weapons and their buyback plan (National Firearms Agreement). Studies do agree that suicide rates have declined.

The Associated Press, though, says criminologists agree the National Firearms Agreement has reduced gun homicides. Results following England’s self-proclaimed “toughest gun control laws in the world” are known and are not good; crimes using banned weapons have risen. At a glance, gun control in Australia (which doesn’t have a Bill of Rights), seems to have decreased gun violence; yet, it depends on the studies. In reality, however, prohibiting an act or an object does not necessarily reduce crime or violence.

3. Gun Control Misapplies Blame

Journalists and many politicians blame guns, mental illness, or some other thing when a shooting occurs. Although mental illness could be a contributing factor, it is not the cause. After Columbine, the media also blamed Marilyn Manson. Manson’s response was twofold: (1) times have not become more violent, just more televised and (2) the blame for the shootings is not music but us: “When it comes down to who’s to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you’ll hit someone who’s guilty.”

Violence is not something new to this world. Before guns there was violence and mass killings. What has changed is the mass production of violence and its glamorization. Movies and video games romanticize violence or make it grotesque, desensitizing the conscious and natural disdain towards it. When the heart becomes numb to violence and taught to act on passions, a violent reaction will occur when someone decides to act. As Jesus said, it is not what is put into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the heart. Blame falls not on the instrument, but on us as individuals for defiling our hearts.

4. Gun Control Is Discriminatory

The Contradiction of Protection above leads to discrimination. Advocating for laws to protect one group while disregarding the rights of another is discrimination. A country having gone through a Civil War that nearly ripped it apart once treated blacks as property and women as second-class citizens. It still treats babies and women as property and babies as second-class. It is discrimination to say Germans should live but not Jews, whites should live but not blacks, the born should live but not the preborn.

It’s a utilitarian worldview centered on the self to discriminately apply the Constitution or natural rights on only certain groups so the majority within a protected class can live in harmony. Selfishness of rights breeds violence. We think ourselves advanced, caring, and tolerant, but still foster discrimination and violence towards certain groups when advocating for laws that protect one class over another. Advocating for gun control while advocating for abortion and pornography is utilitarian selfishness, based on the premise that the preborn and women can be discriminated against while appearing altruistic.

What We Should Do Instead

First, foster a culture of respect for all human life, from conception to natural death. Also, in response to mass shootings, the response should be focused on the shooter’s depraved heart and the religion or philosophy that drives him, not on the instrument used to kill. Individuals must start to control what comes into the heart, and society must root itself in virtue, the Commandments, the Beatitudes, and spirituality.

School education needs to include moral and ethical principles founded on the natural law. Last, offering free classes on firearm safety will teach responsible use of firearms, decreasing its glamorization. Wars and crimes will never be eradicated, but violence can be substantially reduced.

"Heather Mac Donald on Discretionary Policing, Violent Crime, and Black Lives Matter","Heather MacDonald, fellow at the Manhattan Institute, joined the Federalist Radio Hour to discuss her new book, “The War on Cops.” MacDonald addressed the motives of movements like BlackLivesMatter and how it has impacted police forces across the nation.

Mac Donald said crime decreased during the years of economic downturn since 2008 despite liberal rhetoric that economic downturn increases crime.

“Staring in the second half 2014 however, after the shooting of Michael Brown and Ferguson, Missouri…crime in heavily black neighborhoods starting going up because again officers are backing off of policing under the relentless hostility they get on the streets and under the message that they they are the biggest threat facing young black men,” she said.

Domenech and Mac Donald discuss the “Ferguson Effect”, discretionary policing, Freddie Gray, the broken windows theory, and what policing is becoming in Chicago, Detroit, and other urban areas.

"America Is Awash In Guns, And Crime Is At Record Lows","Most Americans believe America is submerged beneath a tidal wave of gun violence. A Pew Research poll in 2013 found that 56 percent of Americans thought gun violence had risen in the last 20 years, 26 percent thought it had remained the same, and only 12 percent thought it had fallen. You might be surprised to learn the 12 percent were right.

The gulf between the facts about guns and the public’s perception is immense, and was created deliberately. Anti-gun advocates invent new terms (“assault weapon”) and politicians lie to win over a skeptical public. Too often these myths are swallowed by journalists and celebrities who don’t bother to check the data and don’t know how modern firearms actually work.

The myth that rising sales of semi-automatic rifles have led to rising levels of gun homicides is pervasive. “The United States has been pummeled by gun violence since the assault weapons ban expired in 2004,” read The Boston Globe’s June 16 editorial in a typically misleading statement of alarm. Although a Globe reader would reasonably conclude that the country is suffering a spike in homicides, the opposite is true. All violence, including gun violence, in America has declined dramatically for more than two decades.

Gun Ownership Up; Gun Crime Down

Using federal government data, University of Michigan and American Enterprise Institute economist Mark Perry last year measured the gun homicide rate against the number of guns per person from 1993-2013. As the number of guns per person rose from 0.94 to 1.45, the gun homicide rate fell by 49 percent, from 7 to 3.6 per 100,000 people.

Also using federal government data, the Pew Research Center reported last year that non-fatal gun victimizations have fallen from 725.3 to 174.8 per 100,000 people from 1993-2014. So all gun-related crime is falling, not just gun homicides.

The United States seems to be recovering a large chunk of the civility obliterated in the tumult of the 1960s and ’70s, suggesting (as do global historical data) that human-on-human violence is predominantly a product of culture, not technology. The U.S. homicide rate more than doubled from 1963-1973 and remained high for the next 20 years. In 1973, the rate was 9.4 per 100,000 people; in 1993 it was 9.5. Although we will need more time before we can know for sure, this spike in homicides appears to have been an historical aberration. Since 1993, the homicide rate has collapsed and it now hovers around its 1962-63 level.

In 2014, the homicide rate was 4.5 per 100,000 people, less than half the rate in 1995. The last time it was that low was 1963, when the rate was 4.6. The median age in the United States is 37, so for the average American alive today the odds of being murdered have never been lower — even though Americans possess millions more firearms than they did two decades ago when homicide rates were higher.

The Same for Rifles (‘Assault Weapons’)

What about so-called “assault weapons?” The FBI divides firearms into handguns and rifles, with the rifles category covering everything from the little .22-caliber rifles kids shoot at summer camps to the dreaded AR-15. In last year’s “Uniform Crime Report,” the FBI listed the number of homicides committed with rifles since 2010. (A few thousand homicides each year are committed with firearms of undetermined type — most likely handguns. These are numbers for confirmed rifle deaths.) The numbers are: 367 in 2010; 332 in 2011; 298 in 2012; 285 in 2013; and 248 in 2014.

This decline in confirmed homicides by rifle coincided with a massive increase in the number of “assault rifles” Americans own. From 2010-2014, sales of semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 rose 28 percent per year, the Los Angeles Times reported on June 13. So while the number of rifles in circulation was increasing dramatically, the number of confirmed murders committed by someone using a rifle fell by almost one-third. During the same time, the number of homicides committed with handguns fell by 9 percent.

The data produce one inescapable conclusion: The entire premise for a new “assault weapons” ban — that the proliferation of “assault weapons” has led to unprecedented carnage — is completely untrue. Yes, the United States is a particularly violent Western country. But blaming this on America’s love of guns is simplistic and wrong. The homicide rate in the United States does not track neatly with the gun ownership rate.

When searching for ways to reduce homicides in the United States, it would be more helpful to discuss America’s macho culture or America’s violent culture than America’s “gun culture.” That is, if your goal really is to make America a more peaceful place. If your goal is simply to win elections by scaring the public, then you would be talking like Sens. Harry Reid and Chris Murphy.

True Headline: British Treat Opponents Well After Brexit Vote,"Yellow journalism (noun): journalism based upon sensationalism and crude exaggeration. Example: Monday’s Independent led with the headline: “EU Referendum: Reports of hate crime increase 57% following Brexit vote.”

(NB: This is not a commentary on whether hate crimes are bad. Of course they are. However, for the extremely thick, I feel compelled to mention this obvious fact.)

For the casual observer or citizen who is already prone to believe Britain is an inherently racist nation—or for anyone, for that matter, who doesn’t go on to read the full article, subliminally the message from the headline might easily be misconstrued as “57 percent of Britain is racist.” (I remind those who smirk at the idea of subliminal influence of the outrage over the “Beach Body” advertisement on the Underground.) One thing clearly implied in this headline, however, given that the figure is conveniently sandwiched between the words “EU Referendum” at the beginning and “following Brexit vote” at the end, is that the Leave result is responsible for hate crimes.

With sensational words such as “hate,” “crime,” “Brexit,” “referendum,” and “57%,” the headline also accurately and safely qualifies that the figure indicates reports of hate crimes and not actual confirmation of hate crimes, yet still fails to nullify the fear-based rhetorical impact of this. The word “reports” is a necessary qualifier which also absolves The Independent of printing an outright lie whilst allowing them to rush out a fear-based story that adds to the narrative many readers desperately want to believe.

Lies and Damned Statistics

We now move on to the article itself and the actual figures—again, not of confirmed hate crimes, but of reports of hate crimes: “There were 85 reports of hate crimes according to True Vision, a police-funded reporting website, between Thursday and Sunday compared with 54 reports over the same period four weeks ago.”

So what do we know? We know that, following one of the most historical and contentious referendums in British history, there were an additional 31 reports—again, not confirmations—of hate crimes in Britain. What we do not know, based on the article, is the following:

a) How many of those reports are confirmed and

b) If confirmed, how many of those crimes are racially or otherwise hate-motivated, as well as

c) If confirmed, how many of those crimes were the result of the Brexit vote.

Herein lies the sensationalist potential of statistics. Let’s say we have a community wherein there was one report of a hate crime before the referendum. Following the referendum, that same community reports no more than one additional hate crime. At this point, it would not be factually amiss for The Independent to report “Following EU Referendum, community sees 100% increase in reports of hate crime.” An accurate headline, to be sure, albeit one that makes gross use of misleading sophistry.

But let’s go further into numbers here to widen our perspective on this issue. The total number of votes cast for Leave was 17,410,742. Assuming a) that the reports of hate crimes are confirmed, b) there was only a single perpetrator in each crime, and c) the perpetrators were neither Remainers nor undecideds nor non-voters, the number of Leave voters who were not involved in a hate crime report before the referendum stands at 17,410,688.

Following the referendum, according to The Independent’s measures, that number now stands at 17,410,657. That’s a 1.78 percent increase (and converse decrease) in the number of Leave voters (again, assuming confirmation of the reports, number of perpetrators, and whether the Leave result was a factor) involved in a hate crime report.

But let’s widen our net a little here, seeing as how one of the primary assumptions necessary to the argument thus far has been the responsibility of Leave for these reports of hate crimes.

The current population of Great Britain is 65,111,143. Again, assuming a) confirmation of the reports and b) single perpetrators in each instance, as well as the addition of a new variable c) such that Remainers, undecideds, or non-voters could also be perpetrators, this would mean 65,111,089 citizens were not reported as perpetrators of a hate crime. Following the referendum, (again assuming a, b, and c) that number fell to 65,111,058. Therefore, there was a 4.76 percent increase (and converse decrease) among the entirety of the British populace who were or were not reported as being the perpetrator of a hate crime.

Thanks for Telling Me Hurting People Is Bad

So is there any more meat to this article than what we’ve been fed so far? (I hope so, it’s almost lunchtime!) Well, let’s look at what Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton says about these statistics: “Police forces are working closely with their communities to maintain unity and tolerance and prevent any hate crime or abuse following the EU referendum. At the national level, the vast majority of people are continuing to go about their lives in safety and security and there have been no major spikes in tension reported.”

He adds what the opening paragraph of the article has already told us about the additional 31 reports of hate crimes, but acknowledges the similarity to trends following other major national events in which “crime levels returned to normal relatively quickly.” Helpfully, presuming we weren’t aware by now, Hamilton does add that “all forms of hate crime are unacceptable” and hate crime “damages communities and undermines the diversity and tolerance we should instead be celebrating.”

So what have we learned from Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, according to The Independent? We’ve learned that diversity and tolerance should be celebrated and that hate crime is a bad thing. What we’ve not learned is, again, a) how many of the reports are confirmed, b) if confirmed, how many are racially or otherwise hate-motivated, and c) if confirmed, whether or not the Leave result is to blame.

Pretty thin gruel there. Still hungry? Let’s read on.

The chief executive for Stop Hate UK, Rose Simkins, tells The Independent the issue “may well get worse.” We don’t know why Simkins is qualified to predict the future, as her credentials to be a modern-day Nostradamus are not put on display in this short article. Perhaps she’s speaking about things getting worse for her. That is to say, if things get better and hate decreases, Rose Simkins of Stop Hate UK may in fact become redundant.

A Wave of Mean Facebook Posts

Incredulously, only after this sanctimonious grandstanding on the badness of hatred and the alarmist and presumptuous statistics implying the Leave result as the sole culprit that The Independent finally condescends to offer us some examples. We are told of a Facebook album entitled “worrying signs,” shown a video of an East End geezer telling a driver to “speak proper English,” and reminded of the reports—again, not confirmations (although three photos are now in circulation)—of the “Polish Vermin” cards in Cambridgeshire.

Any journalist worth his weight will tell you that anecdotal evidence is the worst kind of evidence.

These are, of course, dreadful incidents that should be deplored and condemned. But why The Independent chose not to lead with any empirical examples testifies to their own lack of faith in the story that a 57 percent increase (or 1.78 or 4.76 percent increase, depending on which model you use) in reports—again, not confirmations—of hate crimes is directly attributable to the Leave campaign.

Any journalist worth his weight will tell you that anecdotal evidence is the worst kind of evidence. Whether or not the anecdotes are true, unless verifiable by empirical proof, they cannot serve any sort of journalistic and evidentiary purpose. In this age of social media, reports of “I saw this happen” and “I heard that happen” frequently abound.

In fact, during the seven months I spent living as a woman, I regularly chronicled on Facebook the abuse I received from minority communities in the East End of London. If a reader was coming from a mindset that wasn’t prepared to accept that it’s possible for non-white people to be purveyors of bigotry, she could, if she wanted, dismiss such reports as merely anecdotal. Closer to the present moment, just yesterday, I was wearing a Vote Leave badge on the tube ride from Bethnal Green to King’s Cross and was twice directly called (or, more aptly, slandered) “racist” in the span of 20 minutes.

Like it or not, barring any empirical proof, those incidents are merely anecdotal. Although if I were to notify The Daily Mail and relate the story to them, there’s a very real likelihood they would nevertheless go ahead and run with it, just as The Independent apparently would do if either I witnessed firsthand or concocted a story out of thin air about a minority being verbally abused on the streets of London, long after both perpetrator and victim, real or not, were out of sight and out of mind.

Some of the yellow journalism of the sort we’ve been seeing on this topic calls to mind the scaremongering and ultimately inaccurate predictions of hate crime spikes in America following 9/11. That’s an incident, it can reasonably be argued, with cause for considerably more anger than having a referendum vote result in one’s favor.

Summation: Like it or not, this is a tolerant nation. And the sort of yellow journalism The Independent and others are engaging in following this referendum is just as deplorable for its intent to pit one side against another as is any hate crime.

Why No Government Branch Should Be Able To Fund Itself,"Executive overreach in financial matters can produce bipartisan opposition. Civil forfeiture laws, especially, have produced massive windfalls for governments at the expense of people who often had only tangential connection to the associated crime. Stories of towns subsidized by speed traps and federal courts profiting from the publication of legal documents have elicited similar outrage.

All of these abuses look like a grab-bag of governmental heavy-handedness, but they are united in more than that: each one is also a violation of the separation of powers that once defined American government. In dividing governmental power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, the Constitution’s authors looked to keep any one office-holder from gaining unrestricted power. In doing so, they created a government that required supermajorities to do anything of importance, making it difficult to restrict the people’s liberty.

Some modern pundits regard the separation of powers as a useless relic, especially when one part of the government stands in the way of some law or program they want (see, for example, these screeds against it by Dylan Matthews and Matthew Yglesias). But attachment to the idea is not simply a matter of historical accuracy or fidelity to the Constitution as written; it is also among the most important means of preserving liberty.

As James Madison wrote in Federalist 47 (quoting Montesquieu’s “The Spirit of the Laws”), “There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person …[or] if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.” A free people, in Madison’s mind, requires a government of divided powers.

Civil Forfeiture Is a Prime Example

Consider one of the worst examples of undivided power in modern times: civil forfeiture. The practice, in which the state seizes and permanently retains property suspected to have been involved with a crime (a crime for which the owner has not yet been charged or convicted), has become common in police departments across the nation. As Scott Shackford wrote earlier this year, the public has started to become aware of civil forfeiture and, overwhelmingly, they do not like it.

Part of their objection likely stems from the low burden of proof required. When the state fines people because they committed a crime, the accused must first be convicted by a jury that believes them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. With civil forfeiture, mere suspicion by police is sufficient. Most Americans would find such a system unjust on its face, even if a judge and jury were required to sign off on it.

But the problem goes deeper. In allowing police departments to not only seize but also retain the proceeds of civil forfeiture, the state severs the link between the legislature and the executive. The legislature is the branch of government most closely connected to the voters, being elected more frequently and from smaller districts than the executive elected state- or nationwide. The more the executive becomes self-funding, the less control the legislature has over it. Put more simply, an executive that does not need to ask the legislature for funds is one that does not need to ask the people for permission or respond to their concerns. Self-funding is self-rule.

The results are already apparent. While legislative appropriations are a matter of public record, how the proceeds of civil forfeiture are spent is often opaque. As the Institute for Justice noted in a recent report, “[m]ost jurisdictions lack any reporting requirements for forfeiture expenditures, and the limited data … provide very little insight into what law enforcement does with forfeiture funds.” Even when information is available, it is often unhelpful: 43 percent of the funds Pennsylvania seized, for example, were reported to have been spent on “other,” a category so broad as to be useless.

The source of the funds is similarly difficult to ascertain. When a legislature raises funds, it must consider the voting public’s opinion on equity. If they tax one group disproportionately, they risk raising the voters’ ire, or even running afoul of equal-protection guarantees. Funds raised by civil forfeiture have no such restrictions, and the executive alone chooses who gets stuck with the bill. It is perhaps unsurprising to note, therefore, that a 2015 American Civil Liberties Union report found that 53 percent of civil forfeitures in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, were against black people (only 9 percent of the county is black).

The New Feudalism

Civil forfeiture may be the best-known method of extra-legislative funding, but it is not the only one. The fines generated from minor infractions of law often also go directly to the police department that issues them. The result is a system that rewards vigorous enforcement and punishes leniency and common sense policing.

This facet of law enforcement funding is not new. Sheriffs in medieval Britain were paid based on the “perquisites of justice,” i.e., fees ordinary people paid them to perform their duties. More fees meant more pay. The system carried over to the United States, as well, as one man told historian John Kobler in describing Prohibition-era justice in Texas:

The old sheriff, Jess Robbins, and his deputies worked on a fee basis. The penalty for being drunk and disorderly was a fine of $17.80. The county got $2.80, the deputy who brought you in got $5, and Jess got $10.

In later decades, public authorities under the control of Robert Moses put a stranglehold on New York’s transportation funding for decades, collecting road and bridge tolls and spending them again without legislative input. In our own times, the practice remains common, as in this 2013 report from Augusta, Georgia, which noted that $2 from each traffic ticket issued went directly to the sheriffs’ retirement fund.

A system that was mildly unfair in those days becomes massively unjust in an age when the laws regulating people and property have drastically multiplied. With so many violations to choose from, police departments get to select the source of their funding. It is not shocking, therefore, when they choose to enforce laws most vigorously against those with the least power and wealth.

Abuses in the Judiciary

It is not only the executive that looks for independence from the legislature. In a May 2016 article for Wired, April Glaser reported that one part of the federal judiciary takes in nearly five times the revenue needed to sustain itself, and diverts the remainder to other purposes.

The system in question is PACER, a database of federal court documents. Anyone wanting access to a court record must pay ten cents per page, a price that would make sense for ordering paper copies, but for electronic documents is far too expensive. As Glaser wrote, “the Administrative Office [of the United States Courts] reported collecting $145 million in PACER fees, five years after projecting annual operating costs of less than $30 million.”

As in the executive branch abuses above, it is not easy to find out where exactly the excess money goes. According to the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit, some of the money went to courtroom infrastructure upgrades, even though the E-Government Act of 2002 only allows the judiciary to charge enough “to reimburse expenses in providing these services.” This is not a one-time abuse of an unexpected windfall: Wired took the judiciary to task for overcharging for PACER way back in 2009.

In 2014, Joseph Shapiro of NPR reported on similar abuses in state courts around the country. Half of the fines leveled in one Michigan county went directly to fund the judiciary: “Those costs include the salaries of court employees, for heat, telephones, copy machines and even to underwrite the cost of the county employees’ fitness gym.” Shapiro’s report focused on the problem of these costs, like those of civil forfeiture, falling disproportionately on the poor, but the lack of legislative oversight on a growing pot of the people’s money is just as troubling.

Both Sides Against the Middle

The danger from the Left is from those who want self-perpetuating government that functions independent of the people’s will. But there is also a danger on the Right, from those who want government to be “run like a business.” Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump recently told reporters he would be happy to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, as long as the federal government received “a piece of the profits.” Instead of taxing corporate profits, Trump thinks the state should use its muscle to take a piece of the business, like a mafioso demanding protection money. Earning profits in exchange for services rendered is a normal practice in private enterprise. In a government, it is extortion.

As government grows in scope and strength, so do opportunities for it to fleece the public through extra-legislative fees. The government’s role has changed since 1789, but it is more worthwhile than ever to examine the principles on which that government is based. Returning again to Madison and Montesquieu in Federalist 47, we can see what they thought would be the result of unchecked power being concentrated in one branch of government:

Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for the judge would then be the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppressor.

Madison and the other Founding Fathers knew that any government, no matter how noble its beginning, would eventually be controlled by people who wanted to aggregate their own power without the interference of the citizenry. What he did not count on is the willingness of one branch of that government, the legislature, to acquiesce in power grabs by the other two.

By letting the executive and judicial branches collect and appropriate funds, these state and federal legislators have abdicated the power of the purse, the power that the Revolutionary generation thought would make the legislature the most powerful branch. To regain that power, and to restore liberty in the areas of government in which it has been lost, they must take back their basic function and demand that no funds be dispersed except through the (comparatively) open and honest process of legislative appropriations. It’s time to end self-funding government.

Everyone Should Support Police Accountability,"This has been a tough week for American police. They’re learning the hard way that in today’s world, the cell phone is mightier than the gun.

Someone Is Always Watching

First, there was Alton Sterling. He made a small living trafficking in illegal goods – specifically, bootleg CDs. In the small hours of Tuesday morning, the Baton Rouge police put a stop to it. A widely-circulated cell phone video shows police forcing him to the ground and restraining him. Resistance is minimal; he clearly isn’t planning to put up a fight. Then, the officer further away from the camera shouts something about a gun. The closer officer draws his weapon, pauses for a sickening moment as if contemplating what to do, and shoots the restrained man at point-blank range.

If you can watch this video without expletives, you’re more civilized than I am.

The hits keep coming. Last night, here in my own Twin Cities, 32-year-old Philando Castile was fatally shot by the St Anthony Police Department. His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, narrates the incident live on her cell phone, projecting a remarkable calm as she explains how she and Castile were pulled over for a broken tail light. According to Diamond, Castile was a licensed carrier, and warned the officer in advance that he had a gun on his person, but was only reaching for the requested documents. She pans the cell phone over to show Castile, who is drenched in blood. According to her narration, he was shot four times. We never see the officer’s face, but the drawn weapon is still visible through the passenger window as she speaks.

We don’t have official forensic reports on either of these events. This is especially significant in Castile’s case, since the video doesn’t actually show the shooting. Let’s not kid ourselves, though. This looks incredibly bad.

How interesting that these tragedies would occur just as conservatives were launching into a fresh round of indignation over the “war on cops”.

Is There A War On Cops?

Conservatives like cops. We’re law and order people, so we need to believe that the good guys are the ones with the badges. We’re anxious to do our part to protect the boys in blue from race-baiting liberals and delusional social justice warriors.

This summer, the trendy conservative phrases have been “Ferguson Effect” and “the war on cops”. Both can be traced back to Heather Mac Donald, whose newly-released book argues that cops are policing cities less aggressively, in response to negative publicity from liberal politicians and social justice warriors. That laxity, Mac Donald argues, has had some dire consequences, most notably a spike in homicides across several American cities.

It’s slightly odd for a longtime police apologist like Mac Donald to paint cops as such a sensitive and highly-strung crowd. It’s true that police officers have been more scrutinized of late, and particular politicians and pundits have made unreasonable accusations. Still, actual police fatalities have been at historic lows over the past few years, and while the number of indictments has ticked up slightly, exceedingly few are ever convicted for on-duty fatalities. Given the sacrifices they’ve made, cops do deserve a margin of error, as well as some benefit of the doubt when the evidence surrounding a fatal shooting is inconclusive. The evidence suggests, though, that they’re already getting that, which makes it hard to justify the sort of widespread laxity in law enforcement that would provoke a “Ferguson effect” crime spike.

Despite this, Mac Donald seems to think that we should address policing problems by redoubling our full-voiced support for the boys in blue. Only when cops feel fully and unambiguously supported can we expect to see good policing, and safer neighborhoods.

Corruptio Optimi Pessima

Policing is an honorable profession. A cop is a person who has volunteered to put his own safety on the line to protect yours. That’s impressive, and we should respect it.

Here’s the thing about honorable professions, though. When people are entrusted with noble and good work, it’s always possible that they might betray that trust. The consequences of that betrayal can be very ugly indeed. In the words of the ancients, corruptio optimi pessima. The corruption of the best produces the worst.

When a profession commands our respect, we often feel tempted to “virtue-cloak” it, insisting against all opposition that members of that profession really are what we know they should be. This is a natural impulse, especially in a fractious society where political narratives dominate public life. We understand how easily cops can become scapegoats for progressive liberals with an agenda. They deal daily with the grim effects of social breakdown, and when those confrontations take a tragic turn, liberals would much rather blame the “racist” police than acknowledge the bitter fruits of the sexual revolution and the welfare state.

We shouldn’t allow that sort of scapegoating. Still, that’s not the only relevant danger. Virtue cloaks can be perilous in their own way. They give cover to real and serious misdeeds, particularly in professions (like policing) where people already have a strong, natural tendency to circle the wagons and protect their own. When alarming police shootings occur, that should prompt us to ask: Are these rare aberrations? Or have we, by reflexively defending law enforcement at every turn, helped create conditions in which corruption and brutality can proliferate unchecked?

The Perils of Virtue-Cloaking

We’ve seen this pattern before in other professions. Ask the Catholic Church what happens when an intense concern with public image induces leadership to ignore a growing avalanche of red flags. Pope John Paul II (now a canonized saint) was in most respects an inspiring leader and an intensely holy man. Nevertheless, his strong commitment to developing and ennobling the priesthood gave him something of a blind spot when it came to bad priests. When rumors trickled upwards that priests were abusing minors, the pontiff seems to have assumed that this just couldn’t be true.

Some have suggested that the Soviets once used allegations of sexual misconduct to undermine and discredit good priests. The young Karol Wojtyla (who would later become Pope John Paul II) got used to dismissing such charges as so much anti-clerical hot wind. It’s easy to understand how that could happen. Plenty of modern people hate the Church! But in this case, tragically, it wasn’t hot wind. When the horrific realities of priestly sexual predation came to light, the Church suffered a blow from which it has yet to fully recover.

Obviously, the tragedy was devastating for the victims of abuse, and their families. The Church’s reputation was also badly tarnished. The fallout still affects rank-and-file Catholics by the millions, as punishing lawsuits push dioceses into bankruptcy. Unsurprisingly, the crisis deepened an already-dire vocations crisis, and good priests suffered immensely through 2000’s. Just ask a cleric how it felt in 2002, when parents would see him in the frozen food aisle and shepherd their kids in the opposite direction.

Last January, on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, Ted Cruz described the police as modern-day Levites, our priests clad in blue. Perhaps some people liked that image. I shivered.

The Warning Signs Are There

Even those who favor quasi-sacerdotal policemen should be more cautious. To the attentive and unbiased eye, the red flags are already there, indicating that many American police departments need more transparency, and better oversight.

Let’s start here. Why are there so many fatal police shootings in the United States? The gap between our nation and our European counterparts is eye-popping. Since 1990, Great Britain has had a total of 60 deadly police shootings. The city of Chicago beat that number in just five years. Meanwhile, across the US there were more than a thousand fatal police shootings in 2015, and we’re on track to match that number again this year.

These are very big numbers. Different societies are different of course, and there are lots of ways to explain statistical disparities, but can we first allow ourselves the obvious and natural reaction? Wow.

It isn’t always easy to get definitive information on police shootings. Unless someone was standing on hand with a cell phone, we may not have the kind of evidence could definitively tell us whether a shooting was justified or not.

Consider this, though. The statistical differences between police departments are sometimes quite big, even when we control for obvious things like crime rates. Despite its crime-susceptible population and its liberal-narrative-obsessed mayor, New York City has an admirably low number of police-related deaths. The same cannot be said of Kern County, California, which led the Big Apple last year in fatal shootings even though it has an average homicide rate and a tenth the population.

When historically high-crime cities see above-average numbers of police shootings, that’s unsurprising. When high numbers of shootings correspond in noteworthy ways to a lack of transparency, enthusiasm for the death penalty, or longstanding habitual support for tough-0n-crime policies, that should generate more concern.

Here’s another interesting fact: Police departments across the nation are paying out a fortune in lawsuits. This trend started before Black Lives Matter, and has led to the largest 10 police departments paying out more than a billion dollars in settlements since 2010. Is this just another symptom of our cop-hating, litigious culture? Perhaps, but a rise in legal hush money might also be a sign that police misconduct is more widespread than most conservatives want to believe.

The Right Way To Defend Cops

We owe it to the public, but also to good cops, to concern ourselves with these details. Honest cops don’t deserve to be tainted by the misdeeds of others. They inevitably will be, though, if an avalanche of ugly incidents persuade the public that the police are out to kill them.

Let’s suppose, sometime over the next few years, that Black Lives Matter and its supporters unearth a host of incidents like the ones seen this week. Suppose we find ourselves flooded with damning footage, skillfully buried police reports, and quietly settled lawsuits involving violent and undisciplined cops. Have conservatives positioned ourselves to defend good cops in such a circumstance? We’ve been telling people for a long time that “police brutality” is mostly a trumped-up canard of social justice warriors. If that turns out to be substantially untrue, how much credibility will mainstream conservative pundits have left?

Before we lose our cool over irresponsible political rhetoric, we should consider for a moment how much worse things could get. It’s true that many liberals would like to blame the police for a host of social ills. Most of their beloved social programs have had some awful social consequences, so it soothes them to think that policing might be the real problem. Many liberals would surely love to seize the advantage and start pinning all our social problems on the cops. At the moment, though, the public seems reasonably skeptical; the police remain of our most trusted institutions, and those numbers have remained relatively stable over the past twenty years. That could change, however.

It’s worth noting at this juncture that some libertarian outlets have been far more assiduous about considering evidence of problematic police aggression. Radley Balko, the Cato Institute, and Reason Magazine have all given coverage to policing issues; from another angle, The American Conservative has published some very circumspect pieces on justice issues. Still, most mainline conservative publications remain devoted to building up the “priests in blue”.

Police Reform Can Help Everyone

We should by all means defend cops against unjust accusations and tendentious political statements. We should be zealous about publicly exonerating individuals who are unfairly maligned by politically-interested parties. Ferguson’s Officer Darren Wilson is the obvious example, and he deserves whatever amends can now be made to him after the firestorm of criticism that sent him and his family into hiding, following what now definitely seems to have been a reasonable and justified shooting.

Still, before we accustom ourselves to tendentious phrases like “Ferguson effect”, we should make a concerted effort to understand the situation. Most importantly, we should always be looking for ways to make things better. Don’t we want to halt the evident deterioration of relations between citizens and the police in many of America’s higher-crime neighborhoods. It’s bad for all concerned when residents and cops feel like mutual enemies. Our interest in addressing that problem should outweigh our anxiousness to insist that liberals and their constituents bear the full blame.

Mac Donald is right to remind us that good cops deserve our respect. It’s also undoubtedly true that policing will attract more good men if it is held in high esteem. In the long run, though, we won’t be able to achieve that through head-in-sand denials of real problems. Law enforcement will only command the public’s respect by earning it, and by responding appropriately to genuine misconduct.

There are a number of ways that we might improve policing while still supporting the police. I recommend this article for an overview of some of the “low-hanging fruit”, which includes higher transparency and an improved awareness of mental illness. We need to think seriously about what forms of oversight are most effective. We should work on curbing the power of police unions, which predictably resist transparency.

It all begins, though, with good-faith engagement. Cops are not blue-clad priests, and a badge isn’t a license to kill. For everyone’s sake, conservatives need to work on new strategies for protecting American citizens from the people who should protect them.

"Despite Media Hysteria, Violent Crime Is At Record Lows","It’s not 1968 yet. It’s not even 1993.

It’s fashionable to freak out about everything. So much of the discussion in the media over the last week has been conducted with a tone and focus that suggests violent crime — gun crimes, in particular — are at historic highs and society is on the cusp of unraveling into mass violence.

There are plenty of ominous signs about cohesion, but we’re not exactly in a civil war just yet. While long-term trends don’t alleviate individual injustices or mitigate the grief and anger we experience about what’s going on, context matters. It matters mostly because discussing these events without placing them in some historical framework creates the type of hysteria that leads to false perceptions and then counterproductive policy.

how did we get here? people shooting each other on the streets of America.. #tragic

— Greta Van Susteren (@greta) July 8, 2016



I realize there’s a lot of parsing to do with data, but a broader look at the numbers tells us we’re not only living in an age that’s seen a big drop in violence but perhaps the least violent age in American history. The year Greta Van Susteren first made her name on CNN offering legal expertise on the O.J. Simpson trial, violent crime rates had peaked in the United States. For the next 20 years, they would precipitously fall on every level —including murder, rape, and aggravated assault. People have always been shooting — punching, stabbing, kicking — each other. They just do a lot less of it today.

Homicide rates, for example, have been falling to the point where in 2014 — the last year of FBI data offered — it was at 4.5 per 100,000 people, which is the lowest rate recorded since 1963, when it was at 4.6 per 100,000 people. We know there was a slight uptick in violent crime in 2015, probably making it the second lowest year for homicides in the past 50.

Put it this way: In 1990, in New York City there were 2,245 homicides. In 2015, there were 355. In 1992, Los Angeles County had a record high of 2,589 homicides. There were 655 over the last 12 months. In 1992, Chicago saw 943 murders, or a rate of 34 murders per 100,000 citizens. Although it still owns a far higher murder rate than most major cities, in 2014 there were 432 murders and in 2015 488. Last year, Dallas saw a spike in murders, yet the 10.7 homicides per 100,000 residents was the city’s fourth-lowest total since police started keeping track in 1930. In Denver 95 people were murdered in 1992, 34 in 2014, and 50 (a nine-year high) in 2015.

Stats from almost every city tell the same tale.

After the Dallas shooting of five officers, President Obama, as he always does, talked about more gun control. “We must take a hard look at the ease with which wrongdoers can get their hands on deadly weapons and the frequency with which they use them,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch insisted. So it’s worth mentioning that this drop in violence has coincided with a spike in the number of guns Americans have purchased. We are told that the availability of guns (not the amount of people who buy them, but the guns themselves) is the problem because they are bought in places with relaxed laws and sold to criminals and terrorists in places with stricter gun control laws.

Despite this reality, according to a 2013 Pew poll, 56 percent of Americans believe gun crimes have risen compared to 20 years ago. This even though overall gun death rates have declined — and let’s include homicides and suicides (most gun deaths are suicide) — by 31 percent over that period.

We believe a lot of things that aren’t true. In a 2015 Rasmussen poll, 58 percent of Americans said they believed there was a “war on police.” The murder of five officers in Dallas last week was the worst attack on law enforcement since 9/11. It is in no way to diminish the impact of this event or the lives lost that day to say that the overall trend shows police are not in more danger today than they were 20 years ago. The violence aimed at police has generally followed all other trendlines of violence, which is to say it has decreased.

The recent deaths of a number of African Americans at cops’ hands is also highly troubling, but the debate about it is imbued with a number of societal issues that go beyond mere stats. It’s also far more complicated than conventional thinking might suggest. While that debate rages, it’s important to note that African Americans are not only safer today than they were 20 years ago (and certainly 50 years ago), they have benefited tremendously from lower crime rates. Over the last 20 years, crime among African-American youth has fallen by 47 percent.

Watching the news can make you feel like we’re on the cusp of falling into a dark time. Maybe we’re destined for a more violent age. Yet it seems the technological and economic advances we’ve made (despite inequality, most Americans live better lives) make it unlikely we’re going to return to 1994- or 1968-style violence any time soon. But who knows? It’s also understandable that emotionally we deal with the incidents that unfold in front of us. Still, it wouldn’t hurt the media to frame the news with a little less scaremongering and a little more context.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/11/despite-media-hysteria-violent-crime-is-at-record-lows/,2016-07-11
How Conservatives Turned Against Mass Incarceration,"Steven Teles is an associate professor of political scientist at Johns Hopkins University and the author of Prison Break: Why Conservatives Turned Against Mass Incarceration. Mary Katharine Ham, senior writer at the Federalist, interviewed Teles about transpartisanship, the story of Texas’s state criminal justice reform, and what the crime debate looks like in 2016.

In his book, Teles provides background on how the conservative party has changed their position on criminal justice reform, but also who influenced them in doing so. “The reason why Republicans start switching is that sense of disorder, at least where crime was concerned, went down. We had this absolutely gargantuan decrease in crime,” he said. “That really created an opening for Republicans who for their own reasons wanted to change the party’s position.”

Emotional energy and the heat from the media covering crime stories over the last year forces conservatives into their corner Teles said. “What I worry about, especially on the police side, is there’s a lot we can do to improve the quality of policing that also improves the treatment of African Americans and minorities,” he said. “But it’s hard to have that conversation when everyone is getting their tribal energy and emotion up.”

Hillary Managed Her Emails Like Criminals I’ve Known,"See if you can spot the difference between these two sentences: I didn’t do it. There’s no evidence I did it. Now Google this: Hillary no evidence.

Notice anything? Never in the history of world has a human being been so completely buried under a mountain of no evidence. Hillary Clinton can say there’s no evidence she sent classified emails until the evidence shows up, at which point there is no evidence she knew they were classified, until evidence of that shows up, at which point there is no evidence anyone got hold of it, until 400 people are willing to stake their lives that it was certainly compromised by sophisticated bad actors, at which point there is no evidence that it mattered.

This came to mind listening to FBI Director James Comey’s interesting phraseology, carefully formulated, no doubt: “We found no evidence” and “We did not find clear evidence” and “[Hillary’s lawyers] deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery” (emphasis mine).

A few years ago I was running a company and we caught a couple of people embezzling. A top tech guy with complete access to our computer system got in cahoots with the financial controller. An affair was involved. Federal prosecutors will tell you this kind of nasty collusion is rampant these days. They were systematically looting our cash flow, and, given their respective positions, able to cover their tracks. When they found out I was bringing in more financial oversight (the tech guy had tapped into my email) they knew the jig was up.

If You’re Going to Commit a Crime, Destroy the Evidence

Unknown to anyone, they began destroying evidence as fast as they could. They ordered a shredder (yes, at company expense) and had it shipped to the controller’s apartment, where they furiously disintegrated satchels full of documents they had spirited from the office: financial records, expense reports, receipts—everything incriminating. The tech guy, a long-term, highly trusted employee, wiped everything, including backups.

The new oversight people came in, saw what was happening, and blew the whistle. The “perps” were arrested, as they knew they would be, and thus began my painful education in the surprisingly fragility of “evidence.”

If you are going to commit a crime, destroy the evidence, even if it’s flagrantly obvious that you are doing so and why you’re doing it. No matter how glaringly guilty your behavior and demeanor, prosecutors need evidence to present in court to hold you accountable for it, and if they don’t have it, their hands are tied. (You know, like Comey’s “We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges.”)

All kinds of laws on the books make these secondary things criminal activity—destroying evidence, guilty demeanor—and you might be threatened with prosecution for it, but it’s feckless. It won’t happen, because there’s a catch: To prove you destroyed evidence, it has to be proved that it was, indeed, evidence, not just some random, innocuous paper. But it doesn’t become evidence until the crime itself is demonstrated, of which it is then evidence, but they can’t do that, because there’s no evidence. Get it?

Theoretically, someone could gather evidence that you were destroying evidence, and that you therefore give off all kinds of evidence you are guilty as all-get-out, but it’s an ever-receding goal line with diminishing rewards that most prosecutors aren’t going to sacrifice time and effort on. In fact, when you get really good at being a crook, you’ll realize there’s no reason to wait until the cops are at the door to start managing evidence availability—you do it as you go along. (How many private servers did Hillary have and sequentially destroy, again?)

How Criminals Get Away

That’s what the people stealing from me knew. One even had some prior expertise in these matters and was getting sage advice from some dark hacker group whose members prided themselves on their outlaw bona fides. Bottom line? As a direct benefit of having destroyed the evidence, they came within a hair’s breadth of getting away with it.

They didn’t deep-six all that history to pretend innocence or finger someone else, they did it because they knew it would work, that no matter how obviously guilty they were, the authorities can’t do diddley if they don’t have hard evidence.

I was absolutely astonished that people so clearly guilty of crime number one, and who so openly destroyed the evidence of that guilt—crime number two—would be greatly rewarded for crime number two by having made it difficult or impossible to prosecute them for crime number one, which, in turn, would make crime number two moot. Criminals seem to know this stuff, somehow.

Fortunately, we drew a prosecutor who was tough, determined, and had been around the block a few times, and she wasn’t having any of it. But it took four years, and when they went to jail, it wasn’t for the main crime, because they had destroyed the evidence of that. Prosecutors found enough evidence to get them convicted for ancillary things, sort of emanations from the crime. They left just enough traces, essentially things they forgot about, to nail them on mail fraud and tax evasion (you know, the Al Capone approach), and that induced them to provide a full confession.

That’s why Comey’s construct—“we found no evidence”—resonated. It’s also why there’s a big difference between “I didn’t do it” and “There’s no evidence I did it.” There could be any number of reasons for no evidence, only one of which involves the target not having done it; it could also be because someone got rid of the evidence. Or maybe the evidence is buried in such a mountain of irrelevancies that it can’t be teased out, or the dog chewed it up.

A Long Career in Disappearing Evidence

Of course, it’s entirely possible Hillary reeks of no evidence because she didn’t carry out the avalanche of criminal, quasi-criminal, or merely morally reprehensible acts she’s been accused of over the last several decades, from being thrown off the Nixon/Watergate panel for lying, to the financial improprieties (and improbabilities) of the Whitewater scandal, the overreach of authority in Travelgate, the grotesque savaging of the victims of Bill’s “Bimbo Eruptions,” and all the other sorry episodes.

Maybe all this doesn’t represent a preponderance of guilt so much as a preponderance of accusations, with the fault lying not so much in Hillary as in her stars (the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy and anyone who doesn’t share her worldview).

It is almost impossible to imagine anyone could look at the Clinton Foundation and fail to see it is probably the most bloated influence-peddling criminal enterprise in history.

But maybe not. It’s not like there’s no reason to believe the Clintons are familiar with how to create magical evidence that disappears when it could be problematic then reappears when the danger has passed, or that their minions are above stuffing their socks with top-secret documents in an almost comically brazen evidence-tampering caper.

How liberating might it be to learn over the years that the important thing isn’t cramping your style by trying to cultivate an aura of scrupulous innocence, it’s making sure along the way that whatever evidence might prove troublesome remains elusive. There’s no need to be Caesar’s Wife if you can be The Artful Dodger.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars for inane 20-minute speeches? She was selling something. There was no product, no enterprise, no goods. She was supposedly selling her words, but, unless the words come from a newly unearthed voice recording of Jesus Christ himself, no words on earth are worth the tens of millions of dollars Hillary Clinton, Inc. has raked in. No, she wasn’t selling a product, she was selling a service, and, as Ross Perot was fond of saying, you know it, I know it and the American people know it. There is just no evidence…

It is almost impossible to imagine that anyone could look at the Clinton Foundation in parallel with the arc of Hillary’s curriculum vitae and fail to see it is probably the most bloated influence-peddling criminal enterprise in history. But they will, so long as they have a “no evidence” hook to hang their hat on. There is “no evidence” associated with these things not because there is no evidence, but because those in her thrall wish it to be so, and, with the essential help of a complicit media, it becomes so when they declare it so.

This is the world we live in. Let’s just call it “Hillary World.”

Is Anti-Race-Baiting A Form Of Race-Baiting?,"Heather Mac Donald has spent a good portion of her career assuring people white cops aren’t racist. In 2010 she wrote a book entitled “Are Cops Racist?” Here’s the quick summary: No.

Mac Donald’s most recent book explores similar themes, and she’s written multiple articles in the same vein, including this one, penned last February but reprinted this past weekend by the Wall Street Journal. A fresh missive reiterating the same themes appeared in the Journal on Tuesday.

I agree with Mac Donald: Very few cops (of any race) are bigots. Here’s my concern, though. I’m not sure this is an answer to the questions many Americans are asking right now.

Mac Donald clearly wants this to be the question. Her article in the Journal begins with four quotes from the major Democratic presidential contenders, all related to criminal justice. Hillary Clinton is quoted as saying “too many encounters with law enforcement end tragically,” and “we have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.” Bernie Sanders is on record promising “no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will,” and “It is not acceptable to see unarmed people being shot by police officers.”

Now we get Mac Donald’s summary: “Apparently the Black Lives Matter movement has convinced Democrats and progressives that there is an epidemic of racist white police officers killing young black men.” Wait. Which of those quotes mentioned racist white police officers?

Bad Outcomes Don’t Necessarily Imply Evil Intent

Go back and read them again. Both candidates lament racism, and both decry a “broken system.” Neither one says anything about bigoted cops.

Perhaps you think this is hairsplitting, and that it’s perfectly obvious what Sanders and Clinton both meant. You should reconsider. The Democratic candidates are saying two distinct things. First, our criminal justice system has some problems that particularly (“systemically”) disadvantage blacks. Second, we’re seeing far too many tragic incidents in which police shoot or kill citizens.

It’s entirely possible for these assessments to be accurate for reasons that have little or nothing to do with police bigotry. Actually, there are many reasons these things could be true, which would in no way reflect personal prejudice among law enforcement.

Police officers enforce laws other people make. They deliver offenders to courts they don’t control to receive punishments others decide. They’re regularly subject to bureaucratic pressures to make this or that an enforcement priority, and their resources are perpetually limited. In short, there are innumerable reasons the system could be “broken” that would have nothing to do with racist cops.

Undoubtedly, some radical members or associates of Black Lives Matter do levy egregiously unfair charges against (especially) white cops. Last week that resentment spilled over into horrific bloodshed, which is why the WSJ decided it was an appropriate time to reprint Mac Donald’s piece.

Was that a healthy response, though? It might be if there were a chance cop-hating black radicals would read Mac Donald’s piece and be convinced. Realistically though, I don’t think the Wall Street Journal has much influence in that crowd. Its readers are conservatives, who should at this moment be looking for common ground and viable solutions, not radioactive buttons to push. Unless and until particular Democrats personally decry an “epidemic” of racist white cops, we shouldn’t saddle them with such inflammatory views. We also shouldn’t interpret their words in ways that are maximally injurious to the honor of white cops.

Are Cops Trigger-Happy, Or Are Black People Violent?

Lethal police shootings are controversial for a reason. It’s hard to blame “the system” when an officer shoots a suspect; presumably the blame lies with the officer, or the suspect (or possibly some combination of the two). But if we are indeed witnessing “an epidemic” of lethal police shootings, that surely says something about the police as a group, or about the people being policed.

Obviously, Mac Donald’s money is on the latter. Her argument, though, is decidedly odd. Drawing on the Washington Post’s meticulously kept data on police shootings in 2015 (The Guardian has engaged in a similar project), she points out that “fatal police shootings make up a much larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths than black homicide deaths.”

Come again? It’s strange how Mac Donald skips right past the obvious questions and focuses on a very specific detail of the Post’s broad-ranging project. Shouldn’t we maybe start by considering whether we have a worrisomely high number of lethal police shootings in general, and whether (and by what ratios) young black males are disproportionately victims?

There is also some recent evidence blacks are disproportionately likely to be stopped and harassed by police but not disproportionately likely to be shot in a police encounter. (Interestingly, Mac Donald does reference this study in Tuesday’s article, but only the portion relating to shootings. She doesn’t mention the disproportionate use of non-deadly force.)

Given all these interesting details, it’s odd how quickly she races to a rather specific question: If a particular person is the victim of a homicide, how likely is it that a police officer pulled the trigger? We can anticipate the answer. Given the fact of having been killed by another person, whites and Hispanics are more likely to have been shot by the police.

The stress Mac Donald places on this one weird statistic should itself make us wary. It’s clear she doesn’t want to discuss the alarmingly high number of police shootings. She wants to talk about the violence of dysfunctional black subcultures. After discussing her ratio-of-homicide-victims stat for two whole paragraphs, she bolsters her point by observing blacks also represent a disproportionate number of police assailants, and are disproportionately charged with robbery, murder, and assault. At last, she puts a bow on her “blacks are violent” argument by citing evidence black officers are more trigger-happy than their white counterparts.

We get the point. Don’t blame the white guys. They’re just trying to do their jobs.

Asking the Right Questions

This would be a solid argument if our main interest were in holding a moral magnifying glass to the hearts of white police officers. Mac Donald can build a strong case that police departments are not a breeding ground for white bigots. In fairness, that point holds some legitimate interest in light of the wild allegations flying through the virtual world and threatening the peace of several American cities.

Do black citizens have non-fanciful reasons to mistrust or resent law enforcement?

Having said that, it might still be worthwhile to broaden our range of questions. I humbly suggest most people are less interested in the racial attitudes of cops than in questions like the following:

Are our laws, and the means by which we enforce them, burdensome to honest and (at least mostly) law-abiding black citizens, especially those who live in poorer neighborhoods?

Are law-abiding black citizens more likely to be harassed, detained, or shot by police than law-abiding non-black citizens? Are petty (black) lawbreakers more likely to provoke a disproportionately forceful response from law enforcement?

More generally, do black citizens have non-fanciful reasons to mistrust or resent law enforcement?

Mac Donald’s statistics give us reason to think white cops probably aren’t, in general, racist. But that could easily be compatible with a world in which law-abiding black citizens (especially in high-crime neighborhoods) very reasonably view the police as a threat.

Some Helpful Hypotheticals

There is actually an upside to civic unrest over police shootings: it’s precipitated a push for better data and increased study of policing patterns. Hopefully, this will enable us to generate new strategies for training and deploying police effectively. In the meanwhile, some hypotheticals might help to illustrate why Mac Donald’s data, although not wholly irrelevant, really doesn’t answer the crucial questions.

You’re far more likely to be the victim of such an error if you live in a high-crime, low-trust neighborhood with a lax attitude towards due process.

Let’s suppose that certain predominantly black neighborhoods, for a range of historical reasons, have high crime rates and a pervasive mistrust of law enforcement. Solving major crimes in such neighborhoods is challenging. There are lots of murders, but a dearth of willing witnesses or informants. Still, the residents aren’t the type whose personal problems get reported on CNN, so standards for due process start to slip. That in turn poses dangers to the law-abiding, undermining further the relationship between local residents and police.

In such a scenario, proportionate numbers (of police shootings to crime stats) wouldn’t necessarily tell the whole story. Even honest, non-bigoted police are going to get the wrong man occasionally. You’re far more likely to be the victim of such an error if you live in a high-crime, low-trust neighborhood with a lax attitude towards due process. Roland Fryer’s much-celebrated recent study, although admirable in the scope of its data, wouldn’t necessarily reflect those sorts of problems.

We could add another wrinkle by supposing some cities might (historically or in the present day) have viewed the safety of impoverished, predominantly black neighborhoods as a relatively low priority. A rash of break-ins in the mansion district provokes panic, a press conference, and the threat of new management if the police don’t address the problem. By contrast, stacks of unclosed homicides from poor black neighborhoods just don’t make the mayor’s agenda.

In such a world, we might see homicides raging largely unchecked in certain neighborhoods, driving up black homicide rates. The associations might then lead blacks in gentrified neighborhoods to be viewed (somewhat reasonably) with greater suspicion. Meanwhile, the overall black homicide rate could still seem to justify the disparities, while in reality, honest black citizens might be right to suppose they’re at greater risk. More importantly, black citizens in such a world would have some reason to think society at large was lamentably indifferent to their well-being.

We should note that hypotheticals like the above could all be broadly true even if America had not a single racist cop.

Pointing Fingers Versus Seeking Solutions

The most discouraging thing about Mac Donald’s coverage of this topic is the dearth of suggested solutions. Both Journal articles imply public outrage should be directed towards black crime and not police misconduct. This is also a curious argument. Of course black homicide is a terrible thing. Still, social movements normally aim their messages at those who are interested in public opinion. That doesn’t include murderers. If widespread social disapproval were sufficient to deter violent crime, it’s fair to say our homicide rate would be close to zero.

We shouldn’t try to bury the realities of social breakdown, but we also shouldn’t use them as a de facto excuse to do nothing.

We shouldn’t try to bury the realities of social breakdown, but we also shouldn’t use them as a de facto excuse to do nothing. It’s important to support good cops, but one way to do that is by seeking real solutions. Both cops and residents suffer when relations between neighborhood residents and law enforcement break down.

What sorts of measures might help to alleviate the problem? Better transparency? Improved training procedures and attention to mental health? Changes in the way we allocate our resources? As a longtime expert in policing, Mac Donald could be addressing these questions instead of focusing relentlessly on answering a question that relatively few are asking.

Most cops aren’t racist. It doesn’t follow, however, that black citizens have no real grievances.

How To Spot A Media Hoax,"These days it’s no easy life for perpetrators of fake hate crimes and hoaxes generally: every time somebody comes up with a really good fake scandal, the whole thing seems to unravel within a short while. Time was, a man could go through all the trouble to arrange a hoax and could expect to reap the rewards of his hard work. Not anymore.

What’s changed? Part of it is technological: there are more security cameras, more digital paper trails, more text message records. These present opportunities for hoaxes to be exposed: there are simply more chances for people to give something away, either idiosyncratically (by, say, sending an incriminating e-mail or text message) or extraneously (by being caught on a closed-circuit camera, for instance).

Perhaps more importantly, with the multiple sensational hoaxes taking place over the past decade or so (Breitbart has catalogued more than 100 of them), much of the public—at least among those of us who work in media—has become vigilant in spotting such chicanery and exposing it. Just the same, plenty of hoaxes still get widespread attention before they’re exposed; sometimes they cause lots of damage before they’re revealed as fake.

The good news is you can train yourself to be a hoax-spotter as well. You never know: you might be instrumental in exposing the next big fake hate crime or hoax. Here are three things to look for in determining whether an accusation is probably real or possibly fake.

1. The Allegations Are Too Good to Be True

What do I mean by this? Simply that you should be skeptical of claims that overly gratify certain biases or cultural narratives. The more an accusation of wrongdoing or criminal activity sounds like a picture-perfect capitalized example of Hate Crime or Wicked Evil Behavior, the more you should mistrust the claims.

Take, for example, the now-debunked Rolling Stone article “A Rape on Campus,” which detailed an alleged hours-long gang rape of one young woman by a bunch of fraternity boys. The whole story turned out to be a fabrication and a global humiliation for Rolling Stone. But in the beginning, everyone believed it. Why?

As Richard Bradley pointed out (Bradley was one of the first to publicly question the story), the tale gratified many people’s pre-existing biases: biases regarding “rape culture,” fraternities, men (especially Southern men), and feckless, hostile college bureaucracies. You could have hardly asked for a story that played into more prejudices. Coincidentally, the story turned out to be an enormous lie.

Those of us who raised suspicions were lambasted as “truthers” and rebuked as rape apologists and misogynists. Everybody could have saved themselves a lot of humiliation and anger during those crazy weeks if they had simply exercised a bit of healthy skepticism.

More recently, in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre, a fair number of people claimed to have either had sex with the shooter or else interacted with him on gay hookup apps. There’s that too-good-to-be-true narrative again: an openly anti-gay Islamic man is secretly an active homosexual. It gratifies many peoples’ prejudices: against religion, against anti-gay sentiment, against the way some cultures repress and lambast homosexuality and homosexual desires.

The problem: the allegations are totally unsubstantiated. The FBI has turned up zero evidence. Nobody can find any record of the shooter on any gay dating apps. Somebody produced what appeared to be a profile on one of the apps, but it turned out to be fake. The administrator of one of the apps openly stated he believed it was a hoax. One witness, when pressed to provide more evidence, “became combative,” according to the New York Times: “I don’t need to prove anything to anyone,” he said. “If I said it, it’s true.” Does that sound like a credible witness?

Be skeptical. It doesn’t mean you have to callously or conclusively doubt the people who are making these claims—you should not assume a priori that every victim or witness is a liar. You should, however, be appropriately incredulous when it comes to these things. Fantastical claims should trigger a red flag immediately.

2. The Evidence Doesn’t Add Up

You’re (probably) not a detective or even a journalist, and thus it’s not your job to gather forensic evidence at a crime scene or interview witnesses of murders or assaults. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still make a reasonable judgment regarding available evidence.

Take, for example, the University of Virginia rape hoax mentioned above. The victim claimed to have been raped for three hours on top of broken glass on a fraternity bedroom floor. But she also claimed she refused to go to the hospital for medical treatment. If you’ve been to any frat house across the country, you’ll know they usually aren’t the cleanest or most sanitary places on the planet (I’ve been to several at UVA, and most were uniformly gross). If the rape victim had declined to seek medical treatment after such an episode, the cuts on her back could easily have become infected and she probably would have fallen gravely ill and required hospitalization. That was just one small example of how her story did not add up.

More recently, gay YouTube personality Calum McSwiggan claimed that three homophobic men assaulted him outside of a gay bar in Los Angeles. By his own admission the men punched him hard enough on his mouth to break three of his teeth. The problem? Police later arrested McSwiggan for vandalizing a car, and his mug shot shows absolutely no visible damage to his mouth. Punching someone in the mouth hard enough to snap three teeth in half would leave a lot of bruising and swelling, if not graphically split lips.

More damningly, the Advocate interviewed McSwiggan a few days later, and McSwiggan showed off the bruises, cuts, and other injuries he claims he sustained from the incident—except for his allegedly broken teeth. It’s possible McSwiggan is telling the truth about the assault. But the available evidence strongly implies otherwise. It’s more likely the assault was mostly or entirely fabricated and will be revealed as such in the coming weeks.

So it is with many hoaxes: a quick review of the evidence will often turn up inconsistencies and incoherencies that suggest something isn’t right. Sometimes there are good explanations for these things. Sometimes the explanation is that it’s a hoax.

3. There Is A Big, Public Payoff for the Victim

Our culture has come to prize victimhood: it is often a lucrative trade. Students who claim to feel “unsafe” on college campuses are pampered and feted; liberal college mobs in recent years have even toppled university administrations and forced high-level officials to resign. Being a victim carries a great deal of prestige among large parts of twenty-first-century America.

It is unsurprising many people perpetrate hate hoaxes: they do it for the low kind of fame and fortune that often comes with being a victim.

With this in mind, it is unsurprising many people perpetrate hate hoaxes: they do it for the low kind of fame and fortune that often comes with being a victim. A few years ago a gay waitress fabricated an anti-gay incident for that very reason. A gay pastor in Austin, Texas did the same thing. A black activist at Kean University tweeted fake racist threats at her fellow black students to gin up controversy and build support for her activism.

Sometimes the payoff is less obvious but still very real: earlier this year three black women claimed they were assaulted on a public bus by white men who also hurled racial slurs at them. It turned out to be false: the young women had started a fight on the bus and wanted to deflect attention away from their own bad behavior. In the meantime the women received tons of support and the campus turned into a hotbed of racial activism. Payoff!

Whenever you read of a terrible or sensational claim of violence or bigotry, it is always worthwhile to ask: what is the potential payoff for the people making these claims? This doesn’t mean you should assume every victim of every crime is trying to scam you. But for the kinds of headline-grabbing events that often drive our news cycles, this kind of curious skepticism is always advisable.

Whenever you read of a terrible or sensational claim of violence or bigotry, it is always worthwhile to ask: what is the potential payoff for the people making these claims?

If you follow these three rules, there is a better-than-average chance you’ll spot hoaxes instead of being sucked in by them. You may even do better than our credulous media and pundit class, both of which are often very eager to report on these hoaxes without doing even basic investigatory work. You will save yourself a lot of embarrassment on social media if you’re not taken in, and you won’t contribute to any mass hysteria or public pitchfork mobs in the meantime.

There is, of course, a danger in being too skeptical: in doubting 100 percent any kind of wild or fantastical claim a victim or witness makes. You shouldn’t close your mind to the possibility that these claims are true. All of the hoaxes listed here were 100 percent possible. The problem was, they weren’t very plausible—and in the end they ended up being total fakes, promoted and spread by people who were too eager to question much.

Do not be scared to be skeptical. It may make you unpopular with a certain class of people who eagerly want to believe everything that gratifies their biases. You might get yelled at or scolded if you are too prudent or cautious in getting on board with a public outrage. But you’ll be doing the right thing: making an informed judgment based on the facts instead of blind, biased rage. That’s always worthwhile.

Texas Governor: Attacking Police Should Be A ‘Hate Crime’,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to make it a hate crime to attack police.

On Monday, Abbott called on the Texas legislature to pass a law he called the “Police Protection Act,” which would make any crime committed against a police officer a hate crime. That distinction would increase the penalties imposed against anyone convicted of attacking police.

“Under current law, assault with bodily injury is generally punishable as a Class A misdemeanor, while assault on a public servant, including a law enforcement officer, is a 3rd degree felony,” a press release from Abbott’s office stated. “Under Governor Abbott’s proposal, in cases where the assault is on a law enforcement officer, the penalty would increase to a 2nd degree felony.”

The proposal comes on the heels of the anti-police massacre in Dallas where five officers were gunned down and killed by a single gunman, making it the deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11. On Sunday, three police officers in Baton Rouge were gunned down by a man who was intending to kill law enforcement officials.

“At a time when law enforcement officers increasingly come under assault simply because of the job they hold, Texas must send a resolute message that the State will stand by the men and women who serve and protect our communities,” Abbott said in a statement.

Lawmakers will likely vote on the proposal during the next legislative session. You can read more about the proposed legislation here.

Black Lives Matter Doesn’t Believe Its Own Slogan,"Like so many, I’ve watched with a heavy heart the malicious violence that is sprouting like poison ivy across the country, germinated by liberal applications of incendiary rhetoric and misplaced indulgence. In the city in which I was raised, Baton Rouge, three police officers were assassinated and three officers were hospitalized with gunshot wounds. One of the dead, a black officer with 10 years on the force, had recently posted on Facebook about the angst and mounting pressure he felt from the very community he ultimately gave his life defending. Does his black life matter? Where are the protestors on his behalf?

Yet the list of horribles continues. On the same day officers were killed in Baton Rouge, officers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were dispatched on a domestic disturbance call where a 20 year-old with two felonies on his record opened fire on the police car, wounding an officer inside the vehicle. Eight officers have been killed nationwide in 11 days. Here in Memphis a week ago, protestors took to the streets with their signs and chants and didn’t stop until they had shut down Interstate 40 in downtown Memphis.

For more than five hours, truckers, travelers, parents, and children sat, helplessly stranded on the I-40 bridge over the Mississippi River. (And you think the kiddos can be a challenge when the car is moving!) In one case, paramedics struggled to extract a sick child from the stranded traffic and transport the child to the hospital. How many others who needed medical attention remained stranded is unknown to us and to the resolutely impervious crowd that held commuters hostage.

Naturally, I was interested to see what my colleagues at The Federalist would have to say about events, and went right away to David Marcus’ very moving essay, “This Week We Are All Black Lives Matter.” While the overall appeal to greater understanding and empathy was laudable, somewhere along the way David was carried aloft on the headwind of his good intentions, and deposited somewhere between sentimentality and mawkishness.

The Disproportionality Runs the Other Way

Highlighting the fatal confrontations of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile with the authorities, David writes, “Every white American paying attention already knew that police kill black men at alarming rates.” That’s a pretty sweeping statement on behalf of a lot of people David has never met, and it needs some further scrutiny.

In 2015, according to information collected by the Washington Post, 26 percent of the people killed by police officers were black. Now, if that is alarming, what then are we to make of the fact that a full 50 percent of people who died at the hands of police officers were white? Should the fact that whites were killed by the police at nearly double the rate of blacks take us from alarm to outright panic? Should we shout that white lives matter and wreak havoc, or should we take a deep breath and dig a little deeper into the facts?

Heather Mac Donald, author of “The War On Cops,” has done a stunning and thorough amount of research which has yielded, among other things, the fact that blacks make up just 15 percent of the population in the nation’s 75 largest counties (2009), yet comprise 45 percent of all assault defendants, 62 percent of all robbery defendants, and 57 percent of all murder defendants. In New York City alone, where blacks comprise 23 percent of the population, they account for 75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime.

The wonder therefore, isn’t that a group so highly represented in violent crime comprises 26 percent of deaths that occur in altercations with authority, but rather that the rate isn’t higher still. Whites, who account for 33 percent of New York City’s population, commit less than 2 percent of all shootings, 4 percent of robberies and 5 percent of all violent crime while having the highest fatality rate in confrontations with police. Happily, they haven’t resorted to blocking interstate highways and targeting the police and show no interest in doing so.

It’s Not Necessarily Racism to Pursue Black Suspects

“As black Americans shout, yell, and cry that their lives matter, the eerie silence of white Americans carefully balancing causes and solutions whispers back, ‘No, they don’t,’” David Marcus writes. To divide a group of people by race and assume that they think monolithically is not only erroneous on its face, it’s the sort of presumptuous tribal division we usually associate with the hard left. To further presume to reach into the minds of these people en masse and hear them whisper that black lives don’t matter is insulting.

“The hand that holds the gun is the only system,” David continues. “In those long, deadly moments choices are made, threats assessed, and actions taken. We must never accept the color of a person’s skin influencing the police officer facing these situations.” Well, given the facts presented above, which I assume he must have been unaware of, the burden of proving that skin color is influencing the police falls to David. But he will need to come to terms with the following as well, which Mac Donald presented recently at Hillsdale College:

These disparities mean that every time the police in New York are called out on a gun run — meaning that someone has just been shot — they are being summoned to minority neighborhoods looking for minority suspects. Officers hope against hope that they will receive descriptions of white shooting suspects, but it almost never happens. This incidence of crime means that innocent black men have a much higher chance of being stopped by the police because they match the description of the suspect [emphasis mine]. This is not something the police choose. It is a reality forced on them by the facts of crime.

Add to this the fact that the number of cops who’ve been killed in shootings has more than doubled in only the first three months of 2016, and the fact that a police officer’s chances of being killed by a black person is 18.5 times higher than the odds an unarmed black will be killed by a police officer, and the risks associated with an officer responding to violent crimes in the places where they usually occur come into sharper focus. To lump these and other relevant factors under the blunt title of someone’s skin color “influencing the police officer” betrays a rather incurious simplicity regarding a complex topic.

A protestor who admitted he was taunting Dallas police later told how some officers rushed him and pushed him away from the gunfire when the shooting started. He told of seeing one of those officers fall to the ground, shot while saving the protestor’s life. Decisions that save lives, like those that take them, are not made in “long, deadly moments,” as David dramatically contends, but rather in the heat of the moment and in a fraction of a second.

Police Aren’t the Major Problem for Black People

To the extent that the deaths of blacks has become an issue of race, it has been made so by race hustlers from Barack Obama on down to the usual suspects who rather conveniently fail to address the fact that blacks nationwide commit homicide at eight times the combined rate of whites and Hispanics, and that black males aged 14-17 commit homicide at ten times the combined rate of white and Hispanic male teens.

The question then becomes: Black lives matter to whom, exactly? Because the numbers show it isn’t police officers who are hunting down innocent African Americans. Rather, the awful fact is that the last face a black homicide victim is likely to see is the black face of his killer. Closing the nation’s highways, looting business in the black community, and disrupting the lives of law-abiding citizens will not change that reality even a little bit.

When Memphis’ interim police director met with Black Lives Matter protestors on the I-40 bridge Sunday evening, they all agreed to a cease-fire in the city’s ongoing homicides, which have reached more than 120 people in 2016. No more killings, they said, for the next 30 days. Less than 24 hours later, predictably, another homicide took place.

So we are entitled to ask: Do black lives matter to the thugs who prey on the innocent in their community, who steal from them and assault them? Do black lives matter to a culture that demeans and dehumanizes women in its music and its actions? Exactly how precious are black lives in Memphis, where I live, where young black males regularly swerve on their motorcycles and in their cars across busy interstate highways at speeds in excess of 100 mph, wantonly endangering and sometimes taking the lives of motorists of all races?

Stop Blaming Poverty

In his 1984 book, “Civil Rights, Rhetoric or Reality?” Dr. Thomas Sowell, himself a product of Harlem, wrote:

Few people today are aware that the ghettos in many cities were far safer places two generations ago than they are today. Incredulity often greets stories by older blacks as to their habit of sleeping out on fire escapes or on rooftops or in public parks on hot summer nights. …In the 1930s whites went regularly to Harlem at night, stayed until the wee hours of the morning, and then stood on the streets to hail cabs to take them home. Today, not only would very few whites dare to do this, very few cabs would dare to be cruising ghetto streets in the wee hours of the morning.

So what happened? Dr. Sowell continued:

…If crime is a product of poverty and discrimination as they say endlessly, why was there so much less of it when poverty and discrimination were much worse than today? If massive programs are the only hope to reduce violence in the ghetto, why was there so much less violence long before anyone ever thought of these programs? Perhaps more to the point, have the philosophies and policies so much supported by black leaders contributed to the decline of the community and personal standards, and in family responsibility, so painfully visible today? For many, it may be easier to ignore past achievements than to face their implications for current issues.

Hillary Clinton says she wants to have a conversation about race. Fine. Let’s start with Sowell’s observations and explore whether such programs as Mrs. Clinton and President Obama have long advanced have helped or hurt the black community. Let’s explore whether a system that has encouraged generational dependence on government have yielded the results that were promised when its central programs were enacted more than 50 years ago.

By all means, let’s explore the liberal commitment to the lives of black children, for whom the most dangerous place in the world is in their mother’s womb. As Alveda King, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s niece, noted in 2014:

Right now in America almost half of our babies are being killed in the womb, and in certain parts of America more of our babies are being aborted than being born. While we were marching in the sixties, a place was being prepared for us at Planned Parenthood. We were trying to get off the back of the bus, and they were going to have a space for us in the front of the abortion mill.

Where are the protestors lamenting the hundreds of thousands of black lives claimed by the abortionist each year? Where are those who would confront Mrs. Clinton about her admiration for eugenicist Margaret Sanger, who referred to blacks as “human weeds?”

Yes, there is much to talk about, but we do not advance the conversation by ceding ground to the progressive mythology of racist cops or the progressive habit of dividing people by race for the purposes of assigning collective guilt or deification. Rebuking an entire race for imputed racism is a horribly misguided and repugnant exercise, whether it comes from the Left or the well-intentioned among us.

We are Americans, and we are individuals first and foremost, and we do not advance our country, our communities, or our neighborhoods by suspending the standards of civil society and civilized conduct, or by excusing lawlessness and anarchy—period.

Black Lives Matter Leader: ‘Defund Police’,"A year ago, two police officers in New York were executed while they sat in their patrol car. A week ago, five cops were killed in Dallas. Now three more officers have been murdered in Baton Rouge by a man inspired to kill because he believed the news about police unfairly targeting black men.

If you are to believe to President Obama, who issued a statement right after the shooting, these events should not be linked to anyone or any movement: “These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no one. They right no wrongs. They advance no causes.”

One needs wonder if President Obama’s eagerness to explicitly reject the connection between any movement (including Black Lives Matter) and the string of murdered police officers is a result of the sort of criticism recently lodged against him by writers like Myron Magnet at City Journal. Magnet, a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, recently penned an opinion piece entitled “America’s Worst President? I nominate Obama, the Anti-Lincoln.”

Magnet’s main point is that Obama has stoked the flames of resentment against police officers throughout his presidency by repeatedly—either explicitly or implicitly—suggesting white police officers’ shootings of non-white people are acts of racism. Meanwhile, Obama largely ignored the scourge of black-on-black crime, delivering only a single speech on the topic.

What’s Wrong With Leaving Police High and Dry

Maybe Obama should have listened to his former chief of staff turned Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel, who late last year blamed the uptick in violent crime in Chicago on police officers “going fetal” and second-guessing their actions because of the national scrutiny on the way they do their job.

Ironically, it appears Obama’s silence on black-on-black crime coupled with intense scrutiny on police officers—either using the bully pulpit of his office or using the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division—has made our country decidedly less safe for the very people of color he professes to want to help. Like so many campaigns of the progressive left (such as welfare, overtime mandates, and minimum wage increases) the Black Lives Matter movement makes life worse for the people it is designed to benefit.

Still, despite the empirical evidence that BLM is adversely affecting the very communities it is designed to help, many people still think there is merit to the protest movement. After all, there are pretty obvious cases of overzealous white police officers shooting and killing black people in an unjustified manner. In some of these cases, it also appears there is racism involved. Shouldn’t there be a protest movement for these cases? Take the case of the white police officer in South Carolina who was filmed shooting a black suspect in the back as he fled.

As the son of a retired police officer who was shot in the line of duty—while trying to apprehend a suspect who had already killed another police officer—let me be the first to say I agree with those who think civic engagement in communities should hold police officers accountable for their work. We should do this in the same way we might hold any of our public officials accountable for what they do for us.

Defunding a Crucial Part of Government Isn’t Accountability

This, though, brings us to the crux of why BLM is rotten at its core: It is not like any other movement to keep our public servants accountable. The goal of the BLM movement is to systematically undermine our nation’s law enforcement officers and make their job both less safe and less effective. Just listen to a recent interview of three founders of the movement on NPR.

In typical NPR fashion, Ari Shapiro fawns over the BLM founders, asking them, “Given all of the momentum that your movement has right now, given all the attention being paid to Black Lives Matter, on this the third anniversary, what is one tangible thing that you would like to see this inertia lead to?”

The immediate answer from BLM founder Patrisse Cullors: “Defunding police departments.” How can BLM say the movement is pro-police if its stated goal is to eliminate the very funding that makes it possible for police to safely fight crime in our streets?

It is a common refrain of the Left that government programs are ineffective because stingy fiscal conservatives don’t put enough resources into them: just ask any Democrat why education, social service programs, and government health care don’t achieve the promised results. The answer is always that we just haven’t funded them adequately. Why should police departments be any different?

After the sort of police shooting we just witnessed in Baton Rouge, activists will no doubt flood social media and cable news with a defense of BLM like the one recently made by “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah: “If you’re pro-Black Lives Matter, you’re assumed to be anti-police,” he says in the sort of haughty didactic tone that has made “The Daily Show” so popular amongst leftists. “And if you’re pro-police, then you surely hate black people. It seems that it’s either pro-cop and anti-black or pro-black and anti-cop, when in reality you can be pro-cop and pro-black.”

No, Mr. Noah, you can’t be both pro-cop and pro-black if you’re part of the BLM movement. BLM is explicitly anti-cop and, if you think anything else, you’re just not listening to them.

"Targeting Police Isn’t A Hate Crime, It’s Terrorism","In the wake of recent deadly shootings, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has asked his state legislature to consider making violence targeted at police a hate crime. While increasing penalties against those who kill or injure cops can help protect the men and women who protect us, new hate crime laws are a poor way to achieve that goal. Specifically targeting law enforcement is not a hate crime; it is an act of terrorism.

Conservatives might well enjoy the rhetorical irony of using a hate crime label to describe and punish actions against the police. After all, the legal notion of hate crimes, which became popular in the late twentieth century, has generally been a tool of the civil rights movement. Just as many opponents of Black Lives Matter have appropriated that term and turned it into Blue Lives Matter, Abbott’s legislation seems to put the hate crime shoe on the other foot.

This may be part of growing trend among conservatives to reject programs that carve out special benefits or protections for Americans based on perceived oppression of a race or group identity. But in this case, adopting the use of “hate crime” is misguided—not because attacks on police cannot be motivated by hatred—they certainly can be—but because the very idea of a hate crime is a dubious proposition to begin with.

Criminalizing Hate Criminalizes Thought

Hate crime legislation became popular in the late 1970s as a way to enhance punishment for violent crimes committed with bias against a protected group. Such laws effectively state that punching people because they are gay or black, for example, should be more greatly punished than punching someone because you don’t like them individually. In most cases the hate crime is added to the underlying crime in prosecution.

The problem with the concept of hate crimes is that it very specifically allows the state to criminalize thought. It is not illegal to harbor hatred or animosity towards groups of people. It is irrational and stupid, but not illegal. Nor should it be. Asking judges and juries to punish people on the basis of their bigotry quite literally turns the government into the thought police.

One could argue that intent, a valid consideration in prosecuting crimes, also equals thought policing. But the traditional use of intent differs from the use of hate crime statutes in significant ways. Typically, intent is used to determine the extent to which an individual knowingly committed a crime and understood the gravity of its consequences. This is an old idea in law. In 1789, in his “An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,” Jeremy Bentham addressed the issue:

Let us observe the connexion there is between intentionality and consciousness. When the act itself is intentional, and with respect to the existence of all the circumstances advised, as also with respect to the materiality of those circumstances, in relation to a given consequence, and there is no mis-supposal with regard to any preventive circumstance, that consequence must also be intentional: in other words; advisedness, with respect to the circumstances, if clear from the mis-supposal of any preventive circumstance, extends the intentionality from the act to the consequences. Those consequences may be either directly intentional, or only obliquely so: but at any rate they cannot but be intentional.

Bentham argues intention must be split in two. First, was the act intentional? Second, was the consequence of the act intentional? Motive plays a role in determining whether a criminal act was intentional, but not regarding the intent itself. Whether a criminal act of violence is committed out of jealousy, anger, fear, or hatred, the bottom line is still the physical intent. The proper role of government in most cases is to punish the act, not the motivation.

Once we go down the path of punishing motivation itself, we invite a legislative parade of horribles. In New York City it is now illegal to maliciously refer to a transsexual individual by a pronoun he or she does not prefer. This speech is not criminal because of the act of itself, it is criminal because the speaker is denying the moral orthodoxy of transexuality.

We should naturally expect the concept of a hate crime will lead to establishing hate speech as a criminal act. In most cases, one’s speech is used to prove the group bias that constitutes a hate crime. Someone who harbors animosity towards blacks and punches a black person is less likely to be charged with a hate crime than someone who uses a slur before throwing the punch. It is even possible that a perpetrator who uses a slur may not harbor bias, but may simply be attempting to insult his victim.

For all of these reasons is it ill-advised for Abbott and the Texas legislature to make crimes against police hate crimes. As satisfying as it may be to use progressive dogma in the furtherance of protecting police, it reinforces limitations on thought and speech that are very un-conservative.

Instead, Label Anti-Police Violence Terrorism

If we want to increase penalties on those who specifically target police in acts of violence—and we should—there is a better way to do it. Instead of considering such acts hate crimes, we should consider them acts of terrorism. By doing so we can punish the act, not the motivation, and potentially give law enforcement enhanced methods of preventing such acts.

Setting out to kill random police officers, as we recently saw in Dallas, Baton Rouge, and New York City, is an act of political violence. It is an attack on the rule of law and the systems of government. It is an attempt to undermine public confidence in police and to promote general fear. Importantly, undermining state authority is not merely the killer’s motivation, but also inherent to his act.

Some criminal acts specifically targeted at groups based on race, religion, or sexual orientation may also contain terroristic elements that can be used to enhance penalties. It would be best for us to replace the idea of hatred or bigotry with that of terrorism in policing and prosecuting such actions.

But for now, Abbot and the Texas legislature should resist the urge to use liberal thought policing to protect our cops. Not only is unlikely to be effective, it also codifies a legal argument that conservatives should reject. Even in our very justified anger and horror at police killings, we must proceed in measured ways, just as police should and do proceed in measured ways when they protect us.

5 Things President Obama Needs To Say About Black Crime,"President Obama held a nationally televised town hall last week to address heightened tensions and divisions in our society due to recent shootings of black criminals by police, and the recent shootings of police officers in Dallas. Just days after the event, three police officers in Baton Rouge were assassinated, further highlighting the high stakes for how the president handles this issue.

I was invited to attend last week’s town hall and ask the president a question, but ultimately could not make it. But I did watch it at home, and would like to highlight some key points President Obama did not to make, which could have begun the process of healing and reconciliation.

Indeed, Sunday’s execution of three police officers in Baton Rouge shows what can happen when the president creates an atmosphere of racial victimization and blames police. So it is critical that Obama develops a new message that takes us in the right direction before things get worse and there’s another incident.

With that in mind, here are the statements President Obama should have included in his remarks last week.

1. ‘We Must, Must, Must Reduce the Black Crime Rate’

The black crime rate is significantly higher than that of other races. Yes, some would claim this is due to institutionalized racism or a lack of job opportunities. However, black crime was much lower in past eras when discrimination against black people was much higher, and the economic position of black people was much worse, than today. So that can be no excuse.

President Obama should have talked about how the overall crime rate for black people is three times higher than the national average. He should have noted how blacks commit homicide at a rate eight times higher than whites do, according to Department of Justice data. Even though blacks and Hispanics combined make up only 30 percent of the population, they make up more than 80 percent of all gang members in the United States. He should also have talked how even though black folks are only 13 percent of the population, we commit about 62 percent of all robberies and 56 percent of all carjackings. Obama should have then asked: “Is this really what Dr. King died for?”

2. ‘We Must Put the Black Family Back Together’

Even though the studies clearly show that children born into single-parent homes have worse outcomes in nearly every area, sadly, today about 72 percent of black kids are born to unwed mothers. This has created a whole new generation of troubled young men who have an increased likelihood of entering a life of crime and getting themselves into altercations with the police that create these divisive incidents we see on the news.

So putting the family back together so black children are born into stable, two-parent homes will go a long way to fixing many of the problems black people face today, including problems with the police. President Obama should have forcefully illuminated the broken state of black families, then outlined his ideas to put it back together. There are many ways to approach this, but one good place to start is to scale back well-intentioned but ineffective entitlement programs that encourage and enable single-motherhood, many of which the president himself unfortunately supports.

If he couldn’t have stomached this tough but true response, Obama could have at least given the example of how he leads his own family, which is indeed a stable two-parent black family.

3. ‘We Must Fix the Brokenness in Black Culture’

Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Data shows that the popularity of black kids decreases as their GPA increases, a trend not seen for white public school children. This means black kids pay a high social price for pursuing academic excellence. Research from psychologist Angela Neal-Barnett shows that things like taking an Advanced Placement class, taking an honors class, or—gasp—speaking standard English were behaviors many black students saw as “acting white” and thus carried a social cost.

Researchers are still working out the reasons for this unfortunate phenomenon, but I suspect it exists simply because many young black people are rarely challenged by teachers, parents, communities, and the media. That’s because: 1) It’s much easier to just blame racism, and 2) Challenging black veneration of underachievement might be seen as racist.

However, President Obama should have avoided the easy, cowardly approach of blaming racism and instead forcefully illustrated the problem, proclaiming that achieving excellence does not have a race attached to it, and we will have zero tolerance for blacks who ridicule other black folks for pursuing distinction.

There is also a destructive thug culture among some strains of the black community. Black journalist Cynthia Tucker Haynes beautifully states: “Somewhere along the way, a cadre of young black men and women began glorifying violence, misogyny and thuggery, accepting incarceration as inevitable, resigning themselves to lives on the margins of mainstream society. They created a thug culture that has been commodified — celebrated in music and movies, sold to poor adolescents in wretched neighborhoods as well as affluent teenagers in upscale communities.”

What more can be said? President Obama should have uttered these powerful words last night, then ended them with, “Therefore, we must demolish this thug culture that is destroying young black Americans. We will treat it the same as terrorism: pursue it, confront it, and destroy it.” That’s right, I just compared thug culture to terrorism. September 11, 2011 killed about 3,000 Americans, yet about 5,500 black men kill other black men annually. That’s almost two black 9/11s per year! So where’s the War Against Thugs™?

4. ‘The Police Are Not the Main Problem’

Over the past 35 years, a mind-bending 323,820 black people have been killed by other black people in America, far exceeding the number of police officers killed during that same timeframe. The data showsabout 71 blacks are killed by other blacks for every one black person killed by a white police officer. It is clear then, the real problem is black people killing each other.

Yes, cases of police misconduct should be confronted and handled promptly when they occur. Absolutely. But black deaths due to the police account for less than 2 percent of all black murders, so attacking the police must never be the main issue. President Obama should thus have stated forcefully, “Let us stop blaming the police, for they are not the ones killing black folks. Sadly, it is black folks who are killing each other. Therefore, we must solve the national problem of black murder.”

5. ‘Blaming Police Gets More Police Killed’

Rhetoric that frames police for the deep, systematic problems in the black community puts police lives in danger by riling up hatred and resentment towards them, and encourages the kind of cop killers we’ve seen in Dallas and Baton Rouge. This kind of rhetoric can’t be tolerated.

First, it’s not true. The police are the first line of defense in protecting black Americans from black criminals, who overwhelmingly target black victims. Second, it takes focus away from the real issues at the source of the problem: broken families, thug culture, entitlement programs that disincentivize family formation, and a culture of low achievement.

President Obama should have thus forcefully declared “We will never allow police lives to be put in jeopardy by dangerous rhetoric that blames them for brokenness in minority communities, a brokenness they did not cause and cannot fix.”

Thankfully for the president, I do not charge for this free post-mortem analysis. But for further consultations, we’ll have to talk.

Republicans Chew On Criminal Justice Reform,"On the second day of the Republican National Convention, the U.S. Justice Action Network together with GOPAC Education Fund sponsored a governor’s forum on criminal justice reform. The event featured governors Matthew Bevin of Kentucky, Nathan Deal of Georgia, and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, all of whom are leading their states to reform a criminal justice system rife with overly strict sentencing laws and high rates of incarceration and recidivism.

The event focused on the need to give those who were formerly imprisoned a chance for redemption and restore their dignity. If you rob a person of their dignity, you’re dehumanizing them, Bevin said. They become less able to support their families and contribute to their communities.

Justice reform, in this context, is about breaking the cycle that too often occurs with repeat offenders and the generational effect of recidivism. Fallin said 85 percent of incarcerated women in Oklahoma have children. Many are single mothers, forcing kids into state care and increasing their own chances of criminal activity.

Deal supports alternative programs like accountability courts and other efforts that divert individuals to avoid prison time. For him, education reform is “the ultimate criminal justice reform,” given that recidivism is correlated with dropping out of high school.

Getting Into the Nitty Gritty

During her tenure as governor, Fallin has looked into uneven sentencing between individuals, passed a law allowing those who’ve committed certain low-risk crimes to get back their driver’s licenses so they can get back to work, and signed an executive order to “ban the box” from state employment applications. She is also pushing for district attorneys to prosecute more misdemeanors than felonies.

She points out one of the major problems with incarcerated people who commit non-violent crimes—especially those involving substance abuse or mental health problems—is that they come out of prison worse off and more likely to engage in criminal activity.

Bevin, who hasn’t been in office as long as Fallin and Deal, signed an expungement bill for non-violent offenders that finally passed after several failed efforts to get it through the Kentucky legislature. He encouraged other states’ lawmakers to rise above partisanship and work together on this issue, as he and his colleagues did.

All three governors also focused on the financial aspect of justice reform. Our overstuffed prison system costs taxpayers upwards of $80 billion a year, with a $19,000 average annual cost per prisoner. Justice reform is another way to be fiscally conservative and cut state budgets.

That’s partly why the issue made it onto the Republican 2016 platform, with praise for Republican governors who implemented criminal justice reform, and support for alternatives to prison like drug courts and vocational and educational programs for prisoners. Yet the GOP platform still supports the death penalty, a controversial topic for justice reformers, and while making a nod toward the need to reform mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenders, the party largely supports the policy as a necessary part of law and order.

What the Rank-and-File Think

Out on the street at the convention there was much interest in criminal justice reform among conservatives. A man in his fifties wearing a rehab sticker said offenses involving drug and alcohol abuse should be addressed with taxpayer-sponsored rehabilitation centers, not prisons. A twenty-something man who was with his grandfather wasn’t initially familiar with justice reform, but said he thinks some people in prison shouldn’t be there because “they can’t heal there.” According to him, people need different environments in order to change.

His grandfather is more concerned with states’ rights and the fact that there are “just too many laws.” That echoed what another man in his twenties, who was exercising his right to open carry, said about too many people being in prison for small stuff “while Hillary Clinton is walking free.”

Although many conservative states are leading justice reform, conservatives and Republicans on the street don’t necessarily support it, or even have it on their radar. Many are still attached to the 1980s and ‘90s tough-on-crime style of governance.

One middle-aged couple I spoke with outside a rally at the RNC was wary of what they see as leniency. Trump supporters both, they told me, “Criminals are criminals. You’ve got to obey the law,” although they were open to a narrow type of reform for first-time, non-violent offenders. The man with the rehab sticker said he’s absolutely for minimum sentencing for gun-related crimes.

Republicans often think of criminal justice reform as a liberal issue, one that’s soft on criminals and doesn’t hold people accountable for their actions. They fear this is just another leftist plot to break down society. Countering this narrative is a real challenge for justice reform advocates. Yes, laws need to be passed, but conservative culture also has to change organically. This takes time, and learning how contact with the justice and prison systems hurt those who’ve committed crimes, especially non-violent crimes, and their families.

How to Educate Your Citizens about Criminal Justice

The governors at the event addressed how to get Republicans on board with justice reform. Deal said, “One of the main purposes of government is to keep people safe,” and claimed the old methods aren’t doing that. According to him, people need to be told these reforms will make them more safe, not less. Bevin agreed, saying “criminal justice reform and the safety of communities go hand in hand.”

Money can also be a powerful tool to convince people of the need for justice reform. Fallin noted some alternative programs cost only $5,000 per person a year, as opposed to the average $19,000 annual bill for incarceration.

When asked how to convince conservative colleagues to get behind justice reform, Bevin said, “This is not a partisan issue. This is a human issue. Dignity transcends party.” He challenged audience members to go into a prison and get to know the people incarcerated there, because “the people in prisons look exactly like you.”

Such efforts among Republicans are largely unknown to younger, left-leaning Democrats like Melissa Hill of Minneapolis, who was in Cleveland to protest the RNC. She agrees that Democrat-controlled city governments and state legislatures have neglected criminal justice reform.

“They’re willing to lock all these people up for drug offenses, and also never seem to deny police funding for anything,” she says. Her friend, a black man from Cleveland named Will, agreed and added that it seemed like Democratic mayors, including Cleveland’s own mayor, Frank Jackson, don’t care about the Black Lives Matter movement or criminal justice reform in general.

But for all their disillusionment about Democratic action, neither had heard of Republican efforts to enact criminal justice reform in places like Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry closed three prisons during his final term in office.

There is momentum in the conservative movement for justice reform, not just in our leadership, but among the voters as well. It still has a long way to go, but this might be an issue that can transcend partisanship, that bane of American politics, and make a real difference in the lives of thousands of families in America.

Bevin ended his remarks by saying, “United we stand. Divided we fall. If ever there is an issue that embodies that… it is this issue.”",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/20/republicans-chew-on-criminal-justice-reform/,2016-07-20
‘Law And Order’ Won’t Save The Republican Party,"The Trump campaign has tried to push a few key narratives at the Republican convention. They haven’t succeeded, mind you, because they keep getting pushed off message by unforced errors, like plagiarizing bromides from Michelle Obama and treating Ted Cruz like dirt for six months, then inviting him to knife the nominee in prime time.

But the convention’s intended themes tell us the messages Trump’s people are hoping he can run on, and we can expect those themes to return during the rest of the campaign. One of the main themes is law and order. They hope to respond to the recent attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge by promoting themselves as the answer to runaway crime and a war on police.

But if the Left has constructed a false narrative about out-of-control racist cops, Republicans are constructing a false narrative about runaway crime. Rudy Giuliani summed up this narrative: “The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe. They fear for our children, they fear for themselves, they fear for our police officers.” Then, in a riff on the Trump campaign slogan, he proclaimed, “It’s time to make America safe again.”

I understand why Giuliani would embrace this theme. There are only two reasons he has any prominence on the national political stage: he helped break the crime wave in New York City in the 1990s, and he steered the city through the terrorist attacks on 9/11. So it’s no wonder crime and terrorism are the themes he keeps returning to. When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

The problem is that the crime wave remains broken. I sincerely doubt that the “vast majority” of voters “do not feel safe,” and if they do, the fear is largely unjustified. Recently, I took a look at the data about police shootings that undermines the Left’s narrative about racist cops. Now let’s look at some of the data that undermines the Right’s emerging “law and order” narrative.

Take a Look at Chicago

Let’s just take one microcosm, one which, as a former resident, I know pretty well: Chicago. It has become a standard retort, when President Obama uses a mass shooting to push for gun control, to point to the most recent weekend of shootings in his home city’s high-crime neighborhoods.

Chicago certainly does have a problem with crime, policing, and shootings in some of its outlying neighborhoods. I’ve written before about how the city has been split into two tiers: prosperous upper-middle-class neighborhoods downtown, and impoverished, failing neighborhoods to the south and west.

Yet even in Chicago, overall crime is continuing its long-term decline. Despite sensationalist press headline like “Chicago’s Murder Rate Soars 72% in 2016; Shootings Up More than 88%,” the Chicago Tribune‘s extensive statistics on crime show only a small seasonal uptick in violent crime. Meanwhile, here is their graph of the 15-year trend:

Here is an even longer-term trend for Chicago’s annual number of murders:

Yes, there was a massive crime wave that started in the 1960s and didn’t begin to subside until the 1990s. No, it is not returning, at least not yet. The data shows small ups and down within a level of killing that has been trending down to that of the pre-crime-wave era. This is in line with national-level statistics.

But what about the much-discussed “Ferguson Effect”? This narrative holds that the police shooting of a young black man in Ferguson, Missouri, a legitimate self-defense shooting distorted by the Left into the racist murder of a defenseless teenager, has been used to delegitimize the police and cause a surge in crime in big cities like Baltimore and Chicago.

But the data is ambiguous. There has been some recent increase in violence in big cities, but it is not clearly correlated to the kind of ferment created by Ferguson-related protests or the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s summed up in this graph from the Washington Post.

Yes, there have been big upticks in Baltimore and Cleveland, presumably in response to the Freddie Gray and Tamir Rice cases, respectively, But there were also big increases in places like Nashville, Denver, Oklahoma City, and Minneapolis, while other potential hot spots, like New York City, showed only very small increases.

But what about Dallas and Baton Rouge? Don’t they show an increase in shootings of police officers? Yet those are just two events within a large context of long-term decline. Here is a graph of the number of police killed in the line of duty, from the National Law Enforcement Officer’s Memorial Fund.

These figures include both shootings and traffic fatalities. But so far this decade, the average number of shooting deaths of police, 53, has been outnumbered by the average number of traffic fatalities, 55. By comparison, the average number of deaths from lightning strikes is 51.

This Won’t Resonate with the Public

As someone who remembers the later years of the late-twentieth-century crime wave, when crime kept getting worse and worse and we all feared it was just going to keep increasing, I don’t think we should take the current respite from violent crime for granted. I remember when the police seemed like a “thin blue line” protecting us from anarchy, and that’s why I’m so offended by the current practice of rushing to judgment every time some activist with an axe to grind accuses a police officer of a wrongful shooting.

I’m offended by the current practice of rushing to judgment every time some activist with an axe to grind accuses a police officer.

I certainly think there is reason to fear that recent attempts to delegitimize the police and to dismantle the law enforcement policies that broke the crime wave will lead to a resurgence of crime. But it hasn’t happened yet, and acting as if it has is a narrative just as false as the “racist cop” narrative.

More to the point, it is politically foolish. When Giuliani asserts that “the vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe,” this may resonate with a base of existing Trump supporters, which includes a lot of older voters—people my age and up, who formed their opinions on crime during the height of the crime wave—and, sad to say, a small faction of alt-right types who are eager to gin up an irrational fear of blacks and Mexicans.

But if they think this is going to resonate with the general public—if they’re hoping it will bring enough “law and order” voters to the polls to compensate for Trump’s amazing talent at repelling non-white voters—they are likely to be disappointed.

“Law and order” helped save the Republican Party once, thirty-odd years ago. It won’t save it this time.

The Full Text Of Donald Trump’s 2016 RNC Drafted Speech,"These are the remarks prepared for delivery according to a draft obtained by POLITICO.

Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.

Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.

Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.

Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.

I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.

The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.

It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.

I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.

So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.

But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.

These are the facts:

Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.

Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.

In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.

The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.

The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.

One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.

I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?

Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.

Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high – nearly $800 billion in a single year. The budget is no better.

President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.

Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.

Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.

This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant nothing.

In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy.

I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let’s review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.

Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos.

Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.

This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.

But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.

The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. This will all change in 2017.

The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.

A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.

Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.

That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.

I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.

When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.

And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.

When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.

In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.

I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.

But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.

We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.

America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.

On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and four were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.

I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done. In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.

This Administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them at every level.

When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.

Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?

To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.

Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.

The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.

We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.

This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.

My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.

Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.

Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.

On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.

These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?

These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.

We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.

By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.

Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.

On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.

But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.

Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.

I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.

I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I’m going to make our country rich again. I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.

Never again.

I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.

My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes.

She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.

No longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.

This includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want. We are going to start building and making things again.

Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.

America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.

My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work – that will never happen when I am President. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.

This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.

My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.

We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.

The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.

At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.

An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.

I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.

In this journey, I’m so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.

It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.

To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.

But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.

America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.

Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight. No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.

Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now.

It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.

My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: “I’m With Her”. I choose to recite a different pledge.

My pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.”

I am your voice.

So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again.

THANK YOU.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/21/the-full-text-of-donald-trumps-2016-rnc-drafted-speech/,2016-07-21
What We Can Learn From Tocqueville’s Insights Into Crime,"One of the perennial delights of re-reading “Democracy in America,” the best-known work of the French diplomat, historian, and traveler Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), is seeing how his observations have played out. Some passages border on prophetic visions that virtually leap off the page.

Tocqueville, whose birthday we celebrate July 29, published “Democracy in America” in two volumes and was celebrated for his brilliant analysis of the young nation’s well-constructed constitutional democracy. He also had a keen eye for the social mores and vibrant civic life that set America apart from Old Europe.

The pretext for Tocqueville’s visit to America was an 1831 commission from the French monarchy to study and issue a report on the prison system in America. Working with his friend and collaborator Gustave de Beaumont, Tocqueville authored the report, which, although little read today, makes a number of observations that would inspire applause from those now working for criminal justice reform.

How Legal Structure Influences Crime

For example, Tocqueville points to “how many important causes, unconnected with the penitentiary system, influence the decrease or increase of crime.” To illustrate, he cites an “extraordinary” increase in American crime in 1816 but points to the disbandment of military regiments following the War of 1812 and the lack of work for veterans as potential factors.

He also presciently warns that an increase in convictions, often following a more energetic police pursuit of criminal activity, does not necessarily prove an overall increase in crime. Tocqueville asserts that “the penitentiary system itself, which is intended to diminish the number of crimes, has for its first result, the increase of convictions.”

The influence of criminal penalties on the discretion of judges? Tocqueville recounts a colorful story about the mandatory death penalty for sheep stealing in England. Even though culprits were often proved guilty, “numberless acquittals” followed because judges found the penalty too draconian. When, in 1832, the penalty for sheep stealing was reduced to a sentence in a penal colony, we are told that subsequently “no acquittals of this kind have occurred.”

Whether sheep stealing deserved several years on Devil’s Island may be debatable. But Tocqueville’s illustration points to an enduring verity: How we structure our laws and penal systems may have just as much to do with putting people in prison as do their alleged crimes.

We Could Use Some of Tocqueville’s Insights Now

Although the historical circumstances driving prison populations vary, certain patterns Tocqueville observed continue through the centuries and have a bearing on the current, critical state of our criminal justice system.

A number of factors have combined to create a “historically unprecedented increase” in the federal prison population since the early 1980s, according to a new report from the Congressional Research Service. The number of prisoners the federal Bureau of Prisons house has increased from 25,000 in fiscal year 1980 to more than 194,000 as of July 2016. By year-end 2014, nearly three-quarters of the state prison systems were between 90 and 99 percent of their maximum capacity.

Driving this massive increase in the federal prison population are the rise in the number of crimes subject to mandatory minimum sentences, changes in the criminal code that now make more crimes a federal offense, and the elimination of parole.

While the number of people in federal prison actually declined in the last two years, more and more policymakers are looking for solutions to this “nearly unabated, three-decade crisis.” The American public is paying attention, too. A survey of Virginia residents conducted by Prison Fellowship and the Charles Koch Institute in February 2016 shows criminal justice reform has come to the forefront of public concern.

Thirty-six percent of respondents rate it as either their top issue or one of the top five issues most important to them. Three-fourths of those polled agree the prison population is costing too much money and the system should be re-focused on rehabilitation. More than 70 percent of Virginians agree or strongly agree that “judges should have more freedom to use forms of punishment other than prison.”

Rather than passing new laws with disproportional mandatory minimum sentences, we need to recognize that we have so many laws on the books right now that no one knows, quite literally, how many they are. Like those judges in England whose hands were tied in sentencing sheep rustlers, today’s judges also need more latitude to make the sentence fit the crime.

Just as patterns persist in the history of American criminal justice, enduring American values present in the culture since the early days of our republic—including fairness, equality before the law, and the promise of personal redemption—provide a roadmap for addressing the woes of our criminal justice system. Improving public safety starts with a better plan for a successful outcome, a plan that prioritizes proportional sentencing, a safe and rehabilitative prison culture, and preparation for reintegration into society for those who have paid their debt. If we can move closer to this ideal, we’ll all be better off.

Rotherham Authorities Still Ignoring Massive Child Sex Ring,"A new investigation by the Daily Express has found that the massive Rotherham child sex exploitation ring whose discovery rocked England two years ago is not only still in operation, but is as strong as ever. Reports from social workers, police, residents, and abuse victims all said the same thing: It’s still happening on an “industrial scale.”

In 2014, an independent inquiry led by Alexis Jay, a former senior social worker, found that men of Pakistani origin had groomed at least 1,400 young girls for sexual exploitation over the previous 16 years. These girls, as young as 12, were variously raped, abducted, tortured, and forced into prostitution. Keep in mind, this happened—and is still happening—in the heart of England, not some far-flung banana republic.

The report, known as the Jay Report, found “blatant” failure by city officials and police who didn’t prosecute the well-known and well-documented crime ring out of fear of being accused of racism. So they hushed it up, ignored it, and blamed the victims themselves.

It now appears that, two years and millions of pounds later, little has been done to eradicate the predatory operation. Despite a follow-up report published earlier this year claiming that the sexual exploitation was being addressed “adequately” and that previous failures were “isolated” events, people the Daily Express interviewed paint a very different picture.

Sex Trafficking Rings Across England

A former social worker who works with the victims said there has been a slight improvement in the city but that the scale of the sexual exploitation is still on an “industrial” level. A lawyer who has represented dozens of the young girls involved added that there are now half a dozen “splinter groups” in the town grooming under-aged girls.

This same lawyer is convinced that similar abuse is going on in towns across England, and that local police aren’t taking parents seriously, just they didn’t in Rotherham for years. This is corroborated by reports that authorities have arrested or prosecuted men, mainly of Pakistani origin, operating similar sex rings in 11 towns in England.

This new development raises a number of concerns, one of which is whether authorities continue their inaction from fear of being accused of racism for going after these groups of predominately Pakistani men. One victim who was interviewed by the Daily Express said she knew several other girls who had gone to the police and were told they were being racist.

More Important: Ending Rape or Ending Whining?

It wouldn’t be surprising if this fear were still motivating officials. In 2015, the group British Muslim Youth called on Muslims in Rotherham to cut ties with the police because, they claimed, all Muslims were being painted with the same brush. The Muslim community would “boycott” Muslims who didn’t join with them. According to the BMY, Islamaphobia had risen to “unprecedented levels” after the Jay report was published in 2014, and Muslims were being “demonized.”

It’s entirely possible that Muslims in general took some unfair heat after a scandal like this. But that doesn’t mean the government and police don’t have a solemn responsibility to speak plainly about and take seriously allegations of criminal activity, regardless of the suspects’ profile.

This line of reasoning always creeps up when criticism of Muslims or Islam arises. Try to talk about the dangers of Islamism and its clear link to terrorism, or the consequences of mass Muslim immigration, and one is liable to be branded a bigot and told one’s making the problem worse by encouraging a backlash against the Muslim community.

The London Times, which first broke the story of one of the victims and her abusers in 2013, was subsequently accused of being racist because it implicated Pakistani men in the scandal. This confirmed the fears of some Rotherham officials that many would not welcome prosecutions and arrests of Pakistanis. These kinds of overreactions from Muslim activists are exactly what scares police and government officials, discouraging them from investigating and prosecuting crimes committed by their Muslim immigrant population.

This Is a Widespread Problem

It isn’t just happening in Britain. The same phenomenon can be seen across the European continent. German officials repeatedly tried to cover up the mass sexual assaults that occurred on New Year’s Eve in cities across the country. First, they tried to keep what had happened out of the news, then insisted it had nothing to do with migrants or men from Muslim-majority countries. When it finally came out that the attackers were, in fact, predominately from the Middle East and North Africa, German officials tried to downplay the extent of the attacks. To the German government’s chagrin, news broke just last month that there were many more assaults than previously thought—more than 1,200 victims and more than 2,000 attackers.

We can get an insight into the motivations behind these kinds of official cover-ups by looking at a less well-known example. In January, a left-wing German politician was raped in a playground by three men speaking Arabic or Farsi. When she reported the crime to the police, she lied and said the men were speaking German. Twelve hours later she went back and told the truth, claiming she hadn’t wanted to create “more hatred against migrants in Germany.”

In all these cases, the truth didn’t conform with the official narrative about Muslim immigration: that everything’s going swimmingly. In reality, the unwillingness of the government, politicians, and police to confront crime committed by the Muslim immigrant population is a sign that Europe has a deep and troubling integration crisis on its hands. Europe can’t integrate immigrants if it doesn’t hold them to the same standards as the native European population.

Equality Under the Law Matters

There are ominous signs this failure of integration is being transferred to the younger generation of immigrants. In the Rotherham case, it appears that it’s no longer just older Pakistani men who are targeting these young girls. It’s now also the girls’ peers.

If European law enforcement agencies give immigrants from Muslim countries special treatment, the consequences on all fronts will only be harmful. It will fuel far-right groups, allow crime to go unchecked, and create more strife between Muslims and non-Muslims. It also infantilizes Muslim communities by treating them as too fragile to be held to the social and legal expectations of their new home.

This failure of integration has been going on for decades and is now reaching a fevered pitch. Europe sowed these seeds of discord long ago and now it’s seeing the fruits. Many immigrants and their families have done just fine in Europe. But as we’re seeing almost weekly, many have not.

Rotherham is a particular disgrace because it shows that once again multiculturalism trumps everything, including the safety of young girls. The shocking revelations about Rotherham two years ago should have resulted in a final repudiation of European political correctness. Sadly, it didn’t. And some of England’s most vulnerable residents are paying the price.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/10/report-british-authorities-still-ignoring-massive-pakistani-led-child-sex-ring/,2016-08-10
Sharing Passwords Could Make Millions Of Citizens Criminals,"Netflix, HBO GO, and other streaming devices have become a major part of millions of Americans’ recreation. So, too, has the practice of sharing accounts among family and friends so they can enjoy movies, shows, and music by simply plugging in a username and password.

This seemingly innocuous aspect of daily life has become a federal criminal offense with significant possible ramifications, although the CEO of Netflix and other contemporaries have stated support for sharing. Continuing a disturbing pattern, the federal court system has potentially criminalized a standard facet of everyday behavior through an overly broad interpretation of statute.

The issue of password sharing came to a head on July 5 in the federal Ninth Circuit Court’s ruling in U.S. v. Nosal. The case centered on a former employee of the executive search firm Korn Ferry International, who used a colleague’s login to download huge amounts of confidential data from the company’s computer system.

While David Nosal was rightfully convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the decision Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown wrote was so broad it could be used to criminalize the behavior of millions of Americans. Her decision could set a precedent where any person who shares a password could be violating the CFAA.

The ruling stated that accessing a website or computer network with someone else’s password violates the CFAA. As such, even if your friend consents to you using his Netflix password, accessing his account could be a federal offense unless you obtain Netflix’s permission.

Transforming Millions into Criminals Overnight

This case vastly distorts the CFAA’s original purpose. The CFAA was created as a protection against hacking and other forms of Internet fraud. However, by broadening the scope of the statute to password sharing, hackers and lax or consenting citizens will be tried under the same law.

In a dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt asserts, “the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act does not make the millions of people who engage in this ubiquitous, useful, and generally harmless conduct into unwitting federal criminals…the majority repudiates important parts of Nosal I, jeopardizing most password sharing. It loses sight of the anti-hacking purpose of the CFAA, and despite our warning, threatens to criminalize all sorts of innocuous conduct engaged in daily by ordinary citizens.”

Reinhardt hits upon two critical issues: the increasingly widespread use of criminalization to deal with generally victimless transgressions as well as the subject of mens rea, or the intention or knowledge of wrongdoing that constitutes part of a crime.

U.S. laws and regulations now classify thousands of harmless activities as crimes, and this case may set the precedent for another widespread activity to become a criminal offense. Significant differences between criminal and civil or administrative law make the criminal justice system an overly blunt tool for regulating non-fraudulent business activities.

The crime and punishment model of criminal law logically applies to activities that are inherently wrong like murder, but creates problems when such benign activities such as password sharing become criminal offenses.

Beyond the questionable expansion of its reach, the CFAA carries heavy punishments with conviction. Someone who violates the CFAA can be sentenced to decades in prison and slapped with extensive fines. Does password sharing require such a draconian punishment? To say the punishment exceeds the crime is a drastic understatement.

Ignoring the Importance of Intent

With the overcriminalization of such a standard part of many Americans’ lives comes the issue of criminal intent. Every crime consists of two parts: the criminal act and criminal intent, also known as mens rea. Criminal intent is a central tenet of the American criminal justice system, as the “guilty mind” distinguishes an accident from a wrongful act that society has decided should be punished.

Do many Americans share their passwords with the intent of harming society or breaking a law? When the federal government creates thousands of criminal offenses out of minor activities (which it has), it becomes impossible for a citizen to know of them all.

The idea of someone being sentenced to decades in prison for sharing his Netflix account is terrifying. If the government can create such punishments for relatively innocent actions, it calls into question where and if they will stop creating criminal offenses.

The Nosal case created yet another potential federal criminal offense that implicates millions of Americans. This is part of a greater trend among federal lawmakers and judiciaries making overcriminalization and disregard for mens rea endemic. It is time for serious reform within the federal legal system, where the average Joe has become the average criminal.

5 Questions ‘The Night Of’ Finale Must Answer,"The finale of HBO’s acclaimed limited series, “The Night Of,” will air this Sunday night in a 95-minute, long-form episode. There is no shortage of questions for this twisting, turning crime drama to answer. Richard Price and Steven Zaillian, the show’s creators, have guided viewers through a murder investigation that inverts much of what we expect in crime narratives.

Typically, a lead character, like Nasir Khan, appears at his most guilty as the story begins, only to have that guilt chipped away. While from the beginning all of the evidence of Andrea Cornish’s murder points to Khan, he was presented as a nice kid, one we couldn’t imagine stabbing a pretty girl 22 times. But even with the emergence of alternate suspects, revelations about Khan’s past—including violence, drug dealing, and lies—make him look better for the murder in episode seven than he looked in episode one.

As “The Night Of” wraps up, the following questions need to be answered for the viewer, or proxy jury, to make an informed decision about Khan’s guilt or innocence. Barring a flashback that shows us Khan’s memories from the moment of the murder, when he claims he was passed out on Ketamine, there is likely not to be definitive evidence proving Khan did or didn’t do it. Answers to the following five questions will go a long way to help determine if he is, in fact, a murderer.

1. Were the Creepy Alternative Suspects At the Scene?

If Khan didn’t kill Andrea, two women-hating creepy dudes are presented as plausible alternatives. Creepy hearse driving guy, who predicts Andrea’s death in a brief exchange in episode one, is the Scooby Doo option. He’s a character we meet early on, and then only once more, whose ideas about women fall somewhere between Son of Sam and Henry VIII. Did he follow Khan and Cornish? Is he a whacked-out serial killer?

What about Andrea’s stepfather, the cougar-baiting Lothario who wants Andrea’s deceased mother’s money? He has the most compelling motive of any suspect, but could he have done it? Him following Khan’s attorney, John Stone, perhaps suggests he could have been following Andrea the night of the murder and saw his opportunity to pin it on Khan, but that still feels like a long shot. On the other hand, he would have had access the missing knife, a plausible murder weapon.

One other alternate suspect exists. But I refuse to believe HBO would pin the death of a healthy young woman on Duane Reade, a ubiquitous New York City pharmacy chain.

2. What Does The Cat Know?

Andrea’s cat, adopted by the severely allergic but also lonely defense attorney after her murder, is either an important clue in the case, or an intentional misdirection. We see way too much of this friendly feline for it to be written off as inconsequential.

Does the cat’s presence outside the side door after the murder suggest that someone other than Khan let it out while sneaking in the house? Could the cat or its hair provide some additional physical evidence? Sometimes a cat is just a cat, but this cat gets an awful lot of screen time for a snuggly creature meant only to show us Stone’s soft side.

3. Did Prison Make Khan a Thug, Or Is He Just A Thug?

Nothing is more common in dramas involving prison than the unassuming, non-black guy learning to be tough and survive from the black guy. But doesn’t Khan take to his role as prison thug a little quickly? This isn’t a case of the kid simply punching some guy to prove he won’t back down. Khan, in a very short period of time, is involved in a prison beat-down, smuggles cocaine, shaves his head, gets prison tats, smokes crack, and quickly climbs the convict social ladder.

As evidence of Khan’s violent past emerges, we begin to wonder if he was ever really the good Pakistani kid we were supposed to believe him to be at the top of the show. After all, he does steal his dad’s cab while high on Adderall. That’s not exactly exemplary behavior. Predisposed as we are to the idea that our broken prison system creates more criminals than it reforms, maybe Khan fits in there so nicely because it’s where he really belongs.

4. What’s Up with Detective Box?

When Detective Box shows up to search the Khan family residence, he mentions that he is a father. It seems like a throwaway line until later, when he is struggling over the death benefit in his pension paperwork at the bar. Surely, as a father the answer would be easy, but apparently it is isn’t. Is Box’s child dead? Does that explain the sad opera music he listens to, or his kindness in breaking the chain of evidence to give Khan his inhaler?

From the beginning Box has his doubts. His gut doesn’t like the narrative. But at the same time he makes no effort to investigate any other suspects or create any alternative theories of the crime. Is Box worried that the final case in his long career could send an innocent kid to prison for life? Or is the grizzled detective immune to such concerns?

5. Will Chandra Get Kicked Off the Case?

I’ve never been to law school, but I imagine at some point they mention it’s a bad idea to hook up with your client in a prison cell. The blossoming romance between Khan and Chandra is one of the stranger subplots in “The Night Of.” Here is a young woman who is risking what appears to be a promising legal career to make out with a client she barely knows.

It’s not clear if the busy guard nearby saw that kiss between the lawyer and her client, but surely we saw him for a reason. Could this malpractice lead to a mistrial? Might she be kicked off the case, leaving Stone to take over in the courtroom, finally proving he is a good attorney? Whatever the case, this breach of attorney-client decorum looks to figure into the future of the ongoing trial.

If the current trend of artsy but vague crime stories from “Serial” to “Making of a Murderer” holds up in “The Night Of,” we may never know the truth about Cornish’s murder. With so much evidence pointing to Khan, the creators of the show have done a masterful job putting any doubt in our minds at all.

But could that be the rug they are about to pull from under us? We will find out Sunday night—maybe. Solid endings for solid suspenseful television series have proved elusive, from “Lost” to “The Sopranos.” There is reason to think “The Night Of” could continue that pattern. But even if the ultimate question remains unanswered, by the end of Sunday’s finale we are sure to know more than we do today.

A Former Cop Takes On ‘The War On Cops’,"When news of the Milwaukee police shooting and the ensuing riots broke earlier this month, it’s safe to say I watched the news more intently than most. I’m a former beat cop who worked the some of the worst neighborhoods in a large Midwestern city. If America’s having an ongoing debate about the police response to inner city crime, well, it’s a subject where I have a lot of first-hand knowledge.

Aside from a few years as cop, I have worked in law enforcement my whole adult life, in one way or another. In the Army, instead of counterintelligence, I was accidentally assigned to a criminal investigation team. (It turns out that in the Army both are abbreviated “CI.”) That investigation involved looking into a new bunch of suspected terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay. I worked with those agents for 10 years as a criminal intelligence analyst. I have been a criminal intelligence analyst since then, and I provide training for criminal investigators today.

I am also a “law and order” kind of guy, and while I agree that government is wasteful and often uses force capriciously, I also believe police need a few armored vehicles and SWAT teams. But I see the abuses and the errors, and I know how painful police mistakes are to the fabric of our nation.

But when I first started to tackle Heather Mac Donald’s latest book, which at 233 pages shouldn’t require a running start, I was too busy rolling my eyes over the title. The War on Cops:How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe seems like hyperbole at a time when nuance and thoughtfulness is desperately needed in the debate over criminal justice reform and allegations of police brutality. I was worried this was going to be the same kind of breathlessness, only from the police point of view. We’ve already had enough mania resulting from Black Lives Matter rhetoric.

Not Hyperbole

The original “Ferguson Effect” was supposed to be attacks on police everywhere, and for months that never happened. Instances of police being killed were actually dropping. But then Baltimore protests over the death of Freddy Grey turned into rioting; then Baton Rouge, Dallas, Minneapolis, and now Milwaukee. I began to realize this wasn’t hyperbole.

Mac Donald’s book starts with Ferguson. The Ferguson incident brought the issues of police racism and brutality to the forefront, and gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. It is, unquestionably, the most divisive environment American law enforcement has seen since the Rodney King incident in California in 1991. The current environment may be worse, as the Rodney King issue was often framed as a California problem. The riots after the police officers were acquitted in the King case were severe, but they were limited to Los Angeles. Now, 25 years later, every city seems to be capable of bursting into flames as soon as a police officer fires a weapon.

We must remember, though, that Ferguson is a massively important milestone in criminal justice reform, but not for the reasons that most people understand. Ferguson was, and continues to be, mostly ignorant myth and deliberate deception. Every credible assessment of the shooting that prompted the rioting found it was justified.

That’s not to say that the incident shouldn’t prompt some soul-searching from law enforcement. The Justice Department review of the Ferguson Police Department found a disturbing trend: not of random executions of unarmed teenagers, but of a systematic fleecing of the people of Ferguson by their own police department. Policing was used by the city’s political leadership as an important source of revenue generation. Unsurprisingly, a reflexively liberal media did not seize upon political corruption and excessive taxation as important contributors to the violence and tensions between police and poor urban communities.

Addressing Reality

This is an important theme that runs though Mac Donald’s book. There are major issues within American policing. We are in desperate need of significant reforms of our criminal justice system. But, as Mac Donalds’s book shows with clear prose, credible data, and statistical analysis, the problems are often not what we see reported in in traditional news media. We are not having a useful debate about policing, because we are talking about the wrong things, and in many cases, we are debating the finer points of completely imaginary environments.

Mac Donald’s data helps cut through the haze of poorly written headlines, social media outrage, and sensationalized cable news coverage. The effect of this, however, is a bit like Alice down the rabbit hole. It is distressing to see that much of what passes for debate and discussion about criminal justice reform, police brutality, and the racism of our criminal justice system is simply not addressing reality.

Once she establishes the wrongness of the initial Michael Brown “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative, andshe demonstrates how the U.S. attorney general and President Obama callously exploited it. This helped set the stage for Baltimore.

Since the publication of The War on Cops, prosecution of the police officers accused of being either directly involved or potentially negligent in the death of Freddy Grey have collapsed. Mac Donald discusses the Baltimore riots at length, and notes especially the contrived, almost scripted nature of how the riots played out.

City leadership’s orders to essentially let the riots go on reinforce this point. It seems that any opportunity to let a city burn is abated by a news media that cheerfully parrots Black Lives Matter talking points, while politicians who have been capitalizing on the plight of African Americans gravely condemn the actions of police they command before the crime scene has even been processed.

The Virulent Strain of Libertarianism

Part two of Mac Donald’s book, subtitled “Handcuffing the Cops,” builds on the theme that much of what we think we understand about policing and the debate about criminal justice reform is based on so few facts that we are missing the point completely. She begins a litany of other criminal justice issues, refutes the conventional (or at least popular) wisdom, and manages to get in solid blows against narratives of both social justice warriors and the more anti-cop libertarians.

Maybe the social justice warriors are a lost cause, but I hope libertarians are at least receptive to some of what Mac Donald has to say. I know most libertarians don’t think of themselves as anti-cop. Some are very thoughtful about the massive power we give flawed people and systems, which I understand and appreciate a great deal.

But libertarians also need to be cautious about encouraging a strain that hates the concept of any authority, law, or police. Libertarians have some of the best ideas about criminal justice reform out there and are right to worry about the excess militarization of police. But at times they seem a bit too ambivalent about the reality that we will always need people with guns on patrol.

As for the Justice Department’s new rules regarding citizen complaints against the police, Mac Donald argues they are mostly a power grab. Complaints and lawsuits about stop and frisk in New York City, Mac Donald argues, have only left people in the poorest, most dangerous neighborhoods more at risk as police are further restricted from being proactive.

A Criminal Disconnect

Part three lays out a series of anecdotes, chiefly designed to refute sociologist and TED-talker Alice Goffman’s book, On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City. Part three is subtitled “The Truth about Crime,” and I expected more data here. This section, while a scathing retort to Goffman’s book, seems out of place for anyone, like myself, who had never heard of Goffman or her book. Goffman, Mac Donald claims, is endemic of a white, liberal class of sociologists who place blame for crime entirely on police and the courts.

I have not read Goffman’s book, so I cannot evaluate the strength or weakness of her research or arguments. It is worth noting that Goffman has been accused of getting so close to the subjects of her study in criminal justice that, among other things, she may have driven the getaway car in a murder plot.

I can certainly vouch for a serious disconnect between the realities of crime and the world of some criminologists and sociologists. There is a trend of empathetic, well-meaning people who can’t seem to remember the pain, danger, and fear criminals cause once they have met some of those criminals and found out criminals have experienced pain, danger, and fear themselves. They mistake empathy for tolerance, and slide into weakness.

There is a simple antidote for this: Talk to victims and survivors of crime. Since the vast majority of victims never turn to violence, theft, or drugs, I don’t find pain and hardship quite the excuse that many sympathizers with criminals do.

The Marijuana Myth

Part four focuses on prisons, and some of the misconceptions about “mass incarceration” and the perceived benefits of decriminalization of some, or all, illegal drugs. I found this section very interesting, as I do not normally read or think much about the penal system. The biggest revelation in this section, which is hard to refute thanks to the data, is the fantasy that there are significant numbers of people in jail simply because of drug possession, especially marijuana possession.

We must not believe our prisons will empty and the criminal underclass will be liberated from the tyranny of the police if we just decriminalize marijuana.

In reality, most people in prison are there for violence. Certainly, some of that violence is associated with drug trafficking, which some will say is an argument for de-criminalization. Some of that violence is committed while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, which some will say is an argument for treatment-based responses. But we must not believe our prisons will empty and the criminal underclass will be liberated from the tyranny of the police if we just decriminalize marijuana.

Mac Donald notes clearly this would have a minor, possibly negligible impact on our prisons. We can academically debate the merits of decriminalization of marijuana. I believe we should be experimenting with decriminalization and legalization, and I am happy to see various programs being tried. In my experience in law enforcement, I never had to fight a guy who had been smoking marijuana, but I had to fight a lot of people who had been drinking. Maybe that’s not a scientific survey, but I’m open to the argument that marijuana could be part of an orderly society.

That being said, I would like to send an additional 100,000 cops into the streets to smash heroin, meth, and cocaine dealers. If that didn’t work, I’d send another 100,000. I don’t have any sympathy or mercy for dealing hard drugs.

The Cycle Repeats Itself

If nothing else, Mac Donald’s book is a good reminder that we need more data in our debates about criminal justice reform. We need more evidence, and more rational thought. Black Lives Matter activists scream that young, black men are being executed in the streets, but this just is not true. This irrationality is getting worse, not better, and time is making this hysteria more prevalent, not less.

These demonstrably false impressions feed fear and irrational actions that put people in danger.

The recent rioting in Milwaukee has turned this into a farce after a black police officer killed an armed black man. It seems no pretense or distortion is needed to justify a riot anymore. There’s no need to even concoct the fantasy of Mike Brown surrendering and then being executed for no reason by a racist white cop.

The tragedy is that these demonstrably false impressions feed fear and irrational actions that put people in danger. Black Americans have been told that police execute them for no reason, so of course they run from and fight with police. Running and fighting only increases the chances for violence, and the cycle repeats itself.

The unavoidable reality is this: The police are the only part of the government that is authorized to kill Americans on the spot, and make the decision to kill in an instant. This is not true of Special Forces, the CIA, the NSA, NASA, Congress, the president, the IRS, the Department of the Interior, Exterior, or somewhere in between.

They are also the people called to respond to every single problem in poor, mostly minority communities. Noise complaint? Cops. Kids hanging out on the corner? Cops. Someone is hungry or drunk? Cops. Your kids won’t obey you? Cops. Your cousin is suicidal? Cops. Your neighbor is schizophrenic? Cops. Your landlord is a jerk? Cops. After all the rhetoric and nonsense, poor, urban neighborhoods call for police services more than anywhere else.

I don’t know if this is evidence that the Black Lives Matter movement is totally disconnected from normal urban culture, or if this is evidence of an astounding lack of self-awareness. Remember that the defining quality of the role of police, versus all other social and governmental support, is that they are expected to be obeyed or they can, will, and often are required to use force. Police are government power in its plainest form.

This is a concept called “The law of the instrument,” coined by Abraham Maslow to describe the over-reliance on familiar tools. “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” Maslow said. For our social decline in the inner city, all we have is police, and we are amazed that everyone has started to look like a criminal to them.

What Trump’s Immigration Proposal Gets Right And Wrong,"Donald Trump delivered his highly anticipated immigration plan last week, and I watched with mixed emotions. On the one hand, I have written extensively in support of many aspects of his ten-part plan. On the other hand, some of his ideas are just plainly wrong. Even some of Trump’s ideas I agree with he bases on erroneous premises.

First, What’s Good Here

First, let’s talk about the “good” of his speech, the ideas I agree with.

End “catch-and-release.” President Obama revived the “catch-and-release” policy of the Bush years, and ordered Border Patrol agents not to bother arresting and deporting illegal immigrants who came here before 2013 and did not have serious criminal convictions. For these illegal immigrants, the administration’s approach is a “permiso” to come and stay. Ending “catch-and-release” will eliminate at least one incentive for illegal border crossing.

Complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system. I agree, and believe using smart cards to replace paper visas is the way to go.

Stop funding sanctuary cities. The entire United States is a sanctuary for people who seek a better life by working hard and abiding by the law of the land. Our nation can only continue to be a sanctuary for all who seek freedom and escape from oppression if we continue to uphold the rule of law. Thus, I support blocking federal funding for cities that defy federal law.

Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws. President Obama’s executive actions on immigration have sent the wrong signals to both illegal and legal immigrants. For example, after President Obama announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which in June 2012 temporarily stayed deportations of young adults brought to the U.S. illegally as children, there was a well-publicized surge of unaccompanied minors and families illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

In the meantime, the 30 million legal immigrants in the United States didn’t get any relief even though they dutifully followed the law, paid hefty fees, endured long waits, and suffered long separation from their families. By focusing his attention on illegal immigrants, the president is saying there is no reward for obeying the law and no punishment for breaking the law.

Establishing safe zones for refugees. Migration issues need to be addressed at the source. Besides the national security concerns, we must consider whether a refugee resettlement program is the best solution for a migrant crisis. The most humane way to help all Syrian refugees is to establish safe zones. A coalition of countries, including the United States and European and Arab countries, could jointly provide funding and security protection.

Turn off the benefits magnet. We should restrict immigrants’ access to welfare. A Cato Institute study shows that while cutting access to benefits may negatively impact some immigrant families, the overall impact is pretty minimal because poor non-citizens use less welfare than U.S. citizens, on an individual basis.

Choosing immigrants “based on merit, skill, and proficiency.” I not only support this idea but also have laid out the details on how to make our legal immigration simple and merit-based.

Trump’s Bad Immigration Ideas

Unfortunately, in addition to these good ideas, Trump also offered some bad ideas. The most notable one is his very first proposal: “build a wall along the southern border, and Mexico will pay for it.”

Let’s not forget the U.S.-Mexico border is about 2,000 miles long. There are major obstacles to building a wall or fence this long: first, it would not only be costly to build but also be costly to maintain. Trump insists Mexico would pay for it. Yet, curiously, Trump the tough guy told reporters he didn’t even bring up the payment of the wall to the Mexican president during his one-day visit. Later the Mexican president tweeted that they did talk about it and he made it clear that Mexico would not pay for it. So one of them is not telling the truth.

Besides the cost issue, whoever built the wall would have to negotiate with many different interest groups, such as Indian reservations, private property owners, and national parks. It would probably also require rounds of environmental studies. All this means it would take years before we could begin to lay the first brick.

Besides, a wall wouldn’t even be effective. As a person who grew up in a country that has had a wall for thousands of years (the Great Wall of China), I can tell you that a physical wall, no matter how long or how strong it is, will never be effective at stopping determined people from crossing.

Now, for the Ugly

Here comes the ugly part. Even where I agree with Trump’s ideas on immigration, his premises for them are dead wrong. For example, I agree that illegal immigrants who have committed crime should be deported immediately. It was heart-breaking to watch those parents who lost their children to illegal immigrants on stage. But I reject Trump’s premise that immigrants are roaming around America and committing “countless crimes.”

Despite popular misperceptions associating immigrants with a high crime rate, the actual data tells a different story. Scores of studies on immigrants and crime rates, some going as far back as a century, show that regardless of nationality, ethnicity, education level, or legal status, immigrants are not more likely to commit violent crimes than native-born Americans, and increasing numbers of immigrants are not associated with higher rates of crimes—quite the reverse, in fact.

Here are some of the studies well-respected economists have conducted: A 2007 study by sociologists Rubén G. Rumbaut and Walter Ewing found that “among men age 18-39 (who comprise the vast majority of the prison population), the 3.5% incarceration rate of the native-born in 2000 was 5 times higher than the 0.7% incarceration rate of the foreign-born.” A 2008 study by Richard Nadler of the America Majority Foundation concluded that high levels of immigration aren’t correlated with elevated levels of crime at the state level. Graham C. Ousey and Charis E. Kubrin investigated data from 159 cities between 1980 and 2000 and drew the same conclusion.

It’s wrong to assume that just because someone broke our immigration law it means he or she is more likely to commit other crimes. Let’s not forget that many immigrants come to the United States to better their lives, so they are less likely to ruin their economic opportunity by committing crimes.

Another of Trump’s premises is that immigration hurts American workers by lowering wages and occupying jobs. Therefore, Trump proposed to restrict immigration in order to “protect” American workers. This is the most anti-free market and anti-immigrants argument, and has been uttered many times. But no matter how many times it is repeated, it’s just factually wrong.

Immigration is good for America’s economy and for American workers in the long run. What is really holding American workers back are things we can control but have managed poorly, such as education and occupational licensing. These factors have nothing to do with immigration, but they contribute to our nation’s low labor participation rate and the bleak employment picture in America.

Trump’s speech shows that while he is not “softening” on immigration, he has made some progress towards formulating solutions. I hope he will keep an open mind, continue working on understanding the issues, and solicit ideas from others.

Today’s native-born Americans, including Trump, are descendants of early immigrants. The immigration issue and all the controversies surrounding it are mostly our own doing. We can and should make policy changes. But a meaningful immigration reform can only be carried out when we stop this native versus immigrants, or “us” versus “them,” mentality. We are all in this together.

"20 Years After JonBenét’s Murder, The Ramseys Still Look Guilty As Hell","As the 20th anniversary of JonBenét Ramsey’s murder approaches, a series of true crime television shows, culminating with CBS’s two-part docuseries next week, are re-litigating the conspiracy theories surrounding the murder.

When the six-year-old girl was found murdered in her Boulder home on Christmas 1996, the case generated immense national coverage. A lot of the interest was propelled by JonBenét’s beauty queen competitions and the possible sexual nature of the crime (due to the posing of the body) — both of which turned out to have very little to do with the crime.

When I worked in Colorado, I quickly learned how easy it was to become obsessed with the case. Over the eight years I spent as a journalist in Denver, I met a number of people who’d been involved with the investigation in some capacity. Almost all of them advanced a similar view: One of the parents had killed her, and both had covered up the crime.

This isn’t exactly a contrarian position. It’s worth remembering that in 1999 (uncovered in 2013) a grand jury voted to indict both parents, John and Patsy, in the death of JonBenét. They voted to charge the parents with felony child abuse resulting in death, accessory to first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. Boulder’s district attorney Alex Hunter, as he had done many times before, decided not to move forward due to lack of evidence.

There was never compelling real evidence to back up the intruder theories, save a single shoe print outside that could have been left by any passerby. Other than that, no one could see any prints in the snow-covered December ground. The Boulder police had come up with a list of 25 reasons the intruder theory was unlikely.

Without a confession from at least one or the other, we will likely never know exactly what happened. Patsy Ramsey is now dead. But while it might be entertaining to contemplate conspiracies– and there is plenty of forensic evidence to talk about, as well — investigators were always being pulled in one direction for sound reasons.

There Were Never Any Other Suspects

Re-reading Lawrence Schiller’s “Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,” the most comprehensive and reliable book written on the topic, reminded me how well-founded and reasonable it is to suspect the Ramseys. One of the problems police faced was the prospect of figuring out which of two strong suspects they should pursue.

Every detective in the case’s infancy agreed on one thing: the biggest mistake in the weeks after JonBenét’s murder was the failure to arrest Patsy Ramsey and question her. “The detectives were sure that if only Hunter had agreed to jail Patsy—even for a short time—she would have caved in,” writes Schiller.

Cops argued that such an arrest was standard procedure when a child is murdered in the home. Then again, we’re talking about the quixotic folks in peaceful Boulder, Colorado. So nothing happened. The police had already allowed a contamination of the crime scene—permitting the parents and friends to move the body; at one point allowing a group to pray over JonBenét. (We won’t dive too deeply into the bizarre circumstances surrounding the discovery of JonBenét’s body by her father John in the clandestine room in the basement, where a witness claimed John cried out before even turning on the lights to see the body.)



Then there was the Boulder DA’s constant dithering and an activist detective who joined the investigation and became an advocate on the Ramsey’s behalf after bonding with John over religion. The police investigated everyone who had come into contact with the Ramseys. They traveled around the country chasing down leads. They spoke to countless experts. They interviewed all friends and family. They always ended up in the same place.*

The Killer Didn’t Act Like An Intruder

Every item involved in killing JonBenét was found inside the house, including the pad and pen used to write the “ransom note,” the broken paintbrush, duct tape, rope and ligature used to pose the girl (police had evidence that Patsy probably purchased the latter two items from a hardware store earlier that month) and the flashlight (the likely murder weapon).

This was a pivotal fact. The question investigators kept asking was: What kind of sophisticated, highly motivated sexual predator and would-be kidnapper breaks into a house planning an abduction and rape of a young girl without bringing a single tool of the trade with him?

Then again, what kind of highly motivated sexual predator and would-be kidnapper would feel comfortable hanging around a house long enough to write a three-page ransom note after he’d just murdered a screaming child (neighbors told police they heard a scream, but no one in the house did, allegedly)? If the perpetrator had enough time to write a note at the home, he had enough time to move JonBenét’s body somewhere else.

Even more importantly, why would he stick around to write a ransom note when the prospect of deriving any money from the crime had already been lost? The only reasonable conclusion, according to an FBI report—and almost everyone agreed the ransom note was written after the murder; the perpetrator could have brought one along if he had planned a kidnapping—was that the note had been left behind in an attempt to hide the killer’s identity and motive.

The Ransom Note Implicates Patsy

Other aspects of the letter pointed to an insider, as well. Or, I should say one insider.

The FBI concluded that ransom notes almost always have fingerprints or signs of “handling, creasing, or damage.” This one had nothing but evidence of Patsy. She also claimed she’d stepped over the three sheets of paper that were neatly spread across the bottom of a spiral staircase to get to the kitchen. Believing a child left it there, she returned to it later—which worked well for the timeline of her calling 911, etc. When detectives reenacted this scene, however, they found it was impossible. She could not pass without stepping on the papers. Either she forgot or lied.

The FBI’s Child Abduction and Serial Killer Unit had noted that JonBenét’s murderer almost certainly hadn’t commited a murder before. They also concluded separately that the ransom note was written by someone intelligent but criminally unsophisticated.

So it should not be surprising that the ransom letter was a mess of contradictions, composed by someone who had no purpose other than covering up a crime and diverting attention. As one investigator pointed out, many of the phrases—“foreign factions” and other silly terms—were curiously similar to quotes from movies that had recently been shown on TV. The letter begins with “Mr. Ramsey” and ends with “John,” and infamously includes a monetary demand that matched John’s recent bonus check—an obvious way to deflect blame towards his colleagues.

Moreover, lab tests also showed it was Patsy’s Sharpie pen used to write the note. The pen used to write the note—an FBI profiler estimates it took 21 minutes for the author to practice on the pad and then compose it—was found in a cup with other Sharpies right next to the phone in the kitchen where Patsy kept them. It was very conscientious of the murderer to put everything back where he found it.

While handwriting analysis at the time couldn’t definitively prove Patsy had written the note, of all the people police interviewed, she was the only one who could not be eliminated. A forensic document examiner named Gideon Epstein later examined the note and concluded that there was “no doubt” it was Patsy. Most agreed. Donald Foster, an expert who performed comparisons of phraseology and punctuation at the time, concluded that Patsy was likely to have “written and may have composed the note.”

You Need a Map to Get Around This House

There was another question that baffled investigators. How is it that an intruder had such familiarity in a stranger’s house?

For instance, only the family knew that JonBenét’s urine-soaked sheets and blanket—she was still struggling with bedwetting, a fact that fed many theories about Patsy accidentally killing her daughter in anger—were put directly into the washer and dryer so they wouldn’t stink up the house. Somehow the person who posed JonBenét’s body also did. Yet everyone who had access to the Ramsey home and would have known this was interviewed and cleared.

And what kind of sophisticated, highly motivated sexual predator and would-be kidnapper gets into a millionaire’s house without leaving any evidence of a break-in or escape, and no fingerprints? What kind of killer can put duct tape on a girl and leave behind not a thread of evidence? (The Colorado Bureau of Investigations established that fibers found on the duct tape around JonBenét’s mouth were consistent with the jacket Patsy wore on Christmas.)

When experts retraced the steps of the kidnapper in the dark, maze-like basement, they noted someone who did not know the house intimately could not get around—certainly not with a body.

Finding that hidden basement room—the room that people searching for JonBenét had initially missed—was improbable. In the dark? Almost impossible. Yet there was no evidence that any of the lights had been turned on that night.

“Who gives a f**k if every window and every door was open in the house?” Schiller quotes a cop saying at the time. A stranger entering the house for the first time would need a map and a guide, he went on.

The Staging Doesn’t Make Sense

If a stranger had really murdered JonBenet, he wouldn’t have to stage the body to make it look like a stranger had murdered her. Why would a stranger use a ligature to pretend to suffocate JonBenét, when he thought she had died from the head injury? Why would a stranger only loosely tie a cord around JonBenét’s arm—after she was dead—to feign she was constrained when she never was? The FBI called this a “staging within staging.”

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation had determined that the flashlight was the murder weapon and that it (and the batteries inside) had probably been wiped of fingerprints. Why would an intruder wipe the flashlight—and open it to wipe the batteries—rather than taking it with him when he left if it was the murder weapon? It’s more probable that someone from inside the house would have panicked and removed the prints.

According to FBI profilers, all of this and the time spent staging the body pointed to a killer who was trying make the murder look like an intruder’s work. It was someone comfortable in the house.

From “Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,” a damning paragraph about the killer:

The way the cord had been made into a noose—with the stick tied 17 inches from the knot—suggested staging rather than a bona fide attempt to strangle JonBenét. It suggested that the killer was a manipulative person, with the courage to believe that he or she could control the subsequent investigation. In short, everything about the crime indicated an attempt at self-preservation on the part of the killer. On the other hand, the killer cared about the victim and wanted her found. He or she didn’t want JonBenét outside in the dead of winter in the middle of the night. The child had been wrapped in a white blanket, her Barbie nightgown found lying next to her. Such caring and solicitude were not usually associated with a malevolent criminal.

None of it made sense if a stranger had done it.

The Ramseys Acted Guilty

It should not be forgotten that most of the investigators were taken aback by the behavior of the Ramseys from the moment the body of their daughter was found.

From Schiller:

They had seemed distant from each other the entire morning, had never tried to comfort each other, and had remained physically separate. Patsy was looking around, peeking through the fingers covering her face, one police report said, while John was off by himself much of the time, out of Arndt’s sight. He had even gone alone into the basement at midmorning, after which time he had become despondent, sitting alone. The Ramseys’ refusal to grant formal interviews until four months after the murder was also highly suspicious, the police said.

John began making arrangements to fly his private jet to Atlanta with his family less than a half an hour after police showed up to remove his daughter’s body. The couple refused to cooperate with the police, soon hiring criminal attorneys. When they did offer interviews with police, the Ramseys made numerous demands that would undermine the veracity of the inquiry. They constantly laid blame on their friends– many of whom found their behavior puzzling. Patsy, one cop noted, had the ability to turn on and off the waterworks or use her Southern charm whenever it suited her. She spoke about herself as a victim and used phrases that were constantly making them suspicious.

Is it possible that someone who knew the family got into the house, pulled JonBenét out of her room upstairs, killed her, walked around the house for a few hours pulling together the many items needed to stage the crime, sat down for almost a half hour to write a ransom note, and then left without waking anyone up? I guess.

There have always been theories floating around about family friends or John’s older son from a previous marriage or JonBenét’s younger older brother. All of them were cleared by police. It always seemed curious to me that people were prepared to blame the neighbors or John’s friends without a shred of evidence, yet unwilling to accept the predominance of proof pointing to the parents.

Anyway, the couple soon moved away and, like O.J., gave up looking for the mysterious killer. It’s a shame that this murderer was allowed to remain a menace to children of Boulder all these years. Fortunately, this madman, who employed such a distinctive and stylized way of killing a poor little girl, never seemed to resurface. Funny enough, though, few people were surprised.

*I guess that’s not exactly true. In 2008, Mary Lacy, then the extraordinarily incompetent district attorney of Boulder, had made it her mission to exonerate the Ramseys. She wrote a cloying open letter clearing the couple of any wrongdoing and then generated a lot of excitement around the country by arresting John Mark Karr, a weird man who was living in Thailand for conspicuous reasons. Karr had confessed to killing JonBenét. My newspaper—and every other major media outlet—rushed to send reporters to Bangkok to learn more. Macy, and others, used the self-generated story to attack those who had been critical of the Ramseys. Yet all rational people quickly discerned that Karr was unwell, and that he couldn’t have possibly had anything to do with the case. Karr was soon released. [Go back.]

"To Help Blacks, Colin Kaepernick Needs To Put Up Or Shut Up","Much has been made recently of Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for our national anthem to protest what he sees as the oppression of black people. It now appears Kaepernick’s actions have influenced other players, with additional NFL athletes refusing to stand at attention for the anthem, and some even raising the black power fist in protest.

As a black person who is a football fan, I state plainly: this is stupid. The simple reason is the flag, our anthem, and the best parts of America that it represents are not the cause of black people’s problems.

Thus instead of insulting our nation and Americans who actually like what our flag stands for, these NFL athletes should use their money and fame to work towards actual solutions to the black issues they purport to care about. Here are four ways they can do so.

1. Rebuild the Family

The black family is in complete disarray. More than 70 percent of black children are born to single mothers. The studies show that children born to single mothers have worse outcomes in many significant areas compared to those born into stable, two-parent homes. That means our protesting athletes really need to address this problem.

How? They should start advocacy groups and research centers that press state and federal governments to eliminate welfare, housing subsidies, and other government handout programs that destroy incentives to work and eliminate the role of the black father as provider, thus decimating the black family and communities. While some conservative groups already do this, it would be much more powerful and meaningful coming from black NFL players.

Additionally, they should create awards, financial and job incentives, training programs, and counseling and mentorship centers for black men and women who choose to marry and raise their children the right way as married couples. Why not even start an ad or social media campaign around something like “Marriage is cool” or “Marriage pays,” featuring black celebrities who are happily married and showing the various health, economic, and sexual benefits of marriage?

2. Rebuild American Education

It is obvious that public schools in poor, black communities are an abysmal failure, with studies showing the blacker the school, the worse the performance. Protesting athletes should thus use their wealth to start excellent private schools in the poorest black neighborhoods, and then invest in research and collaboration to turn the schools into a national movement.

Studies also show that black kids become less popular as their GPA increases. This unfortunate phenomenon is known as “acting white.” Why can’t protesting athletes be or highlight role models who did well in school, and promote academic achievement? How about national awards and prizes for kids who do excellently in school?

Further, because many children in poor, black areas weren’t raised in loving, intact homes, many have serious problems with work ethic, discipline, attitude, and people skills. That means the educational projects athletes implement will have to include training in the type of soft skills that many poor black kids never got at home and that are not typically taught in schools—such as how to be on time, dress professionally, and speak proper English. All this may seem like a tall order, but given that Kaepernick has a $114 million contract, he certainly has the resources to get started.

3. Rebuild American Jobs

With their combined hundreds of millions of dollars, the protesting NFL players could start a venture capital investment fund that finances innovative entrepreneurs who’ll create jobs in poor, black communities. They could even partner with established venture capital firms for guidance, mentorship, and additional funding.

They could work with Walmart, which has announced a plan to spend $250 billion bringing jobs back to the United States, to develop programs to steer some of the incoming manufacturing to poor black areas, and then train the people in those areas to succeed in these new work opportunities. There are lots of possibilities here with as much money as the protesting NFL men have. It’s time for them to use their fame and fortunes to start serious initiatives to bring jobs to poor black areas.

4. Stop the Killing in Black Communities

Kaepernick says he has a problem with police brutality. But the facts clearly show that black brutality is a much bigger problem than police brutality: approximately 6,000 black people are murdered by other black people ever year, compared to just 300 killed by the police, and even fewer than that killed by white police officers.

Black crime is astronomical. The rate at which black people commit murders is a whopping eight times that of whites—34.4 per 100,000 versus 4.5 per 100,000. Despite being just over one-tenth of the population, black people also commit more than half of all carjackings. Just wrap your head around this reality. We absolutely must end black crime. It kills more Americans than terrorism, by a large margin.

Our protesting athletes should thus leverage their money and fame to end violence in black communities. Some ways they can accomplish this are: buying up drug houses and shutting them down; building up neighborhood security patrols in the most dangerous black neighborhoods, which has been proven to be a low-cost way of reducing crime in several studies; and by raising nationwide awareness of black crime in order to call for help and solutions.

I hope Kaepernick and friends will get to work ASAP on what I’ve outlined here, for the sake of their needy fellow Americans. And stand up for the anthem, for Pete’s sake!

Donald Trump Was 100% Correct: Crime Is Rising In The U.S.,"Last June, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a simple, easy-to-verify claim, and the so-called fact-checkers lost their minds over it. What was his shocking claim? “Crime is rising.”

Politifact, infamous for declaring that “clearly accurate” and “technically true” claims are nonetheless “mostly false”, pulled out all the stops and gave Trump’s claim a “pants on fire rating,” which the organization reserves for only the most egregious of lies.

“Donald Trump said, ‘Crime is rising.’ It’s not (and hasn’t been for decades),” Politifact declared in its headline.

Unfortunately for Politifact, brand new FBI crime data released yesterday prove that Trump’s claim was 100 percent accurate.

According to the newly released 2015 crime data, violent crime in the U.S. increased across the board last year. The murder rate increased by 10 percent. The rape rate increased by more than 5 percent. The robbery rate increased by nearly 1 percent. And the aggravated assault rate increased by nearly 4 percent. (Crime rates, rather than the absolute number of crimes perpetrated, are used to take population growth into account). The rate of every single category of violent crime increased in 2015. Overall, the violent crime rate increased by nearly 4 percent last year.

In its screed against Trump, Politifact used trend data from the 1990’s through 2014 to show that crime had steadily fallen for two decades. That is true. Crime today is thankfully much lower than it was 20 years ago. But when it comes to evaluating the specific claim about whether “crime is rising,” crime data from 20 years ago are irrelevant. Trump didn’t say crime was higher than it was in 1995. He didn’t say America is locked in a multi-year upward trend. He merely said, “Crime is rising.” And the only data we need to evaluate the veracity of that claim are crime data from 2014 and 2015. If crime fell, then Trump’s claim would be false. Crime would not be rising. If crime increased, then Trump’s claim would be correct. It’s that simple.

The comprehensive nationwide crime data released yesterday by the FBI, data which Politifact said are “generally considered the best available for answering” questions about crime, indisputably support Trump’s point that crime in the U.S. is rising.

Will crime continue to rise in 2016 as it did in 2015? We don’t know. There are some promising signs that the 2015 increase in violent crime might have been a blip, at least in some isolated areas, but it’s far too early to tell, especially since other cities like Chicago are seeing massive spikes in murders so far this year:

Police departments in many major cities and metropolitan areas say that homicides and other violent crimes are up midway through 2016 over the same point last year, reports that come as the country’s levels of bloodshed have become a recurring topic in the presidential campaign.



More than two dozen police agencies say killings in their cities were up at the midyear point, in some cases outpacing their 2015 homicide counts by dozens of deaths, according to statistics released Monday. Much of this violence is continuing in the same places that also saw violence also increase last year, as most cities with higher homicide totals for the first half of 2016 also reported more killings for all of 2015.

It is an indisputable fact that crime increased in 2015. There’s also evidence that crime may be higher yet in 2016. But rather than evaluating the actual claim that Trump made (“crime is rising”), Politifact chose to critique the claim it wished Trump made (“crime is higher today than it was 20 years ago”).

Apparently unbeknownst to Politifact, it is possible to craft a perfectly accurate sentence in which an uptick in crime is placed in context with multi-year crime trends: crime is rising, but it is still far lower than it was 20 years ago. Or: While crime clearly increased in 2015, it’s unclear if that uptick was merely a blip or whether it will be the beginning of a new upward trend. Or maybe: Violent crime increased across the board in 2015, but not enough to erase significant decreases over the last two decades. That is how an organization interested in accuracy, rather than partisan polemics, would have approached the issue.

Politifact could have rated Trump’s claim as completely true and then added historical context about the overall trend in crime. Yes, crime is on the rise according to the most recent nationwide data available, but on the whole the nation is far safer than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Why would that be so hard to admit?

Politifact can’t admit that Donald Trump was right about something because because Politifact’s agenda is not fact-checking. Politifact is not a fact-checker. It is an implication-checker. If it doesn’t like a claim’s implications, it decides that the claim is false. Even when presented with irrefutable evidence that its own claims were inaccurate, Politifact stuck its fingers in its years and screamed, “PANTS ON FIRE!” It has done this time and time again.

That’s right: Politifact blatantly refused to retract its “pants on fire” rating, even though multiple crime data experts contacted the organization to explain why Politifact was completely wrong. And why did Politifact ignore the evidence and the experts on this particular issue?

According to Politifact, the editors refused to retract their wildly inaccurate rating because they disapprove of “Trump’s sweeping rhetoric about a nation in decline.” That statement right there proves that Politifact was never actually interested in evaluating Trump’s simple claim that “crime is rising.” Politifact’s goal was to smear Trump for saying true things that had implications of which Politifact didn’t approve.

The new FBI data prove that Trump was 100 correct, and that Politifact was 100 percent wrong. Crime is rising in the U.S., even if it still happens to be lower today than it was in the 1990’s. Crime in 2015 was higher than it was in 2014. These are indisputable facts, and they remain indisputable facts regardless of how you happen to feel about Donald Trump.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/27/donald-trump-right-crime-increased-significantly-2015/,2016-09-27
How Black Lives Matter-Style Activism Is Ruining America,"When the Ferguson riots broke out in 2014, the nation was shocked and alarmed. The press gave the event wall-to-wall coverage for a week. For young people this was fairly new territory, while older people had flashbacks to the Los Angeles riots of 1992, or even (if they were old enough) the Watts riots of 1965. These were alarming connections. Weren’t we past all this stuff?

The Baltimore riots in 2015 were a bit less shocking. This was a movie we’d all just seen. By the time we got to Charlotte, the element of surprise had been completely lost. Deadly race riots are starting to take on the banality of “same old, same old.” I’ve actually started looking forward to winter as a less riot-friendly season. It’s pretty depressing that we’ve reached the point where that line of thought makes sense.

Here’s the real tragedy of Ferguson, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Charlotte, and any other cities that haven’t yet been sacked but soon may be. Taken in themselves, the problems that drive this frustration are reasonably soluble. Unfortunately, just about everyone seems to prefer narrative-peddling to problem-solving. It’s easier and more fun.

As we all double down on our rightness, soluble problems morph into massive, mangled webs of anger and angst, and American cities go on burning.

America Is Not Drowning in Crime

Here’s the basic reality. Crime rates in America have gone down quite a bit since the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, we still have relatively high rates of violent crime compared to other Western nations, and our murder rate has ticked up a bit over the past year.

Crime is again bubbling up as a domestic concern for ordinary American voters. At the first presidential debate, Donald Trump gave a mostly incoherent speech on crime, in which he took care to use the words “law” and “order” repeatedly, obviously signaling that he wishes to inherit the mantle of law-and-order conservatism. Those memes had been fading from the conservative electoral playbook, so Trump’s ham-fisted attempts at reviving them are worthy of comment.

Most people fail to understand that crime is quite a localized problem in America. There are places where murder is rampant, and places where it’s shocking and rare. That’s partly related to gangs, which are turf-oriented such that you pretty much know where to find them.

Actual gang murders are just one piece of the puzzle, though. In some neighborhoods, the social fabric has decayed, and bad blood between police and residents goes back many years. Solving crimes is challenging when residents are afraid of being labeled “snitches.” Cops get frustrated, and some start bending the rules. Relations deteriorate further.

It’s understandable that residents of these neighborhoods are frustrated. It’s tough to grow up in a place where you regularly feel unsafe. It’s hard feeling that you (or your kids) are seen as suspicious every time you wear a hoodie or have something bulky in your coat pocket.

Still, we should understand that this is not most of America. We’ve heard a lot lately about elite “bubble dwellers” who can’t understand the problems of ordinary people, but with respect to violent crime, it might be more accurate to see these sorts of neighborhoods as “bubbled.” Crime is still a problem in America, but it isn’t the sort of pervasive problem that’s driving people into gated-community islands of safety. In most places, our police are doing a pretty good job.

Crime Control Problems Are Soluble

That’s the first piece of good news. The second is that we’ve made significant advances in crime control over the past 20 years. Research and data analysis have given us vastly improved analytics, enabling us to direct resources to criminal hot spots. Better surveillance and communication reduces response times. Advances are also being made in training methods that help police to respond more appropriately to addicts, juveniles, and the mentally ill.

In many areas, improved transparency for police departments is also warranted. Unions and corrupt officials have enabled bad policing practices to become entrenched especially in many urban areas that have for decades been under near-exclusive Democratic control. In some cities (most obviously Chicago), law enforcement needs some restructuring and rebranding. But even in Chicago, substantial improvement should be possible, if we could think of the problem in terms of police transparency and crime control.

Unfortunately, it’s hard to fix anything in America today, when reform efforts are so easily hijacked by nefarious national narratives.

A Problem of Misdiagnosis

Americans have a narrative problem. We just like our narratives way, way too much. We’re starting to fall prey to narrative-induced paralysis.

This problem has fairly deep historical roots, especially for the black community. Looking at our list of American heroes, what sorts of people do we find? In general, our most-prized moral exemplars are prophetic figures whose main social contribution was to speak truth to power.

Martin Luther King Jr. never had much of a head for policy, but he was a genius at making a moral point. In a similar mold, we lavish admiration on Mahatma Ghandi, the suffragettes, and heartstring-pulling writers like Upton Sinclair, W.E.B. DuBois, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Americans just love our awareness-raisers. We like them enough that we’re even sometimes willing to forgive certain lapses from Ghandi’s and King’s non-violent protest model.

In some cases, awareness-raisers really are heroic. (Jesus Christ is my personal favorite, although Elijah was also pretty great.) At other times, our obsession with awareness may actually blind us to the real solutions. Not every problem comes back to a widespread deficiency of human concern.

What if most Americans already agree that “black lives matter”? What if our policing and crime-control problems actually call for some prudent policy adjustments, and not a nationwide lifting of hearts and minds? High-minded but ineffective solutions can often be worse than useless insofar as they deter people from focusing on what really needs to be done. If a friend has a headache, you offer him an aspirin first, not a Bible.

Black Lives Matter is currently giving us a heartbreaking tutorial in the consequences of misapplied social activism. Just a few months ago we could argue about the reality of “the Ferguson effect,” but now we seem to be hurtling forward to a point where every black victim of a police shooting is potentially seen as the next Rodney King. It’s no longer necessary to wait for the verdict, or even for basic forensic analysis. Hearsay is enough to start the looting.

Needless to say, these developments are creating an extreme crime control challenge for city officials. No cop wants his city to be the next Ferguson. But how can police chiefs send cops into high-crime neighborhoods without giving them leave to defend themselves against potentially deadly attacks? The longer-term consequences of that kind of undisciplined “demonstration” will be more gang-controlled neighborhoods, and more black deaths.

Meanwhile, if Black Lives Matter goes on demonstrating its disdain for relevant facts and procedures, more and more Americans will lose sympathy for the cause. Can a narrative kill you? In a way, maybe it can.

Leashing Our Unruly Narratives

I’m not trying to blame everything on liberals. Conservatives have narrative problems too. We have a bad habit of deflecting any criticisms of our justice system by playing the “Daniel Patrick Moynihan” card. Rather than discuss seriously whether our police, courts, or correctional policies would benefit from reforms, we’d prefer to talk about the collapse of the family and how this is mostly the fault of liberals and the welfare state.

We could buy ourselves some credibility by taking an interest in shorter-term solutions for struggling neighborhoods.

This all makes perfect sense when you understand the twin policy arcs of the late twentieth century, along with their corresponding political narratives. Liberals responded to poverty and social decay with a spate of entitlement programs, while conservatives promoted aggressive law enforcement. Both approaches had some drawbacks (not necessarily equally serious), but naturally everybody prefers to discuss where the other guy fell short.

Moynihan’s argument that the welfare state would further destabilize the black family, thus locking millions in a crippling cycle of poverty and dysfunction, looks awfully prescient in hindsight. That’s somewhat beside the point, though, for addressing immediate crime-control problems. We’re not going to re-instill the traditional family model overnight. When conservatives talk about Moynihan in the wake of a controversial police shooting, liberals (understandably) read that as, “Nothing can actually be done here, but just so you know, this is all your fault.”

Moynihan’s analysis can be mostly true without being the most relevant truth for every circumstance. We could buy ourselves some credibility by taking an interest in shorter-term solutions for struggling neighborhoods. It’s easier to give lectures on family values when you’re already involved in the neighborhoods that need to hear them.

There are times when activism and high-minded moralizing really are effective catalysts for positive change. There are other times when the sermonizing just wastes time and energy that could be put into building things that work. Let’s fire the activists, and start hiring more good cops.

Thank Truman Capote For Shows Like ‘Making A Murderer’,"Today is Truman Capote’s 92nd birthday, and this year marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of his great American crime novel, In Cold Blood. The small-statured and sensational Capote, with his trademark high-pitched voice, was unlike any other authors, playwrights, or actors of his time. His “child” as he called it, In Cold Blood, has proved to be a timeless tragedy and the type of story that audiences are still obsessed with today.

In Cold Blood is arguably the pioneering story that paved the way for a genre that’s popularity has surged in the twenty-first century: true crime. With the mass following of cold-case podcasts like “Serial” from “This American Life” and documentary series like “Making a Murderer” or “The Case of: Jon Benet Ramsey,” audiences are still mesmerized by the type of non-fiction, investigative story that Capote first wrote about 50 years ago.

On November 16, 1959, Capote spotted a small story in the New York Times, no more than an inch or two long, headlined “Wealthy Farmer, 3 of Family Slain.” That news story was the only inspiration he needed to pack up and head to Holcomb, Kansas—the small farming town that became the setting of one of America’s most famous crimes.

The High Wheat Plains of Western Kansas

The story of the Clutter Family, as Capote tells it, begins with the quirky personalities and interests of a mostly normal, all-American family, and ends in a quadruple homicide committed by two ex-convicts: Dick Hickock and Perry Smith. In Cold Blood traces every clue and plausible murder theory, then details the story of Hickock’s and Smith’s arrest, trial, years on death row, and eventual execution.

Capote’s research would result in a four-part series in The New Yorker and a completed novel published in 1966. He interviewed neighbors, residents, and detectives, took 8,000 pages of notes, and eventually became so invested in the crime and the criminals that he became part of the story. Thus, the birth of New Journalism.

In an interview after the book was published, Capote told the New York Times, “It seemed to me that journalism, reportage, could be forced to yield a serious new art form: the ‘nonfiction novel,’ as I thought of it.” Capote did not use any recording devices. It is said that he instead memorized the case and its dialogues. He captured the true nature of not just the people of Holcomb, but the murderers, too. He visited, interviewed, and kept in touch with Hickock and Smith as inmates — so much so that he developed relationships with them and wrote about their life stories.

This is how is how his writing came out as a novel, not a piece of reporting. This new form of journalism that required not an altering of the facts, but the addition of the author’s imagination, was one that some also attribute to writers like Tom Wolfe, Joan Didion, and Gay Talese. (Of course, in the typical high-drama Capote fashion, he would later disagree that his novel could not be categorized in any genre. His opinion here was that nothing like In Cold Blood existed in the history of journalism.)

Why Are We so Obsessed with Crime?

I don’t think I can (or should) make the case that popular crime shows and the cable networks devoted to true-crime programming can be categorized as New Journalism. Didion would surely be rolling in her grave at that thought. But there is something to be said for rejecting local news packages or black and white newspaper reports, and a desire for a more artistic telling.

Maybe it’s doesn’t stop at wanting something more aesthetically appealing. Maybe there is also a desire for a different type of story. Audiences have lost a certain amount of trust in the reporters, anchors, and police press conferences. They want someone else to dig into the story and add some of his own imagination of what could have happened.

They don’t care if they know it’s all a show for ratings. They are intrigued by the killers’ back story and other conspiracy plot lines, no matter what the police reports originally said. We want to hear from someone like Capote, a short, squealing man from Manhattan who had no business being in Kansas, and what he has to say about the look in the murderer’s eyes.

In Cold Blood set the precedent for taking the typical news story, a few quick lines about the facts we know, and turning over every rock to unveil stories about humans and the calamity that surround us.

In an eerily pertinent 1966 New York Times book review of In Cold Blood, literary critic Conrad Knickerbocker discussed the importance of this written work in an electronic age: “Tape and film, documentaries, instant news, have sensitized us to the glare of surfaces and close-ups. He gratifies our electronically induced appetite for massive quantities of detail, but at the same time, like an ironic magician, he shows that appearances are nothing.”

Perhaps, in a world where “sensitized” is an understatement for our relationship with screens, Capote can induce your appetite for both cold-blooded killer tales and the written word. Happy birthday, Mr. Capote.

The United Nations Call For U.S. Reparations Is Completely Whack,"A United Nations team called the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent conducted a 10-day mission to the United States this past January to investigate the state of black people in our country. The team did not just decide to come on their own; they were invited by “the government of the United States,” presumably at the behest of President Obama. Naturally, as a black person I was keenly interested in their findings.

The members of the UN team were Mireille Fanon-Mendès-France, Sabelo Gumedze, and Ricardo Sunga III. Does that first name sound familiar? Fanon-Mendès-France is the daughter of the famous Marxist, anti-colonialist, far-left activist Frantz Fanon. Some might see similarities between his philosophy and that of President Obama, but I’ll leave that to readers.

During their week and a half visit, the working group visited New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, Baltimore, and Jackson, Mississippi, meeting with various local government bodies and activist groups. They also met with the White House and the Congressional Black Caucus. Many of their meetings were coordinated by the U.S. Human Rights Network, a conglomeration of leftist activist groups, as well as the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, an organ of the State Department engaged in left-leaning causes and headed by a Democrat and Obama appointee.

As the final product of their U.S. travels, the working group has released a report with their findings and recommendations. Sadly, it fails to mention much, and what it does mention is largely wrong. I’ll highlight three of the report’s findings that are problematic, three things they failed to find, and then generally why the report is misguided.

What’s Wrong with the Findings

Firstly: The panel argues “The dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion among the United States population. Hate crime groups, including white supremacist terror groups, are still active in the United States, targeting African Americans, as was seen in the attack at a church in Charleston in 2015.”

The Charleston shooting was not carried out by a white supremacist group. It was carried out by a lone crazed maniac. Also, those influenced by or sympathetic to Black Lives Matter have called for and actually carried out police officer killings.

The Dallas sniper who murdered five police officers told negotiators “he was upset about Black Lives Matter. He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” A black Dallas police officer is even filing a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter for inciting violence against police officers. Further, Black Lives Matter supporters have rioted and destroyed property in Charlotte, North Carolina, and have called for killing white people. So why no mention of their hateful, racist ideology?

Secondly: The report erroneously elevates incidents of police killings of black people to a serious national problem, when in fact far, far more black people kill each other than do police. In fact, for every one black person killed by a while police officer, 71 black people are killed by another black person.

Also, the data shows that blacks are killed by the police in proportion to the rate at which they commit crime, meaning the police do not disproportionately target them for violence. The report fails to consider these facts when painting the false picture that out-of-control police are unfairly targeting black people.

Thirdly: The report says we should address today the evil problem of past lynchings. But there are two problems with this. First, white people today are not responsible for lynchings of the past, so making them pay for it is unjust. Secondly, as with incidents of police killing black people, this past problem is dwarfed by black murder. According to Tuskegee University, a total of 4,733 black people were lynched from 1882 to 1959. Yet over the past 35 years, an average of about 9,000 black men have killed each other every single year.

Wrap your head around that. Every single year, black men are killing each other at numbers higher than the total of all of the lynchings that ever happened in the history of the United States.

Here’s What the Report Fails to Mention

The report contains no mention of the fact that 72 percent of black kids are born to single mothers, and that this is a major contributing factor topoverty, crime, and educational outcomes for black Americans. It makes no mention of putting the family back together as a way of improving conditions for black people in America.

The report does not mention that the black murder rate is eight times higher than the white murder rate, and that even though black people are only 14 percent of the population, they are about half of all murderers. Indeed, black people are painted only as victims of crime, not committers of crime with deep family, community, moral, and spiritual dysfunction causing them to be that way.

Although the report makes cursory mention of the “root causes of crime,” the authors never develop this into an argument about methods to stop black people from killing each other.

The report also contains no mention of the deep brokenness in black culture, including: a thug culture that glorifies violence, misogyny, criminal behavior, and incarceration, and is spread by a complicit media through music and pop culture. Nor does it tackle the “acting white” phenomenon, in which black kids’ popularity goes down as their GPA goes up. This means certain segments of black culture actually glorify being dumb and the criminal lifestyle. Any solution to the issues facing black people must address these problems, but they’re totally absent from the UN report.

The report concludes with a long list of recommendations, including a call for reparations for “enslavement and racial discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present.” The problem is that the United States has already spent $22 trillion on the War on Poverty, even though it’s been largely ineffective in eliminating poverty among black people.

Does this not count as reparations? What about other programs, like minority preferences for government contracts? How would one measure how much reparations is enough? And why should white people today have to pay for what happened in 1619? Further, why doesn’t the working group call for involving the black church in the solutions to these problems, since it’s one of the oldest and most influential of institutions in black communities?

Ultimately, although the report was published by the UN, it reads like it was written by Obama, the Congressional Black Caucus, and leftist activist groups. The working group would have more credibility if it included voices other than the far-left, such as churches, think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, and beat police officers who deal with black criminals and witness daily the terror they cause in black communities.

Thankfully, the report is non-binding and its recommendations will not be adopted. But it’s perhaps a sneak peek into the kind of policies that President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats might implement if they had complete control of all branches of government.

We Need To Rethink How We Treat Rapists,"“We are too hard on them,” the man says. He wears a blue button-up shirt tucked into his slacks. He practices law downtown on the 32nd floor of a skyscraper, and we’re talking about a case where he’s helping a man get out of jail and return to his family. The man has been in jail for eight years, and during that time he has missed out on seeing his children grow. Instead, his wife made ends meet. Miraculously, she didn’t divorce him. People said she should, but she didn’t.

The man’s crime was fondling his daughter. That’s right, child abuse. To many, it’s among the worst crimes imaginable. People convicted of this crime aren’t always safe in prison because the inmates will seek vigilante justice. It’s a crime among criminals.

This is a sensitive topic, and I questioned even addressing it. I know people whom this very crime has dramatically affected, people who years later are still struggling to come to terms with what happened to them as a child. There’s really no way to set the emotions aside.

To help, let’s agree to this: We’re not talking about every perpetrator or every situation, just this man and this situation. In this case there was no major injury, no violence; the child was very young, almost unaware. The man confessed to his wife, stopped the fondling, and was back on the right track—until the authorities got involved. Then he was on no track at all. The actual damage from the crime was minimal when compared to the effects on the family of him going to prison for eight years.

Is Sexual Assault the One Unforgiveable Crime?

Still, accepting this, no one learns about a child abuser—we call them pedophiles—and feels the courts are too harsh. We’re more likely to think they should be locked away for good. That is what I believed until this lawyer told me “We are too hard on them.”

This lawyer was not being paid to do the work. It was a pro bono case he took because he knew the family and wanted to help. This lawyer was also himself abused as a child. He’s not speaking from some self-interested place or out of self-deception. There’s no politics in his voice. He’s not saying something to win followers, score points, or impress others. What he says, he believes.

He told me about when he was abused. It was part of his childhood, and he is not ashamed or particularly angry. I could hardly believe it. I have never been abused, but simply the thought of it made me cringe. It felt as close to pure evil as I could imagine. It is perverse to a point that it becomes the thing of nightmares. To me it seemed that one conviction should be enough to lock the perpetrator up for life. And this criminal was getting out before he was even old; that seemed plenty lenient to me.

So how are we too hard on them? The lawyer says we come down so hard on these criminals as a way to deflect our guilt over our own permissiveness. If we draw a clear line, put up big signs, and punish anyone who crosses it, we feel we no longer carry any liability for the crime.

Blaming You Excuses Me

To be clear, he’s not saying victims are at all responsible for these crimes. He doesn’t feel that what happened to him as a child was his or his family’s fault. He’s talking about a larger, broader sort of responsibility—not a my or your responsibility, but an our. He means that the society we create, the values we promote, the people we care for, have an impact.

Criminals are not always born that way. What people do and who they become partially owes to what opportunities they were given and how society influenced them. We are all born with different vulnerabilities, and there is a certain amount of luck that goes into who succeeds and who fails. This lawyer’s point is that sometimes our harsh punishments allows us to ignore our involvement.

The paradox is called “self-licensing.” There have been a lot of experiments exploring this phenomena. In 2011 at the National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan, researchers gave placebo pills to two groups of people. They told the first group the pills were multivitamins with dramatic health benefits. To the second group, they told the truth: the pills were worthless.

The group that thought they were taking health supplements smoked more, exercised less, ate bad food, and were more likely to participate in “hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards.” That’s stuff like casual sex, wild parties, and excessive drinking. By taking a health supplement, people were less likely to be healthy. By doing one good thing, they licensed themselves to do other bad things.

This phenomena has been used to explain why studies have found shoppers at eco-friendly grocery stores were less altruistic than people shopping at conventional stores. It has explained why people who purchase energy-efficient products often end up using more energy, and why some Barack Obama supporters were more likely to express racist views. Malcolm Gladwell has used it to explore how the Royal Academy’s praise of Elizabeth Thompson’s painting allowed them to block her from entering as its first female member.

That’s what the lawyer was getting at. Our punishment of pedophiles licenses us to be sexually promiscuous. We watch violent porn, have casual sex, go to wild parties, and it’s all okay because we really hate pedophiles. They’re the worst. Anyone who does that, we cut him out.

I Make Myself Feel Better By Taking You Down

The same is true for rapists. Largely due to the controversies surrounding Stanford University student Brock Turner, who was convicted of assaulting an unconscious woman, we have all witnessed some particularly vehement examples of contempt for rapists. When we no longer trust the justice system to deliver justice, we learn something about our own concepts of what would be just. The following comments are taken from the BuzzFeed article describing the armed protesters who stood outside Turner’s residence the day he was released from jail.

These comments depict a brutal justice devoid of charity. We’ve made crossing the line bleaker. We’ve added contrast to the picture. But, if the lawyer is right, our righteous indignation might serve as anodyne anointment for everything that remains in bounds. Anything that isn’t quite over the edge, even if it brings you right to the brink.

Because we’ve made the black areas blacker, we feel justified in making the white areas whiter. The line between what is moral and immoral is clearer but also more immediate. Now, you don’t just step across the line, you fall. We’ve terraced morality in order to give ourselves more space to play.

Because we’re harsh on rapists, we don’t have to consider our own responsibility in triggering other people’s vulnerabilities. Because we punish the bad guys, we can ignore our own badness. Just as having a designated driver makes someone more likely to get drunk, hating rapists makes us less likely to question our own lusts, check our own morals, and monitor our own appetites.

There is one clear benefit of separating the crime from the context. We protect the victims from shouldering the blame. This is both noble and necessary. Can’t those of us who are not victims, however, shoulder some of the burden? Is charity necessarily one-sided, or is there a way to find charity for both victims and rapists? And what would that look like?

There But for the Grace of God Go I

Of course, the lawyer isn’t talking about rapists. He’s talking about pedophiles. Even worse. What sympathy do we owe them? In Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure” a judge condemns a man to death, but by the end of the play the judge has committed the very same crime. A nun pleads for the judge to extend mercy, saying, “Go to your bosom; Knock there.” The message is that charity is not so much about condoning other’s actions but admitting our own predispositions towards those very actions. It’s an awareness that it could have been me. That we, ourselves, are implicated in the crime.

It’s an awareness that it could have been me. That we, ourselves, are implicated in the crime.

Perhaps here we are worse than Puritans in our morality. I was surprised to learn that in Puritan communities when a person was convicted of a crime, the town felt they too were somehow responsible. The criminals still went to jail, but the local community baked meals, provided linens, and visited the criminals.

If the laws required capital punishment, the entire town arrived and prayed for the criminals and for themselves—believing that through capital punishment the criminal might find forgiveness and yet be saved. In a way, the criminal’s death was similar to an atonement, offering redemption for the whole village. This was not victim-blaming. It was a realization that we too share responsibility for what our neighbors do. The criminals were punished, the victims protected, and yet charity remained.

That’s a far cry from our sentiments today. We are too hard on rapists in order to be too kind to ourselves. Sure, we’ll push them to the line, but if they fall over, screw them.

Voter Fraud Is Real. Here’s The Proof,"Image Credit Alexandru Nika / Shutterstock

This week, liberals have been repeating their frequent claim that voter fraud doesn’t exist. A recent Salon article argues that “voter fraud just isn’t a problem in Pennsylvania,” despite evidence to the contrary. Another article argues that voter fraud is entirely in the imagination of those who use voter ID laws to deny minorities the right to vote.

Yet as the election approaches, more and more cases of voter fraud are beginning to surface. In Colorado, multiple instances were found of dead people attempting to vote. Stunningly, “a woman named Sara Sosa who died in 2009 cast ballots in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.” In Virginia, it was found that nearly 20 voter applications were turned in under the names of dead people.

In Texas, authorities are investigating criminals who are using the technique of “vote harvesting” to illegally procure votes for their candidates. “Harvesting” is the practice of illegally obtaining the signatures of valid voters in order to vote in their name without their consent for the candidate(s) the criminal supports.

These are just some instances of voter fraud we know about. It would be silly to assume cases that have been discovered are the only cases of fraud. Indeed according to a Pew Charitable Trust report from February 2012, one in eight voter registrations are “significantly inaccurate or no longer valid.” Since there are 146 million Americans registered to vote, this translates to a stunning 18 million invalid voter registrations on the books. Further, “More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters, and approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.” Numbers of this scale obviously provide ripe opportunity for fraud.

Don’t Let Data Contradict My Narrative

Yet in spite of all this, a report by the Brennan Center at New York University claims voter fraud is a myth. It argues that North Carolina, which passed comprehensive measures to prevent voter fraud, “failed to identify even a single individual who has ever been charged with committing in-person voter fraud in North Carolina.” However, this faulty reasoning does not point to the lack of in-person voter fraud, but rather to lack of enforcement mechanisms to identify and prosecute in-person voter fraud.

The science of criminal justice tells us that many crimes go unreported, and the more “victimless” the crime, the more this happens. The fact is, a person attempting to commit voter fraud is very unlikely to be caught, which increases the incentive to commit the crime.

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is a sophisticated, comprehensive effort to catalog “the number and types of crimes not reported to law enforcement authorities.” However, it tends to deal mostly in violent crimes. As complex as the NCVS is, gathering accurate data for unreported victimless crimes such as voter fraud is even harder, since 1) outside of the criminal, no one may know a crime has taken place, and 2) there is no direct victim to report the crime in the first place. Yet we are expected to believe that, unlike violent crime, voter fraud is limited only to the cases that are actually reported and prosecuted? This is a senseless position.

Further, the Brennan Center report argues that because prosecutor Kris Kobach’s review of 84 million votes cast in 22 states found only 14 instances of fraud referred for prosecution (which amounts to a 0.00000017 percent fraud rate), voter fraud is so statistically small that it’s a non-issue. Let’s follow this logic. Does the fact that 109 people were cited for jaywalking in Seattle in 2009 mean that only 109 people jaywalked in Seattle that year? Does the fact that 103,733 people were cited for driving without a seatbelt in Tennessee in 2015 mean that only that many people were driving without seatbelt in Tennessee in 2015?

Absolutely not. This can be proven easily because in 2014, the previous year, only 29,470 people were cited. The disparity is largely due to increased enforcement efforts in 2015. In other words, increasing enforcement of the crime revealed a much larger number of people committing the crime.

The exact same is true for voter fraud. We have no reason to believe that the low number of prosecutions means only that exact amount of voter fraud is happening. Rather, it could mean a lack of enforcement is failing to reveal the bulk of the violations that are occurring. Thus, as with many types of crimes, especially victimless crimes, the real number of cases is likely significantly higher than the number reported.

How to Effectively Target Voter Fraud

So now that we know voter fraud is a serious issue, what are some solutions to this problem? States like Michigan have Poll Challenger programs, where observers from both parties may be present at voter check-in tables at precincts. They check each voter’s ID against a database of registered voters for that precinct to ensure the person attempting to vote is actually legally qualified to vote in that precinct. If there’s a discrepancy, the poll challenger may officially challenge the ballot. Other states should implement similar programs.

States should sponsor initiatives to remove dead voters and correct the registrations of people registered in multiple states (make them choose just one state). Since many local jurisdictions are reluctant to clean their voter rolls, federal or state oversight with teeth may be necessary.

Further, voter ID laws, such as the one implemented by North Carolina, but (wrongly) struck down by three liberal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit— one appointed by Bill Clinton and the other two appointed by President Obama—are needed to ensure there’s no cheating with votes. States should continue to press the issue regardless of recent setbacks by liberal activist judges.

Finally, some have claimed that strong voter ID laws are racist, because they disproportionately impact minorities and would prevent minorities from voting. As a black person, I’m naturally interested in this claim. Thankfully, it turns out to be false. The Heritage Foundation has shown that black voter turnout actually increased after North Carolina passed its voter ID law.

Not only was the claimed negative outcome false, but the reasoning was faulty as well. The fact that the law disproportionately impacts minorities does not mean that it is discriminatory. It means, unfortunately, that fewer minorities are in compliance with common-sense safeguards to protect the integrity of our elections (i.e., having a driver’s license or photo ID).

To mitigate this concern, states can offer a service that will take people without valid ID to their local government office to apply for proper ID, free of charge. Users could schedule the pickup with their smartphone or a phone call. That way there will be as few barriers as possible to those who want to vote and are capable of obtaining a valid ID, but cannot due to transportation concerns (a reason often given by those who claim voter ID laws hurt minorities).

So let us not believe false claims that voter fraud doesn’t exist. It’s real, and we must work to stop it, while making sure those who are eligible to vote but without proper ID are accommodated fairly.

"Catholics Should Condemn Hillary’s Crimes, Not Staffers’ Email Comments","Forgive me if I do not join the chorus calling for John Podesta’s resignation or—drumroll—a pro-forma apology from Hillary Clinton for derisive comments by her staffers about Catholics.

Hillary Clinton is corrupt to the marrow. She is guilty of actual crimes. But our shepherds avert their eyes from the squalor of Hillary Clinton’s behavior in office and her policy proposals. Instead, they take aim at the thought crimes of her campaign team.

Like Lewis Carroll’s Caterpillar, our bishops puff away on their—federally funded—hookahs, “taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.” Then along come leaked emails circulated privately among high-level members of Clinton’s staff. Suddenly, these bravehearts take the hookah out of their mouths, and rear themselves upright to fume grandly over a red herring.

It’s all theater. This burst of ecclesial umbrage is a practical move in public relations terms. It permits otherwise quiescent—and cooperative—shepherds to brandish credentials as spear-carriers for the church. In reality, however, they’ve crippled that role by managing refugee resettlement programs which garner hundreds of millions of federal dollars. In effect, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) functions as a government contractor. And lobbyist.

Reluctant to jeopardize state funding, our bishops go full throttle to endorse mass migration and open borders. This puts them eagerly in Hillary’s camp. At the same time, they are obliged to reject abortion, an inviolable duty that puts them in solid opposition to Hillary. They are caught, like Buridan’s ass, between two equally compelling bales of hay.

So they punt. They clamor for apology from an unscrupulous politician whose concession—if one were to come—would be meaningless. But the gesture will have been made. And the funds will keep flowing.

At play among the powers and principalities, our bishops know that their umbrage is anticipated, fully expected in the wake of WikiLeak’s disclosures. They also know their complaint has as much impact on political conduct as a wet snowflake that melts as soon as it lands. But making a show of grievance is the proper thing to do, if only for image’s sake. All political animals tolerate the protocols of image maintenance. They have to—they all use them.

Suppose the hustler candidate decides it is in her interest to issue an apology. What then? On what grounds should Catholics give a tinker’s damn? Are Catholic feelings so tender—and Catholics so easily stroked and manipulated—that they will be mollified by a Clintonian mea culpa, and then gladly pull the lever for a militant abortion evangelist?

If that were to happen, our apology-seekers would have much to answer for. Catholics are already leaning heavily toward Hillary in the polls. We can thank our bishops—and their irresponsible sentimentalizing of migration issues—for the tilt.

Did any of our now-incensed bishops go public with denunciations of Clinton’s declared hostility to the Hyde Amendment? Or to the Affordable Care Act’s end run around that amendment via Medicaid? Even now, on the eve of the election, they are unwilling to censure Clinton by name for her catastrophic decision-making and lethal policy preferences.

In the light of the USCCB’s own sympathies and derelictions, there is something oddly comic about these calls for atonement. However much her staffers reflect Clinton’s attitudes, it was still staff who made the offending remarks. They also made them privately. By contrast, Archbishop Charles Chaput called Clinton “a scheming liar” in public. By the logic at work in this tempest, Clinton is within her rights to demand apology from the archbishop. But she is too smart to do it.

It would have been refreshing if the USCCB had responded more along the following lines.

We are grateful to WikiLeaks for bringing to light ugly attitudes we have long suspected but were reluctant to acknowledge.

A hearty thank you is due John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri. Without meaning to, they did us all a mitzvah. Their contempt reminds us of something we tend to forget: federal monies get us by the throat. The church is most free to be herself when she refuses the shackles of the state. Mr. Podesta and Ms. Palmieri prompt us to remember that the Catholic Church is no stranger to anti-Catholic bigotry. It has survived it before, and will again. What it cannot survive is a pact with the devil.

Permit us to add: John, Jennifer—you are Catholics, yes? Why don’t you stop by for coffee after Mass one of these Sundays? We’d be delighted to see you. It would be lovely to talk over fresh scones and brioches.

And you, Julian. Sorry you can’t be with us. For this once, we are in your debt. Watch your back, son. Godspeed.

Why I Won’t Apologize For Loving Chicago,"Maybe you’ve seen the headlines. “Chicago Hits 500 Homicides for 2016 After Deadly Labor Day Weekend,” reported USA Today. The Chicago Tribune followed up shortly after: “Chicago Passes Another Grim Milestone: More Than 3000 Shot This Year.” Then the bombshell: “Chicago Has Had More Murders Than New York and L.A. Combined This Year.” That was only by October.

It’s all true. My city — the city I love — is crime-infested. From the outside it looks like the Wild West, and from the inside it’s not always better. The South and West Sides, where most of the crime hotspots are, can be a living Hell. What kind of city is so out of control that a nine-year-old can be targeted for a revenge killing? What kind of city lets its poorest residents rot in food deserts, job deserts, and dire poverty? Chicago, of course.

I know what non-Chicagoans think: what a hellhole. The mental imagery the press has painted leads one to think of Chicago as a giant, dilapidated, falling-apart city on the verge of imploding. Guns must be everywhere, and if you aren’t careful you’ll wind up dead. But let me make it clear: that’s the furthest thing from the truth. Chicago’s crime doesn’t define the city, and the city isn’t in the shape outsiders assume it is.

You’ve Not Heard the Whole Story about Chicago

Let me tell you about Chicago. We have the most beautiful cityscape in the country. Lake Michigan is to the east, suburbia is to the west, and everything in between is urban, with one of the most recognizable and beautiful skylines in the country. The Sears (now Willis) Tower, John Hancock, CNA Building, Aon Center, and others make Chicago instantly recognizable to anyone even marginally acquainted with the city.

Our cultural institutions are unique in America because of their permanence and impact on the culture writ large. Chicago, for instance, is the only city outside New York to have a permanent “Hamilton” production (and before that we had “Wicked” and “Book of Mormon,” among others). Our comedy scene is what made “Saturday Night Live” funny. Our opera and symphony orchestra are among the best in the world.

Our newspapers, especially the Tribune, have played integral parts in American history. Our architecture is a “living museum” because of the variety of styles and schools that call Chicago home. Our universities, especially the University of Chicago, are on par with East Coast Ivy League schools, and in some cases exceed them.

Chicago’s neighborhoods have a spunk to them that is different from other cities’ neighborhoods. This point is difficult to understate. They are so defined that they’re almost walled off from each other, which can be both good and bad. But they have character, and in a lot of cases they feel like cities within the city.

Lincoln Square feels like a European main street with a distinctively Chicago vibe. Bridgeport is so blue-collar it you’ll think you’re back in the industrial 1950s and ‘60s. Chinatown is on par with San Francisco’s, and ours is doing better than most across the country. Behind every neighborhood is a certain feel — a Midwestern one.

Chicago: It’s the People

But this isn’t a competition. If it was, Chicago would lose to New York every time (we’re the Second City for a reason). Chicago is special not because of the architecture, schools, or orchestras, although those all contribute to our uniqueness. Chicago is special because of the people who live here. Despite the crime, despite the fiscal mess, despite the corruption, Chicagoans never go down for the count.

Carl Sandburg’s famous poem “Chicago” describes the city thusly:

Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth,

Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs,

Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle,

Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his ribs the heart of the people,

Laughing!

This, too, is a truth of Chicago. Chicago doesn’t moan about its situation. The Chicagoans I see are always looking for ways to improve their community and make their city safe, with or without the help of politicians. These days, it’s mostly without the politicians.

For example, look at the Englewood “Mothers Against Senseless Killings” (MASK), or their other well-known name: the “Army of Moms.” It is what it sounds like. An “army” of community mothers patrols Englewood, one of Chicago’s most dangerous neighborhoods, day and night to curb violence.

When they go out, they’re largely successful. Shootings on the blocks they patrol are almost nonexistent, which is eye-popping given the area. The purpose of MASK is to create a community where one may not exist. In a DNAinfo Chicago interview from August, MASK founder and Englewood native Tamar Manasseh explained the rationale behind the group: “The theory is that if you build community, violence stops. It’s not necessarily saying ‘Put the guns down.’ It’s about giving people a reason to put the guns down. And if there are 100 people out here on the corner eating, who going to come through here shooting?”

We Care About Our Neighborhoods

The sense of community that Manasseh speaks about is the backbone of Chicago. Another group is also working to connect the city and break down the walls that neighborhoods often form around themselves. My Block, My Hood, My City (M3 for short) takes teenagers from low-income neighborhoods and puts them into areas they normally wouldn’t go. M3 calls it an “exploration,” and that’s pretty accurate.

One of the first explorations the group did was taking teenagers from Roseland and North Lawndale — two high-crime, high-poverty South Side communities — and visiting Wicker Park, the hip artsy neighborhood of the city that still has some “grunge” to it. That exploration and others have been successful despite not having much funding or city-sanctioned support.

There are more examples. Becoming a Man (BAM) is another Chicago community organization that targets at-risk young men from low-income, high-poverty neighborhoods and provides mentorship opportunities to keep them off the streets, away from crime, and focused on school. BAM currently mentors approximately 4,000 young men in the city, but Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently announced that he wants to help expand the program, and other programs, to be able to mentor the 7,200 young men from eighth through tenth grades who live in the 20 most crime-heavy neighborhoods.

MASK, M3, and BAM are just three of the dozens, perhaps hundreds, of mentorship and community organizations in the city that come from the people, not the politicians. That’s what makes Chicago great. The fact that Chicagoans value community, and actively work to improve it, is what makes the city special.

Our cultural institutions help, of course. But there’s more to a city than nice museums and college campuses. Many people who live in Englewood, Roseland, and North Lawndale probably don’t care much about “Hamilton.” But they do care that there’s someone around the corner looking out for their children and working against the tide to break the cycle of crime.

Chicago isn’t a perfect city. No one is saying it is. But those who rip Chicago because of the headlines they see do a disservice to the city and to themselves. Chicago is beautiful in spite of itself, and nothing the critics say will change that.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/05/wont-apologize-loving-chicago/,2016-11-05
Why The 9 States With Pot On The Ballot Shouldn’t Legalize It,"In 2012, my fellow Coloradans thought it would be a good idea to legalize the sale of so-called medical marijuana in our state. Lefty billionaire George Soros helped get it on the ballot to get the Cheech and Chong vote to the polls to help re-elect Barack Obama.

Those who proposed it as a good idea made all kinds of wonderful promises about how it would improve our already marvelous state. The same promises are being made in the nine states that will be voting on the issue on Tuesday.

It seems reasonable for these voters to ask how these grand promises have worked out in real life here in the Rocky Mountain State. All around the Internet, you can find “fact sheets” that make claims about how wonderful legal pot has been to our communities: Lower crime, fewer drug arrests, decreases in traffic fatalities, and higher tax revenues. Government data tells a very different story, however.

As a citizen of 20 years here, seeing the effects on my community and neighbors, I don’t see much benefit and do see a great deal of serious harm. We live in a very different state than we did before 2012. Let me give you just a few facts.

‘Just for Medicinal Purposes’ Is a Bait ‘n Switch: If they are promising you legalization for medical marijuana only, what they really mean is medical marijuana will be first. Recreational will follow like the coal car behind the locomotive engine. This linkage only took one year for us.

Pot Arrests Aren’t Gone: We hear all about how arrests for possession have dropped dramatically. Of course they did. It’s legal. But these arrests were only cut by just less than half, which is curious. Why didn’t the arrests drop more? Legalization didn’t fix the illegal possession issue, as we will see below. It has brought more serious problems.

Now for Serious and Unexpected Concerns

Industry Growth: PotGuide.com happily boasts “there are more dispensaries in Colorado than Starbucks, McDonald’s and 7-Elevens combined — and the numbers keep growing.” We even have one-stop gas and grass stores. We have warehouse-type stores where growers come and buy the materials they need for their agricultural pursuits. It’s a totally full-blown industry here.

Creeping into Our Kids’ Schools: According to the Colorado Department of Public Safety, of all misdemeanor pot-related offenses in public locations, the greatest numeric increase is around elementary/secondary schools, rising 400% in 2014 alone (see Table 4).

Student Use: Legalization has brought marked increases in pot usage among high school students. The percentage of Colorado teens reporting usage in the last 30 days increased 19 percent from 2012 to 2014. The same measure saw a 4 percent decrease across the United States (see Figure 25).

Organized Crime Still Runs a Black Market: Legalization was supposed to have removed the scourge of the black market altogether, one of the advocates’ most repeated promises. However, charges for distribution under the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act relating to the marijuana trade increased 344 percent from 2012 to 2015 (see Table 5).

Additionally, the Denver police department is struggling under a 900 percent increase in “the unlawful cultivation and manufacture of marijuana and marijuana concentrate” as well as a 99 percent increase in the unlawful distribution of these two substances. They have seen an increase of 3,424 percent in the quantity of pot seized in the average arrest.

It’s basic economics. If one group is selling something for one price, another will come in under them and sell it for a lower price. This is what the pot black market does. It’s naïve to think it will go away.

Public Consumption: The Denver District Attorney circulated a public letter from his office last month explaining that unlawful public consumption of marijuana has increased more than 300 percent per year since Coloradans legalized recreational pot.

Traffic Deaths: This DA also reported that traffic deaths related to marijuana increased 48 percent the first year it was legal. The rate of driving under the influence of marijuana increased 121 percent in Denver from 2013 to 2015.

Emergency Room Traffic: The same letter states that marijuana-related emergency room visits increased 49 percent and related calls to poison control centers increased 100 percent.

Hospitalization: The rate of citizens hospitalized for any kind of marijuana exposure increased 68 percent from 2013 to 2015 throughout the state.

Car Thefts: The DA’s office finds that motor vehicle thefts increased 28 percent in Denver alone in 2015.

General Crime: In 2015, crime has risen notably in every neighborhood in Denver. Across the state, increases in marijuana-related crime from 2012-2015 are as follows (see Table 6):

Assault: 100 percent increase

Robbery: 21 percent increase

Burglary: 40 percent increase

Miscellaneous crime: 50 percent increase

Property Rentals: Another huge problem for owners of rental properties is renting to seemingly nice tenants and later finding the tenants have been using the basement for massive pot grows. Often these homes are totally destroyed by mold, extensive water damage from extensive hydration, terrific odors from the growing plants that seep permanently into the structure of the home, and extensive damage to poorly re-worked electrical systems for necessary lighting, not to mention the questionable folks regularly tramping in and out of the home every day.

Hundreds of these homeowners throughout the state have found their life’s investment totally trashed because their insurance doesn’t cover such damage.

Legalizing marijuana has had a marked and highly noticeable effect on our beautiful state. It certainly has not made ours a better state. All one needs to do is live here for a few months and observe what’s going on in the neighborhood to see how it’s changing.

See those next to you on the road partaking in the magic herb as they drive. See the increases in homelessness as people move to our state simply to smoke more pot with no plans for supporting themselves. See the increase in glassy eyes in the grocery stores, even among moms and dads with their small children in tow. See the businesses leaving our state because they can’t find workers who don’t come to work stoned.

If you are thinking legalization might be a good idea for your state, come spend some time with us first. You’ll see.

"Although They’re Guilty, Acquiting Ammon Bundy’s Crew Was Right","The acquittal late last month of men charged with occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge launched discussions of jury nullification and its place in the American legal system.

That’s an important discussion, but it does not explain everything at work in that trial. It took a unique combination of distrust, arrogance, and prosecutorial blunders to lead the Malheur occupiers to get away with the crimes of which they, by any objective standard, are clearly guilty.

Occupy from the Left, not the Right

The facts of the case looked like a slam-dunk for prosecutors. Twenty-seven men, led by Ammon Bundy and calling themselves the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, took possession of the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon. Their actions were well-publicized and recorded, and clearly ran afoul of several federal laws.

They were charged with violating a variety of offenses—nearly everything is a crime if you do it on federal property—including conspiracy to intimidate federal workers, possession of firearms in federal facilities, and use of a firearm in a crime of violence.

These are serious crimes, but the government had plenty of evidence. Bundy and his crew made no effort to hide their activities, although they had several bizarre legal theories about why they had the right to do them. Moreover, federal prosecutors have a pretty good record of getting their men: the vast majority of federal trials end in a conviction. So, on October 27, when the jury in the main trial produced a not-guilty verdict, it provoked considerable outrage in some quarters, especially on the Left.

Their rage is both cynical and unsurprising. From a segment of society that typically sides with the defendant, vehement opposition to the occupiers is ridiculous. From people who supported Occupy Wall Street and honor radicals like Bill Ayers with tenure for their terrorism, the sudden lack of sympathy for rebellion is two-faced.

But lefties who condemn the Bundy crew do so not because of their crimes but because, unlike the communists of Zuccotti Park or the Weathermen of the 1960s, the Malheur occupiers’ motives are incomprehensible to them. If the occupiers were Sioux from the Standing Rock Reservation protesting an oil pipeline, their acquittal would be a cause for celebration on the Left. But this occupation is different. They don’t want to undermine an American war effort or fight Big Oil or seize someone else’s bank account—they want less government, and to the Left, that is the scariest rebellion of all.

The Legal Arguments at Play

Bundy and his crew had one major complaint against the U.S. government: that the feds own too much Western land. Whether you agree or not, that the government owns a great deal of land out West is indisputable (look at the government’s own map to see the extent of it).

In the East, we see federal land ownership mostly in the government’s own office buildings and military bases, along with a few national parks and forests preserved because of their natural beauty or historical significance. People in the rural West have a different story, with the majority of some western states’ land being federally owned. It amounts to one-third of the entire country. Because the land is far from urban population centers, most people never see it.

Right or wrong as policy, government land ownership is legal. The federal government has owned land since the birth of the republic, and that power is enshrined in the Constitution (Article I, section 8, clause 17). If the amount of land the feds hold is greater than anything the Founding Fathers imagined, the country itself is vaster than the one they knew. There are many ways in which the federal government stretches the Constitution, but this is not one of them.

Bundy called his group’s occupation an “adverse possession” action against the government. Adverse possession is a way of taking another person’s land that you think is yours by occupying it openly, excluding the legal owner and all other people, and keeping it for a long period of time, usually 21 years. That sounds like a legal theory that expired long ago, but it is actually good law in the United States.

One major caveat: it is not, and has never been, applicable against government property. Adverse possession sounds good in this situation to the kind of folks to whom the sovereign citizen movement sounds good, but it will not hold up in court. The Citizens for Constitutional Freedom—a name that in this election year sounds like a political action committee—have a beef, to be sure, but they do not have much of a case.

What Went Wrong in the Case?

Given the weakness of the occupiers’ legal arguments, the wealth of evidence against them, and the support in Washington for convicting them, how did the jury come back with a not guilty verdict? Many in the press were quick to blame jury nullification.

Jury nullification, as I wrote in April, is the theory that juries have the right to refuse to convict when they believe a conviction would be unjust. Even without the fancy name, the theory has been in practice as long as there have been juries, and it is one of the strengths of the jury system. Legislatures often overreach their constitutional limits, and executives often charge people under laws never meant to apply to them. When confronted with such a case, it is natural for a jury to hesitate before putting someone in jail for years for something they do not believe should even be a crime.

Is that what happened here? Did Bundy and his pals convince a jury of their peers that the government was wrong to stop them from violently occupying federal property? If that was their only strategy, it would have been unlikely to succeed.

But a series of other factors added to the jury’s mistrust of the government, foremost among them being prosecutors’ decisions. As Dan McLaughlin said, “Wherever you see jury nullification in an easy case, prosecutorial overcharging is rarely far behind.” This was certainly such as case.

Choosing to prosecute the group as a conspiracy made things complicated for the government. As Matt Pearce explained in the Los Angeles Times, “The conspiracy count was actually a double-whammy: If the defendants could persuade the jury that no criminal conspiracy had occurred, then they could not be convicted of the accompanying weapons charge — which requires the government to prove the guns had been brought on federal property to commit a crime.”

When that conspiracy charge fell apart, the weapons charge fell with it. But why did the conspiracy charge fail? Surely the men were acting in concert to commit a crime, weren’t they? As Juror 4 explained after the case ended, it was not that simple.

It should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove ‘conspiracy’ in the count itself – and not any form of affirmation of the defense’s various beliefs, actions or aspirations…All 12 agreed that impeding existed, even if as an effect of the occupation…But we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings, rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind. It seemed this basic, high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout.

The same juror wrote, “The air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us, nor was it warranted given their burden of proof.” The government, confident of their case, failed to prove some of the elements of the main charge beyond a reasonable doubt. That’s not jury nullification, that’s the system at work.

We make it difficult to put our fellow Americans behind bars because, like the first proponents of the jury system in medieval England, we fear the power of the criminal justice system will be used unjustly. Despite the many changes to the criminal justice system since then, the right to trial by jury is one that, as William Blackstone wrote in his 1765 “Commentaries on the Laws of England,” “was always so highly esteemed and valued by the people, that no conquest, no change of government, could ever prevail to abolish it.”

In the case against the Malheur occupiers, we see this faith in the jury system affirmed. We should draw strength from this even if we believe that the occupiers were wrong and deserve to be punished. The jury in Oregon lived up to their duty, putting aside their own feelings and opinions about the correctness of the defendants’ activities and limiting their judgment to the law, whether the defendants broke it, and whether the prosecutors proved it. The jury did its job, even if the prosecutors didn’t.

"Donald Trump Should Pardon Hillary Clinton, Not Prosecute Her","As they do every four years, the American people have rendered their verdict. Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States. Whether you regard his election as an endorsement of him and his policies or a rejection of Hillary Clinton and hers, the fact remains that he will occupy the White House for the next four years.

The fact also remains that his defeated opponent, Clinton, remains under a greater cloud of corruption and scandal than any previous presidential candidate. That, combined with the animus generated in the ugliest campaign in recent history, leaves the nation more divided than ever.

Investigations into Hillary, her foundation, and her cronies will continue, especially if Trump makes good on his promise during the campaign to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary. Instead of working to fashion a conservative agenda and come to terms with the rising populism that brought Trump to office, this would distract Republicans with the e-mails, the corrupt foundation, and every other Clinton scandal of the past few years.

They will, that is, unless President Trump instead issues an unconditional pardon to Clinton, and puts the issues to rest. For the good of the country, he should do just that.

Remember Watergate?

Clinton’s crimes, like those of any high-ranking political figure, are often compared to President Richard Nixon’s Watergate scandal. Watergate has become so embedded in our political discourse that the suffix “-gate” is now routinely attached to some noun as shorthand for an episode of political misconduct. Aficionados of past Clinton scandals know this well, and will recall Travelgate, Nannygate, and Troopergate, among others.

The Republican Party needs to figure out where its future lies. They will not do that be fixating on the Clintons.

We should also remember that Watergate completely consumed the nation’s attention and dominated the political conversation in Nixon’s abbreviated second term. Clinton is not president, of course, and will never be, but she still looms large in the national consciousness. Any hope that Congress might pass some meaningful laws will be lost if the conversation is dominated by hearings, depositions, and pontification about Clinton’s various crimes. The Republican Party needs to figure out where its future lies. They will not do that be fixating on the Clintons, who now belong to the past.

For those of us convinced of Clinton’s guilt, the whitewashing and covering-up by President Obama’s Justice Department have been nothing short of enraging. Nearly every Republican politician has uttered something along the lines of “if the person accused of these crimes were anyone but Hillary Clinton, she would have been convicted already.” They are correct, but would her prosecution by Trump’s Justice Department be any better for the nation? If anything, the perception of political persecution would make the charges against her, deserved or not, even more polarizing.

Some Republicans might see it as justice being served, but for many it will feel like reopening a wound for no reason but spite. Also, even if Clinton is charged, a conviction is far from guaranteed. We have seen federal prosecutors unable to prove their case in far easier circumstances. What are the odds that all 12 jurors in a Clinton trial would resist the temptation to let Hillary off the hook?

Only the Guilty Are Pardoned

Let us be clear: she’s going to get away with it. She will not be convicted and, despite the chants of many a Trump rally, no one will lock her up. That may be a miscarriage of justice, it may be a failure of the rule of law, but it is a political reality that is almost unavoidable.

That is not completely a bad thing. As much as conservatives rightfully recoil at Clinton corruption and leftist policies, the prospect of putting a presidential candidate and former secretary of state in an orange jumpsuit should appall people who want to avoid relegating the United States to the status of a tin-pot dictatorship. In this country, we remove our political enemies from office but, outside of a few truly unusual situations, we do not jail them.

President Gerald Ford knew this when he pardoned Nixon. In pardoning the disgraced former chief executive, Ford said that trying Nixon for his crimes would “cause prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation a man who has already paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office of the United States.”

Admittedly, Clinton has paid no such penalty and will not occupy that highest office, but the ruin of her and her husband’s reputations has already begun. Putting her in jail would serve little purpose, even if it were politically possible, and would cause years of anguish and division. What’s more, avoiding jail is not the same as avoiding guilt. No one recalls Nixon’s story and claims he was innocent of all the charges against him (or if they do, it is not because of the pardon). In fact, a pardon has the opposite effect: it lets the accused avoid punishment, but sears his guilt into the public consciousness. After all, an innocent man does not need to be pardoned.

That’s not just a measure of public opinion. As a matter of law, accepting a pardon means admitting guilt. In Burdick v. United States, the Supreme Court held that a pardon “carries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.” If President Trump pardons Clinton and she accepts the pardon, she will be also admitting that she is guilty of at least one federal crime.

Ford paid a price for pardoning Nixon when he narrowly lost the 1976 election. For Trump, the situation is different. In pardoning a political enemy rather than an ally, he could project an image of moderation, conciliation, and far-sighted bipartisanship, all things he lacked during the campaign.

A Pardon Would Not Vindicate Her

For Hillary, on the other hand, a pardon is no vindication. History will show even more clearly that the mark of scandal can never be cleansed from her escutcheon. Her unfavorable rating, already high for a major party’s presidential candidate, will not fall with the remove of years. The chances of getting a Democratic Congress in 2018, not to mention the election of a Democrat to the presidency in 2020, will not be increased by their association with a pardoned felon.

Republicans will be able to turn the page on the past Clinton scandals and concentrate on developing an agenda, either with Trump or without him. The Clintons, and Democrats generally, are at their best when talking about scandals and personalities. Just look at the ads Hillary’s campaign ran in the last few weeks before the election: the focus was on Trump, his scandals, his bizarre statements, and his character generally. It was almost enough to get her elected, despite her own deep flaws as a candidate.

So let’s turn the tables on them, and talk about issues again. Freed from responsibility for investigating years-old shenanigans, Republicans can focus instead on Obamacare’s death spiral, the growing federal deficit, the crushing weight of taxation, constricting regulation, the assault on civil liberties, and every other bad idea in the Democratic platform. They can focus on where the party is going, not where it’s been.

A pardon will not erase the Clintons’ corruption, but with the decks cleared, Trump and conservatives could possibly forge a positive, forward-looking challenge to the stale ideas of the Left. As good as a pardon would be for Clinton’s hopes of staying out of prison, it would be better for her erstwhile political opponents and better still for the average American. President Trump should do the right thing, as President Ford did, and help put our long national nightmare behind us.

"Sorry Democrats, But Americans Are Remarkably Tolerant People","In the midst of this post-election moral panic, the FBI released its 2015 hate crime statistics this week. As you can imagine, newsfeeds were littered with headlines like “New hate crime statistics shows surge against Muslims” and “FBI: Hate crimes against Muslims in US surge 67 percent.” The key words, in case you missed them, were “Muslims” and “surge.”

Though the numbers are from 2015, the report comported neatly with the overwrought reaction that has followed Donald Trump’s surprising victory. We should remain skeptical about this supposed surge in violence by his supporters. Hundreds of stories launched into social media were based on nothing more than accusations. As Reason magazine points out, many have already turned out to be hoaxes.

Notwithstanding all its warts, the FBI’s hate crime report actually offers us a useful reminder: despite the presence of a number of idiotic and violent fellow humans — a plague on all cultures and races, regrettably —Americans are generally tolerant of others in the ways that matter most. When we consider the depth and sprawl of our diversity, it’s pretty clear we are unique to history. Look at any place in the world. When races, faiths, or ethnicities converge there is almost always strife and violence.

I wonder if the average American thinks about his country in that way anymore. I wonder if the average American understands how rare bias-motivated crimes are in his country. Since 9/11 we’ve been warned about an impending violent backlash against Muslims. Yet even with a number of horrific terrorist acts perpetrated by home-grown Islamists, it still hasn’t happened. Of all hate crimes, 19.7 percent were reported as religious bias. Among that group, 51.3 percent were reported as anti-Semitic and 22.2 percent were anti-Muslim. (Also, 17.7 percent were committed against one of the Christian faiths, which the FBI divides into multiple categories.)

A more factual headline might have read, “FBI finds Jews most often the victims of rare faith-based hate crimes in America.” But considering these numbers are pre-alt-right Twitter, that doesn’t fit neatly into the narrative we’re looking for right now.

If reporting bias-crime numbers in overall percentages seems unfair to you, fine. There are around 5 million Jews in the United States and probably around 3.5 million Muslims. It’s difficult to calculate these numbers with precision because, despite progressives’ hard work, Islam is still not a race nor a nationality. But even measured proportionally, Jews were more likely to be victims of hate crimes.

Speaking of percentages: To say there’s been a 67 percent surge in bias crimes against Muslims between 2014 and 2015 is factual but incomplete. To put the number in perspective, let’s remember that in a nation of around 330 million people there were a total of 257 criminal incidents — perpetrated by 228 offenders (not every police department reports hate crimes, but most do) — that officials determined were motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment.

Victims of a hate crime suffer in ways that most of us can’t comprehend. Some of these crimes were deadly serious. Most were misdemeanors, however. Among them were acts like vandalism, simple assault (assault that does involve physical contact), and intimidation. None of these crimes are tolerable, and the perpetrators should be fully prosecuted, shamed, and rejected by all decent Americans.

In any event, these numbers, flawed or not, hardly align with the hysterics we’ve been hearing from the Left these past few years. Hate crimes are a blip when we consider all criminal activity. Even if these numbers were quadrupled, they would still be a blip.

I already know what’s coming: But how about this incident! And how about this one! Look what this one said!

No rational person would deny that racists and bigots exist. Believe it or not, as a Jew myself, this election cycle isn’t the first time my background has been attacked. When you start likening contemporary political officials to Nazis, though, I tend to think you’re shortchanging the people who decimated my family back in the Old Country.

It’s also undeniable that over the past year some legitimately worrisome voices have found footing with Republicans. Maybe Steve Bannon is going to be bad news. I wasn’t too crazy about Obama nominating someone who claimed her favorite political philosopher was Mao, either. Still, there was no Great Leap Forward.

If you believe one side is normalizing extremism, think about this: Rep. Keith Ellison, a guy whose political career was launched as a member the anti-Semitic and racist Nation of Islam, and who is one of the most radically left-wing members of Congress, may soon be running the DNC. Just juxtapose the stories and rhetoric surrounding Bannon and Ellison. Only one is treated as if he’s outside the norm.

In the minds of many, the only reason someone could be critical of Ellison is that he’s an African-American Muslim. Democrats have become so fixated on race and identity that they’re unable to imagine anything else could matter. Hannah Arendt once wrote that Western intellectuals had adopted one of Communism’s most effective tactics: they made all debate about motive rather than the merits of the argument. This outlook has consumed the American Left.

Is there any contemporary political dispute today that doesn’t come down to accusing conservatives of harboring deep-seated motives about race or sex? Some (and I really, feel uncomfortable calling them “liberals” anymore) have convinced themselves Trump’s victory confirms that half the country is made up of white supremacists — as if voting and governance were that simple.

In truth, the reason racism is treated as a grievous social sin is because it is so rare and intolerable in everyday discourse. The Left compensates for this by constantly expanding the description of bigotry to include anyone opposing their policy preferences. When everyone is a racist, no one is.

For years, President Obama made it a habit to conflate criticism of Islam with hate speech. A majority of Americans harbor legitimate apprehensions about Islamic terrorism and immigration, which while it brings many good people to our country also brings a lot of illiberal ideas. Trump’s boorishness on the matter doesn’t mean his voters are all pining to burn down mosques or threaten their neighbors. It probably means most other politicians weren’t taking their concerns seriously enough.

Anyway, the FBI has yet to come up with a “thought crimes division,” although I’m sure the folks at Vox or Slate have some great ideas. There is no real way to gauge how much love Americans have for all their neighbors. Guess what? Even if some old-timer isn’t crazy about people who speak Spanish in public, it doesn’t make him a member of the Schutzstaffel. What we do know is that considering our sheer amount of religious, cultural, and racial diversity, we live in a peace unmatched in human history. This is worth remembering as we have an emotional breakdown over an election.

Why Punishing Criminals Can Be More Merciful Than ‘Rehabilitation’,"The United States prison system constitutes a serious problem. While we make up 5 percent of the world’s population, we lay claim to 25 percent of the world’s prison population—that’s 2.4 million incarcerated people. This constitutes a 500 percent increase over the past 30 years, a problem that such diverse figures as Ta-Nehisi Coates and the Koch brothers want to address.

As with many social problems, progressives point to Europe as the righteous elder brother to the younger, prodigal United States. The problem with our prison system, say progressives, is our retributive mentality. Our system metes out revenge instead of rehabilitating. A video comparing Norwegian and American prisons made the rounds a few months ago and illustrated this perspective precisely.

“Do you want people who are angry?” a Norwegian prison official asks. “Or do you want people who are rehabilitated?”

Besides the false dichotomy between anger and rehabilitation, along with the video’s extremely selective view of a single prison, and the irrelevance for the U.S. of policy made in the small, homogenous, oil-rich Norway, the video also plays into progressive American self-flagellating for problems that do not exist. Do we have a problem with our prisons? Yes. But the problem is not too much retribution.

In Choosing Effectiveness, We Abandon Justice

No matter how heartwarming it is to watch footage of convicted Norwegian criminals smiling and playing electric guitar, progressives’ story about the American obsession with retribution is bogus. Much of our problem actually stems from having forgotten about retribution. The American criminal justice system is not intended to punish criminals, and in fact, the notion of rehabilitation is part of the problem with our prisons. If we had heeded C.S. Lewis’ warning on the subject, we wouldn’t be in our current mess.

In his 1949 essay “The Humanitarian Theory of Punishment” (published in 20th Century: An Australian Quarterly Review because no one in England would publish it—the Australians had no qualms with a defense of retribution, apparently) Lewis warned that the doctrine of rehabilitation-as-punishment, “merciful though it appears, really means that each one of us, from the moment he breaks the law, is deprived of the rights of a human being.” Rehabilitation deprives prisoners of their rights.

How could that be true? As Lewis explains, by endorsing rehabilitation, we abandon “the concept of Desert,” the principle that justice exists only when people get what they deserve. We can ask whether a punishment is likely to deter others or to cure the offender, but these questions have nothing to do with justice—they are questions about effectiveness. A doctor does not ask about a “just cure” or a “fair cure,” but only about an “effective cure.” In choosing effectiveness, we abandon justice.

The State Is Not A Doctor, And Prisons Aren’t Hospitals

After all, justice is quite simply getting what you deserve. For example, justice requires allowing Muslims to practice their faith, because they deserve religious freedom. In a similar way, justice requires punishing the criminal, because he deserves punishment. The punishment, however, must be strictly in proportion to his crime. We can, and ought, to argue about what constitutes a just punishment.

Clearly, a six-month sentence for rape with only three months served, as in Brock Turner’s case, is unjust because it falls far short of what Turner deserves. And a sentence of 25-to-life for stealing three golf clubs, as in Gary Ewing’s case, is unjust because it goes far beyond what Ewing deserves. So long as we are having this argument, we are on the right track, because we are arguing about justice. Too often, however, we argue not about what is just, but about what is effective.

When we argue about what is effective, instead of what is right, we grant the State the authority to prevent and to cure, and in so doing, we grant it a more expansive role than it previously had. The State becomes a doctor who diagnoses, treats, and pronounces a cure, but in a prison, unlike in a hospital, the patient has no right to refuse or discontinue the treatment. Before the rise of rehabilitation, we permitted the State to punish strictly in proportion to the crime committed. Once the punishment was paid, the State had no further right over the prisoner, unlike now.

Consider the “box” on educational and employment applications. Or the publicly accessible databases that contain the names, faces, and addresses of sex offenders. Or how we take the vote away from those convicted of felonies. The punishment follows the offender forever, wherever he goes and whatever he does, because the price for his crime is never actually paid. Because the State has committed to curing criminals, it must monitor them for relapse, and continue to do so indefinitely. “Mercy, detached from Justice, grows unmerciful,” Lewis writes. Even if we “reform” our prisons to include electric guitars, they will still be warehouses where the State is doctor, disciplinarian, and priest—master of the body and of the soul.

We’ve Embraced the Panopticon

In “Discipline and Punish,” Michel Foucault describes the Panopticon, Jeremy Bentham’s prison design with a central guard tower and darkened windows intended to make prisoners feel that they are under constant observation. Foucault recognizes that this system of imprisonment has nothing to do with retributive punishment, but rather with creating what Foucault calls “docile bodies.” The all-seeing Panopticon reminds us that though we’ve been using the metaphor of “cure,” the State is not actually interested in health, but something more like total submission. We ought not to trust Lidless Eyes.

The unmerciful plant of rehabilitation and its bad fruit grow abundantly in the state of California. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that prison overcrowding in the state had grown so unreasonable that the prisons themselves constituted a violation of the Eighth Amendment. And the prisons got to that point because officials stopped asking whether a punishment was just, but concerned themselves with effectiveness.

For much of the twentieth century, California’s criminal justice system operated by the humanitarian theory that Lewis condemned. Judges handed out absurdly broad sentences, like five years to life, and let parole boards evaluate prisoners’ progress in rehabilitation efforts. But (justified) progressive concerns about racial bias on parole boards and conservative concerns about rising crime pushed then (and now) Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, to sign a 1976 determine sentencing law that curtailed the immense discretion of parole boards. The rest of the country got in on the tough-on-crime act too, which reached its climax in President Bill Clinton’s Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

‘Humanitarian’ Punishment Isn’t Really Humane

While being tough-on-crime seems like a return to the retributive mentality, it is actually an extension of the humanitarian theory. Once the proponents of the humanitarian theory had gutted justice from our theory of sentencing, we were left only with deterrence and rehabilitation—both approaches predicated on effectiveness, not justice.

Take the bevy of Three Strikes and You’re Out Laws that were passed in states all over the country. These laws are responsible for much of the overcrowding afflicting American prisons, and directly responsible for Gary Ewing’s draconian sentence of 25-years-to-life for stealing three golf clubs from a pro shop.

The Three Strikes Law is supposed to serve as a deterrent (its actual effectiveness is doubtful). But it also reveals the tyrannical “mercy” at the heart of the humanitarian theory. Under no circumstances does petty theft merit the same—or harsher—penalty as rape or murder. But that is precisely how the State treats a thief under the Three Strikes Law.

We may protest that the State is not acting justly, because the sentence violates the law of proportionality, “the concept of Desert,” a requisite of justice. But the State does not care. In this case, the State is not even looking at the rubric of justice at all. Rather, the sentence is ultimately an expression of resignation. “We cannot cure this man,” the State says about the repeat petty offender. “He is incurable, so we must lock him up forever.”

Proponents of the humanitarian theory of punishment call their approach “merciful,” and thus many Christians associate rehabilitation with Christianity. But mercy requires acknowledgment of a crime committed, just as forgiveness requires confession. Humanitarians, on the other hand, call crime a “disease,” or even more frightening, a “social pathology.”

But a sick man cannot be pardoned, only cured. And if the cure doesn’t take, well then, the social physicians conclude, the problem must be the patient. The Three Strikes Law is the inevitable pessimism that inhabits the dark side of utopian social engineering. It is what Lewis called “a man-eating weed.” So it should surprise no one that such an enlightened progressive as Hillary Clinton invented the “superpredator,” the maniacally violent black youth of the inner city, immune to the remedies of the State.

An ‘Eye For An Eye’ Restrains Violence

“An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.” This is one of the numerous supposed quotes from Gandhi. Many cite it to denigrate the retributive justice found in Mosaic Law, the lex talionis that mandates a penalty equivalent to whatever harm was committed. It is considered bloodthirsty, but consider what you would do if someone tore out your eyeball. I doubt many would content themselves—after staunching the blood issuing from their eye socket—with taking a single eye from their assailant. A response much more violent would feel in order. Rather than promoting violence, “eye for an eye” restrains it.

At the heart of the lex talionis is a timeless and universal moral truth. Justice requires punishment, punishment must be deserved, and just desert requires a punishment in proportion to the crime committed—neither too much, nor too little. This is far preferable to the senselessly draconian sentences and the perpetual monitoring and post-imprisonment sanctions subject to the whims of a grimly humanitarian state. Even if it has electric guitars—although forcing prisoners to listen to their cellmates learn how to play might be its own form of punishment.

Trevor Noah's Memoir Will Surprise With His Take On Religion And Politics,"If you want to know more about Daily Show host Trevor Noah, there’s a book you should read. Noah’s memoir and biography Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood is the Rosetta Stone for understanding the man behind Jon Stewart’s former desk (or Jonathan Liebowitz’s former desk, as President-elect Donald Trump would have it).

From mistakenly burning down a family’s home at age seven to an impromptu career of hustling pirated CDs and slinging payday loans in the ‘hood, Noah doesn’t shy away from the good, the bad, and the funny. This candor can take you to some surprisingly visceral, compelling places, sort of like Noah’s recent viral interview with Tomi Lahren.

Born a Crime centers on Noah’s love for his mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, and praises her strength in the face of danger, abuse, and poverty. The book also spends a lot of time discussing South Africa’s erstwhile apartheid system of racial segregation and hierarchy that defined his early years.

The Ultimate Prankster

Noah was born to a Swiss father and black South African mother in 1984 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Sex between Europeans and Africans was illegal at the time, punishable by five years in prison. Noah’s birth certificate lied about his parentage to protect him from being taken away by the government and to protect his parents from punishment.

“The wrong color kid in the wrong color area, and the government could come in, strip your parents of custody, haul you off to an orphanage,” Noah explains.

Noah describes his young self as a “fat little kid,” who was also “hyperactive” and “the ultimate prankster.” He recalls times of great strife such as in the chaos that arose after Nelson Mandela was freed from prison and Zulu and Xhosa-aligned political parties (two large ethnic groups in South Africa) struggled for who would take power. He describes seeing a charred body on the roadside that had been “necklaced” (a tire forced around the person and then lighted on fire to burn him to death), and recalls coming home to see entire adjoining neighborhoods on fire. His mother’s response:

She’d tell me not to worry. She always came back to the phrase she lived by: ‘If God is with me, who can be against me?’ She was never scared. Even when she should have been.

He Gets Religion

Noah was raised solely by his mother in a devoutly Christian environment, where he was held up to a strict code of behavior and physically disciplined by her when he stepped out of line. He was the go-to guy at prayer meetings that were often held at his grandparents’ house and attended church weeknights and often multiple times on Sundays.

In one of the book’s most hilarious passages, Noah recounts a theological debate with his mother on one Sunday morning when her second-hand car wouldn’t start. In another exchange he argues with his mom about the Narnia series, because she believes that the lion character Aslan is idolatrous. Noah tries, and ultimately succeeds, in convincing her that Aslan is a Christ figure and thus not sacrilegious.

Anyone who currently watches the Daily Show and thinks “this guy just doesn’t get conservative religious people” will really have to have another think after reading Born a Crime. Even Boyz II Men was strictly off-limits in the Noah household, and most movies weren’t allowed. As Noah writes, “the Bible was my action movie. Samson was my superhero. He was my He-Man.”

Noah straddles the line between poking fun at his religious upbringing while also admitting he gained a lot from it, and faith ultimately plays a pivotal role in the book’s conclusion. He leaves it ambiguous as to what degree he holds any religious beliefs today.

Poverty and Abuse

Noah’s father Robert is presented as a total enigma. They visit on weekends, birthdays, and Christmas, but we’re never told much about Robert, including the depth or length of his relationship with Patricia. Noah and Robert’s history is patchily described at best, and includes years of estrangement, although a love for his dad and vice versa is clearly evident.

Born a Crime is frequently laugh-out-loud funny, but it also brings the reader to rock bottom with stories of devastating poverty and abuse. Noah opens up about living for a year in his new stepfather Abel’s mechanic garage where he had to sleep in the back of cars. For a time the family survived on the cheapest food available: a disgusting type of worm.

Despite all the disorder surrounding him and the beating he first got from Abel starting in grade six, Noah explains his bring-people-together approach to life, which he also discussed in a recent New York Times op-ed. When there are tweets like this coming from the Daily Show on Twitter (it’s unlikely Noah wrote the reprehensible tweet) it’s easy to dismiss “come together” rhetoric from the Left. Yet Born a Crime doesn’t harp on polarizing, flippant rhetoric as often as the Daily Show does.

As Noah grows up he becomes increasingly torn between the black world, white world, and “colored” world (a distinct historically placed racial identity in South Africa different than the context in which Americans may understand the term). Noah’s story arc shows us a young man who didn’t belong in any one racial category. At one point in the book he writes that he encountered situations that made him have to decide his identity decisively:

[A]t some point, you have to choose. Black or white. Pick a side. You can try to hide from it. You can say, ‘Oh, I don’t pick sides,’ but at some point life will force you to pick a side.

However at other points Noah seems to propose that you don’t have to pick other than being a good person and emphasizes his belief that communication (he speaks six languages) can cut through layers of conflict.

Noah has a rebellious stint in a private Catholic school paid for by a scholarship through his mother’s work (spoiler: at one point before Mass, Noah furtively eats and drinks the Eucharist intended for the Catholic students). Soon after, he enters high school. In high school he embraces being a “nobody” who all the “cool kids” could joke with but never actually worry about whether he’d compete with them to date the pretty girl. In high school Noah also acquires a CD burner as a parting gift from a friend and he goes on to become an enterprising young hustler in the ‘hood after graduation, selling burned CDs, DJing parties, and operating an informal payday loan business.

Raising Eyebrows

Born a Crime has several weak points. The book talks about apartheid so often that it becomes repetitive. Clearly it’s a central theme of the book and Noah’s experiences, but even those deeply interested in the subject may find themselves fatigued as complexities and injustices of apartheid are brought up that were already discussed in a past chapter.

Another portion of the book that may raise eyebrows is the chapter “Go Hitler!” about Noah’s black friend Hitler. Hitler was a star dancer in Noah’s dance crew at events he used to DJ. Noah claims that Western historical figures like Hitler aren’t well understood by some black South Africans and are perceived in a more generic sense (i.e. as formidable or noteworthy, but without knowledge of those figures’ policies and beliefs).

In a particularly cringe-worthy passage Noah talks about a DJ gig at a Jewish high school that gets cancelled on the spot after he and his dance crew begin chanting “Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler!” as Hitler dances onstage. Noah and his crew are unaware that they’re causing great offense.

In this chapter of Born a Crime Noah poses questions and provides commentary that will offend many and ruffle some feathers. He muses on how the mass murder of Africans in the Belgian Congo, for example, isn’t seen as equally bad to the Holocaust only because it doesn’t have documentation and didn’t happen to a Western population.

Noah talks about going from seeing the police as basically good to seeing them as an old boy’s club after they repeatedly didn’t respond to his mother’s complaints of physical abuse by Abel. Noah also speaks of his serious run-in with the criminal justice system in a way that makes it clear he regards the system as fundamentally unfair and prone to snap judgments on the basis of things like skin color, language, and a judge’s whims.

‘Wake Up the Next Day and Move On’

Noah’s mother faced domestic abuse for years, and he discusses the paradox that strong women kept communities running during the hardships of apartheid, but were also simultaneously expected to “submit [to] and obey” men. His mother would never be what society demanded she be, however, and did things her own way by building her own life.

This made it all the more upsetting to Noah that she ended up under the shadow of the alternately nice, alternately brutish Abel, whom she’d symbolically spent her life escaping. Noah hints at his support for abortion (or adoption?) when he talks about his mother getting unexpectedly pregnant after having her tubes tied. Noah felt “keeping” baby Isaac was tantamount to re-upping on the contract of abuse with her monstrous husband.

On economics, Noah talks about how obtaining a CD writer while he was in high school catapulted him into economic success. He displays moneymaking zeal in his younger days that would make Ayn Rand proud. Noah also states that while he doesn’t agree with “handouts,” he does believe there’s a lot of lecturing of the poor by the rich instead of giving them tools to succeed. Instead of teach a man to fish, Noah asks, why not teach a man to fish and give him a fishing rod to do it?

Noah’s book ultimately advises an optimistic approach to life that doesn’t dwell too much on the past. Ignore the irony that his book focuses a lot on the injustices and hardships of the past, and this is pretty good advice:

If you think too much about the ass-kicking your mom gave you, or the ass-kicking that life gave you, you’ll stop pushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It’s better to take it, spend some time crying, then wake up the next day and move on.

Whether conservative, liberal, secular, religious, or anything else, Born a Crime is a compelling journey that will make readers laugh, cry, and ponder some big questions. Now if only the Daily Show could do the same.

The Trump Administration Should Treat Islamists Like The Mafia,"Thousands attend their rallies, claiming widespread discrimination. They wrap themselves in displays of “interfaith” cooperation. National, state, and local officials pay them heed. Words that “offend” them are removed from movies, newscasts, and even official government reports. All the while, the men who lead this organization have appeared extensively on FBI wiretaps and are known to federal law enforcement to be involved in a national criminal conspiracy.

You could be forgiven for thinking this describes the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) and its Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders—a group the FBI, federal prosecutors and a federal judge have all affirmed supported the designated terrorist group, Hamas.

But no. The year is 1971, and the pressure group is the Italian American Civil Rights League (IACRL). Its founder, Joe Colombo, is known to federal law enforcement as the head of New York’s Colombo crime family, one of the infamous “Five Families” of the Cosa Nostra. Its most high-profile spokesman is his son, Anthony, who, for more than 30 years would deny the Mafia existed and rail against dark government conspiracies targeting Italian-Americans.

You Fight Crime, You Fight Italians?

It may seem like a punch line now but, in the 1970s, the effort by gangsters to don the mantle of activists and wrap themselves the flag of “civil rights” was taken semi-seriously. Many prominent Italian-American elites (prominenti in Italian) endorsed the call, throwing their influence behind the grievance-mongering. As scholar Joseph Sciorra of the Italian American Review describes,

A blurring occurred in which the mobbed-up League was conflated in the popular imagination with civic-minded spokespeople, thus diminishing the latter’s seemingly altruistic efforts (Kenna 2007, 193). But as historian Philip V. Cannistraro notes, “the prominenti’s constant preoccupation with the Mafia issue” (2005, 83), dating to the early 1930s when newspaper owner Generoso Pope launched an anti-defamation campaign against cinematic depictions of mafiosi, has historically been a self-serving agenda. ‘The dual focus of prominentismo has always been to promote the separate, self-aggrandizing interest of their own particular elite rather than the community as a whole, and to stress what Italian Americans are not’ (Cannistraro 2005, 84). It is no surprise, then, as Fred Gardaphé observes, that ‘more unified acts by Italian Americans have been launched against fictional portrayal of the mafia than ever were mounted against real mafiosi in the United States’ (2015, 365).

The obvious parallel is to the tens of thousands of Muslim-Americans CAIR enlists to bolster crowds condemning “Islamophobia” and any discussion of Islamic terrorism, but offer at best anemic support for pro forma denunciations of terrorism. As The Federalist’s Sean Davis has noted, the analogue between the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Italian American Civil Rights League is so close that, reading the latter’s public statements from the early 1970s and replacing “Italian” with “Muslim,” you’d be hard-pressed to spot the incongruence.

The way Sciorra described “the mobbed-up League” and its efforts could be an apt descriptor for CAIR, a group founded and run by ex-Islamic Association for Palestine staffers that has had more than one of its employees convicted of terror-related criminal activity. As Sciorra explained, while the crowd at the league’s rallies wore pins discussing their Italian pride, the leadership had more strategic concerns. They focused on attacking federal law enforcement and purposefully conflating all investigation of Mafia criminal activities with discrimination against the large Italian-American community.

The only way to end this perceived “discrimination,” the league insisted, was for the government and media to change its ways; not only must it stop using the word “Mafia,” it must deny that any such criminal conspiracy existed. And they did. The Department of Justice adhered to federal regulations, which prohibited use of the word. “There is nothing to be gained by using these terms,” U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell wrote, “except to give gratuitous offense” to “many good Americans of Italian-American descent.” The New York State Police had a similar rule. The word “Mafia” was deleted from the script of “The Godfather” at the behest of Colombo’s league.

Once, the Media Reported These Connections

Not everyone fell for it, including among the Italian-American community. New York state Sen. John Marchi warned that Italian-Americans had “been had” by their endorsement of Colombo’s Italian American Civil Rights League, only to be denounced as a “self-loathing Italian.” One wonders if Marchi didn’t feel then much the way Zhudi Jasser of American Islamic Forum for Democracy must feel now as he warns the American people about the machinations of Islamist groups, only to be denounced as an “Islamophobe” by known terror conspirators.

In the early 1970s, the media was a lot more skeptical of these obvious propaganda efforts, as well. At the end of a syndicated 1971 article about the League’s alliance with the Jewish Defense League, the Jewish Telegraph Agency slips in the following inconvenient information for context, complete with parentheses:

(Joseph Colombo, president of the League, faces a Federal hearing on April 21st on charges of conducting a gambling business. He has also just been convicted in the Manhattan State Court on a perjury charge and was recently arrested for allegedly receiving stolen goods from a robbery of the Long Island Jewelry Exchange in Mineola.)

The JTA obviously thought it was important to describe for its readers the provenance of the league’s complaint, as well as its unsavory record. Of course, one would wait in vain today for a mainstream media outlet to describe CAIR’s troublesome history with the same forthrightness.

In fact, despite U.S. District Court Judge Jorge Solis ruling that, “The government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR [and other Islamist groups] with Hamas,” none of the nearly 700 articles the New York Times has run about the group has mentioned it. Even more egregiously, the Times covered CAIR’s 2007 efforts to break free of its designation as an unindicted coconspirator in the largest terror finance trial in American history, yet neglected to cover the 2009 rejection of the Islamist group’s appeal.

What It Takes to Fight International Leagues of Terror

The parallels between the League’s censorship efforts in the ‘70s and CAIR’s efforts today aren’t lost on Rudy Giuliani, and for good reason. In 1983, when he was U.S. attorney, Giuliani launched his successful prosecutions against the New York crime families. One of his first acts was to violate the prior decade’s DOJ regulations and say the forbidden word “Mafia.” In a piece for the Wall Street Journal last year, Giuliani made an apt comparison between the battle for accurate vocabulary in both the fight with the mob and with Islamic terrorists.

I had a different view of using the term Mafia. It reflected the truth. The Mafia existed, and denying what people oppressed by those criminals knew to be true only gave the Mafia more power. This hesitancy to identify the enemy accurately and honestly—“Mafia” was how members described themselves and kept its identity Italian or Italian-American—created the impression that the government was incapable of combating them because it was unable even to describe the enemy correctly.

As Giuliani argued, the similarities go beyond mere forbidden words and get at the heart of what it takes to prevail against both the Cosa Nostra and Islamic jihadists. In a recent piece for the Claremont Review of Books, we argued for a new law enforcement approach to dealing with Islamist movements, of which the Muslim Brotherhood is the most consequential, that draws explicitly on efforts to defeat the Mafia:

Instead of approaching Brotherhood members and organizations as respected community leaders for outreach purposes either at home or abroad, the primary goal should be to acquire the intelligence needed to disrupt terror finance or prevent indoctrination. If necessary, officials can use the possibility of prosecution under the Muslim Brotherhood designation to secure cooperation, which would be similar to the way informants are treated when approaching other conspirators, such as crime organizations.

Since Giuliani crippled the New York mob in the 1980s, Colombo’s League and its campaign to ban the word “Mafia” seems more like a quaint throwback to the 1970s than a threat to the integrity of organized crime investigations. Perhaps the Trump administration will be able to accomplish the same for groups like CAIR, when the inappropriate deference, and White House meetings, become a thing of the past.

Of course, some of the league’s bitter holdouts will always remain. Anthony Colombo continues to write on his mob boss father, insisting the FBI had him killed to halt his civic accomplishments. Even more colorfully, Father Louis Gigante—brother to famed Genovese Mafia Boss Vincent “the Chin” Gigante and a well-known Bronx community organizer—holds up mobsters as exemplars for civic minded Americans, in just the way Islamist groups sing the praises of convicted terror financiers.

For most Americans of all ethnic groups, though, government efforts to act against the Mafia are considered appropriate rather than discriminatory. No serious person insists that admitting Mafiosi were largely Italian-Americans is the same as saying all Italian-Americans are mobsters. The same can and must be done for Islamic terrorism.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/02/trump-administration-treat-islamists-like-mafia/,2017-01-02
Jaime Foxx’s ‘Sleepless’ Is So Cliché It Will Put You To Sleep,"Casinos, cocaine, and dirty cops: those words sum up Jaime Foxx’s new crime thriller “Sleepless.” The movie, which begins with some promise, has a gritty retro aesthetic that hearkens back to the crime films of the 1970s. The world is a messed-up place, and sometimes the best we can hope for is a hardboiled, hollow-eyed hero. New York City is cleaner than it was 40 years ago, so “Sleepless” is set in America’s last bastion of gilded dirtiness: Las Vegas.

In “Sleepless,” Foxx plays Vincent Downs, a Las Vegas police officer who finds himself in possession of 25 kilos of cocaine that don’t belong to him. The drug lords want their cocaine back, and they kidnap Vincent’s son to ensure his cooperation. Vincent gets the drugs and heads to the casino where his son is being held hostage.

Things start to fall apart for Vincent in the movie’s second act, and when I say “things” I mean the script. “Cookie cutter” was the phrase I heard as I exited the theater, and the movie hits every narc-movie cliché.

You can make a satisfying movie out of clichés (e.g., “The Force Awakens”). But if you’re not planning to show the audience something fresh, the least you can do is film and arrange your clichés with excellence. “Sleepless” could have been named “Sleepwalking” because it seems that everyone involved decided to shoot for mediocre.

An Action Film Where the Lead Doesn’t Get to Act

Michelle Monaghan and Scoot McNairy do a creditable job playing the kinds of characters that they typically play in spite of a script that doesn’t give them much to work with. The biggest crime in this thriller is that Foxx is absolutely wasted after the opening scenes. If you have an Academy Award-winning actor lined up for your film, you should probably let him act.

Foxx spends most of the movie alone, running through the empty hallways and service corridors of the fictional casino that provides the setting for most of the movie. Even when he does talk to other characters, there’s no joy in it. Foxx is a funny guy, but the few “humorous” bits that were meant to break up the grimness fail.

The script’s relentless grimness is compounded by a sense of claustrophobia. Most of the movie takes place in a high-rise casino, but for some reason this casino has a shocking lack of space. The director didn’t spend much of the $30-million budget on set construction, and the movie has a few relatively small sets crammed with a few hundred people in them.

We’re not supposed to notice that the casino is smaller on the inside than on the outside. At one point Monaghan’s character complains to her partner that they’ve searched the whole casino from top to bottom without finding Vincent Downs. That would be a ludicrous statement if the casino had more than three rooms, but fortunately it doesn’t.

For the movie’s climax, the director must have realized that he needed to change up the location even though he was out of money. The solution? Shoot in a parking garage. Those are cheap. The climax is the weakest part of the movie. As the filming budget dwindled, characters started making increasingly irrational decisions to bring the plot to a close. Really, no one’s actions make sense towards the end. I’m beginning to suspect that the movie was called “Sleepless” because the whole thing was filmed in one sleepless night.

At Least the Bad Guys Are Bad

“Sleepless” pretends to be more than a cliché-filled crime thriller by telling the audience that it’s really a movie about fathers and sons. Downs and his kidnapped son have some issues to work through. McNairy’s creepy villain has his own struggles as he tries to gain his father’s approval.

A number of scenes signal to the audience “Pay attention to this poignant moment about fathers and sons!” but these attempts at sentimentality lack any emotional punch. The movie leaves us with the message that it’s okay to neglect your family if your work is really important. They’ll understand when they see it pay off in the end. I’m not sure the audience will.

The one redeeming thing about “Sleepless” is that the bad guys are bad guys and the bad guys are not us. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the rise of the Bourne franchise, our own government has often threatened the heroes of action thrillers. As part of that retro feel, “Sleepless” locates evil in organized crime’s drug trafficking. Every aspect of Las Vegas seems to have been corrupted by that evil, as no one’s happy at the beginning of the movie. This corruption extends to the government.

As Monaghan’s character says, the city is “crawling with dirty cops.” But the government itself isn’t the problem. We aren’t the problem. Corruption has taken its toll, but corruption of a system entails that the system must be inherently good. The Las Vegas of “Sleepless,” as bad as it is, still has some good people in it, and some of them are cops.

Unfortunately, those few good people won’t get much rest. The movie ends on an implicit promise of a sequel. We can only hope that Foxx finds a better option to fuel his ambitions to become an action hero.

Immigration Is A Ticking Time Bomb Trump Needs To Defuse,"To the surprise of many Americans, immigration and his no-holds-barred approach to politics gave Donald Trump a resounding win that sent both Democratic and Republican strategists to the showers, rethinking their time-worn formulas.

Even more surprising, Trump has lit the fires of populist revolt on an international scale. The European Union is in peril and nationalism, spurred on by immigration, is one of the more notable opponents. Who woulda thought? Clearly, Americans are not the only citizens ticked off at the elite.

Trump’s foray into the immigration morass will prove to be a formidable challenge. The subject has been the “red-headed stepchild” of policy for as long as our nation has existed, and the ball is clearly in his court.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to create a uniform rule of naturalization. In a judicially created doctrine known as the “plenary power doctrine,” the Supreme Court allowed Congress to delegate its immigration authority to the executive branch. Hence, the president virtually holds a monopoly over immigration law.

Two predictable outcomes came of this decision. First, immigration became a political football in the hands of the president, doing what he will when he wants to, and that translates to political expediency. Second, the immigration issue became an orphan among America’s global initiatives like foreign and economic policy. Times of war were notable exceptions.

If that gives you pause, be assured you are not alone: it should be a major concern. Immigration policy has never been more important, and has implications far beyond a benign social issue.

Despite high-minded protestations to the contrary, honoring Trump’s pledge to construct a fence that stems the flow of illegals entering America is the right call. Don’t let the persona of the messenger cloud your thinking. Immigration is a social and national security bomb that needs to be carefully defused. Step one is securing our perimeter until a smart strategy is in place.

Immigration Policy Is Not a Sidecar

Great nations, armies, companies, and institutions are not the product of blind luck or impassioned hyperbole. They are the result of articulated values, ideas, and goals that their shareholders buy into—a sense of shared mission that empowers those who faithfully come together in common cause. When this “buy-in” occurs, you unleash a force that demands a reckoning.

Immigration is, and has been, a divisive wedge issue in our common cause, exploited by politicians for personal gain and political demagoguery. Never, outside of election periods or war, has it received the attention and thoughtfulness of other components of national policy.

Terms like economic policy, trade policy, and foreign policy are familiar to the majority of Americans. They carry a certain weighty connotation that suggests its architects need to be thoughtful, skilled strategists, wise in the ways of the world, and forward-thinking. Immigration policy is no different. It is vital to our nation’s future. That said, it behooves us to approach it with cautious optimism and strategic thoughtfulness.

Our Immigration Policy Needs Intelligent Design

Apart from whatever else you might think, immigration policy development must consider three fundamental components: National security; the full and sincere political assimilation of the émigré, in which he or she embraces our Constitution and Bill of Rights; and the émigré possesses education and skill sets conducive to facilitating his and our nation’s economic health.

Intelligent design of any system begins with an accurate assessment of where you are today, including threats and weaknesses, then unequivocally articulating the desired end state. That’s true for computer systems, weapon systems, utility systems and our beleaguered economic system. No evidence I know of suggests the government, press, or general public fully appreciates these issues.

One of the harsher realities we face in the twenty-first century is that technology has forever changed the workplace. Factories that produce raw materials and finished product rely less and less on unskilled labor. We already have an excess of unskilled labor, as our increasing Rust Belt can attest, and that is an economic liability we cannot ignore.

America needs a plan to employ or transition our surplus of unskilled workers to meet the ever-changing skill sets commerce demands. In today’s global economy, a western nation with labor exploitation laws and awash in unskilled labor is a nation condemned to the dust-bin of history.

Until we have a workable strategy that considers the aforementioned three immigration components, immigration needs to be shut down except in exceptional cases. The reality is that we simply cannot save the world’s poor and refugees. Trump is absolutely right in sounding the immigration klaxon.

Immigration Policy Is Merely a Tool

Unserious immigration policy development and enforcement best serves the needs of big business and politicians. Business seeks cheaper labor and politicians seek “victims” they will claim to champion in exchange for a rubber stamp voting bloc to keep them in power. The economic reality is that a surplus of cheap labor depresses wages for the lower middle class, which drives up unemployment, which creates a greater demand for social services.

A less discussed aspect of porous borders is the benefit to transnational crime cartels. Historically, the more well-known cartel products were marijuana and cocaine. Today, transnational gangs have proliferated, and have expanded their offerings to include synthetic opioids, nefarious people of foreign origin, counterfeit goods, illegal arms, young women sold into sex slavery, and a more potent crystal meth. Further, any local law enforcement agency can tell you that drug addiction increases crime rates.

The Los Angeles sheriff recently stated his jail cell capacity of several thousand was being significantly strained by meth addicts who are so violent he cannot put more than one person in a cell. He is warehousing the mentally ill. It should be clear that an ounce of prevention in reducing illegal immigration is worth more than a pound of cure.

The National Security Council has a strategy to combat these issues, yet a comprehensive border enforcement policy is virtually nonexistent. Complaints by our border patrol agents union largely fall on deaf ears.

We Need to Discriminate Among Immigrants

Knowing the multitude of ills that we face with our politicized immigration system, it is fair to ask, “Who would be the ‘winners’ if we were to maintain or expand relatively open borders?”

The EU experience has instructional value. Europe is notable for its generous social welfare systems, which are under increased stress. Crime rates and the need for mental health services are increasing.

According to our own National Institutes of Health, few experiences are more traumatic than immigration. Virtually everything in the immigrant’s life changes, including loss of family, diet, climate, culture, language, and social status. Social trauma of one degree or another is common.

The point of origin also has a great deal to do with the success of immigrants into western societies. In Los Angeles, 44 percent of immigrants come from Mexico. They are among the least-skilled and poorest-educated people in the hemisphere. They also lack the financial resources necessary to prosper in an alien economy. On the other hand, studies show that Cuban refugees are much better equipped to succeed in America. Hence not all Latins are the same.

Asians have vastly different future prospects. Asian immigrants are more likely to come to our shores with transferable skill sets, access to funds, and a keen appreciation for education that facilitates their successful immigration. Their demand for social services is minimal compared to Latinos and other native-born minorities.

The same is true for Europe, where the growing influx of unskilled immigrants has seriously violated all three fundamentals of successful immigration policy: being a security risk, not embracing the culture, and lacking transferable skills to meet national needs and ensure their own successful future.

Recent intelligence findings in the aftermath of growing terrorism in Europe have demonstrated that open borders facilitate terrorism, while widely differing intelligence policies, culture, and strategies of European nations inhibit counter-intelligence. Immigrants are also more easily radicalized to crime and terrorism.

Hence, apart from being the antithesis of fostering civil society, “open borders” is a breeding ground for conflict of purpose. That is not a good result, unless united purpose and common cause are obstructions to your longer-term goals, in which case you seek the bitter fruit they will bring. Divide and conquer comes to mind.

The Diversity Mantra Is a Ruse

The mantra that praises diversity has been exploited by leftists and globalists ad nauseam. “Diversity” is one of the great hoaxes of the last half-century, a figment of the imagination of people who live in the distorted reality known as academia.

Those who wish to immigrate to America but do not support our Constitution or Bill of Rights are not good candidates for citizenship or extended residence.

History unequivocally proves people are tribal, stubborn creatures who place great importance on shared values, religion, experience, ethnicity, culture, and so on. By their very nature they seek out their own, and many harbor resistance to interlopers. When displaced into another nations, they are inclined to congregate into enclaves euphemistically defined as Little Tokyo, China Town, Little Italy, etc. In Europe, these enclaves have frequently become crime-ridden ghettos and safe havens for terrorists, where the native-born dare not enter.

If diversity advocates were actual educators, they would acknowledge that, in the context of immigration, diversity is a serious challenge to unity of purpose. In fact, diversity is the antonym (look it up) of agreement, sameness, similarity, and uniformity—the very heart of shared values and purpose.

Those who wish to immigrate to America but do not support our Constitution or Bill of Rights are not good candidates for citizenship or extended residence. If their beliefs are incompatible with these documents, that is fine. They, and we, are better served when they immigrate elsewhere.

Our explosive growth of technology-driven commerce has facilitated the accumulation of wealth that would make a pharaoh blush. That has granted the rich increased access to political power. The result is an international community of wealthy globalists unburdened by borders or societal trappings. National pride, culture, and independence are the mortal enemies of a worldwide government driven by a ruling class of globalists.

None of this would surprise our founding fathers. They had a keen appreciation for the frailty of mankind regarding wealth and power, knowing full well their democratic republic would require eternal vigilance and shared responsibility in keeping it. We are long past the time where we need an integrated and intelligent immigration policy.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/18/immigration-ticking-time-bomb-trump-needs-defuse/,2017-01-18
Poll: Americans Are Not As Divided On Policing As Headlines Suggest,"Recent killings by police in Ferguson, New York City, Baltimore, Charlotte, Minneapolis, and other places have highlighted sharp disagreements among Americans about the current state of policing. Are police too quick to use deadly force? Is there a “war on police” preventing officers from keeping communities safe?

This debate has renewed focus on a deep racial divide in perceptions of how the police do their jobs. For instance, a Cato Institute/YouGov survey finds that 73 percent of African Americans and 54 percent of Hispanics believe police are “too quick” to use deadly force—compared to 35 percent of white Americans.

On the other hand, 64 percent of white Americans and 52 percent of Latinos worry there is a “war on police in America today,” but a majority (54 percent) of black Americans think there isn’t such a war.

There’s A Perception Gap—But Also Common Ground

This perception gap extends to nearly every evaluation of policing: responsiveness, accountability, professionalism, impartiality, and honesty. Overall, African Americans feel considerably less favorable (40 percent) toward the police than white Americans (68 percent), and Hispanics fall in between at 59 percent favorable.

Certainly, these perception gaps matter. But our political punditry has failed to notice the fact that Americans of all backgrounds largely agree about how policing should operate in America.

A Cato Institute/YouGov national survey that I conducted finds that while Americans have different perceptions of how police operate, no demographic group is “anti-cop.” Americans agree on what we want from our police, and reach consensus on a variety of police reforms.

Media have sensationalized the extreme fringes of activists, who call for “abolishing” or “defunding” the police. But these individuals are rare and do not represent the views of many people. For instance, nine in 10 black, white, and Hispanic Americans all oppose reducing the number of police officers in their community—and a third say their community needs more officers.

Furthermore, very few people even go so far as to say they have “very unfavorable” views of the police (one in 10 or less of any racial group). In addition, six in 10 black, Hispanic, and white Americans all believe that police have very dangerous jobs—suggesting empathy for police officers and the risks they face.

Police Should Fight Violent Crime, Not the Drug War

Americans also agree on how police should prioritize their tasks: prioritize fighting violent crime, not the drug war.

When asked to select their top three priorities for law enforcement, Americans want police to prioritize investigating violent crime (78 percent), protecting people from crime (64 percent), and investigating robberies and property crime (58 percent). Blacks, whites, and Hispanics share these top three priorities for the police.

Notably, only 30 percent of Americans say enforcing drug laws should be a top police priority. And perhaps ironically, only 19 percent think the police should prioritize traffic enforcement—the task leading to the most common interaction we have with the police, getting a traffic ticket.

No One Likes Civil Asset Forfeiture

Eighty-four percent (84 percent) of Americans solidly oppose civil asset forfeiture—a practice in which police may take the money or property of a person suspected to have been involved in a crime before the person is convicted. Virtually all demographic groups—including 84 percent of whites, 86 percent of blacks, and 80 percent of Hispanics—oppose civil asset forfeiture. Why does it persist? Probably because people don’t know what it is or can’t believe that it actually occurs.

Support For Independent Investigations and Body Cameras

Although whites (57 percent), blacks (36 percent), and Hispanics (49 percent) disagree about whether police are held accountable for misconduct in practice, strong majorities of all three groups support reforms intended to enhance accountability.

For instance, 79 percent of Americans support having outside law enforcement agencies investigate police misconduct, rather than leave it to the department to handle in-house (21 percent). Although most jurisdictions allow police departments to internally investigate and discipline their own officers, majorities of Americans regardless of race or ethnicity think independent investigations would better enhance police accountability.

Americans of all racial backgrounds also agree that on-duty police should wear body cameras to record their interactions with citizens, with 89 percent in support. People think body cameras can help keep both citizens and police accountable by protecting the police from false accusations and keeping police honest by recording their on-duty interactions.

A Majority Support De-escalation Training for Police

Americans disagree about whether police tactics are “too harsh.” Fifty-six percent of African Americans think tactics are too harsh, but 67 percent of whites and 58 percent of Hispanics think they’re “about right.”

However, Americans of all racial backgrounds agree police could do more to de-escalate confrontations with citizens and could benefit from additional training (68 percent). Such a reform is broadly popular with solid majorities of whites (62 percent), Latinos (78 percent), and blacks (82 percent) all in support of providing police officers with additional confrontation training.

Americans Want Police to Be Transparent

The survey found that Americans also want police to be transparent about stops and searches. Most jurisdictions in the U.S. don’t require police officers to inform citizens when a police stop and search is voluntary or mandatory. However, a strong majority of Americans (73 percent) think police should notify citizens when a stop is voluntary and they may decline to be searched. Even though most Americans have nothing to hide, many may resist added scrutiny from police or government when given the choice.

Americans Support Cooling the Drug War

The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports police make about 1.6 million drug arrests every year. Thus, many criminal justice scholars believe that cooling the drug war could go a long way to improve police-community relations by reducing the opportunities people have to interact with police. Plus doing so could free up resources to help police fight violent crime.

Sure, few people want to outright legalize all drugs. But the survey found a majority of Americans also don’t think we should punish drug offenses like we would a criminal offense. Instead, 54 percent believe we should treat drug offenses like minor traffic violations with small fines rather than as felonies. Re-categorizing drug offenses from felonies to civil offenses is broadly popular regardless of racial or ethnic background (whites at 54 percent, blacks at 59 percent, and Hispanics at 52 percent).

We’re More United Than We Are Divided

When it comes to what we want from police and how to improve policing, Americans are far more united than we are divided. It’s simply not controversial to suggest police should be transparent, wear body cameras, receive de-escalation training, or only take a person’s stuff after they’ve been convicted of a crime.

Furthermore, these data show that we don’t all have to agree about the source of every policing problem in order to support criminal justice reform. Despite different perceptions of how the police actually do their jobs, Americans reach consensus about how police should do their jobs. Furthermore, Americans of all backgrounds support a variety of reforms that many criminal justice scholars believe can help keep police safe and mend relationships between police and the communities they serve.

The Data Suggests Unisex Bathrooms Are A Bonanza To Male Perverts,"One year ago in February 2015, the Vancouver Province ran a story on the rise of voyeurism in British Columbia, my home province, with the headline “How can we get men to stop doing this?” The sober reality is that the crime of voyeurism, almost always by males, may be virtually impossible to stop. Voyeurism is an enormous monster that lives in the shadows of our culture, hidden to many, but continually nourished by advancing technology, pervasive pornography, and increasing opportunity.

Voyeurism has been seen as a minor crime historically, but recording technology and victim statements are beginning to change that. One of the voyeurism cases the Province article cited was that of Jonathan Stringer, who hid a video camera in a unisex public washroom in Whistler, BC. One of his victims shared the effect it has had on her: “I have post-traumatic stress disorder from it. I was off work for a couple months, I was having problems sleeping and having weird dreams about being watched. It definitely affected me and made me fear for my safety.” More and more, voyeurism is starting to be recognized for what it is: sexual assault against women.

Advancing technology is also changing how seriously we perceive this crime. Not only is miniaturization making it easier for men to record women, but the fact that pictures and video can be stored, shared, and viewed over and over again, has significantly changed the nature of the crime from the traditional “peeping tom.”

It Happens More Than You Think

Inherent in the question “How can we get men to stop doing this?” is the question of prevalence. Is voyeurism widespread, or limited to a few scattered predators? A look at the literature and studies on voyeurism reveals surprisingly little. In a day and age where every topic has seemingly been studied in minute detail, there is a glaring paucity of good information on the subject.

But the data that does exist is eye-opening. Templeman (1991) found that no less than 42 percent of college men in a rural sample reported that they had engaged in voyeurism. Bradford et al. (1992) reported that “of 443 adult males studied, 115 admitted to voyeurism” (cited from Krueger, 2016). Rye & Meaney (2007) found that 61 percent of the men in their university sample would engage in voyeurism if the likelihood of getting caught was 25 percent (cited from Krueger, 2016).

These enormous percentages suggest that voyeurism is far more prevalent than commonly thought. It’s not only because of the amount of men who are voyeurs or express voyeuristic desire, but also because of the amount of acts committed by those who are recognized as paraphilic (anomalous or deviant in their sexual behavior). Langstrom & Seto (2006) cite a 1988 study of sexual deviants by Abel, “Exhibitionistic and voyeuristic acts occurred up to 150 times more often than official police arrest statistics indicated.”

We see this not only in the literature, but also in the news. In May 2016, David Walker (archived) was convicted of voyeuristic activities, including filming “hundreds of women in swimming pool changing rooms,” most of which probably occurred in unisex facilities, a common layout in public pools in the United Kingdom.

In December 2015, George Thomas was convicted of voyeurism after police found personally filmed voyeuristic videos of more than 3,500 people in his possession. Yes, that number is correct. These were recorded over a six-year period. Thomas was finally discovered when a female colleague found a recording device in the unisex staff shower room.

Voyeurism Seems to Be On the Rise

Some of these cases have had high visibility, but are incidents actually on the rise? As Krueger explains in “Noncontact Paraphilic Sexual Offenses” (2016), it has been difficult to track historically because of how it is criminally categorized in different countries, including the United States. In Great Britain, however, they do have a criminal offense for voyeurism.

We did a search at The Law Pages, and found a significant rise in voyeurism convictions. In the years 2006-2009 there were only 2.25 convictions per year. A significant rise was noted in 2010-2012 where the average rose to six convictions per year. However, over the last four years, 2013-2016, this number has exploded even higher, up to an average of 16 convictions per year.

These scary statistics on voyeurism prevalence, incidents per perpetrator, and the exponential rise of convictions have a significant bearing on “bathroom bills” and allowing access of biologic males into women’s safe spaces. At WOMAN Means Something, we oppose trans-advocacy policies and bills like Canada’s Bill C-16 which, although well-intentioned, put many women at risk of sexual violence.

On January 14, 2017 we released a set of data, with original sources, that documents no fewer than 140 incidents in North America and the United Kingdom of sexual violence to women by biologic males in safe spaces like washrooms and change-rooms. Seventy-six of these recorded incidents took place in 2015 and 2016. To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive database on these kinds of incidents available. The vast majority of these were of non-transgender males who took advantage of unisex spaces to perpetrate voyeuristic activities against women.

Given the statistics found in the literature, it is highly likely that these incidents represent the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Policy makers and politicians need to understand that the push to open women’s spaces is taking place in the middle of a voyeurism epidemic. Rights and freedoms don’t live in a vacuum. In this case the rights of one group (trans individuals) dramatically affects the rights of another (females).

How can we get men to “stop doing this”? There may not be an easy answer. But until we find one, let’s make certain that we do not increase the opportunities for women to be sexually victimized. Where there has been opportunity, there has been sexual violence. There is enough data now that this is clear, and there is no excuse. If you care about sexual violence against women, we must act to keep their spaces safe.

Although a conservative, he is working right across the political spectrum to ensure that women's spaces stay safe from predators.

"Yes, Violent Crime Has Spiked In Sweden Since Open Immigration","The multicultural elite so dominant here and in Europe quite perplex me: what group of people has ever so prided itself on its sensitivity to cultural differences but is, nonetheless, so hopelessly blind to those differences when they (inevitably) manifest themselves?

Multiculturalism, paradoxically, seems to presuppose uniculturalism—that all human beings actually share the same basic moral orientation. This is why we are to “celebrate” diversity, but never deplore it. (Indeed, the elite may well prosecute you, in Sweden as elsewhere in the European Union, if you dare.) Yet reality keeps intruding.

Consider the recent flap over Sweden. Last Saturday, as Robert Spencer reports, “President Trump unleashed an international storm of ridicule…when he said: ‘Here’s the bottom line, we have to keep our country safe. When you look at what’s happening in Germany, when you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden — Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers, they’re having problems like they never thought possible.’”

Trump’s statement here is somewhat unclear. It could be taken, as it was, to mean there was a terror incident on Friday (there wasn’t). “Fake news!” But even when Trump subsequently clarified that he was referring to a segment Fox aired Friday concerning Sweden’s migrant crisis, he was still denounced for spreading “false information.”

Here’s the Fox News segment Trump was referring to. Here, in turn, is CNN’s Don Lemon interviewing Ami Horowitz, the filmmaker whose film the Fox segment featured. Lemon denies violent crime has increased in Sweden. He also denies there is any evidence of a correlation between these crimes and immigration.

Actually, Violent Crime Has Increased in Sweden

So, has Sweden experienced an increase in violent crime? Well, Sweden’s official statistics do show increases in “lethal violence” (which includes murder, manslaughter and other deadly assaults) and sexual offenses over the past ten years. Between 2006 and 2015 the incidence of “lethal violence” does fluctuate, but there is a sharp 65 percent spike from 2012 to 2015. In the same period, there was also an almost 49 percent increase in sexual offenses (a category including, among other offenses, rape).

Looking at rape by itself, from 2006-2015 there was a 40 percent increase in the number of reported rapes. It is true that the number of rapes declined from 2014 to 2015, from a high of 6,697 to a still-high 5,918; but, even so, the overall upward trend is clear.

Other Swedes, namely Ingrid Carlqvist and Lars Hedegaard, argue these trends are much sharper if one takes a longer view:

In 1975, the Swedish parliament unanimously decided to change the former homogeneous Sweden into a multicultural country. Forty years later the dramatic consequences of this experiment emerge: violent crime has increased by 300%. If one looks at the number of rapes, however, the increase is even worse. In 1975, 421 rapes were reported to the police; in 2014, it was 6,620. That is an increase of 1,472%. Sweden is now number two on the global list of rape countries. According to a survey from 2010, Sweden, with 53.2 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants, is surpassed only by tiny Lesotho in Southern Africa, with 91.6 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants.

According to United Nations data, in 2010 Sweden had the second highest rate of rape in the world. Also, the 2010 number—5,960 reported rapes—was not much higher than the 2015 number—5,918. The police, by the way, only locate less than 15 percent of the perpetrators.

Data Also Suggests the Uptick Is Due to Immigrants

More controversial is what explains these increases. Some contend the increase in rape is simply a statistical phenomenon due to the application of an expanded definition of rape in 2005 and again in 2013. Others suggest Swedish women have simply grown bolder about reporting things that happened previously but went unreported. Maybe, but in the same period, as Carlqvist and Hedegaard point out, “the number of gang rapes [in Sweden] increased spectacularly.” In rapes of this kind “culprits and victims are most often young and in almost every case, the perpetrators are of immigrant background, mostly from Muslim countries.”

So might immigration help explain the increases in violent crime and rape? It is difficult to determine this, Carlqvist and Hedegaard note, because the Swedish government is no longer interested in collecting the data necessary to examine this possible connection. Indeed, the government is not only not looking for such a connection but is also actively suppressing the release of evidence supporting one.

This wasn’t always the case. As Carlqvist and Hedegaard also note, the data collected before the government stopped collecting such data does show a strong correlation:

As part of the evidence Michael Hess presented in court, he made use of whatever statistics existed on immigrant criminality in Sweden before the statistical authorities stopped measuring. Michael Hess tried to find answers to two questions: Is there a correspondence between the incidence of rape and the number of people with a foreign background in Sweden? Is there a correspondence between the incidence of rape and some specific group of immigrants in Sweden? The answer to both questions was an unequivocal Yes. Twenty-one research reports from the 1960s until today are unanimous in their conclusions: Whether or not they measured by the number of convicted rapists or men suspected of rape, men of foreign extraction were represented far more than Swedes. And this greater representation of persons with a foreign background keeps increasing: 1960-1970s – 1.2 to 2.6 times as often as Swedes

1980s – 2.1 to 4.7 times as often as Swedes

1990s – 2.1 to 8.1 times as often as Swedes

2000s – 2.1 to 19.5 times as often as Swedes Even when adjusted for variables such as age, sex, class and place of residence, the huge discrepancy between immigrants and Swedes remains. Research reports on crime in Sweden have become a rarity, but among the eighteen that were done during the 1990s and the 2000s, eleven dealt with rape. Two of these reports dealt with the connection between rape and immigration, and they both confirmed that there is a link.

Finally, it’s also worth pointing out that the rise of rape isn’t peculiar to Sweden either. The same problem is plaguing Germany, Austria (more information here), Britain, and other EU nations.

Anyone who points any of this out will likely be labeled a “Nazi.” But recognizing this problem has nothing whatsoever to do with “blood and soil” nationalism—which, along with its totalitarian cousin, communism, is utterly despicable. The problem here is rooted in culture, not blood.

Islam is increasingly hostile to the views that define western liberal democracy. To get some sense of the cultural chasm, read Carlqvist here and watch the videos she has linked (most of which have subtitles). They are chilling.

This One Simple Change To Traffic Laws Can Reduce Police Brutality,"Think of the last time you had to interact with a police officer. Chances are, it was a traffic stop. Most Americans drive, and in a country where it’s nearly impossible not to violate some criminal law while behind the wheel, to drive is literally to be a criminal. Being a criminal means the cops can stop and arrest you at any time, even to investigate a crime that has nothing to do with any traffic violation.

That’s not a big deal for most people, since they know the rare traffic ticket is probably the worst that can happen. But when getting pulled over can mean violence or even death, the prospect of a traffic stop can be a constant menace.

As anyone who isn’t willfully ignorant knows, that’s the reality facing many black (and brown) Americans today. Poverty dynamics, implicit bias, and a judiciary that has interpreted the Fourth Amendment to place few limits on police discretion all combine to create an environment in which police-related violence has become unacceptably commonplace.

Decriminalize Traffic Offenses

That needs to end. Improvements like body cameras and independent police auditors are steps in the right direction, but none of those reforms gets at the source of the problem, which is that our criminal traffic laws give police officers the discretion to detain a broad swath of the country’s population at will in the unceasing effort to nab more criminals.

The time has long since come to attack this systemic defect at its root. That means abolishing our criminal traffic laws and replacing them with an administrative enforcement system.

We’ve come to take it for granted, but it’s actually bizarre that we use police officers and criminal courts to enforce basic traffic regulations. In every other similar context — fire codes, building standards, occupational rules, and a host of others — we use administrative systems to enforce society’s health and safety standards, not criminal laws and criminal law enforcement. Yet we’re no less safe as a result.

The difference is important. Unlike police officers, administrative personnel don’t investigate crimes and aren’t empowered to arrest or detain. So, for example, when a contractor doesn’t construct a building with access to a fire escape, or a restaurant owner doesn’t require her employees to wash their hands, they aren’t arrested or put in jail by a police officer. A code enforcement official just issues them a citation or an order to correct the violation.

There’s no reason it should be any different when dealing with turn signals and speed limits rather than building construction and sanitation. Except for serious offenses like drunk or reckless driving (which should remain criminal laws), traffic violations don’t pose an imminent danger to safety.

The guy who doesn’t use his signal before changing lanes may be annoying, even incautious. But no one’s going to be hurt if he’s merely fined rather than detained by a police officer the moment he commits his transgression. Just as with any other regulatory scheme, we can rely on administrative enforcement rather than the criminal justice system to deter everyday bad driving and keep us safe.

Traffic Stops Are Not about Deterrence

One reason we’ve gotten so accustomed to our criminal regime is that a traffic stop lets a police officer cite the actual driver who commits a violation, whereas in an administrative system enforcement officials would likely just send the car’s registered owner a fine by mail. We already enforce parking laws this way, and it makes sense. The theory is that a car’s owner is responsible for making sure his car is used properly, even if he permits other people to use it. That theory applies equally in the context of minor traffic violations.

But even if we wanted to preserve the practice of on-the-spot vehicle stops, enforcement officers in an administrative system would have no criminal investigative authority, so the stop would consist of nothing more than citing and releasing the offending driver. This type of strictly non-criminal, citation-only system is very different from the world of traffic cops and criminal courts we’ve always known, and the shift from one to the other could be jarring for some.

But we can’t continue to abide the status quo. Police officers should fight crime, not supervise driving. Ending the practice of using armed police officers to stop drivers based on minor traffic violations would do nothing to impair criminal law enforcement. Quite the opposite—it would free our officers to focus on protecting us from real crime, not to mention lighten the burden on our overworked courts. At the same time, that single reform would do more than any other to reduce unnecessary police-related violence.

Let’s stop accepting that people suffering or dying because of minor traffic violations is inevitable. It isn’t. People only suffer or die because we have elected to use criminal laws to regulate an innocuous everyday activity. Abolishing those laws and replacing them with a simple administrative system is the first necessary step to fixing the problem.

We owe it to our fellow citizens, especially our citizens of color, to do that (rather than the opposite) before yet another person is needlessly jailed, assaulted, or killed simply because she had the audacity to get behind the wheel of a car.

The Conflict Between Racism And Law And Order Is All About Big Government,"The need for order in society divides both the left and the right. Libertarian versus conservative, progressive versus anarchist, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can fully describe themselves as the party of order. Even among those who agree on the value of order, there is disagreement. For the right, those interested in order are primarily interested in the old older, informal controls enforced by societal pressure, and respect for tradition. On the left, both factions are (or were) forward-looking, the only difference being which method would best propel us to the glorious future, radical freedom or radical bureaucracy.

Chris Hayes’s new book, “A Colony in a Nation,” is above all a book about order and how the people’s desire for it contributes to unequal treatment of different groups of Americans, typically on account of race. The book begins with a discussion of the disorder of the past several years, especially events in Ferguson and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015, on which Hayes reported extensively for his show on MSNBC, All In with Chris Hayes.

He tells the tale with which Americans became familiar during those crises through the reporting of Hayes and others: a community, mostly black, alienated against their local government, spurred to near-revolution by the death of a young black man at the hands of police. Ferguson and Baltimore differed: the first is a suburb run by white Republicans; the second is a city run by black Democrats. Urban mismanagement is bipartisan, and trouble between police and a populace can occur no matter which party runs the government.

People’s reaction to the events showed the divides on right and left. Some were appalled at the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray, but recoiled at the violence that followed. Others reserved judgment on the police officers’ actions, but found the quasi-militarized force that took to the streets to restore order as overkill. Hayes is good at showing this division of opinion, whether within communities or within individuals. The latter is the more difficult task. Most of us are not fully for liberty or fully for order. There are times to be for one or the other, and there are times where we think that both can co-exist.

Hipster Elegy

Hayes also explores his own thoughts on the matter, and the book at times resembles a memoir as much as a current events work. His writing is effective here, as he turns the journalistic lens on his own life and his own interactions with disorder in American cities. Hayes writes of commuting from his childhood home in Norwood in the Northwest Bronx through poor, black neighborhoods in the South Bronx and Harlem to his magnet school on the more affluent Upper East Side of Manhattan, the emotional responses it provoked, and the experience of growing up in a city divided by race and class.

Commuting through a dangerous city at the height of the national crime wave would be enough to make anyone nervous, and his recounting of an incident in which he was the victim of a street crime rings true to anyone who has experienced the same—which could include most city-dwellers in those days. Hayes spins that feeling of fear out to a national scale, using it to explain the emotional state that led most of America to embrace the tough-on-crime measures of the era. Although reluctant to credit any one policy with the reduction in crime that occurred throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he does admit that it was a more dangerous time at the beginning of that period than at the end. Any honest observer would be hard-pressed to deny it, and Hayes cites the telltale statistics of murders in New York: from a record 2,245 in 1991 to just 352 in 2015. Other crime similarly decreased.

Hayes also discusses the general seediness of New York in those days—his word, and an accurate one. While he prefaces the section by saying that “this phenomenon was quite distinct from the massive spike in crime,” he says that the same feelings of insecurity and distrust are inspired by seediness as by criminality. It is a distinction that is rather too fine to be believed. Many of the seedy elements of the public scene he describes are also crimes: aggressive panhandling, public intoxication, and the like. They are crimes not simply because they disturb decent people’s sense of order, although that certainly figures into it. The acts are also dangerous (or at least lead to danger) in a way that the public has judged, rightly, should not be tolerated.

A scene of Hayes visiting a police training center is a useful counterpoint to the prevailing narrative on the left of cops who are indifferent to the community they serve. At the Morris County sheriff’s office, the author went through training scenarios that made him quickly realize how easy it is for a cop to find himself in a dangerous situation, and how fast fear for one’s life can cause that situation to escalate. As things in the mock-up soon go sideways, Hayes looks at the situation with equanimity. “We’re only one scene in,” he writes, “and already the self-righteous liberal pundit has drawn his weapon on an unarmed man holding a cinder block.” The author’s self-awareness, here and elsewhere in the book, sets it apart from some other writers’ punditry that rapidly descends into unreadable screeds.

Muddled History

Other discussions are more off the mark. Several times, Hayes mentions redlining, the practice by which banks limited their mortgage lending the residents of white, non-immigrant neighborhoods. The odious practice, first encouraged by the Franklin Roosevelt administration through the newly created Federal Home Loan Bank Board, limited the ability of blacks and certain whites to borrow against their homes, cutting off what would become a major source of credit for more favored groups. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 banned the practice, which at least took the government out of it even if it did not stop furtive, private discrimination.

How redlining could be responsible for Ferguson’s troubles is unclear. When it was outlawed, Ferguson was still 98.55 percent white, according to the 1970 census. Similarly, what Hayes calls Richard Nixon’s “highly effective racialized Southern Strategy” is interesting as an historical matter (and the degree to Nixon “racialized” anything is still a matter of scholarly debate) but it, too, predates Ferguson’s integration, let alone any conflict between the black and white populations there.

Redlining may have set the scene for the segregated neighborhoods of New York, but the changes that occurred in Ferguson’s demographics came much later. Everything in history is connected, but at a certain point the connections grow too tenuous. Redlining is widely condemned, and justly, but it is not the source of all ills. For someone so reluctant to name any cause of the decline in crime, he is very sure of the causes of society’s other ills.

Slighting Nixon is especially odd, given that the title of the book springs from a 1968 speech by Nixon. The “New Nixon” who campaigned for president that year captured America’s anxiety about crime, but also spoke thoughtfully about the need not to criminalize an entire class or race—exactly the sort of sentiment Hayes seemingly wishes to espouse. In criticizing his predecessor’s Great Society welfare state, Nixon also wove a plea for unity into his remarks, calling for all Americans to “build bridges to human dignity across that gulf that separates black America from white America. Black Americans, no more than white Americans, they do not want more government programs which perpetuate dependency. They don’t want to be a colony in a nation.”

Government: The Problem and the Solution

Hayes correctly identifies the need for city financing as driving the escalation of police interactions with the populace. In Ferguson, especially, the city government takes in a disproportionate share of its funding through fines imposed by for all manner of minor violations. The impulse is understandable: Which is likely to be more popular means of financing government, a new tax or fines on criminals? Fines sound great when they are imposed on bad people; they are less popular when it turns out that the “bad” people are nearly everyone. But it is hard to see more government as the solution here. If the problem is that the need for income turns a city into a police state, perhaps less government, requiring less funding and leading to fewer interactions with police would benefit the people more.

The author embraces Nixon’s phrase, but rejects the idea behind it. For him, the colonization of America’s black neighborhoods is the product not of government programs but of the entire history of racism in the United States. But disentangling the two is more difficult than that. Redlining was racist; it was also big government. The same is true of segregation and any number of other government programs. So, in fact, is actual colonialism. Where Hayes’s analysis falls short is not in identifying the problem, but in the solutions at which he hints. For problems caused largely by government, perhaps more government is not the solution.

Hayes has a fluid writing style, and his prose is enjoyable to read. While his solutions are typical of the left and not fully fleshed out, the problems he identifies are real and well-described here. “A Colony in a Nation” is not ground-breaking, but it is a serviceable synopsis of the civil disturbances of the past several years and the conditions that led to them. What cities like Ferguson and Baltimore await is a solution that is better than just more of the same.

"Bill James On The Cubs, Analytics, Crime, And JonBenét Ramsey","Bill James is a baseball writer, historian, author, and statistician. He joins Federalist Radio Hour to discuss the Cub’s World Series victory, the role of analytics in sports, and our obsession with popular crime. James also answers audience questions about this year’s baseball season.

“The war on analytics is over and we did win,” James said. “Analytics is not a theory that we’re smarter than everybody else. It’s just knowledge.”

Popular crime can have an influence on policy and law, and the new media fascination with true crime stories. “Crime and politics are joined at the hip because protecting us from criminals is one of the basic functions of government,” James said.

Netflix's 'Casting JonBenet' Gives Murder The Treatment It Deserves,"One of the producers of Netflix’s “Casting JonBenet” recently referred to the documentary as the “craziest piece of community theater.” This is a great analogy for what might be the most unconventionally interesting true-crime documentary — if you can really even call it that — ever created.

Revisiting high-profile mysteries (most of which aren’t truly that mysterious, to be honest) is a popular genre. One victim who has gotten plenty of attention has been JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old girl who was found murdered in her Boulder, Colorado home on Christmas 1996. Her story generated immense national interest at the time, becoming one of the first cases to be shoved into the 24-7 cable news grinder. A lot of this coverage was driven by JonBenét’s participation in prepubescent beauty-queen competitions and the assumed sexual nature of the crime (due to the posing of the body), both of which turned out to have nothing to do with the murder.

Carrying around my own small obsession with the case, I watched “Casting JonBenet” with great curiosity. While the framing insinuates a documentary, “Casting JonBenet” avoids almost all of the traditional elements of the genre. For instance, there are no experts pointing to “newly unearthed evidence” or brand-new suspects. In fact, “Casting JonBenet” doesn’t even attempt to solve the mystery. Not really. It’s a film about how notorious cases embed themselves into the American consciousness.

The premise is simple: Australian documentarian Kitty Green filmed amateur actors from Boulder auditioning for roles in a purported movie about the Ramsey case. As the actors prepare for their readings, Green coaxes them to talk about the case and themselves. Some of the performers claim to have a nebulous connection to the time and place of the murder, while others only have faint recollections of the crime. All of them have plenty of thoughts.

Many of the rumors and wild conspiracy theories the actors throw around — a secret cabal of Boulder child abusers did it! — are patently ridiculous. But by allowing them to recount their presumptions and theories without any exposition or debunking, Green illustrates just how many smart, average Americans can internalize tabloid culture.

Maybe it’s a kind of method acting, but many of the actors begin to deconstruct the crime or take on the role of amateur psychological profiler. A would-be actress, who studiously watched hours of tape of the Ramseys, confidently explains why Patsy’s hand motions prove she is a fraud. A Chicago cop breezily relates that his precinct would use the Boulder police investigation of JonBenet as an instruction manual on how not to conduct their own. “Casting JonBenet” is about the actors, who range from the tightly wound to the quirky (a local cop who teaches S&M techniques on the side).

As far as the case goes, the most intriguing part of “Casting JonBenet” is watching these actors, who come with various degrees of skill, struggle to transform into characters of a gruesome tale. Some are compelled to grapple with large issues of evil — more specifically, if parents might be able to murder their child and then create sexually depraved distractions to cover it up. For many, it seems beyond their moral comprehension.

Watching the Patsys attempt to calibrate their tone to telephone the police about their daughter’s kidnapping is uncomfortable to watch, especially for someone who suspects her as having played a part in the crime. Watching the aspiring Johns discover JonBenet’s body in the basement (staged incorrectly in the documentary, but that’s another story) is similarly disconcerting. Then, witnessing the melodramatic Pastys and stilted Johns try to work together to make that infamous press conference seem real only highlights the implausibility of the Ramseys’ story.

“How do you go on camera and say these lines and make them sound real?” asks one of the Patsys. “You can’t” is the answer.

Then there are the powerful auditions of the children. Watching a boy Burke’s age (the brother that CBS tried to pin the murder on) trying to act the part reveals the awkwardness, shyness, and immaturity of children that age. Witnessing six-year-old girls auditioning for the role of a murder victim is, to say the least, off-putting; perhaps as offputting as those beauty pageants themselves. Yet it goes a long way in re-humanizing a little girl who has been fodder for entertainment.

Don’t get me wrong, there are limits to the effectiveness of this trick, especially for those with only a mild interest in the case. Yet, in a weird and sometimes spooky way, this case may have finally gotten the treatment it deserves.

How Expecting Police To Be All Things To All People Can Fuel Violence,"Fifty-two years ago, in Watts, California, two officers pulled over a black motorist who they believed to be drunk. A scuffle began, and things turned violent. By the time the violence ebbed, 34 people had been killed, and $40 million worth of damage had been done.

Twenty-five years ago, the story seemed to repeat itself: another drunk driver, another police beating, another race riot in southern Los Angeles that claimed dozens of lives and left neighborhoods smoldering.

If riots were earthquakes, LA would be due for another. A recent poll suggests that Angelenos are bracing for exactly that. A quarter-century after Rodney King, these stories still feel uncomfortably contemporary. Race riots are back, and policing is still the main fuse. Over the past three years, violent demonstrations have hit Ferguson, Charlotte, Milwaukee, and other cities, even as homicide and gang violence become more prevalent across multiple American cities. We’re feeling the tremors. Is a major quake on the way?

We Have To Think About Our Expectations For Police

In a way, it’s maddening to find ourselves comparing riots to earthquakes. Humans, after all, are not tectonic plates. We have agency. No one benefits from a quadricentennial torching of civilized society. So can’t we just find a way to get along?

Reflecting on this sad state of affairs may tempt us to think in cosmic terms, viewing racial unrest as a fixed feature of our national character, perhaps derived from America’s Original Sin or deep-seated tribal loyalties. A finer-grained analysis may yield a less bleak (if more prosaic) diagnosis. It’s possible to keep order without creating unrest. The past few decades have in fact seen some remarkable innovations in crime control. If we can develop and implement them properly, it should be possible to maintain civic order without sacrificing Constitutional rights.

We may need to think more carefully, however, about deep tensions in the expectations we place on police officers.

The Man Who Professionalized Policing

Fundamentally, we want officers of the law to be three things: warriors, community workers, and sleuths. Fight crime, serve the public, and crack the case. These functions are not mutually exclusive, but choosing the right hat for the right situation can be a scramble. A mindset that supports one of these functions may not be optimal for another.

The King riots drew the nation’s attention to the shortcomings of a “warrior”-oriented model of policing. For decades before the fateful Simi Valley verdict, however, the LAPD had been the nation’s leading model of “professionalized policing.”

When the legendary Bill Parker took over the LAPD in 1950, he immediately began applying his experience as a decorated World War II veteran. Effectively, he made his police force into a kind of domestic military.

Seeing egregious problems with corruption and inefficiency, he slimmed down the force, creating an administrative structure that was meant to insulate his officers from political and public pressures. Parker wanted his department to set its own agenda, and he wanted his officers thinking of themselves as crime-fighting professionals, not on-call neighborhood boy scouts. On his watch, the sleek and imposing squad car replaced the friendly beat cop. His police academy trained recruits in tactics modeled on military peacekeeping efforts. Some credit the legendary chief with coining the term “thin blue line.”

How Professionalization Became Militarization

Parker was beloved for a reason. He made great strides towards reducing corruption and restoring the image of the LAPD. He was a fan of probity, and not overly enamored of the tough-guy police ideal. If you’ve ever watched “Dragnet,” you’ve seen his running commercial for the style of policing he wanted: upright, prudent, by-the-book.

Professionalization has its benefits, but there are downsides too. Parker’s protégée vividly illustrated this point across his 14 years running the LAPD. Undeniably talented, Daryl F. Gates’ passion for fighting crime was never adequately tempered by an appreciation of restraint. He is remembered today as the father of SWAT (originally meant to be the “Special Weapons Attack Team”), as well as for the thousands of indiscriminate arrests made under “Operation Hammer” in the late 80’s. After a lifetime of pursuing the bad guys, it was sadly ironic that Gates ended his career in a firestorm of criticism over his decision to attend a fundraiser just as the King riots were spiraling out of control. He spent his retirement making police-themed video games. Parker may have “professionalized” the LAPD, but under Gates, it was “militarized.”

We needn’t justify rioting to draw lessons from the King debacle. Realistically, we do need crime-fighters to be tough. At the same time, domestic policing is not warfare, and police can’t be effective when they’ve come to view ordinary citizens as enemy hostiles. Officers are at far greater risk entering neighborhoods where law enforcement is viewed with mistrust. They’re more likely to be targeted, and they can’t get the information they need to close crimes. Professionalization paid certain dividends, but the costs of that distancing were painfully evident on April 29, 1992.

How To Go Beyond Tough-Guy Policing

Is it possible to dial back the aggression and still maintain order? There are reasons to think so. The warrior needs to be balanced by his counterparts: the social worker and the sleuth. In the years since the King riots, two other models of policing have made significant strides in certain parts of the country, giving more space to these two other personae.

Community policing is a self-consciously demilitarized model that encourages officers to cultivate personal connections to the communities they police. In the years following the King riots, the Department of Justice actively promoted community policing, and most departments now incorporate certain elements. The goal is to help police become trusted, credible community members, not just specialized crime-fighters. Military tactics are de-emphasized, and developing community relationships is treated as part of the job. Officers are more extensively trained to recognize and respond to drug addicts and the mentally ill, exploring alternatives to violent force.

These efforts seem to be bearing some fruit in certain neighborhoods, among them the historically-troubled Watts, where LA’s first major riot began. Violent crime is down, and residents indicate that they feel safer. Apparently it is possible to defuse these longstanding tensions, though this does seem to require concentrated and sustained efforts of a sort that might be difficult to replicate in every neighborhood.

The Promise Of ‘Intelligent Policing’ For The Future

Problem-oriented policing (sometimes called “intelligence policing” or “predictive policing”) uses data, analytics, and a results-oriented managerial system to improve crime control without needless aggression. Many elements of this were incorporated into New York’s famous CompStat program, piloted by crime-fighting entrepreneurs like William Bratton. Taking charge of the NYPD’s Transit Police in 1990, Bratton recognized that he was not, for the most part, dealing with hardened criminal masterminds. Trained officers have a huge advantage in dealing with drug addicts, drunks, and gang-banging teenagers; they’re smarter, better-trained, and better-equipped.

With a clearer understanding of crime patterns, we should be able to deploy resources more efficiently, targeting particular problems without being unnecessarily invasive. Sweeping, indiscriminate arrests (such as Gates used) require tremendous manpower and create widespread resentment. Intelligence-based models aim to make policing smarter rather than tougher, and the results in New York and elsewhere have been impressive. They are probably a major reason why crime continued dropping across the late 90’s and early 2000’s.

We Haven’t Entirely Dissolved Unrest

Given these advances, why does policing continue to cause unrest?

Cell phones are one factor. In the early 90’s, frustrated LA residents were jubilant that at last there was real video evidence to substantiate their complaints. Cell phones now inundate us with videos of varying quality, and this “episodic transparency” is a public relations nightmare for police departments. The court of public opinion seems to grow hastier and less judicious with each passing year. Rodney King’s supporters at least waited for a verdict before taking to the streets; Black Lives Matter doesn’t usually offer that same courtesy. A long-term solution will have to involve better transparency and some restoration of public trust. In the short run, things are admittedly volatile.

Beyond the technology issue, the fact remains that a plethora of new theories and techniques won’t automatically translate into reliably good policing. Implementing any of these methods takes considerable time and effort, and they aren’t always easily compatible. Community policing methods are somewhat in tension with the more professionalized model, and the latter has started to seem more relevant again as counterterrorism becomes a growing concern. Intelligence-oriented models aren’t strictly incompatible with either, but they add a level of complexity to police operations that can complicate other efforts. It’s hard to be a warrior, a worker, and a sleuth, all in a single day’s work.

Police officers are expected to be many things to many people. Sometimes, under the pressure of a snap decision, they pick the wrong hat. As we consider the future of policing, we need to ask some hard questions. Is it reasonable to expect police to be tough enough for drug lords and terrorists, but also sensitive enough to deal with peevish teenagers? How many hours can we ask cops to log building community relationships, considering that we also expect them to be rooting out terrorist cells, chasing down muggers, and asking the guy up the street to turn down his stereo? Transparency is good, but we also need a realistic sense of the limits of law enforcement.

We Can Help Prevent Future Riots

Riots are not like earthquakes. Measures can be taken to forestall them. In our time, we need to be more judicious about our use of police power. Police officers should not be used as petty tax collectors, or as a go-to source of manpower for public projects. We should be especially careful about asking police to initiate potentially-violent confrontations with citizens (as in no-knock raids on civilian homes). Maintaining the balance between warrior, worker, and sleuth is hard enough without piling on extra burdens. Beware mission creep.

Finally, we need to work towards greater transparency in policing. In the present climate, it’s not enough just to ask people to support the police. Many people simply don’t trust law enforcement, perhaps for good reasons. Citizens do need to take an active interest in cooperating with police to solve neighborhood problems. Be willing to do more than just protest. But community relations are a two-way street, and better oversight is needed to ensure that abuses are seriously investigated, and that cops with a consistent pattern of problematic behavior aren’t simply allowed to go on terrorizing citizens.

Humans have agency. We can change. Let’s do what we can to prevent a sequel to the Rodney King riots.

"The Forgotten Tale Of How The FBI Stopped A Bloody, Racist Conspiracy","In the true crime masterpiece Killers of the Flower Moon, David Grann overtakes fiction once and for all: Truth is just that much stranger. The revelations here come from a once well-known case, one of the FBI’s very first—the murders of many wealthy Osage Indians by covetous white settlers, some of whom had married their oil-rich Osage victims.

Grann, who previously authored the bestselling Lost City of Z, has taken a cruel tragedy, and paced the telling of it like a thriller-mystery. He extracts the truth not just from unpublished case files but the living legacy of the Osage tribe, his ultimate source for reopening countless more cold cases. Those whose family lines weren’t extinguished altogether in what’s now known as the “reign of terror” lost at least one relative.

Men and women of the tribe know more from their parents and grandparents than the groundbreaking agents of the early Federal Bureau of Investigation ever managed to uncover—and they cracked the case. What the bureau pinned on one mastermind, drifter turned de facto mayor William Hale, aka “The King of the Osage Hills,” and his handful of lackeys, was really a racist killing spree.

Forgotten FBI History

After the case’s lead FBI investigator, the stalwart and upstanding former Texas Ranger Tom White, has convicted Hale and his nephews—thereby sealing his slot in history as the lawman who broke the Old West, as none of J. Edgar Hoover’s new crop of college-educated desk-trained agents ever could—the story takes a turn.

Beneath what history has told us about the FBI’s mostly forgotten first big case, there lay an altogether untapped well evil: “For a moment, before he receded from history, too, White was eulogized as a good man who had solved the murders of the Osage,” Grann writes, mounting toward a present-day denouement. “Years later, the bureau would release several of its files on the Osage investigation in order to preserve the case in the nation’s memory. But there was something essential that wasn’t included in these and other historical records, something that White himself had missed. There was another layer to the case—a deeper, darker, even more terrifying conspiracy, which the bureau had never exposed.”

Every frontier hero, frontier villain, every Osage victim, every vile conspirator who got off scot free was not a character in a vivid drama but a living witness enmeshed in one. Each had his motive to murder or a weakness (love, drink, misplaced trust) exploited in the killing campaign. White husbands and wives dosed their Osage spouses’ whiskey with strychnine. The often unsuspecting victims deteriorated over months of poisoning—and even those who feared foul play found no recourse in seeking treatment for their symptoms. The two brothers who maintained a medical practice in the Osage Hills were co-conspirators in the many murder plots, and although the FBI agents questioned them, they were never convicted.

In the Osage Hills, the reservation settlements of Gray Horse and Fairfax, the Osage capital Pawhuska, and the freewheeling oil boom town of Whizbang, Oklahoma were “like a fevered vision,” Grann writes. Oil-rich tribal land, where the earning rights to all mineral legally belonged to the tribal natives, created these towns torn between two worlds. “The streets clamored with cowboys, fortune seekers, bootleggers, soothsayers, medicine men, outlaws, U.S. marshals, New York financiers, and oil magnates. Automobiles sped along paved horse trails, the smell of fuel overwhelming the scent of the prairies. Juries of crows peered down from telephone wires. There were restaurants, advertised as cafés, and opera houses and polo grounds.”

The Unkillable Mollie Burkhart

The wealth of the Osage—their ability to profit so immensely on the “underground reservation” of black gold—depended, of course, on the white man’s modern uses for a rabid oil economy. Newspapers gawked at the “red millionaires” and described expensive automobiles parked around a prairie campfire where finely dressed Osage draped in traditional tribal blankets were “cooking meat in the primitive.” This was tribal land, under the jurisdiction of the Great Mystery, the god Wah’Kon-Tah, whom the Osage—even those who’d become devout Christians, like tragic heroine Mollie Burkhart, who’d been taken from their families by missionaries and made to attend Catholic boarding school—beseeched in ceremonial dances.

Grann builds the terrors that befell them around the powerful character of Mollie Burkhart, as her mother and siblings die off around her. It’s with the mysterious disappearance of Mollie’s sister Anna, her body discovered days later in the stream where she was murdered, that the plot begins to unravel. But many more murders unfold in the next four years while a negligent sheriff and Pinkerton private investigators fumbled in the dark, foiled by conspirators. Finally, in 1925, Hoover dispatches White to take over the FBI’s field office in Oklahoma and the embarrassingly inconclusive investigation into mounting Osage murders.

Pressed into literature from life, Mollie is as central to Grann’s telling as she ever was to an extended family that depended on her. And Mollie, alone among her, siblings survived the murderous plot she married into—her husband, Ernest Burkhart, was William Hale’s nephew. Burkhart and his brothers did Hale’s bidding: They killed off Mollie’s sisters, so that she inherited their fortunes, which would all flow to her husband upon her death. When White and his team of investigators arrived, Mollie was a “marked woman.”

Greed, Envy, and Wrath

Overvalued oil rights and countless deaths due to their neighbors’ and purported friends’ unaccountable greed, envy, and wrath sets up an alarming contrast to the lives they led before, when they would save every last sinew from the bison carcass and eschewed land ownership according to an ancient philosophy. The “underground reservation” was a twinkle in savvy Osage lawyer Joe Palmer’s eye when, in 1904, he negotiated the Indians’ exclusive hereditary headrights to “the oil, gas, coal, or other minerals covered by the lands… hereby reserved to the Osage Tribe.”

But white “guardians”—the Bureau of Indian Affairs deemed many Osage, including Mollie’s mother and sister, insufficiently competent to execute their own estates—routinely fleeced them, embezzling and grossly overcharging for major and minor purchases alike. Joe Palmer had pleaded with Congress to abandon the guardianship rule, by which independence often depended on how much or how little Indian blood an member of the tribe had—but to no avail. Rich enough to buy their “guardians” a dozen times over, the Osage were less than human in the eyes of the law. Grann writes, “One Osage who had served in World War I complained, ‘I fought in France for this country, and yet I am not allowed even to sign my own checks.’”

One reading lets the cut-throat oil economy itself play the enemy. Sucked into this line of thinking as I was, I waited for a fourth quarter reveal. Until the final pages even, when Grann writes of life today in the Osage Hills, revealing hidden histories long overlooked to the popular one-villain narrative, I held onto a more cinematic red herring: There was a sinister cabal of oil barons behind it all, a conspiracy too big and shadowy and deep-pocketed and tied up in government for the twentieth century’s methods ever to root out. Eat your heart out, Teapot Dome. Grann would find out these vicious titans, I trusted: Literary journalism delivers ultimate justice to the untouchable emperors of the late gilded age.

Evil Implicates Everyone

But then there were finally too few pages left for anything like my prediction to unfurl. White, having long since convicted Hale and Burkhart, led a full life beyond the Bureau and even wound up warden to Hale at Leavenworth. Hale would be granted parole in the 1940s, and Ernest as early as 1937, which was also the year Mollie died. The FBI was by then already, under Hoover, a bloated monarchy within the federal government, and Osage case all but forgotten fodder for newsreels that had propped up the Bureau’s tightly-controlled image as a modern crime fighting machine. During the Great Depression, the Osage saw their fortunes further diminished when the wells dried up and the price of a barrel nose dived. By the time the remaining members of the Osage tribe were permitted by Congress to run their own estates, the headrights were virtually worthless.

In the end, the truth is so much darker. Among the many murderers of the Osage there were Old West outlaws, the moral equivalent of tumbleweeds. But most, by far, were ordinary citizens who believed themselves more deserving of the Osages’ wealth, and for whom murdering an Osage Indian was not an equal crime to killing a white man. During the trials, “A prominent member of the Osage tribe put the matter more bluntly: ‘It is a question in my mind whether this jury is considering a murder case or not. The question for them to decide is whether a white man killing an Osage is murder—or merely cruelty to animals.’”

The early FBI proved its mettle breaking the lawless Old West. Modern crime-fighting, Hoover’s suited college graduates and high tech methods, had conquered the last frontier when White and his men cracked the case and brought it Hale. In the version of events Hoover advertised, modernity outmoded the evil of the old world. In landing a marketable narrative, the Bureau miss the point.

The Osage murders are not such a timely topic as some would have it. Claiming a Trumpian villain, finding for an alt-rightish nativism in the murderers’ motive, diminishes the evil exposed. In the stubborn way of true stories, this one does not conform to our hot-trending themes.

A bloody conspiracy left cold by a century’s morally careless cover-up reveals more of those hideous truths we wish we could avoid. The single bogeyman dissolves under Grann’s scrutiny and storytelling. There is no one black-hatted villain. But with so many at fault we’re left, in the end, with the human heart’s susceptibility to those grave sins that drive a man to destroy his neighbor. The scarily forgettable nearness of evil implicates everyone. It’s reason enough to tell true stories, to look to the past, in the first place, in just pursuit of what is too terrifying not to be true.

Sessions Has Neither Authority Nor Evidence To Pursue A New Drug War,"The drug problem in America, especially with regard to opiates, has been growing in the public consciousness. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions want to do something about it.

That’s an admirable idea, but increasing federal involvement in the drug war is not the way to go about it. The measures proposed last week are not those of a limited-government conservative, nor do they fit with the scheme of federalism designed by the Founding Fathers, which remains the best way to govern a sprawling and diverse nation.

The Last Drug War Was a Failure

Much of Trump’s appeal has been in how he seems to harken back to an earlier time in America, one that in his supporters’ minds was a better time. Nostalgia has its uses, and reminiscences will always be a part of people’s lives, but fond memories of the past do not always make a sound basis for government policy. In deciding what to do about crime and punishment, that is especially true.

Trump’s selection of Sessions for attorney general fits that old-time feel of the administration. Sessions was prosecuting criminals as a U.S. attorney in the 1980s, which was the golden age of the War on Drugs. As more and more dangerous narcotics flooded American communities in those days, the solution—which had widespread public support—was harsher and harsher punishments for dealers and users.

In the decades since, that consensus has started to shift. As we learned nearly a century ago during Prohibition, there is more than law enforcement to keeping addicts away from the substances they abuse. Certainly jailing drug traffickers will always play a role, but treatment and counseling are now widely seen, even among some conservatives, as an equally large part of the answer.

Sessions is not a part of that emerging consensus. As the Washington Post reported last week, “Sessions told his more than 5,000 assistant U.S. attorneys to charge defendants with the most serious crimes, carrying the toughest penalties.” This policy, the reversal of the Obama administration’s efforts to reduce the massive incarceration of nonviolent offenders, provoked a strong dissent on the Left and the libertarian Right.

In one way, he is right. No one can deny with a straight face that the increased sentences required by laws passed in the 1970s and ‘80s contributed to crime’s decline in the 1990s and 2000s. There were other factors at work—everyone has his pet theory—but keeping criminals away from the public undoubtedly reduced crime.

With that said, we must also admit that the kind of crime in question here, drug sales, has not declined in the least. Someone who wants to buy drugs in America can do so with little difficulty. Narcotics are cheap, plentiful, and available in a bewildering array of varieties. In that respect, the War on Drugs has been a complete failure.

More Crimes Means More Government

The divide on the drug war and on criminal justice reform generally runs along generational lines as much as partisan ones. Younger Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul see the bad effects of mass incarceration and the ineffectiveness in stopping the trade, and begin to consider rethinking the government’s approach to drugs, including legalizing some of the less harmful ones. Sessions, on the other hand, is more similar to those congressmen of days past who spelled marijuana with an H. Drugs, to them, are alien substances that only bad people use. For people of Sessions’s mindset, the only flaw in the war on drugs is that it has not been waged hard enough.

The divide is similar to that seen when the government tried to ban alcohol. After the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act passed, many prohibitionists predicted a profound, immediate decrease in alcohol consumption in America. The results proved otherwise. Instead of giving up or trying a different tactic, the government redoubled its efforts. They used wiretaps and surveillance, raided speakeasies with squads of heavily armed police, and generally dug deeper into the average American’s private life than ever before.

The big-government apparatus that grew around Prohibition soon adopted tactics even they would have blanched at when the amendment passed. By 1926, the Prohibition Bureau demanded that industrial alcohol supplies be increasingly poisoned with wood alcohol to prevent their diversion for use by bootleggers. As John Kobler wrote in his book, “Ardent Spirits: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition,” the result was not less drinking but more death. Wayne Wheeler, the head of the Anti-Saloon League, blamed the addict for his failures, saying that “the person who drinks this industrial alcohol is a deliberate suicide.”

Others saw the overreach in enforcement the same way many do today in the overreach of the drug war, and questioned why this crime was being treated so differently and excessively. “To meet the frailties of human nature by processes that do not prevail in the enforcement of any other law, save that of capital punishment,” wrote the New Haven Journal-Courier that same year, “is a perversion of sound government and public morals.”

But in seeking to regulate human behavior at such a personal level as dictating what we may and may not ingest, there is almost no alternative to Big Government. To control people’s lives so completely requires a massive use of money and manpower. Many people who said “there ought to be a law” when they saw a drunk passed out on the street began to realize that the solution could be worse than the disease. Sometimes a good look at the law makes one realize that there ought not be one, after all.

Small Government, Except When We Want It Big

This realization led to the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. As they did so, the federal government recognized that different communities ought to be allowed to manage the problem of alcohol abuse differently. The Twenty-First Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth, allowed for that by returning alcohol policy to the states in cases that do not involve interstate commerce.

Some states instantly turned the taps back on; others remained alcohol-free zones (at least in law), with Mississippi in 1966 becoming the last to allow alcohol. Some counties and towns across the country still ban alcohol production or sales. The effect is a compromise that lets local communities decide the best laws to govern their people.

A version of this federalist policy in drug law is what Sessions and the Department of Justice hope to stymie with their new policy. It is a strange quirk of a party that usually calls for smaller, more locally based government. Republicans want to return abortion law to the states, health care to the states, and welfare policy to the states, but on drug policy they put forth arguments for federal jurisdiction that sound an awful lot like Democrats’ ideas. In one area they could create a bipartisan consensus on federalism, the Sessions wing of the party refuses to budge.

It is not a new problem. In the late 1990s, states’ medicinal marijuana laws tested the cooperation between states and the feds on drug policy. In 2004, these disagreements reached the Supreme Court in the case of Gonzales v. Raich, which they decided the following year.

Those advocating for local control sounded an awful lot like conservatives on other matters of federal overreach, as they questioned how the federal power to regulate interstate commerce could be construed to allow banning a product that was grown and consumed entirely within one state. Essentially: if a person grows marijuana in his backyard and smokes it on his back porch, where is the interstate commerce? How is it any of the federal government’s business?

It is hard to imagine anything not able to be regulated under this standard, and conservatives typically rebel at such a broad interpretation of a limited federal power.

The Supreme Court saw things differently, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy joined four liberals in upholding federal jurisdiction over the local production and use of drugs. Echoing the sort of decisions that have given constitutional conservatives fits for generations, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that a long line of caselaw has established that “Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself ‘commercial,’ in that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.” That is to say: if the product is sold anywhere in America, anything to do with that product affects the market for it, and can be federally regulated.

It is hard to imagine anything not able to be regulated under this standard, and conservatives typically rebel at such a broad interpretation of what was originally intended to be a limited federal power. Abandoned by his usual allies on federalism issues, Justice Clarence Thomas took up the dissent. The respondents in that case, he wrote, “cultivate their cannabis entirely in the State of California—it never crosses state lines, much less as part of a commercial transaction. Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that ‘commerce’ included the mere possession of a good or some purely personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.”

Thomas’s originalism finds more favor now than even ten years ago, and hopefully the addition of strict constructionists like Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court will help turn the tide toward a rebirth of federalism. In the meantime, the Trump administration should try to remember which party elected them.

The problem of drug abuse, especially opiate abuse, is a real one, and every politician wants to be seen to do something about it. But their oaths of office do not pledge them to “do something”; they oblige them to support the Constitution. Besides being beyond their constitutional authority, much of the War on Drugs has been an ineffective failure. Instead of doing more of the same, Sessions and Trump should consider a new approach, one that favors treatment over punishment and local control over federal fiat.

12 Ways The Southern Poverty Law Center Is A Scam To Profit From Hate-Mongering,"What makes the hate list of the Southern Poverty Law Center different from the “burn book” a high school queen bee keeps in the 2004 movie “Mean Girls”? Answer: not much. The burn book was a compilation of insults, gossip, and rumors intended to repel the diva’s “enemies,” label everybody, and keep herself on top of the heap.

The SPLC uses its list of designated hate groups in much the same way: to manipulate the lives of others, smear reputations, control personal relationships, and reap the spoils. The dynamic is the same, whether played on the adolescent scene or in the political arena. Both lists serve mostly as power-mongering tools.

In civilized societies, we supposedly grow out of that sort of tribalism. But look around and you’ll see such behaviors proliferating in every sphere: politics, journalism, education. A recent headline in the Washington Examiner nailed it: “The Bret Stephens Freak Out is a Reminder that the Media Is Basically a Massive High School Clique.”

Why do so many folks treat the SPLC with undeserved reverence, the way too many high school kids treat a self-appointed nasty queen bee? Why do they accept the Southern Poverty Law Center as the nation’s Grand Inquisitor dictating who may speak and who must shut up? And why are its smears and caricatures so often blindly accepted at face value? What qualifies the SPLC to act as judge, jury, and social executioner of any human being who is not their blind supporter?

Those questions have been hanging in the air for decades. As with all vilification campaigns, the SPLC plays a dangerous and cruel game under the guise of defending victims. So let’s take a closer look at some of the SPLC’s history and behavior. Let’s count some ways it’s a con game.

1. It’s a Big-Money Smear Machine

The SPLC’s main role is as a massively funded propaganda smear machine. The following information on the SPLC, provided by Karl Zinsmeister of Philanthropy Roundtable, is an eye-opener: “Its two largest expenses are propaganda operations: creating its annual lists of ‘haters’ and ‘extremists,’ and running a big effort that pushes ‘tolerance education’ through more than 400,000 public-school teachers. And the single biggest effort undertaken by the SPLC? Fundraising. On the organization’s 2015 IRS 990 form it declared $10 million of direct fundraising expenses, far more than it has ever spent on legal services.”

2. The Center’s Work Has Incited Violence

The SPLC’s agitation and propaganda have proven to incite violence. Any person or organization of note who doesn’t get with the SPLC’s political agendas—whether they promote family integrity, religious freedom, U.S. immigration law, or anything else—is liable to end up smeared as an SPLC-certified agent of hate.

The SPLC website keeps tabs on designated bad guys with a Hate Map of the United States and an invitation for readers to #reporthate. The SPLC’s hate list includes the Family Research Council in Washington DC, and the 2012 shooting at FRC headquarters was inspired through the influence of SPLC agitprop, according to the gunman himself. He would have committed mass murder if he wasn’t stopped.

The recent mob violence in response to social scientist Charles Murray’s talk at Middlebury College, and the assault of a faculty member there, were products of the SPLC’s smear of Murray as an “extremist.” The list goes on.

3. SLPC Uses Emotion-Laden Images to Spread Innuendo

SPLC uses emotion-laden images with nary any evidence to “spread stigma just by innuendo.” Zinsmeister from Philanthropy Roundtable notes: “Over the years, numerous investigators have pointed out that most of the scary KKK and Nazi and militia groups that the SPLC insists are lurking under our beds are actually ghost entities, with no employees, no address, hardly any followers, and little or no footprint.”

But “hate groups” and “extremist organizations” are great copy, especially for fundraising. So the SPLC list of storm-troopers-in-our-midst is catnip for journalists looking for dramatic stories. SPLC’s lack of reasonable criteria for who goes on its list of crazies combines effortlessly with careless reporting, and spreads stigma just by innuendo. Mere proximity to SPLC’s arbitrary “hate” list is enough to tar even the worthiest group.

4. The FBI Stopped Citing SPLC as a Resource

Two years ago, the FBI deleted the SPLC from its website’s list of legitimate resources on hate crimes. This is a promising sign of growing clarity that the SPLC’s designations for hate groups lack legitimacy. There also seems to be growing boldness in calling out the SPLC for its tactics intended to shut down serious scholarship.

5. People On Its Political Team See the Problems, Too

Even some self-identified progressives are taking issue with SPLC vilification campaigns after the 2012 SPLC-inspired shooting at the Family Research Council. The SPLC’s emotionally charged rhetoric ignites divisions among people rather than healing anything. And there’s no telling where that can end up. So even leftist Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote that the SPLC’s labeling of the Family Research Center as a hate group was a reckless act.

6. Its Nonprofit Status Masks Highly Political Fundraising

The SPLC operates far more as a political action committee than as the nonprofit it claims to be. The hyper-partisan nature of the SPLC’s operations makes its nonprofit status seem like a joke. In a recent letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the Federation for Immigration Reform argued that the SPLC’s tax-exempt 501(c)3 status should be revoked because in the 2016 elections, the SPLC clearly violated the Internal Revenue Service requirement that prohibits “participating in or intervening (including the publishing or distributing of statements), in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.”

7. Its Public Activities Are a Ruse for Fundraising

The SPLC is little more than a “cash collecting machine” rooted more deeply in fund-raising opportunism than in any do-gooder impulse. The SPLC was founded in 1971, after much of the heroic heavy lifting of the civil rights era was already over and the Ku Klux Klan was pretty much beyond its death throes. But invoking the imagery of pointy white hoods still seems to be an irresistible fund-raising ploy for the SPLC.

Again, Zinsmeister at Philanthropy Roundtable calls it out: “The SPLC is a cash-collecting machine. In 2015 it vacuumed up $50 million in contributions and foundation grants, a tidy addition to its $334 million holdings of cash and securities and its headquarters worth $34 million. ‘They’ve never spent more than 31 percent of the money they were bringing in on programs, and sometimes they spent as little as 18 percent. Most nonprofits spend about 75 percent on programs,’ noted Jim Tharpe, managing editor of the SPLC’s hometown newspaper, the Montgomery ­Advertiser, in a talk at Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism.”

Zinsmeister adds: “Though it styles itself as a public-interest law firm, the Southern Poverty Law Center does shockingly little litigation, and only small amounts of that on behalf of any aggrieved individuals.”

8. Its Founder Is a Direct Marketing Guru

SPLC founder Morris Dees was inducted into the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame in 1998. That should tell you a lot. Dees’ experience as an ultra-successful direct mail marketer well precedes his SPLC days. Perhaps he employed those skills while working on George Wallace’s 1958 gubernatorial campaign in Alabama and as finance director for George McGovern’s 1972 presidential bid, as well as campaigns of Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy.

But critics say he got especially wealthy while at the SPLC, building what they’ve called his “poverty palaces,” by guilt-tripping and virtue-signaling a load of affluent white donors who identify as progressives.

9. Civil Rights Activists Say Its Founder Is ‘A Con Man’

Bona fide civil rights activists have described the SPLC founder as “a con man and a fraud.” A 2000 Harper’s Magazine article by Ken Silverstein quotes anti-death penalty activist Millard Farmer on Dees’ apparent fund-raising monomania: “He’s the Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker [notorious televangelists] of the civil rights movement, though I don’t mean to malign Jim and Tammy Faye.”

Take note also of the sentiment expressed (also cited in Harper’s) by civil rights lawyer Stephen Bright in a letter to the dean of the University of Alabama law school in 2007: “Thank you very much for the invitation to speak at the law school’s commencement in May. I am honored by the invitation, but regret that I am not able to accept it due to other commitments at that time.

“I also received the law school’s invitation to the presentation of the ‘Morris Dees Justice Award,’ which you also mentioned in your letter as one of the ‘great things’ happening at the law school. I decline that invitation for another reason. Morris Dees is a con man and fraud, as I and others, such as U.S. Circuit Judge Cecil Poole, have observed and as has been documented by John Egerton, Harper’s, the Montgomery Advertiser in its ‘Charity of Riches’ series, and others. . . . Both the law school and Skadden are diminished by being a part of another Dees scam.”

10.The Center Is Advertising For New Revenue-Raisers

SPLC is now advertising for help in “developing theories” to support its litigation projects. The following is from a current appeal to recent law school graduates at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania: “Penn Law and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) have created a new, two-year, post-graduate fellowship for a new or recent graduate to work with the SPLC’s Special Litigation Practice Group. . .The Penn Law Civil Rights Fellow will serve as an integral member of the SPLC’s legal group, conducting legal research and analysis and developing theories to support new litigation projects and advocacy campaigns …” (emphasis mine). If you need to develop a “theory” to support an argument intended to condemn those you’ve labelled as haters, there probably isn’t any there there.

11. SPLC Propaganda Seems to Encourage Hoax Hate Crimes

SPLC propaganda seems to encourage hoax hate crimes. There has been a recent surge of hoax hate crimes. In part, I believe this is due to the far reach of the SPLC’s propaganda and agitation machine, which has maligned legitimate think tanks and advocacy centers like the Family Research Center, Alliance Defending Freedom, and the Center for Security Policy. It also has smeared eminent scholars like Murray and Ayaan Hirsi Ali as well as pediatric neurosurgeon (now secretary of Housing and Urban Development) Ben Carson.

This indiscriminate free-for-all creates an easy climate in which hoaxes can thrive. (For some background on fake hate crimes, check Laird Wilcox’s publication “Crying Wolf” or his database.)

12. Its Blacklist Foments the Campus Anti-Speech Movement

The SPLC is no doubt heavily invested in the campus anti-speech movement. It stands to reason that to control “hate speech,” one must control all speech. That’s a major reason any speaker on a college campus who is unapproved by the SPLC can end up shut down in riotous fashion as Murray at Middlebury or Milo Yiannopoulos at Cal Berkeley or Gavin McInnes at New York University. If you plan to attend such an event, you’ll notice that even lesser-known speakers often need police escorts after the SPLC has blacklisted them.

A society of people who can reason isn’t good for direct mail marketers.

Anti-speech activists on campus will often cite even an association the speaker might have with someone on the SPLC list. They will also direct students to attend another event deliberately scheduled to conflict with it. This happened to me at Georgetown University when I went to hear Nonie Darwish speak about her conversion from Islam to Christianity. She had at least three police escorts, and endured a lot of slurs and hostility from audience members. The flyer I was handed before going into the talk warned that Darwish was an “Islamophobe” unapproved by the SPLC, as though that actually meant something.

Now, why would the SPLC want to demean good people who take views contrary to its own?

A society of people who can reason isn’t good for direct mail marketers. A society of people who have serious concerns about the erosion of religious liberties or free speech is not good for propagandists of any stripe. The term “hate” has been remarkably effective at suppressing independent thought and speech. Nobody wants to be labeled a bigot, and if faced with that prospect will tend to flee from “offending” views. This is the behavior modification propaganda aims for. It contributes to the noxious effects of groupthink.

The flip side is that the SPLC’s abuse of the term “hate” will attract support from a certain segment of the population that wants to suppress the views of those who disagree with them. That is good for direct mail marketers who are interested in generous contributions from the fatuously self-righteous.

Sadly, history has revealed time and again that organized vilification campaigns endanger human dignity and freedom. The SPLC treads perilous ground, trading in explosively hostile language in return for what else but money and power?",https://thefederalist.com/2017/05/17/12-ways-southern-poverty-law-center-scam-profit-hate-mongering/,2017-05-17
Police: No Evidence Killing Of Virginian Girl Was ‘Hate Crime’,"Police have recovered the body of what they believe to be a 17-year-old Virginian girl who went missing on June 18.

Nabra Hassanen was walking with some friends to McDonalds early Sunday morning between Ramadan prayers when 22-year-old Darwin Martinez Torres got into an argument with a teen in their group who was riding a bike. Martinez Torres then drove his car over the curb, scattering them. Martinez Torres later chased the group down with a baseball bat in a parking lot before abducting Hassanen in his car.

Hassanen’s body was later found in a pond in Sterling. The medical examiner ruled she died from abrasions to the head and neck. Martinez Torres has been charged with murder.

Hassanen is Muslim and was observing Ramadan, a religious fast during which many practicing Muslims abstain from eating between sunrise and sunset. Many Muslims will eat meals in the predawn hours, however, which is why Hassanen and her friends were out getting food.

Due to Hassanen’s religion and the proximity of the attack to a mosque, media originally reported the killing was potentially motivated by her religion or ethnicity. Police say, however, this is unlikely.

“Our investigation at this point does not indicate the victim was targeted because of her race or religion,” said a Fairfax Police statement. “Should new information be revealed to suggest it was, we would pursue it.”

Two boys in the group told the AP they didn’t see anything that would make them think the attack was a hate crime, and that they even originally thought it might be a friend playing a joke. Some, including Hassanen’s father, are still skeptical.

“He killed her because she’s a Muslim — this is what I tell the detective,” Hassanen told the Washington Post. “Why was he running behind the kids wearing Islamic clothes with a baseball stick? Why, when my daughter fell down, why did he hit her? For what? We don’t know this guy. He doesn’t know us.”

Road rage. Indeed.

If you think for a minute that her appearance had nothing to do with this crime, you're lying to yourself. pic.twitter.com/zIo0YiVjjK — rabia O'chaudry (@rabiasquared) June 19, 2017

Words shape narrative and we need to use correct adjectives when describing evil — Hanif J. Williams (@HanifJWilliams) June 19, 2017

Supreme Court Strikes Law Banning Sex Offenders From Much Of Internet,"In Packingham v. North Carolina, the Supreme Court took up the thorny problem of how to deal with sex offenders after they have served their time and been released from prison. In a unanimous opinion Tuesday, they ruled that however justified a state may be in protecting potential future victims from recidivist offenders, those justifications do not override the protections all Americans have under the First Amendment. The court left open the debate as to what other means governments may use to protect children from sex offenders deemed likely to repeat their crimes.

Why We Have a Bill of Rights

Free speech is one of those civic ideals that everyone agrees to in theory. In practice, when the speech (or the speaker) is particularly offensive, many are tempted to cast aside the liberties that are every American’s birthright. In North Carolina, that led the state legislature to enact a law banning registered sex offenders from accessing social media where minors might have accounts. Effectively, this bars anyone convicted of a sex crime from using Facebook, Twitter, or almost any other of the websites that are the town square for twenty-first-century communication.

To be fair the legislature: it is easy to see what they were concerned about. People who commit sex crimes against minors breach one of the most sacred parts of our social contract, harm the most vulnerable victims, and have a high rate of recidivism. Almost from the birth of the Internet, perverts have used it to make contact with unwitting potential victims. Banning them from communicating there seems one way to combat the problem. For children’s safety, it is easy to imagine even someone committed to civil liberties saying “better safe than sorry.”

But the temptation to remove fundamental liberties from an unpopular minority is exactly why the Constitution protects such liberties from the legislature’s whim. As Justice Anthony Kennedy said in his opinion, “A fundamental principle of the First Amendment is that all persons have access to places where they can speak and listen, and then, after reflection, speak and listen once more.” In his view, and that of the rest of the Supreme Court, the principle applies to ex-offenders, too.

Limits to Punishment

Of course, ex-cons have their rights restricted all the time. In some states, felons cannot vote for several years after their release. Felons lose their right to own guns, too, based on the principle that former criminals are likely to become future criminals. But even given those precedents, the Supreme Court found that North Carolina lacked a reasonable, narrowly tailored basis for depriving sex offenders of all access to social media.

The court deemed the restriction to be unduly broad. While the statute contained narrow exceptions for websites used solely for email or photo-sharing, it was still so sweeping as to bar people on the sex offender registry from a wide swath of the Internet. As Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute noted in an amicus brief in the case, the ban could even include even such sites as Amazon and the Washington Post. Sex offenders deserve to be punished for their crimes and prevented from re-offending where possible, but neither buying a novel nor reading a newspaper can be said to be reasonably related to those goals.

The Supreme Court admits that more narrow laws, such as those preventing registered sex offenders from contacting minors online, might be permissible. But banning offenders completely from half the Internet goes too far. Criminals lose some of their rights when they go to prison, and do not necessarily regain them all upon release, but there are limits to how much someone who has served his time may continue to be made a pariah under the law.

The Larger Question

This brings up the larger question of what is to be done about a class of people who have committed horrible crimes against children but who, because they have served their sentences, are now allowed to walk among us as free men. That we have sex offender registries at all suggests we have recognized that these crimes are different in nature from those that usually land a person in jail: theft, assault, drugs, etc. These are deviant crimes committed by aberrant persons whom we expect to reoffend with some frequency.

So society faces a conundrum. On the one hand, we judge these kinds of offenders to have been punished to the proper degree by the law. On the other, we still view them as ticking time bombs of depravity. The Supreme Court tells us today that chipping away at our basic civil liberties cannot be the way we choose to square the circle.

It remains to be seen whether other options—such as extended imprisonment, continuous monitoring, or something else altogether—will be considered, and whether they will be effective in finding the balance between maintaining a free society and protecting that society’s most vulnerable members.

It’s Time To Allow Concealed-Carry Permits In Washington DC,"In the wake of the targeted shooting of Republicans at baseball practice and the heroic efforts of capitol police to apprehend the shooter, it’s time we revisit an ineffective, unconstitutional law that bans adults from obtaining concealed-carry permits inside the District of Columbia.

Not only do our representatives and other government officials deserve to feel safe while doing their civic duty on our behalf, but the rest of us who enjoy DC regularly have a right to protect ourselves while visiting a hotspot for crime.

More Guns Save Lives By Democratizing Force

If any area of the country should expand gun laws, it’s Washington DC, where power is centralized, crime is rampant, and more guns will save lives. As the hub of political activity where our political leaders gather and work, there’s often hardly enough police or security to go around for representatives and their aides. Many work, attend meetings, and travel accompanied by a staff member and no protection whatsoever.

In the case of the Alexandria shooting, armed police were only on-site because a member of congressional leadership was also, which allowed a quicker resolution to an awful situation as they immediately returned fire. But what if Majority Whip Steve Scalise hadn’t been present? More people would likely have been injured or killed.

Although crime, particularly homicide, is down in the District, violent crime is still higher than the national average and the city, along with nearby Baltimore, is among the top murder capitals of the nation. Recently while at my favorite kid-friendly restaurant on Capitol Hill, I asked a cop what it was like to try to stop crime there. He shook his head and said they often reprimand the same perpetrators over and over. What about loosening gun restrictions? “They never will,” he said with a sigh. “This city is too liberal.”

The Nation’s Gun Control Mecca

Washington DC gun laws are far too strict. Currently, buying and selling handguns is illegal in the District. Residents and non-residents can apply for a concealed-carry permit, but due to a stay issued by a federal appeals court last year, “DC Just Cause” is in effect. That means folks seeking a permit to lawfully carry must go through an arduous process that includes meeting multiple requirements, “including demonstrated to the Chief good reason to fear injury to his or her person or property or has any other proper reason for carrying a pistol.”

Once the paperwork is filled out, granting permission is still at the discretion of local police. Should the police finally give permission for an individual who has demonstrated “need” to acquire his concealed-carry permit, there are still restrictions on top of that.

Even after that, a lawmaker who’s been threatened before and established his need for a permit can’t reload his six-shot revolver more than once on his foes as that would equal 12 rounds, the max amount allowed in DC. But isn’t the whole point of acquiring a concealed-carry permit to allow for personal protection or protection of defenseless around you? Limiting law-abiding citizens’ ability to protect themselves and others only makes innocents vulnerable to bad people, who have less regard for following the law. If you’re going to commit murder, you’re not going to be worrying about breaking a rounds restriction in the process.

The Second Amendment Is Constitutional, Ya’ll

Of course, fans of the Second Amendment already know the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia addressed this issue in his epic, must-read majority opinion for District of Columbia v. Heller, a landmark case overruling the District’s previous outright gun ban, for which the District has substituted an effective paperwork ban.

It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upperbody strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid. We must also address the District’s requirement (as applied to respondent’s handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times. This makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.

Lawmakers in places like DC don’t want the average adult walking around with a concealed-carry permit because they too have bought into the absurd lie that more frequent bearing of loaded weapons would be a menace to society. This has been debunked so many times it’s hardly worth doing so here. Dozens of statistics show the more gun control decreases, the more crime does too. In other words, the more people possess guns, the less others commit crime. There are countless stories of people protecting themselves or loved ones with a legally purchased handgun.

I Just Want to Protect My Kids from Crazies

Although I live in Northern Virginia, as a mother of four who homeschools at least one history buff, we make regular, often weekly, trips into DC for various festivals, conventions, exhibits, or just to revisit an favorite museum or monument. I find every year my kids are able to glean more from the same exhibits they’ve seen dozens of times.

However, in the wake of so many terrorist attacks over the last five years, especially of “soft” targets, I’ve often wondered how I would protect myself and my four kids should tragedy strike while we are visiting one of the most targeted areas in the world. The National Mall, for example, is a wonderful place to learn and roam, but there’s very little shelter. If something tragic happened there, we’d have difficulty hiding or finding shelter, let alone actively protecting ourselves.

I’m a sane adult but don’t have an express vocational need for protection, except protecting the valuables my children represent. If I were allowed to possess a concealed-carry permit, I could rest a little easier knowing I could proactively protect my children and those around me in the event of sudden crisis. As Scalia said in Heller,

Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.

No, it is not. As a friend said to me in an e-mail, “The de facto ban on concealed carry is why I travel to D.C. as little as possible. I’m way more likely to get knifed or shot or robbed there than I am just anywhere else, and it’s the one place I can’t legally defend myself. Forget that.” So it’s time for the District to lift its tight restrictions on gun laws, allow reasonable adults to acquire a concealed-carry permit, and let everyone rest easier in our nation’s capital.

Police Video Of Philando Castile’s Death Confirms He Didn’t Have To Die,"The release of the video capturing Philando Castile’s death at the hands of police officer Jeronimo Yanez has confirmed what many on the Left and Right have stated about the incident from the start: the killing cannot be justified.

After Castile was pulled over, he carefully announced to Yanez that he was legally carrying a weapon, and was only reaching into his jacket pocket for his drivers’ license. Yanez told Castile not to pull out his gun. Castile confirmed he was not going to do so, then continued reaching into his jacket pocket as he had been instructed. Yanez warned him again, shouting this time, then opened fire.

We will never know for certain what was going through Yanez’s mind as he pulled the trigger, but the information we have indicates that his fear, real though it may have been, was not reasonable, and unreasonable fear can never justify the use of force.

Philando Castile Did Everything He Should Have

Reason compels us to acknowledge that it was unlikely that Castile, a school cafeteria worker who had no history with Yanez, had it out for him from the start. A man with nefarious intentions toward Yanez would also be unlikely to state openly that he was carrying a gun, as Castile did.

It is far more likely that Castile was doing exactly what concealed carriers are instructed to do in his situation: he let Yanez know he was carrying a weapon for the express purpose of avoiding escalating tension. Yanez, after all, would have been taken aback if he saw the weapon without knowing it would be there, and Castile assuring him that he was reaching for his wallet, not his gun, would keep Yanez from deciding he had to shoot to protect himself.

Even the measured wording of Castile’s statement—“Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me”—suggests a conscientious attempt to clarify what is happening far more than it does a threat. Contra Yanez’s peculiar contention, marijuana odor does nothing to change this calculus. Merely stating that one has a weapon, even to a police officer, in the absence of any real indicator of danger, is not a crime in a country that guarantees its citizens the right to bear arms.

Not only was Castile’s carrying a weapon and making Yanez aware of it not a crime, it was legally protected. The danger present in being a police officer—and I do not underestimate how real that danger is—does not trump the law or constitutional rights. Indeed, the opposite must be the case in a free society.

Police Power Is Not Unlimited

Police officers are empowered to act upon reasonable fear of imminent danger to protect themselves, with reasonable being the operative word. Fear itself is not sufficient, as it can be based on just about anything—including, yes, skin color. The fact that distinguishing between reasonable and unreasonable fear is a heavy and difficult question is why it takes a noble person to be a good police officer.

Proper law enforcement requires both courage and wisdom to stare down danger and continue to uphold the law while doing so. Men placed in this position of power who do not have the ability to judge these situations well will harm innocent people, and when this happens those responsible must be held as accountable as anyone else.

Even if Yanez’s fear was real and not at all informed by prejudice, it was still not reasonable, and it still caused him to wrongly shoot a man who had committed no crime, for the simple fact that the man’s legal exercise of a constitutional right made him uncomfortable. For that he should be facing jail time. It is hard to fault those who demonstrate in protest. This sort of affair has been sparking outrage in this country since 1770, and I don’t think even John Adams in all his honor and skill would have found it in himself to defend Yanez in this instance.

Our Rights Are Meaningless If Not Protected

This is an event that conservatives and libertarians, if we are true to our principles, must speak on. Castile committed no crime. He was, by all accounts, a decent man whom his community loved. Indeed, he seems to have been exactly the sort of man that our Second Amendment exists to protect and empower—a “good guy with a gun.” And he was killed for it. He was killed simply because a police officer believed his lawful possession of a handgun to be too dangerous for his own liking.

If this standard goes unchallenged, and we establish the legal precedent that a civilian’s possession of a weapon makes him a threat that can be countered with the highest level of force, then it matters not what happens in our legislatures in the debate over gun rights. The right to bear arms will be meaningless, a mere sentiment that can be blown away by the state at any time its agents like.

The Second Amendment’s guarantee of a fundamental right to self-ownership and self-defense, including against a tyrannical state, is necessary. But if it does not protect citizens like Castile from having those rights violated, or hold accountable the agents of the state who violate those rights, then it means nothing and protects no one. The assault on Castile’s rights—to his life, his liberty, and yes, his right to bear arms—is an assault on all of us.

What 'Baby Driver' Has In Common With 'Crime And Punishment',"Major spoilers included.

“Baby Driver” is an easy movie to like. Edgar Wright has directed a film that’s refreshing, exciting, and innovative. Ansel Egort, Lily James, and Kevin Spacey deliver interesting and well-acted roles as the film’s key protagonists and antagonist. The movie’s soundtrack is at once smooth and exciting, with all the pulse and tension of the film’s many car chases.

But the question I kept asking myself, as I ruminated on the film this week, was this: what about Raskolnikov?

What ‘Baby Driver’ Suggests About Sin

Let me explain: “Baby Driver” is a film about a young man who’s been coopted into serving as a getaway car driver. After suffering a car crash as a kid—a crash in which he lost both his parents—“Baby” has developed a rare talent for driving cars at mad speeds. After a wealthy and powerful criminal named Doc discovers Baby’s talent, he forces Baby to assist him in his many heists.

But Baby does so only while listening to his beloved music: he owns a collection of iPods, each with different soundtracks for different days and moods. The car crash Baby experienced as a youngster gave him tinnitus, and so the music helps him drown out the ringing in his ears. But also, as David Sims notes in The Atlantic, “Right from the opening shots, Baby is doggedly trying to block out the nasty mayhem around him (in addition to his tinnitus). … Baby’s habit of recording conversations he overhears (one that eventually gets him into trouble) feels like a similar way of blinkering out the bleakness.”

But this sort of ethical evasion eventually ends for Baby. This happens, in part, because he meets Deborah: a sunny diner waitress with a similar love of music, and an innocent sweetness. The moral conflict is compounded when he’s forced to work with “Bats” (Jamie Foxx), an especially sinister and bloodthirsty criminal, whose lust for violence cannot be drowned out by any manner of music.

Baby strives to free himself from the throes of his criminal condition—but is forced to lie, steal, and kill in order to do so. Deborah becomes the Bonnie to his Clyde, accompanying him through every car chase and shooting.

Baby sees that Deborah is too good for this world of criminality. He wants something more for her—and, by extension, for herself. So at the climax of the movie, as they face all the threatening power of the law, Baby gives up. He turns himself in so Deborah can go free—and so he can really, truly be with her.

What follows is a series of scenes that seem pulled almost straight out of “Crime and Punishment.”

What ‘Crime and Punishment’ Says About Vice

In Dostoevsky’s classic novel, Raskolnikov is a self-appointed murderer: someone who wants to test out his theory that some men—the elite, the “supermen” of the world—are above the law. He believes that these elite can transgress moral codes in order to achieve some larger utilitarian good. So Raskolnikov commits murder—and throws himself into a moral and existential crisis.

His conscience affects his physical and intellectual health; friends and family wonder whether he’s mad, delusional, or ill. In the end, Sonya’s the only person who can save him—because Sonya reminds Raskolnikov of a greater, deeper truth that pulls him out of himself and into the light. It’s because of Sonya that Raskolnikov finally—after much misgiving and backpedaling—decides to turn himself in.

At the end of the novel, after Raskolnikov has been convicted of murder, he stands on trial—and several people vouch for the goodness of his character, noting his acts of charity and heroism in the past. He’s sentenced to eight years of hard labor in Siberia, and Sonya waits for him during this time.

But Raskolnikov still doesn’t necessarily see himself as having committed wrong. Rather, he considers the murder an “error,” and his choice of confession over suicide a moment of weakness, not moral clarity. It takes a dream—a revelation of his sinful pride—to draw him finally into confession and forgiveness.

How Baby Compares To Raskolnikov

In “Baby Driver,” Baby’s confession follows the same pattern: Deborah compels him to give himself up to the police. During his trial, testimonies to his kindness and good character save Baby from a harder sentence. Baby works in prison for the duration of his sentence, and is then released—finally free to be with Deborah.

Baby’s bondage to Doc could be seen as metaphorical for a bondage to sin: Baby wants to use his talents for good, to be free from a life of crime. But he can’t seem to shake himself free. His own efforts at liberty only throw him deeper into patterns of sin and death, until he finally decides to turn himself in and suffer the punishment for his actions.

But there’s a key difference between “Baby Driver” and “Crime and Punishment”: in “Baby Driver,” there’s no crucifix (Sonya gives one to Raskolnikov, thus ushering in a new pattern of thought and motive). Which is to say, we’re convinced throughout that Baby truly is a good person, a victim of cruel circumstances. His righteousness and worth are unquestionable throughout.

He kills Bats, but we all recognize Bats as worthy of death (much like Raskolnikov considered his murder victim to be a “louse” unworthy of life). He confesses his crime so Deborah won’t have to live life on the run—telling her that she’s too good for such a life. He doesn’t give himself over because he necessarily believes himself deserving of punishment. And that means “Baby Driver’s” ending, while fascinating and satisfying in many ways, falls short of a complete redemption story. Baby maintains his composed façade until the very end. He never loses his cool.

But “Crime and Punishment” suggests that until we die to ourselves, we can never really be clean. Our vices lie within, not without. They aren’t mere “errors,” mistakes we can excuse away. They lie much deeper, within our prideful hearts. Raskolnikov’s bondage isn’t circumstantial—ultimately, it’s spiritual. No prison sentence can expunge it away. Until he realizes this, he isn’t truly free from bondage. Thus, Baby understands what it takes to live freely but not, necessarily, what it takes to be free.

I don’t know whether Wright had Raskolnikov in mind when he created his film. I haven’t seen any other reviewers reference the book, or consider the parallels between its ending and the film’s. But ultimately, whereas Wright gives us the ending we want—one that suggests sin is a mere circumstantial bondage we can easily purge—Dostoevsky proffers us the ending we need: one that suggests a much harder, and more personal, voyage into freedom.

Murray Calls For Trump Official Resignation Over Rape Comments,"The Trump administration is reconsidering Obama-era sexual assault regulations that have forced campus tribunals to put their finger on the scale for accusers, resulting in students using tribunals for score-settling instead of justice. Predictably, the victimhood brigade is calling concerns for equality, accuracy, and equal treatment under the laws “rape apology,” polarizing any reality-based discussion of these endemic problems. They even got acting Office of Civil Rights head Candice Jackson to issue an apology for making an accurate generalization.

Jackson, the acting head of the civil rights office, told The New York Times that 90 percent of cases ‘fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.’ Later, in a written apology, Jackson said that what she said was ‘flippant, and I am sorry.’ ‘As a survivor of rape myself, I would never seek to diminish anyone’s experience,’ the apology said. ‘My words in the New York Times poorly characterized the conversations I’ve had with countless groups of advocates … All sexual harassment and sexual assault must be taken seriously — which has always been my position and will always be the position of this Department.’

Monday, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), a bitter foe of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, used the occasion to call for Jackson’s head.

Immediately Believing All Accusers Is Not Justice

If you, like me, are wondering how it can be “insensitive” and “egregious” to give some perspective on the massively hyped sexual atmosphere on college campuses, let’s recall the imprudent rhetoric that fuels this system that eviscerates “innocent until proven guilty” and due process as key fundamentals to the American system of law. We are literally told that wanting accused rapists to be proven guilty before being punished is making apologies for rapists. Hillary Clinton infamously tweeted this party line:

Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported. https://t.co/mkD69RHeBL — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 23, 2015

The question, of course, is how do we know a person is actually a survivor of sexual assault, not someone who during an encounter consented and participated, then later faced regrets? Well, it turns out we have a justice system precisely to sort the answers to questions like this concerning a wide variety of objectionable human encounters. I know from firsthand experience that our justice system often does not deliver justice. But it is far better-suited to investigating and prosecuting felonies than a bunch of college students and administrators.

For one thing, as Jackson pointed out in her NYT interview, “We have a justice system where nobody demands that the system itself be weighted in favor of a plaintiff. In principle, there is no reason to depart from setting up a Title IX discipline process on campus that is anything other than fairly balanced and doesn’t prejudge and weight the system in favor of a finding. We don’t do that in our court system, our criminal justice system, and I see no reason why we would want to do it in a campus system either.”

In the U.S. justice system, people are innocent until proven guilty, allowed to present evidence supporting their case, allowed to defend themselves and hire defense help, allowed to face their accusers and question their testimony, not allowed to be prosecuted twice for the same crime, and can only be convicted on clear and convincing evidence being provided of their crime. These are all civil rights bundled into the concept of “due process,” and none is available to those on campus accused of one of the most serious crimes a person can perpetrate.

“[T]ypically the accusee doesn’t know the precise charges, doesn’t know what the evidence is, and can’t confront witnesses,” writes Northwestern professor (and card-carrying feminist) Laura Kipnis in her recent book, “Unwanted Advances.” This is a violation of their rights as U.S. citizens. There can be no excuse or argument for abrogating Americans’ rights in order to give feminist hatemongers excuses to exploit victims of sex crimes for fundraising and political power. Ensuring due process for all those assaulted and charged of assault is key to prosecuting rapists, not an obstacle to that righteous pursuit.

What Is Rape? The Definitions Matter

Let’s be very clear. Rape is a heinous crime. I would countenance the death penalty for convicted rapists, as well as castration. But forcible penetration is simply not the same thing as, say, “He kissed me and I didn’t want him to,” or “I thought I wanted to have sex at the time, but I was drunk then and after I was sober knew that had been a terrible decision.” Primarily, that’s because neither of these scenarios includes forced sex, which is the definition of rape. Secondarily, there are further reasons.

Sexual interaction is largely nonverbal. Very often consent is requested and given without any words used or needed, and that means the person who initiates may make an unwelcome advance. An initial unwelcome advance is not assault, it’s a request for consent — unless the person doing it refuses to take no for a response or ignored verbal or nonverbal rejection in making the advance. Bypassing rejection is when it becomes assault, and there are levels to assault. Every sane person realizes that an unwanted kiss, while unpleasant and objectionable, is simply not the same as a man holding you down while forcing himself inside you.

When both parties are drunk, it’s also unfair to blame either one for a sexual encounter that later one or both decide was a poor decision. At the time, they agreed, or thought they both agreed, and you simply can’t erase history. It’s not fair to consent to an interaction then, once that interaction is completed, attempt to change its terms. What’s done is done. The person who attempts to change the terms after the fact is attempting to cheat the other. “Please note that this makes anyone who’s ever had sex a potential rapist,” Kipnis also notes.

Definitions matter because a rapist deserves to face serious and lifelong consequences for his or her crime. But it is horribly unjust to give these same serious, lifelong consequences to someone who has not committed this crime. Expanding the definition necessarily dilutes the punishments applied to those who fit in this category, because it is obviously unjust (to all but moral knuckle-draggers) to apply the same punishment to a groper and to a rapist. The more people are called and judged as rapists whose offenses do not fit that term, the less rape victims will be able to secure justice.

This is precisely what we see in campus tribunals. The worst a college can do to an offending student is expel him with a black mark on his record. Is that really a just punishment for a rapist? Hell, no! What kind of misogynist thinks such a degrading, trivializing thing about a woman’s virtue? A rapist deserves far worse than having to now get through community college to move on with his life. Campus courts simply cannot provide justice for victims, and it’s utterly insulting to say that getting one’s attacker expelled is a fitting consequence for a crime of this magnitude.

Regret Over Bad Decisions Doesn’t Prove Rape

Now, let’s get into some data about campus sexual assault, because it shows that most of what is happening on campuses is simply not rape, which reinforces Jackson’s characterization. Really what’s mostly going on is “teenagers doing horribly stupid things while drunk,” not “a pandemic of sicko male predators holding women down while they scream and kick.”

A 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Washington Post poll found, for example, that 67 percent of college students who said they had been sexually assaulted also said they had been drinking before the incident. Kipnis’s book notes that many of the statistics used to promote campus kangaroo courts are unreliable, such as the “only 2 percent of accusations are false,” claim, which is based on 40-year-old data from one police department. While Jackson’s “90 percent” is a generalization, a significant majority of campus assault cases involve alcohol abuse, and the connection is well-known. One study even found 80 percent of campus sexual assaults to involve alcohol.

People know this, which is why we’re not seeing the moral panic that the assault hypers want hitched to their power play. This, again, is detrimental to real victims, who must plead their legitimate cases alongside punks who use campus courts to get back at a guy for having sex with them then refusing to be their boyfriends.

“[W]e seem to be breeding a generation of students, mostly female students, deploying Title IX to remedy sexual ambivalences or awkward sexual experiences, and to adjudicate relationship disputes post-breakup—and campus administrators are allowing it,” Kipnis writes.

They May Not Have Been Raped, But They Were Violated

As crazy as this campus situation is, and as legally unactionable as it is for a woman to signal that she will have a sexual encounter, have it, then retroactively decide she was raped, I actually think there is legitimacy to that feeling so many women obviously can’t shake and which they tell us haunts them for life. People can actually consent to an encounter thinking it will be one thing, during or after the encounter find out they were robbed, then be left to deal with the consequences they didn’t foresee or were told didn’t exist.

They have no other way to express their deep feelings of violation besides accusing their partner of ‘rape.’

This is what happens when you tell young people that sex with someone you aren’t comitted to for life is perfectly good and normal, that they can act callously about sex, that sex is just a bodily function, a physical release we all need, that they’re dirty or dysfunctional if they have qualms or concerns about intimate encounters with strangers. We end up with young males (not men, certainly) who like a porn performer won’t kiss a woman they’ve just screwed, so she doesn’t “get the wrong idea” that putting their penis inside her, you know, actually meant anything.

The link between drinking and perceptions of assault on campus isn’t random. Young women openly acknowledge they get drunk precisely to lower their inhibitions so they are as sexually promiscuous as our culture insists they should be. Later, when they’re sober, they regret it.

It’s not crazy. It’s perhaps the most sensible thing going on in this whole scenario. They have no other way to express their deep feelings of violation besides accusing their partner of “rape.” It wasn’t rape, as in forcible penetration. But it was a violation of something sacred, a transgression. These young people are essentially “raping each other,” as one assault victim told the Washington Post. But how can a relativist legal system punish them justly for assaulting each other? It can’t. So the least callous participant loses, and the more callous participant walks — unless his tender counterpart starts looking for revenge inside Title IX courts.

This is all called “sex positivity” by people with no brains, souls, or hearts. I call it “rape culture.” It’s unfair to slap men with rape charges for doing what our culture tells them women want, and the women themselves are participating in. But, if not legally then morally, the women are definitely victims, and so are the men. Victims of lies and the moral cretins who tell them that the only thing you should consider before sex is whether the other person isn’t resisting.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/07/18/sen-patty-murray-calls-resignation-trump-official-accurate-campus-rape-comments/,2017-07-18
Rules Increasing Civil Asset Forfeiture Are An Exercise In Swamp Filling,"The Trump administration announced a rule this week intended to increase and encourage federal civil asset forfeiture. The Department of Justice directive comes against a backdrop of a nationwide trend toward reform on this policy, by which law enforcement seizes the property of Americans who are not charged with a crime.

Civil asset forfeiture is the name for the state’s ability to take your stuff if they suspect it’s been used in the commission of a crime, even if you have not been charged with a crime. In these cases, your stuff is deprived of the presumption of innocence and due process Americans are guaranteed. Getting it back can be a nightmare from which law-abiding citizens emerge without their property.

“With care and professionalism, we plan to develop policies to increase forfeitures,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions at a gathering of district attorneys this week. “No criminal should be allowed to keep the proceeds of their crime. Adoptive forfeitures are appropriate as is sharing with our partners.”

The problem is, civil asset forfeiture doesn’t deal with the property of criminals. Criminal asset forfeiture is a process by which property is taken in a prosecution, so at least a charge is necessary. But civil asset forfeiture is a taking that doesn’t even require a charge or indictment against a citizen to deprive him of his property.

For this reason, libertarians, conservatives, and liberals have come together in states across the country to enact reforms to a policy that violates Fourth Amendment protections and, in many places, had become abusive as a transparent vehicle for money-grabbing, leaving little to no recourse for citizens. More than a dozen states now require a conviction to confiscate property.

Attorney General Eric Holder limited the practice in 2015, prohibiting “federal adoption” (the term for sharing assets seized by states and local governments when an investigation intersects with the feds, “except for property that directly relates to public safety concerns,” such as “firearms, explosives…and property associated with child pornography.” But this limitation came only after forfeiture takings surpassed burglary in raw numbers in 2014.

The new directive is a reinstatement of the Obama administration policy pre-2015 with several added protections for property owners, according to a Department of Justice release.

The rule sets a threshold for value of seized property, meaning anything under $10,000, law enforcement would have to take extra steps to justify the taking. The new rule requires some justification of probable cause under which the property was seized during a legal review process, and it promises to speed up notification of property owners, so they can contest these takings. Each of these protections seem to have wiggle room as written, however, and it’s unclear how this rule might fare under challenge in court.

“Instead of revising forfeiture practices in a manner to better protect Americans’ due process rights, the DOJ seems determined to lose in court before it changes its policies for the better,” said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who has long backed reform in this area.

In remarks announcing the rule, Sessions said “civil asset forfeiture is a key tool that helps law enforcement defund organized crime, take back ill-gotten gains, and prevent new crimes from being committed, and it weakens the criminals and the cartels.”

But he also made clear in those very remarks just how much this is about money: “Civil asset forfeiture takes the material support of the criminals and instead makes it the material support of law enforcement, funding priorities like new vehicles, bulletproof vests, opioid overdose reversal kits, and better training. In departments across this country, funds that were once used to take lives are now being used to save lives.”

This kind of incentive has led to abuse of this law enforcement tool across the country. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently limited the powers of law enforcement there. When a West Philadelphia grandmother who had her home and car taken because her grandson was arrested under suspicion of selling marijuana on her property, her case brought attention to one of the most abusive asset forfeiture regimes, where Philadelphia had seized some $6 million a year on the practice.

Sen. Rand Paul’s FAIR Act, a proposed federal reform of these rules, proposes seized assets go to the general Treasury fund instead of directly to law enforcement, to reduce this incentive.

One of the problems with the new DOJ rule is that “federal adoption” has been used in the past to circumvent state restrictions on forfeiture. Here’s Radley Balko on the pernicious effects of that policy:

The adoption policy is an end-around the state legislatures. It’s one thing if an investigation involves significant participation between federal and state or local law enforcement, and that investigation produces forfeiture proceeds to be divvied up. Such investigations comprise a broader class of forfeitures that are known as ‘equitable sharing’ cases. They’re still problematic, especially if it’s a civil forfeiture that doesn’t require the state to produce any actual criminal charges. But adoption cases are much more pernicious. The sole purpose of the adoption policy is to give police agencies a way to ignore state law. It was devised to let local cases become federal cases with little to no involvement from actual federal law enforcement officials. This is why the Obama administration tried to phase out the program. As I pointed out at the time, then-Attorney General Eric Holder’s plan to phase out the adoption policy would affect only about 5 to 6 percent of federal civil forfeiture cases. But it would end the policy in states where the legislature (and, presumably, the people) had tried to pass laws protecting people from unjust forfeitures.

The issue of civil asset forfeiture reform has made strange ideological bedfellows for a reason. A 2016 YouGov poll showed 84 percent of Americans opposed asset forfeiture without a conviction. The problems with the practice are obvious and have given reform momentum as it becomes more well-known.

The Trump administration came into office with promises of respecting state decision-making and “draining the swamp.” This decision is a disappointing violation of both.

Michelle Carter Case Underlines Legal Battles Over Speech Crimes,"Michelle Carter, the young Massachusetts woman convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter for “instructing” a boyfriend by email to commit suicide, was sentenced Thursday to a minimum of 15 months imprisonment. Her case has been widely discussed because of the shocking content of her emails, the prosecution’s successful argument that words can kill, and its implications for free speech under the First Amendment.

Before trial, Carter’s attorneys tried to get the case dismissed as a misapplication of the law of manslaughter and as violating her free speech rights, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts rejected that effort.

Because of its nationwide notoriety together with its consideration of the role of words in the crime of involuntary manslaughter, the case is already a landmark and a precedent. Now, the question is, how far and extensive will the precedent be? What are its implications for what might be called “word crimes,” and, beyond the criminal law, for the contemporary increase in the civil regulation of speech?

Recent Comparisons from Other Cases

Two recent state cases, both in New Jersey, serve as comparisons in criminal law. In New Jersey v. Pomianek (2015), two white employees of a New Jersey township’s public works department played a “prank” on a black employee by locking him in a cage at the department. When he protested, they retorted, “You throw a banana in a cage, and he goes right in.” The black employee considered those words, which were essentially the only issue in the case, racist.

The two employees were indicted and convicted by a jury under a section of New Jersey’s “bias intimidation” statute whereby a defendant may be criminally convicted of harassment if his victim “reasonably believed” that the defendant’s conduct was based on bias, including racial bias. It was alleged in the case that the defendant’s “words were racially motivated.”

The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the New Jersey statute caused a due process violation because it focused on the effect the defendant’s words had on the victim. That is, it required the proof of a crime to be based “on the victim’s perception and not the defendant’s intent.” Criminal law requires the perpetrator to have the necessary and complete criminal intent, the mens rea; crimes are not proved by what the victim thought the perpetrator intended. The court ruled that the New Jersey statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In New Jersey v. Dharun Ravi, (2016), the notorious case in which a college roommate was convicted of cyberbullying his college roommate to commit suicide, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the key section of the New Jersey “bias intimidation” statute was an unconstitutional denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus it was not a free speech case.

Defendant Dharun Ravi used his webcam to spy on and broadcast a same-sex encounter between his college roommate and another man at New Jersey’s Rutgers University in northern New Jersey. He used Twitter to invite other students to see the broadcast, and some accepted that invitation. Three days later, Clementi, learning of this, committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River. At trial, Ravi was convicted of invasion of privacy, tampering with evidence, and bias intimidation.

The New Jersey Supreme Court held that Pomianek controlled the case and that Ravi was denied due process because his conviction was based on evidence demonstrating victim Clementi’s state of mind, that is, the effect Ravi’s spying had on him, rather than on Ravi’s criminal intent. Clementi killed himself as his own reaction to what Ravi had done. Ravi did not intend that.

Growing Accusations of Word Crimes

Some other comparisons, both civil and criminal, can be made. In 2015, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch committed the Justice Department to “take action” and to prosecute “anti-Muslim rhetoric,” although she later partially modified the wording of that commitment. Last year, New York City enacted an ordinance that provides civil fines up to $250,000 for failure to use a person’s preferred name or pronoun, and last month Canada added “gender identity and expression” to two sections of its criminal code.

Two weeks ago, psychology professor Lisa Feldman Barrett, referring to the current controversies about “microaggressions” and “trigger warnings” at universities, argued in The New York Times that “scientific findings” demonstrate that “hate speech that bullies and torments” is “literally a form of violence.”

A not entirely unrelated event concerns celebrity Kathy Griffin’s video of herself with a replica of the bloody, decapitated head of President Trump. For that, she was investigated by the Secret Service. Was that a threat under the federal law, 18 U.S.C. 871, that makes it a crime to make a “threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm” upon the president? The video contained no audio, but it surely qualified as “symbolic speech” under Supreme Court decisions, including Tinker v. Des Moines (1969), wherein the court ruled that wearing anti-Vietnam-war armbands was “closely akin to pure speech.”

In its pretrial ruling, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court approved of the prosecutor’s “killing words” expansion of the crime of involuntary manslaughter and snubbed Carter’s plea under the First Amendment. Now that she is sentenced, it seems certain that her lawyers will appeal the same two issues to the state high court again and attempt to appeal the First Amendment issue to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both American law and society in general await the results.

"Sorry, Jeff Sessions, But We're Not Experiencing A Violent Crime Wave","In Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ world, an explosion of violent crime is persistently bubbling just beneath the surface of American society, ready to spill forth onto the streets. Speaking to the National Association of Attorneys General in February, Sessions noted recent jumps in U.S. crime rates and warned they represent “a dangerous new trend” that he believes is “not necessarily an aberration.”

His perception of a looming crime outbreak can be traced to his unwavering belief that drugs inherently induce crime. Sessions authored a foreboding piece for The Washington Post in which he claims “the federal government softened its approach to drug enforcement” during the Obama years and as a result, “drug abuse and violent crime surged.”

Downplaying the mass of low-level drug offenders (roughly half of the federal prison population), he insists any nominally “nonviolent” offenders in prison are there solely because they were violent offenders who accepted plea bargains of drug charges.

Check Your Data, Sir

Numerous studies suggest Sessions is wrong on all of these points. He may believe that all drug offenders are incorrigibly dangerous, but a 2015 study that examined the federal inmate population determined “over three-quarters of all individuals in federal prison for drug offenses have no serious history of violence before the current offense.” Another report found that 39 percent of state and federal prisoners are incarcerated without a public safety justification.

His claim that a “softened approach” to drug enforcement caused a violent crime surge under President Obama is also flatly untrue. From 2009 to 2014, overall crime fell to its lowest level since 1970, even while prosecutors scaled back use of strict federal penalties.

Finally, a new study from the Vera Institute, one of the foremost research organizations focusing on criminal justice policy, undermines his argument that recent increases in crime signal a dangerous trend. The study analyzed crimes rates for four different groups: those with low, low-medium, medium-high, and high crime rates. It found that “average rates of robbery, aggravated assault, and overall violent crime declined between 2014-2016 for all four groups,” and that “the only notable increase in the group-average rates …was for homicides that occurred in the group of jurisdictions that already had the highest pre-existing violent crime rates.”

The report states that “given the sudden uptick in homicides and other violent crimes in spring and summer of 2015, the default assumption became a new trend towards violent crime.” However, the researcher notes those assumptions were premature, as year-to-year crime fluctuations are normal and that changes similar to those seen from 2014 to 2016 have occurred before.

The study reiterates that overall crime rates remain at historic lows, and that “the recent spike in violent crime was centered in major cities where the violent crime rate was already high.” In fact, just three cities—Baltimore, Chicago and Washington—accounted for half the aggregate homicide increase from 2014-2015. In the following year, Chicago alone accounted for more than 40 percent of the increase. Even within these cities, the majority of crimes occurred in just a few specific neighborhoods.

Jeff Session’s Distorted Perspective Will Be Ineffective

In his Washington Post article, Sessions warns that a recent homicide uptick of 11 percent is the highest percentage increase in decades. But the Vera analysis explains that percentage changes in homicide can be especially volatile, given their very low baselines and sample sizes. Ultimately, the analysis concludes that the recent rise in homicides in a few cities is troubling and requires localized interventions, but that it would be irresponsible to paint the situation as an imminent, national crime wave.

The problem is that Sessions’ misguided beliefs about the nature and pervasiveness of crime informs his policy choices. Soon after his swearing in, the attorney general rescinded a directive from former Attorney General Eric Holder that guided federal prosecutors to avoid pursuing charges that would trigger mandatory minimums for low-level offenders. Holder’s memo was intended to minimize prosecutions of drug offenders without extensive criminal histories in favor of pursuing criminals higher up in the food chain.

The strategy was working. The percentage of defendants who faced a mandatory minimum plummeted, while prosecutions of more serious crimes increased. For the first time in decades, prison populations fell in tandem with crime rates. Now many non-violent, first-time offenders face the possibility of being stuck with a ten-year mandatory minimum charge, when they otherwise would have gotten a slap on the wrist or been placed in a rehabilitation program. Prosecutors, on the other hand, will be splitting their resources between “small fry” offenders and the truly dangerous.

Contrary to the attorney general’s imagination, hordes of bloodthirsty gang members are not suddenly plaguing American neighborhoods. Crime is still at its lowest level in decades. The role of the highest-ranking prosecutor is to present the facts, not to further an alarmist agenda.

Why Are NCAA Recruiting Violations A Crime—Let Alone A Federal One?,"When I first heard the University of Louisville basketball program was involved in some recruiting scandal, I was shocked—shocked!—because an ethical cloud hangs around its coach Rick Pitino like Pig-Pen of Peanuts fame. Then I heard that the FBI had been investigating multiple schools for similar violations and I thought two things: I’m again shocked—shocked!—that shamateurism prevails in the NCAA, and why does any law enforcement agency care?

Here’s what allegedly happened: An executive at sportswear manufacturer Adidas named James Gatto funneled significant sums of money to high school basketball players who then committed to Louisville. A Louisville assistant coach apparently knew about this, so he was fired, then Pitino and the athletic director Tom Jurich were placed on administrative leave (a way-station before firing).

Separately, assistant coaches at three other schools—Arizona, Oklahoma State, and University of Southern California—took cash payments to steer elite players towards certain agents and financial advisers. Then Auburn University associate head coach and former NBA rookie of the year Chuck Person and a clothing executive were charged with conspiring to direct players to use a particular clothing line.

It’s all very shady, and obviously violates the strict rules that the NCAA established to maintain the purity of its money-making machine athletic enterprise, but again I ask, what does this have to do with law enforcement? It’s like the NCAA grandees are paying the cops to do their dirty work.

These Charges Could Fit Anyone

Technically, the charges involve bribery, conspiracy, fraud, and “traveling interstate to commit crime.” My favorite is the invocation of “honest services fraud,” a catch-all that could even ensnare you, dear reader, if you’re reading this article from your employer’s computer during business hours. The Supreme Court has been narrowing this charge in recent years, precisely because the rule of law doesn’t look kindly at sweeping criminal statutes that effectively allow authorities to pick anybody up. The federal hook comes in because the coaches worked for institutions receiving federal funds and the individuals or funds involved traveled across state lines.

But even if a savvy prosecutor can fit the above reign of terror into a proper criminal indictment—with potentially decades in federal prison for those involved—why would he? Besides, doesn’t the venerable Federal Bureau of Investigation have better things to do with its time?

The complaints filed last week read like a summary of college basketball (and football) in modern times, with agents and sneaker companies conspiring with coaches and players to manipulate the recruiting process. It’s unfair to competing programs that follow the rules, to be sure, but let’s not kid ourselves that anybody actually involved in the transactions is hurt. Players get paid, coaches get victories, and their schools get both revenue and wins.

Think about it: how is the University of Louisville defrauded when Brian Bowen—the star recruit at the heart of the scandal who’s now been suspended—agrees to play for Pitino (who previously hired hookers to lure recruits)? The school created a sports environment where the only goals are to win and make money; it has succeeded wildly in recent years. As has Auburn, where the only thing more prized than cha-ching and championships is beating Alabama.

Let’s Just Stop the Sham and Pay the Players

At this point, the legal process is beside the point: the cases will drag on as the defendants argue they didn’t “intend” to do anything wrong and that the statutes are too vague, while the prosecution gets unindicted co-conspirators to roll over and solidify its allegations. If anything ever gets to a jury—likely not; these things tend to plead out—I’m rooting for nullification, because I don’t want to my taxes paying to imprison these non-menaces to society.

Some will agree that this mess and others like it buttress the argument, gaining steam with each passing year, that the NCAA should simply allow players to be paid. There’s more than enough money to go around, so why not give some to the kids who generate it? Among other benefits, in this woke era it wouldn’t hurt to cure some socioeconomic injustice—most of the players are poor and black, and they get nothing if they don’t make the pros (like most don’t)—while allowing the free market to flourish. It would eliminate the hypocrisy that a Duke-Carolina game is no different than Princeton-Rutgers a century ago.

It’s not a bad argument, but it doesn’t go nearly far enough. Basketball and football—the so-called “revenue sports,” although relatively few programs turn a profit—should simply be spun off into their own minor leagues. As with hockey and baseball, you could still have college teams, but nearly all serious professional prospects would come through the minor-league system.

The Olympics are a lot better off for having thrown off their pretense of amateurism, and so would be collegiate basketball and football. Then the NCAA could go back to regulating true amateur sports—and the FBI could focus on terrorist cells, Russian hackers, and real Wall Street criminals.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/02/ncaa-recruiting-violations-crime-let-alone-federal-one/,2017-10-02
"This Liberal Found It's More Complicated Than ‘More Guns, More Crime’","I have always looked at the gun problem and assumed that there is a “commonsense” solution if the gun lobby would just get out of the way and people would just screw their heads on right. Like most Americans, I still support efforts to improve the efficacy of the background-check system, but I now understand them to be common sense but not solutions—and potentially distractions from the core social questions of economic despair and shuttered opportunity, which plague both poor minority neighborhoods and the white working class alike.

Over the past year, I have from time to time posted the most mild-mannered of comments on Facebook, suggesting that the gun issue is more complex than one might think. I am not exactly fearless on social media, anxious about the cultural disapprobation that comes with conservative views in my circles. My posts have been exceptionally mealy-mouthed, timid suggestions that the gun issue is tricky or perhaps a particular National Review article is “worth a look.”

My reading suggestions have not been well received. My liberal friends have rather disdainfully rejected the facts offered, not usually with their own facts but with the statement that we just need to get on with doing “something.” This would seem to suggest that people who don’t agree with policy for window dressing’s sake are somehow hunky-dory with thousands of gun deaths every year. It is a little window into the sanctimony of some liberals, and I don’t like it very much.

Proposed Laws Would Rarely Have Stopped Recent Attacks

Virtually all of the guns used in mass-murder situations in the past decade were lawfully obtained, and could have been lawfully obtained under proposed laws, such as the extension of background checks to private sales (eighteen states already do so). The Aurora, Newtown, and Orlando shootings were all committed with lawfully obtained guns, or with guns taken from licensed owners.

And it is just not credible to think that restricting private sales at places like gun shows will substantially reduce urban violence. The most recent, though admittedly still dated, surveys of prisoners, which were undertaken back in the 1990s, indicate that only about .6 percent of guns obtained by criminals were from gun shows.

I’m not terribly impressed with surveys like this, but I don’t have any reason to dispute the conclusions: that there are just too many lawful and unlawful ways to obtain a gun to believe that new restrictions will make a material impact on outcomes. And even if new laws reduced gun transactions in a meaningful way, people would still continue to steal guns at a frightful rate. Somewhere between 300,000 and 600,000 guns are stolen each year, enough to cover every gun-related crime in the country, several times over.

Yes, We Have High Violence Rates, But It’s Not Guns’ Fault

One of the key arguments for gun control is the unfavorable comparison between gun violence in the United States and in other developed countries. As President Obama noted in 2015, “What we also have to recognize is, is that our homicide rates are so much higher than other industrialized countries. I mean by like a mile. And most of that is attributable to the easy ready availability of firearms, particularly handguns.”

And it is true; out of the 35 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States ranks 31st in homicide rates, though gun proponents hasten to note that the United States is far safer than Russia, Mexico, and Brazil, and a little safer than Latvia, none of which is likely to be bulletin-board material for our national tourism agency. And what is most disturbing is that we are not even a close 31. Our homicide rate is ten times the rate in Japan and three times the rate in Canada, for instance.

It’s truly depressing stuff, unless you are planning to move to England, where the writer Bill Bryson recently reported, in all seriousness, and with some satisfaction, that you are more likely to be killed by walking into a wall than by being murdered. I’ve pondered that statement quite a bit, trying to figure out what impels so many Britons to rush into walls, presumably headfirst, at speeds high enough to kill themselves, and haven’t found any adequate explanation, but the sentiment expressed by Bryson is still true: England is an amazingly safe place. There were only 573 murders in all of England and Wales in 2015 (Chicago by itself is on pace to hit about 700 in 2017) and only about 40 of those murders were with firearms.

I couldn’t find statistics to confirm Bryson’s running-into-walls comparison, but it is true that in England you are about twice as likely to die from falling out of or through a building as you are to be killed with a gun, and about six times more likely to die from “malaise or fatigue.”

Those numbers are deeply satisfying to gun control advocates—and to the Brits as well, I should think—but it’s not clear what they mean for the United States. Gun control advocates link the low murder rate in England, for example, to the 1997 Firearms Act, which effectively outlawed private ownership of handguns, but in truth the homicide rate in England was low long before the Firearms Act and it has actually increased modestly since 1997.

Gun Prevalence Is Not the Key Cause of Crime

And the relationship between the number of guns and murder rates is not always very clear. If you are to believe the Small Arms Survey, countries like Russia and Brazil have relatively low firearms ownership rates, but apparently all those guns are in the hands of killers and thieves, and high-ownership countries like Switzerland and Finland have comparatively low murder rates.

Switzerland, for instance, is awash in guns—a “gun in every closet” is integral both to the national defense plan and the national culture—and there is roughly one gun for every two people in the country. And yet the murder rate is pleasingly low, not so different from England itself. It is not that there is no relationship between gun availability and homicide rates—of course there is—but the story of violence and the means of controlling it are far more complicated and nuanced than advocates on either side of the story would have us believe.

I started off this process thinking, as do many of my political coreligionists, that reducing gun violence is simply a matter of will, and of overcoming the Neanderthals at the National Rifle Association (NRA). But I have learned that it is not, and that if we really want to reduce gun violence, we should be focusing not first upon the weapons but on a lot of things around it: poverty, drugs, race, and addressing mental illness, opportunity, and gangs, to name just a few.

The Left Is Still Unable To Face Bill Clinton’s Alleged Sex Crimes,"It is fascinating and welcome to see liberals discovering their consciences on Bill Clinton’s alleged rapist tendencies. True, this moral revelation comes about two decades later than it should have, and at precisely the moment the Left can no longer reasonably ignore it and not a moment sooner.

Just the same, it is nice to finally see some honesty on this issue. It is nice to see liberals, having no more use for the Clintons, finally undertaking what MSNBC host Chris Hayes calls “a real reckoning” with the very real possibility that Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broaddrick nearly 40 years ago.

And yet. One is tempted to believe we’re witnessing not a “reckoning” but a quick and guilty kind of moral shrug, a sort of Kansas City shuffle meant to absolve a bunch of deeply culpable people of their own deep and stinking culpability. For a real “reckoning” of American liberalism’s wink-nod approach to Bill Clinton’s alleged sex crimes would implicate American liberalism itself, or at least the last few decades of it. That is understandably not something many liberals are willing to do.

Still Too Scared to Face Themselves In the Mirror

A great example of this evasive genre can be found at The Atlantic, where Caitlin Flanagan has written an article titled, simply, “Bill Clinton: A Reckoning.” The article itself is actually not a reckoning of Bill Clinton or even an overture toward a reckoning.

Indeed, Flanagan only comes to the sexual assault allegations leveled at Clinton only about two-thirds of the way through, after bringing up Clarence Thomas’s alleged sexual harassment of Anita Hill. She places most of the blame for Clinton on “machine feminism” rather than Democratic opportunism, then lamely asserts Democrats need to “come to terms” with how they “abandoned some of [their] central principles” in their unthinking defense of Clinton.

At The New York Times, columnist Michelle Goldberg offers a similar pastiche of self-serving pseudo-reflection. “I Believe Juanita,” her most recent column declares upfront. After that she spends a great deal of time grumbling about Breitbart, “the right’s evident bad faith,” “right-wing propaganda,” “the right-wing press,” “epistemological warfare,” and “various figures in conservative media.” Only after six paragraphs do we get to Broaddrick, after which Goldberg quickly returns to the conservative-led “blizzard of lies” that led progressives to doubt Broaddrick 20 years ago.

Almost as an afterthought, Goldberg writes: “It’s fair to conclude, that because of Broaddrick’s allegations, Bill Clinton no longer has a place in decent society.” Goodness, after two decades this is the best we can manage?

Even Hayes’s own viral tweet is couched in a tired and evasive formula. “As gross and cynical and hypocrtical [sic] as the right’s ‘what about Bill Clinton’ stuff is,” he wrote, “it’s also true that Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.” Got it: so the Right is “gross and cynical and hypocritical” regarding the Left’s steadfast avoidance of Bill Clinton’s alleged sex crimes, but we’re also correct? Are liberals capable of discussing Clinton’s sordid history without having to obsessively refer back to conservatives?

They Let Bill Clinton Keep Legitimacy for 18 More Years

There is a deeper and more cynical politics at work here. “Reckoning” with Bill Clinton’s alleged crimes is not just a matter of the Democratic Party saying sorry for not believing Broaddrick in 1999. Bill Clinton has remained a prominent fixture of the party in the intervening 18 years, including as a major fundraiser during his wife’s two failed campaigns for president and as a stump for other Democrats, including President Obama.

Progressives, meanwhile, adore him. “Bill Clinton couldn’t keep it in his pants, but he was a great president!” one very liberal woman told me years ago. Broaddrick would surely agree with the first part. Summing up the feelings of millions of progressive millennials, comedian John Mulaney described Clinton as a “smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the United State of America.” This kind of hero-worship is only possible if one disbelieves Broaddrick’s testimony entirely—testimony that, 20 years on, remains very credible.

A “reckoning” of the accusations against Bill Clinton must thus also function as a reckoning of the last couple of decades of Democratic politics, a politics that has featured Bill Clinton as an ancillary yet still near-permanent fixture. Every Democrat has known of Broaddrick’s accusations for years. Yet Bill Clinton was still eagerly accepted within “decent society,” and his wife—who is quite reasonably seen as both an apologist for her husband’s perverted behavior and possibly a criminal conspirator regarding his crimes—became the standard-bearer of the Democratic Party itself in the last election.

To reckon with all of this means to reckon with the Democratic party in toto—its political instincts, its morals, and its public credibility and future viability.The Left predictably isn’t very keen to do that. So we get what we’ve witnessed in the past week: liberals feigning a kind of come-to-Jesus public confessional over Bill Clinton while ultimately just complaining about conservatives.

It is true that, in the end, we do not know if Bill Clinton raped Broaddrick. It is virtually impossible to prove it one way or the other, as it generally is with these types of claims. It would not be wholly unreasonable for someone to doubt Broaddrick after a careful review of the evidence. Then again, her claim, and the evidence surrounding it, is compelling enough to be believable, more so than many.

So what does it say about the Democratic Party that it has nevertheless allowed Bill Clinton a revered and permanent spot in its ranks? And what does it say about liberals that, even now, after all of this time, they cannot truly come to grips with it?

The Top 4 Anti-LGBT Myths Of 2017,"In a year of nonstop crisis, scandal, violence, and political unrest, it is easy to understand how many people across the country feel on edge. As we well know, fear is often an effective tool to motivate the masses in a desired direction.

LGBT media would have us all believe that LGBT people are in a near-constant state of danger in the United States and under assault from the police, Republicans, and the president himself. But a closer inspection tells us this simply isn’t true. Let’s take a look at the top anti-LGBT myths of 2017.

1. 2017 Was the Deadliest Year for Transgender People

If you have been paying attention to the media, you will have noticed a series of headlines stating, “Transwoman is the 17th…19th…22nd…murdered so far this year!” The dramatic statement with an escalating victim count gives the impression that transgender people, specifically transwomen of color, are being intentionally targeted for hate crimes across the country. The panic of each news story validates feelings of victimhood and fear and causes those scrolling by to believe in an epidemic of violence.

This narrative inspires government policy and initiative to curb the violence and demands to demonstrate intolerance for hate crimes. In September, Rep. Keith Ellison introduced a congressional resolution titled “Recognizing the violence and other challenges faced by transgender women of color in America.”

Ellison and several other congressional leaders signed a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March pleading for him to do something about transgender murders. The letter stated, “We write to urge you to investigate the recent murders of multiple African-American transgender women around the United States. Transgender women are over four times more likely to be murdered than the general population of all women, and 2017 is on track to be the most deadly year for transgender women, particularly those who are African-American.”

In “2017 has been the best year for trans people; it’s also been the worst,” Salon wrote, “According to sociologist Nielan Barnes, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, the very visibility and increasing acceptance that helped lift Roem [the first openly transgender to win state office in America] and others into office may lie at that heart of what can feel like a deadly backlash. ‘More attention is directed to the LGBT population, and transgender individuals, because they’re non-gender-conforming, and they’re far more visible, tend to be a target.’”

It is important to recognize the value of each life and empathize with the tragedy the families of these victims face. However, it is equally important to recognize that there is not a single thing law enforcement, or certainly the federal government, could do to prevent them. Why? Because the murders have absolutely no pattern or consistent motivation. Despite the headlines and the rhetoric, there is no indication any specific threat towards transgender individuals, of any gender identity or race, exists.

A close examination of each case provides insight into the real causes of these tragedies. Human Rights Campaign compiled a list of the known transgender murders in 2017 with details about each individual. Each can be linked back to local reporting and police statements. While major LGBT news sites reporting on the murders tend to fixate on the police “misgendering” the victim and devote most of their articles to quoting positive things said by the people who loved them while lamenting the rise in violence, these articles contain clues to the origins of each case.

After researching the known 28 cases, it becomes clear that these individuals are the victims of robberies, domestic violence, police use of lethal force, sex work, and drugs or random acts of violence rather than targeted anti-LGBT motivation. In fact, not a single case listed in 2017 can be directly linked to the victim’s gender identity. The most brutal murders were committed by partners or other people the victim knew personally. Others remain unsolved with no indication of a motive. Three involved the victim physically attacking or threatening the police before being killed.

LGBT media chooses to attribute anti-LGBT bias as a motivation for a political purpose. These are simply transgender people who were murdered, not people murdered for being transgender. The HRC admits this as much in their report: “While the details of these cases differ, it is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, and that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia conspire to deprive them of employment, housing, healthcare and other necessities, barriers that make them vulnerable.”

The goal appears to be to fabricate a narrative to encourage fear without recognizing the true threats are more mundane and common-sense. We all know that sex work is dangerous, as is drug use. We know the threats of domestic violence and why reporting and escaping are vital for survival. We also know that if you walk down a darkened street at night in Chicago, bad things can happen. This affects us all equally, and depends entirely on the situation at hand, not one’s sexual status.

2. LGBT Hate Crimes on The Rise

Throughout 2017 we saw increasingly dramatic headlines warning of the rise in anti-LGBT hate crimes. BuzzFeed, for example, used the headline “This Report Says More LGBT People Were Killed So Far In 2017 Than In All Of 2016” to denote an increase of LGBT murders from 28 to 33 from 2016 to 2017. This trend continued from the previous year, when The New York Times declared: “L.G.B.T. People Are More Likely to Be Targets of Hate Crimes Than Any Other Minority Group.”

This article cited the most recent FBI hate crimes statistics from 2014 and a poll that asked Republicans and Democrats what they thought was most likely the motive of the Pulse night club shooting in 2016. The choices were “Mostly Terrorism, Mostly Hate Crime, or Both.” Thirty-seven percent of Democrats described it as a hate crime, and only 8 percent as a terrorist attack. The majority of all respondents said “both.”

The article quoting the statistics stated that one-fifth of all hate crimes were anti-LGBT-motivated. The 2016 FBI hate crimes report, the most recent available, said 17.7 percent of all hate crimes were anti-LGBT-motivated. This, as the “epidemic of transgender murders” narrative, implies a high risk to LGBT Americans.

But a closer look at the data provides proportion and perspective. According to the Pew Research Center in 2017, LGBT people make up roughly 4 percent of the American population, about 10 million people. There were 1,255 reported anti-LGBT hate crimes in 2016. This means that in 2016, 0.001 percent of the American LGBT population experienced hate crimes.

Even with claims of “underreporting” and accusations of police not correctly labeling hate crimes, multiplying the number by 100 (125,000 anti-LGBT hate crimes) would represent a risk to 0.1 percent of LGBT people. The numbers simply do not reflect the narrative. In truth, hate crimes overall are remarkably low for a country and population of the United States’ size and diversity.

3. Religious Liberty as a License to Discriminate

A popular rallying cry this year was against the “license to discriminate,” the way the Left describes religious freedom legal standards. As the Los Angeles Times puts it: “If you thought 2016 was a nasty, brutish year for LGBT rights across the country, 2017 is already shaping up to be much, much worse. Over the holidays, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced that he would be reintroducing the First Amendment Defense Act, a bill first put forward in 2015. It would prevent the government from taking action against businesses that discriminate against LGBT people based on their ‘religious belief or moral conviction…’”

Masterpiece Cakeshop did not discriminate at all or deny service to anyone based on his or her sexuality.

This year the Supreme Court heard the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, about a Christian baker who refused to create an artistic wedding cake for a same-sex wedding. The case inspired many frantic headlines warning of an impending wave of anti-LGBT discrimination should the court rule in favor of the baker. The LGBT world was aflame with hypothetical concerns of where, when, and how they may find themselves shunned from public life.

The truth, of course, is that Masterpiece Cakeshop did not discriminate at all or deny service to anyone based on his or her sexuality. In the last few years, we have seen many small business owners accused of this based solely on their opposition to participating in a same-sex wedding. At no time did we witness any owner or advocate declare a desire to not serve gay people. As is true with most of the cases, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop offered to make the gay couple a different cake for any other occasion. His only objection was designing an artistic expression for the purpose of celebrating an event he religiously opposes.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, signed by President Bill Clinton, demonstrates the absurdity of the overall claim. Businesses all across America were not actively limiting or removing gay customers or denying them service during that time or since. American business owners have always had the freedom to discriminate against gay customers, and they simply have never chosen, as a general rule, to do so. There is no reason to believe they will start now.

4. The Anti-LGBT President

Of course, no discussion of liberal mythology would be complete without looking at how they represent President Donald Trump. Trump is a unique figure because he has been a well-known media icon for decades and has long publicly supported LGBT rights. He is arguably the most pro-LGBT president ever to be elected and the first to openly support same-sex marriage upon election. Yet, as this Newsweek headline proclaims: “TRUMP IS WAGING OUTRIGHT WAR AGAINST LGBTQ AMERICANS,” the media narrative would have you believe otherwise.

Trump is arguably the most pro-LGBT president ever to be elected and the first to openly support same-sex marriage upon election.

Besides openly embracing his LGBT supporters during his campaign, President Trump demonstrated his preference for equality when he appointed Richard Grenell, an openly gay man, as ambassador to Germany. His general disinterest in identity politics as a whole represents his inclination towards natural diversity and actual equal treatment. He appears to treat LGBT individuals exactly as he treats everyone else.

A close examination of the accusations against Trump reveals a political agenda to label any opposition to currently popular left-wing initiatives as “anti-LGBT.” This is evidenced by claiming everything from the newest tax bill to the Obamacare renovations to net neutrality are designed to intentionally harm gay people.

It can be argued that President Trump has opposed the current transgender social agenda to push gender identity politics onto the nation’s schools. He rescinded President Obama’s pro-transgender memo sent to all U.S. public schools. Trump also famously sparked outrage by announcing a ban on transgender service members.

Yet the military ban appears to be more practical than malicious. Transgender individuals have an extremely high suicide rate, with 40 percent reporting attempting suicide during their lifetimes. Transgender women (biological males) are up to 3.6 percent more likely to face crippling depression or anxiety than the general population is.

While it can be argued transgender service members are qualified and it is wrong to discriminate against them, it is tough to argue the motivation is pure bias.

NPR reports: “Four in 10 of the women had a mental health or substance dependence disorder, and 1 in 5 women had at least two diagnosed psychiatric conditions. More than a third of them had experienced depression, and 1 in 5 women had contemplated suicide in the past month. Rates of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol dependence and other substance dependence also was higher than average.”

There is also a high cost associated with this population. Military estimates put sex-change costs upwards of $8.4 million dollars annually. The military has a long list of medical conditions that bar entry into service. This includes drug or alcohol abuse, a history of psychiatric disorders, anemia, asthma, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and many more conditions. While it can be argued transgender service members are qualified and it is wrong to discriminate against them, it is tough to argue the motivation is pure bias. There is a legitimate medical concern.

Mythology is difficult to counter, as belief intertwines with emotion and identity. But the truth matters, and it should always be stated without hesitation. A comforting lie helps no one. Sadly, much of the current LGBT media appears to be more dedicated to constructing a useful narrative than simply celebrating everyday equality and natural diversity.

The truth is, America is an amazing place to live if you are a gay or trans person. We enjoy abundant freedom and true personal choice and expression. The victimhood narrative simply cannot survive examination, and we must continue to expose it.

We Love ‘The Godfather’ Because It’s Not Cynical About America,"The 45th anniversary of “The Godfather” has brought us another Blu-Ray box set and another round of critical reappraisal of the mafia movie classic. The secret of the film’s enduring appeal, however, might be found in its opening line: “I believe in America.”

It is often said that “The Godfather” is an ironic commentary on the American Dream. That conventional wisdom may say more about movie critics than about “The Godfather,” which has a more nuanced subtext.

Coppola’s Fight to Keep ‘The Godfather’ A Period Piece

Director Francis Ford Coppola fought many battles to realize his vision for “The Godfather.” His most important was to demand that it remain a period piece over the studio’s wish that it be set in contemporary St. Louis instead of 1940s New York.

Coppola saw “The Godfather” as a story about America flowering as a world power in the immediate post-World War II period. During pre-production, he created a notebook analyzing how he would adapt the novel, and “the times” informed every major section.

Gordon Willis brought his signature darkness to the cinematography, as he did with other 1970s classics, including “All the President’s Men” and “The Parallax View.” But only in “The Godfather” (and Part II) did he color-time the film to look like home movies, how we imagine the 1940s looked more than they actually looked.

Placing the audience in the position of looking back is a key to how Coppola and his team present the themes of “The Godfather.” It is also key to how audiences have processed those themes—even if subconsciously—since 1972, when we were losing a war instead of winning one.

For example, “The Godfather” is obviously about the immigrant experience in America. The film focuses on one of the darker aspects of this experience. Historically, many immigrant communities have had a phase where organized crime is notable. This did not bother Coppola, an Italian-American. He understood this was one small part of his much larger canvas.

Moreover, this is how Italian-Americans generally have understood “The Godfather.” In 1972, America was closing a chapter in its history of primarily European immigration. Italian-Americans and similar communities were proud of assimilating into the middle class. The movie was seen as a validation, not an indictment.

A Celebration of Family

That audiences viewed “The Godfather” more as a celebration was reinforced by film’s focus on the idea of family. That idea is now a standard trope of the mafia genre, but it was fresh in 1972. “The Godfather” is suffused with Coppola’s family experiences as an Italian-American, particularly in the opening wedding sequence. The quasi-documentary style in which this set piece was shot reinforces the sense of watching a home movie.

Ultimately, the family life depicted is more malign than the patriarchy of “Father Knows Best.” Yet the sexism is often about literally shutting women out, an implicit admission of the immoral world the men perpetuate. The weight placed on family predominates such that we still relate to the characters.

The period context again matters a great deal. In 1972, family was one of many traditional institutions reeling from the tumult of the 1960s. Audiences did not (and do not) have to embrace reactionary sexism to appreciate the power of nostalgia for a time when families were more stable.

Going West to Grow with the Country

In addition to the immigrant experience, “The Godfather” addresses the migrant experience within America. In the first half of the film, Don Corleone dips his toe into the waters of Hollywood. By the end of the movie, the Corleone family is going West and growing up with the country, to use a phrase popularized by Horace Greeley.

Of course, Greeley was referring to the westward expansion of the mid-1800s. But part of the American story rests in the migration that exploded after WWII, partially fueled by returning soldiers like Michael Corleone. It is the story of Los Angeles and San Francisco becoming major cities and the story of Seattle and Phoenix as much as Las Vegas.

By 1972, America was becoming a fully bi-coastal nation. The dominance of New York as a focus of our culture industries (excepting movies) was slipping away. Ironically, at this point, Hollywood’s studio system was on life support. Institutions like Paramount were bought by large corporations like Gulf + Western, which almost stripped the studio’s real estate holdings during this period.

It is commonly held that “The Godfather” critiques the cartel capitalism of the period. Coppola has described it this way, although he has admitted that he probably could not have thought to pitch it as such when he was preparing the film. Yet even on the subject of capitalism, “The Godfather’s” brief references to communism do not recommend it as an alternative. Moreover, Coppola issues a far more direct critique of cartel capitalism in 1988’s “Tucker: The Man and His Dream.”

The timing and framing of the film again informs how we process its treatment of American cartel capitalism. In 1972, the other WWII powers had rebuilt their industrial capacity and started to compete with the United States again. Union membership began a steep decline. “The Godfather” looks back at American economic power at the dawn of the current period of economic globalization.

An Enduring Concern for Law and Order

Lastly, there is “The Godfather’s” attitude regarding crime and justice. At the outset of the film, Bonasera believes in America but turns to Don Corleone when the judicial system fails him. Revenge is always a popular theme in cinema. It is a sentiment to which audiences could relate in 1972 and in ensuing generations.

That generations of audiences have embraced ‘The Godfather’ despite its seamy milieu suggests we process the film’s overall view of America more charitably.

But issues of law and order were particularly on the American mind in 1972 and played a role in President Nixon’s election four years earlier. Violent crime rates had skyrocketed in the late ‘60s and continued to rise until the ‘90s. Our current violent crime rate seems low but roughly remains at what was considered an alarming level in 1972. These concerns are implicit in “The Godfather,” filtered through the overall nostalgia the film evokes, as opposed to the overt role they played in contemporary dramas like 1971’s “Dirty Harry.”

Many film critics tend to view “The Godfather” as having the sort of cynical attitude toward America that Michael displays when Kay claims senators and presidents don’t have men killed. It seems less than coincidental that America recently had experienced a rash of political assassinations.

That generations of audiences have embraced “The Godfather” (and Part II) despite its seamy milieu suggests we process the film’s overall view of America more charitably. As Sally Jupiter would put it in “Watchmen”: “Every day, the future looks a little bit darker. But the past… even the grimy parts of it… keep on getting brighter.”

We can’t stop watching “The Godfather” because we see in it our virtues as well as our vices. “The Godfather” saga’s epic sweep captures a chapter of American greatness just as that chapter was closing, as our institutions were falling into decline. Yet the film does not flinch from America’s warts, capturing the contradictions in our legacy that have formed the subtext for many of our political fights through the present.

5 Reasons You Should Binge-Watch ‘The Godfather’ On Netflix Right Now,"This contains plot spoilers.

On January 1, Netflix finally earned its modest monthly cost in full, when it began streaming the iconic, award-winning trilogy, “The Godfather.” While older generations may know everything there is to know about the quotable mafia flick, millennials may have yet to bask in the glory of Marlon Brando’s mystifying role as “godfather” to an Italian-American family operating the “family business” in New York City.

Your significant other wanna “Netflix and chill”? Not this weekend, baby. You’re legit-binge-watching one of the greatest American mafia films of all time.

1. It’s the Best Mafia Story Ever

There are films dedicated to characters and films dedicated to plot, and a handful knock both out of the park. These do so with the same characters three times. The Godfather Trilogy is to the Italian-American mafia what “Citizen Kane” was to American politics. The story involves everything a good film or novel should: Sex, lies, murder, love, and loyalty. The trilogy manages to show just what you think the mob would do—on steroids. In other words, the plot remains just beyond the average moviegoer’s active imagination, which is part of its lasting appeal.

In “The Godfather,” released in 1972, family patriarch Don Vito Corleone is shepherding his sons through the family business: organized crime. At first, Vito’s oldest, Sonny, takes over while other son Michael gets his hands dirty getting back at a drug lord for attempting to assassinate their father. As a result, he is forced to hide in Sicily, where he marries a woman who is subsequently killed in a car bombing. After Sonny is murdered, Michael returns to America to take over. He proves a vicious patriarch.

“The Godfather Part II,” released two years after the original, is said to be one of the best sequels of our time. It presents parallel dramas, prequel and sequel to the first. This centers on Michael’s ability to lead as the new don, keeping his business ventures successful. The film shows several flashbacks of Vito’s childhood in Sicily and migration to New York City.

“The Godfather Part III” was not released until 1990. It completes Michael’s journey as don, as he tries to legitimize his mafia empire. Sonny’s son Vincent begins to take over for Michael. It includes several fictionalized real-life events like the death of Pope John Paul I.

In every plot and subplot, first-time viewers will struggle to predict the next scene, which keeps everyone inundated. Even the “predictable” scenes—like when Kay tells Michael she had an abortion—don’t end how one might predict. The flashbacks during the second part are particularly rich and woven well with what audiences have already learned in the original “Godfather.”

2. The Characters Are Unforgettable

The trilogy centers at first around the Godfather himself, Vito Corleone, and his son, Michael Corleone, taking on the “family business.” Michael is the epitome of the protagonist and antagonist: He is all stoic, alpha male, and all brutal, evil assassin. Even as he plots and schemes, audiences root for him. Women adore him, and men want to emulate him. He is the epitome of a mafia protagonist.

Other characters in the trilogy sear the screen with their presence. Audiences get to see the family patriarch Vito as a child and new father in addition to an up and coming gangster, and of course as the head of one of the five major crime families in New York City.

Vito’s son, the quick-to-violence Sonny, is paired with Vito’s other son, the incompetent and weak Fredo. Who can forget these polar opposite characters? Fredo has become so synonymous with weakness, every teenage boy should see “The Godfather” just to know what not to become. As Michael says at one point, “Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak…and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.”

Even the minor characters leave a lasting impression. Their roles may be small, but are still critical to advancing the plot and filling in the details, leaving impressions that have lasted decades. When one hears, “Leave the gun, take the cannoli,” everyone knows it’s Peter Clemenza, even if they don’t know the actor added “take the cannoli” spontaneously.

In an unusually astute and powerful move, the female characters in the trilogy are just as strong as the men. Kay Corleone, while hardly as magnanimous as Michael, is alluring in her own way, mostly because, while she loves him, she refuses to be a doormat and seems to care little what “the family” thinks. She remains strong when she disagrees with Michael and unafraid to show her distress.

Even Michael’s younger sister Connie grows from a timid wife in part one to a protective younger sister who orders hits in part three. All of the characters come together to form a cohesive unit central to advancing the story through all three chapters.

Heavily infusing Italian culture and stereotypes,while showing the complexity and beauty of Italians living as American immigrants, remain one of the most impressive aspects of the film. It’s second only to the unprecedented insistence that men of the mafia portray considerable psychological depth and complexity.

This is so spot-on that when real-life gangster Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano—of Gambino crime family fame—saw it, he said, “I left the movie stunned … I mean I floated out of the theater. Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, that was our life. It was incredible. I remember talking to a multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way.”

3. It Wasn’t Supposed to Be a Hit

While “The Godfather” earned dozens of positive reviews and even more awards after its release, the film was a bit of an underdog. Following its 1972 release, it won five Golden Globes and three Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor—an irony since the studio didn’t want to cast Brando as the “Godfather” nor Al Pacino as Michael Corleone.

Even though director Francis Ford Coppola’s lackadaisical methods of hiring actors and getting production going ended up costing about $40,000 a day, it’s unclear if anyone at Paramount minded in the end: “The Godfather” was the highest-grossing film of that year and the highest-grossing film ever for many years.

Since it was based on a somewhat-successful novel by Mario Puzo, folks weren’t clamoring to make this film. Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for less than six figures and for a while executives couldn’t find someone to direct it. Originally, when they asked Coppola to do it, he turned them down because he thought Puzo’s novel was “pretty cheap stuff.” Eventually, however, he agreed, and it turned out to be the right choice.

He and Puzo co-wrote the screenplay, but see if you ever hear the word “mafia” or “Cosa Nostra” anywhere. You won’t hear it, because the Italian-American Civil Rights League banned the words to diminish stereotypes about Italian-Americans. (It’s unclear whether they succeeded, but I’m going with nah.)

Another reason Coppola was a genius pick: Originally studio executives wanted him to make the film reflect the current day, 1970s, but he insisted on setting the film in the days of the novel, the 1940s and 1960s, which added to its charm and believability. Despite budget constraints, they also let him film on location in New York City and Sicily, another bonus.

4. ‘The Godfather’ Shows the Complexity of Human Nature

It’s impossible to discuss “The Godfather” without identifying parallel themes of good and evil throughout the trilogy: Family, love, loyalty respect recur simultaneously with murder, violence, bribery, white-collar crime, and lying.

Even the way the film was shot highlights the fight between family and loyalty, love and respect.

Even as “The Godfather” romanticizes criminality, it’s clear it’s as ghoulish as it is glamorous. The Corleones are a patriarchal family who are either doling or earning respect, yet it’s often hard to see what they’re doing that deserves respect.

Up until the making of “The Godfather,” films portraying members of organized crime typically relied on stereotypical and cartoonish characters that didn’t give viewers insight into human depravity. Nowhere is that more clear than when a priest asks Michael during his nephew’s baptism if he renounces Satan. As murders he ordered are carried out, Michael answers, “Yes, I renounce him.”

The films also present crime families in a romanticized way: The meetings. The rituals. The edicts. The customs. It all presents an almost Shakespearean image. Yet it’s clear behind all of the pomp and talk of “business,” these people are at their core violent thugs who rely on fear as a substitute for love and respect. Audiences wrestle with this dichotomy.

Even the way the film was shot highlights the fight between family and loyalty, love and respect. Cinematographer Gordon Willis turned down the initial offer to shoot “The Godfather” but later, after accepting, he and Coppola decided to use a “tableau format,” which is why the film feels at times like a painting. Astute observers notice an interplay of light and dark scenes throughout the film, mimicking psychological developments.

While the scenes in Sicily show a lush, beautiful, romantic Italian countryside, the New York scenes are grittier, darker, and edgier, to show that particular reality, especially for a crime family, assimilating from their beautiful Italy to the United States. All that glitters certainly is not gold.

5. ‘The Godfather’ Offers Big and Small Life Lessons

There are as many enormous life lessons in the films as there are small ones, sometimes in memorizable chunks. Many of these phrases have been immortalized in popular culture. Ever hear “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse”? Vito utters it with such nonchalance, you might miss it the first time. Yet it’s been said it’s so compelling real-life gangsters started using it for effect.

When Vito Corleone advises that “A friend should always underestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults,” who among us hasn’t nodded and thought it was a fantastic observation about humanity? Michael Corleone tells Sonny, “It’s not personal, it’s business.” One of the most underrated quotes of all time from “The Godfather” is when Vito explains the concept of respect:

I understand. You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. You didn’t need a friend like me. But, now you come to me, and you say: ‘Don Corleone, give me justice.’ But you don’t ask with respect. You don’t offer friendship. You don’t even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money.

The trilogy offers quotable lines rooted in philosophical thought that linger long after the film is over, and the same thing echoes during larger, more memorable scenes.

When Sonny is ambushed, Fredo fishes on Lake Tahoe for a final time, and Kay leaves the man she once loved, the message is clear: Life is short. When Vito chases his grandson, Michael dances with his wife Apollonia in Sicily, and tearfully tells his father, “I’m with you now,” this message is just as clear: Family is precious and loyalty is its own reward.

“The Godfather” stirs emotions, spurs philosophy, and unravels previous stereotypes because it’s as moving as it is profound. Watching the film is its own experience.

The ‘First Trans Murder Of 2018’ Was Not A Hate Crime,"A homicide in Massachusetts during the first week of the new year has caused a great deal of anxiety. The murder, the first in the town of North Adams since 2013, occurred at the victim’s home. Mark Steele-Knudslien, the husband of 42-year-old Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien, confessed to murdering Christa. He was arrested after turning himself in at the police station.

No motive has been released. A detail in the case has, however, made it stand out far more prominently than it otherwise would have: Christa was transgender. The Human Rights Campaign tweeted out on the murder, stating, “A tragic start to the new year. We mourn the loss of Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien, whose death is now the first reported murder of a trans person in 2018.”

The comments to the tweet included pleas to end “hatred and ignorance” and the hope that 2018 will be less dangerous for transgender Americans than 2017 was. 2017 has been labeled the “deadliest year for transgender people” due to its 28 murders of transgender individuals. But like the above case, the person’s gender identity was not a known factor in any of the murders. The killings were an assortment of homicides ranging from random acts of violence to robbery to domestic violence. In the same way, Christa’s murder appears to be domestic violence.

In a strange interpretation of community identity, LGBT media and advocacy groups connect all violence or insult towards anyone LGBT as a direct attack on all LGBT people, regardless of the motive. If a transgender person is murdered, it is presented as a hate crime and collected with other transgender murders. The list becomes evidence of an overall threat, to transgender people specifically and LGBT people generally, requiring awareness and action.

If Disparity Is the Issue, Why Ignore Domestic Violence?

The HRC is well aware of the effects of tweeting “the first reported murder of a trans person in 2018,” as LGBT people have become accustomed to outrage and anxiety over anti-trans violence. Taken at face value, it appears some LGBT advocacy groups consider even the most remote possibility of a hate crime important enough to rally around. They believe in an outside threat with such conviction that they report any evidence that can be construed to support this belief.

From their perspective, it is vital these murders are well-known and widely reported to highlight what they believe are ongoing problems of equality and safety. Thus it becomes relevant to ask why much larger concerns of violence within the LGBT community do not receive the same attention.

The rate of domestic violence for LGBT people is astonishingly high. From The Advocate, a gay-oriented publication, in 2014:

The National Violence Against Women survey found that 21.5 percent of men and 35.4 percent of women living with a same-sex partner experienced intimate-partner physical violence in their lifetimes, compared with 7.1 percent and 20.4 percent for men and women, respectively, with a history of only opposite-sex cohabitation. Transgender respondents had an incidence of 34.6 percent over a lifetime according to a Massachusetts survey. In 2010 the CDC reported that 43.8 percent of lesbians, 61.1 percent of bisexual women, 26 percent of gay men, and 37.3 percent of bisexual men experienced sexual assault, stalking or other physical violence from intimate partners.

The Advocate recognizes a concern here: “Myths about domestic violence, victims’ fear and shame, a silence that stems from a desire not to harm perceptions of the LGBT community — all these together contribute to making the problem invisible to others.”

LGBT people as a whole faced extremely low hate crime rates, at 0.001 percent yearly according to FBI reports. About 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender, and 28 transgender people were murdered in 2017. But more than half of all women who engage in same-sex relationships report domestic violence.

It is shocking that LGBT media and advocacy groups obsess endlessly over hate crimes, bullying, and anti-LGBT attitudes when such a dramatic issue is directly in front of them inside their own community. As The Advocate article implies, PR concerns appear to influence this decision.

The Persecution Narrative Serves a Political Purpose

Identity politics involve a remarkably vital need to maintain a specific public narrative to remain important in the national discussion. LGBT organizations would have very little to do if most gay and transgender people stopped looking to them for guidance and simply lived their lives. These organizations need to focus on threats that inspire action, outrage, and, most importantly, attention from the media. The high rate of LGBT domestic violence invites unwanted scrutiny, whereas “the deadliest year for transgender people” inspires sympathy and a continued seat at the national table.

The LGBT movement was founded to battle outside threats to members’ freedoms and rights. Later it became fundamentally important to gain widespread social acceptance and legitimacy. Today the focus seems to be loudly shouting at the smallest offense or reporting the most remote and isolated act of violence as an immediate threat to all LGBT people across the nation.

While there is nothing particularly wrong with highlighting the murder of a member of one’s tribe and mourning together in solidarity, it does matter when that murder is used for political purposes. LGBT media and advocacy groups will include Christa in their annual list of “transgender murders” to perpetuate the false narrative of a dangerous environment for transgender individuals in our country. Christa’s death will be included in the statistics that influence public policy.

Lying About Their Stories Does Victims No Justice

We require accurate statistics, and those who do face genuine hate crimes are diminished by linking their stories with random violence due solely to a shared sexual or gender identity. More importantly, victims like Christa get ignored in the domestic violence discussion when their deaths are politicized. Instead of focusing on funding, advocacy, and awareness campaigns that may have helped Christa, LGBT groups will instead continue fighting a threat that simply does not exist.

Every murder is tragic, and each victim deserves to be remembered, just as their murderers deserve just punishment. But no one is honored by having his or her name associated with a lie. Sadly, the LGBT world will view this crime as another attack on them, ignoring the relevant context and details, and experience a personal sense of tragedy and fear.

Perpetuating fear keeps advocacy alive and well-funded. Intentionally misleading the public for a greater cause currently has no consequence or repercussion. Despite the reality that this murder is likely a case of domestic violence, something a large portion of LGBT Americans report experiencing, very few will recognize this as a legitimate concern.

Somehow, the specter of anti-transgender hate and violent intent inspires more outrage, advocacy, and anxiety than the truth of LGBT domestic violence and the threat of intimate partner abuse. As profoundly disturbing as it sounds, it is entirely political. The political narrative thrives on fear more than action, and that is the motivation behind all LGBT organizations today.

Blaming ‘Toxic Masculinity’ For Mass Shootings Is A Form Of Bigotry,"When Stephen Paddock fired on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 58 and wounding hundreds, Americans wanted to know the motive behind the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Was Paddock a terrorist? Did he have accomplices? Was he mentally ill?

Nearly four months later, we still don’t know his motives, but we can be reasonably sure that Paddock acted alone and that he wasn’t crazy. An 81-page preliminary report issued last week by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department says as much, breaking down in great detail Paddock’s movement in the days and weeks leading up to his rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. But after nearly 2,000 investigative leads, 21,000 thousand hours of video, hundreds of thousands of images captured, and nearly 750 legal notices filed or sent, the report concludes that “nothing was found to indicate motive on the part of Paddock or that he acted with anyone else.”

Lacking a motive, some commentators have turned to other, more rarefied culprits. Laura Kiesel, writing in Politico, argues we shouldn’t blame mental illness for mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas. Instead, we should blame men: “If we want to stop the problem of mass shootings, we need to fix the problem of toxic masculinity.”

Kiesal goes on to cite crime statistics and sociological studies about everything from anxiety disorders to media messaging to bolster her claim that men and their toxic masculinity are somehow to blame for mass shootings.

“Men don’t just constitute almost all mass shooters in recent history; they are also responsible for the vast majority of gun-associated deaths in the country,” writes Kiesel. “Men own guns at triple the rate of women in the U.S., at 62 percent compared to 22 percent—and also commit suicide at nearly triple the rate of women. Eighty-nine percent of murder-suicides are committed by men, and most often include an unwitting female partner or ex-partner.”

Whether Kiesel realizes it or not, she’s talked herself into a position that can only be described as bigoted. What’s the difference, after all, between her argument and saying that we should not blame gun rights for gun violence, we should blame black men? There is no difference—indeed, there’s even a strong statistical correlation between black men and gun violence to back up such an outrageous claim.

Here’s How The Left Stumbles Into Bigotry

Consider the New York Police Department (NYPD) crime statistics for 2016, which show a staggering disparity in gun-related crime by racial category, with blacks accounting for the vast majority of shooting victims, suspects, and arrestees (72.5, 70.7, and 67.5 percent, respectively)—and this is in a city where blacks account for only about a quarter of the population.

Here are those figures in a shocking bar graph from the NYPD:

What does Kiesel make of such statistics? Based on her own reasoning, should she not conclude that the real problem with gun violence in New York City is black men? After all, if the vast majority of mass shootings in America are committed by men, and from this we conclude that what’s behind mass shootings is a social malady of “toxic masculinity,” then should we not also conclude that what’s behind gun violence in New York City is a social malady of toxic black male-ness?

The mere suggestion is of course offensive, and no reasonable person would conclude this from the NYPD crime statistics. But here we see the fundamental flaw in Kiesel’s reasoning. It’s true that black men in New York are doing a lot of shooting—but not because they’re black men. Race has absolutely nothing to do with it.

Far more likely culprits are government welfare policies and the dysfunctional family culture they create. The poisonous combination of welfare and minimum wage laws has gradually hollowed out entire urban communities, weakened families, and suppressed social mobility. If you restrict economic opportunity for long enough, you end up with communities where single parenthood is rampant and crime is pervasive. This is largely what’s to blame for the rates of gun violence, among other social ills, we see among black residents of New York—not race or sex or any other coincidental correlation. If we want to talk about the shocking rates of gun violence among blacks in New York, this is where we should start.

But because that’s not a conversation the Left is willing to have, we will continue to witness the spectacle of earnest, link-heavy essays in national publications arguing that a person’s sex disposes him to commit gun violence. With apologies to Kiesel, who I’m sure is no racist, this argument is as preposterous as suggesting that a person’s race disposes him to commit gun violence, and it should be treated with the same scorn.

Denying Human Nature Comes With Real Costs

All of that leaves the question of Paddock’s motive. Nothing about his life suggests he would commit this terrible crime. He was not impoverished or desperate. Being married, he was at least not a complete romantic failure. He seems to have had little in common with other recent mass shooters like Dylann Roof, the lonely white supremacist, or Omar Mateen, the confused would-be jihadi.

He had no accomplices, no radical politics, no prior criminal record, and no evidence of mental illness. He left no manifesto or suicide note. The only scrap of paper found in Paddock’s room with any writing on it, according to the police report, was “a small note indicating measurements and distances related to the use of rifles.”

That sparse and harrowing detail, tucked away in the report, underscores the cold inhumanity of the Las Vegas massacre. We understandably want to explain Paddock’s behavior and attribute it something like mental illness. He must have been depressed or bipolar or schizophrenic. He must have been part of some extremist movement. Some external factor must explain his monstrous deed.

But this search for external causes is a modern and progressive impulse. So far we have no explanation or motive except that Paddock was a wicked man intent on doing evil. Those words—wicked, evil—are not taken very seriously by the sort of people who would prefer to blame Paddock’s crimes on toxic masculinity or mental illness. Progressives in particular scoff at the very idea of human nature, much less that it is fallen and corrupt and capable of doing great evil.

To suggest that something so arcane and old-fashioned as the wickedness of human nature is to blame for Las Vegas is, for progressives, tantamount to blaming a demonic spirit. It is absurd and unscientific. After all, human nature is itself a delusion, a phantom of the imagination no more real than a demon or a wood sprite. Such talk is beneath serious people in the twenty-first century.

Much like the Left is unwilling to have a conversation about the real causes of gun violence in New York City, so too is it unwilling to have a conversation about human nature and the reality of evil. Progressives can no more admit that government welfare policies are the root cause of gun violence in New York than they can admit that fallen human nature is the root cause of mass shootings like Las Vegas.

That’s too bad, and not just because it causes otherwise-decent people like Kiesel to talk themselves into making bigoted arguments better suited to an alt-right blog. There are real costs to denying human nature and real implications to the notion that something like “toxic masculinity” can be rooted out or suppressed.

Make no mistake, when progressives talk about “addressing toxic masculinity” they are making a claim about human nature: men and women and children can be molded into whatever we choose. Indeed, men can be made into women, and boys into girls. There is nothing, really, to stop us. Certainly nothing so preposterous as human nature. If we can only shed these superstitious notions, they say, our eyes will be opened, and we shall be as gods.

An Illegal Almost Killed My Family. He Was Freed To Commit More Crimes,"Several months ago, the Trump administration ended the President Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which gave work permits and protection from deportation to people illegally brought to America as children. Before it was rescinded, about 800,000 foreign citizens had been approved for the program, out of an estimated 1.8 million who are eligible.

Because DACA illegally sidestepped Congress and federal law, it was only ever a temporary measure. When ending the program, the Trump administration urged Congress to take action to provide DACA enrollees, also known as “Dreamers,” legal status. If Congress doesn’t act by March, recipients will begin falling out of the program, which could mean losing a job or deportation.

Many in Congress say they want to give the Dreamers legal status. But the White House and conservatives in Congress also want to restrict newly legalized DACA recipients’ ability to bring in non-spousal adult relatives from foreign countries, judging these adults as having more difficulty assimilating into American life. They also want money for increased border security, an end to the diversity-visa lottery to make room for more skills-based immigration, and a crackdown on cities and states that refuse to deport violent criminals.

The national government even shut down for several days at least partly over this issue. Then, last week, President Trump offered a deal: provide a path to citizenship for the 1.8 million people living in America brought here illegally as children, as long as they were not serious or serial criminals or dependent on taxpayers. The plan would also provide $25 billion to build a border wall with Mexico, end the 50,000 green cards given to foreigners based on country of origin—the diversity-visa lottery—and restrict family-based migration to only minor children and spouses.

Playing Politics With Serious Issues

Trump’s plan is totally reasonable, but the Democrats have rejected it, as have some on the Right. So far, Democrats have proposed only meager funding for border security, and find abhorrent any curbs on DACA recipients’ ability to bring in family members. As Mollie Hemingway has pointed out, likely Democrats don’t want a deal. They intend to use the DACA issue, and the resulting human toll, to get out the vote during the 2018 midterm elections.

This would be a terrible mistake for our country. Conservatives who care about the rule of law, are compassionate, and want to see the border secure need to fight back. But while Democrats play politics, too many Republicans are either all too willing to give Democrats what they want while receiving little in return, or secretly have no problem with porous borders.

If a resolution to this issue is to occur, conservatives in Congress and the Trump administration need to fight through the DC swarm and speak directly to the American people. They can do this most effectively by telling stories from Middle America that speak to the concerns of ordinary Americans. Here are a few stories out of many that show the way forward on immigration. The first story is my own.

Our Family’s Big Car Accident

It was several minutes before 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning, October 3, 2004, and we were going to church. My mother and my younger siblings were in our vehicle, a Chevy Suburban. I was driving.

We were in a 40 mph zone, in a small town of about 10,000 in southern Minnesota. Only several minutes from the church, the road from our perspective curved to the right. On the right side of the road a bike path was being constructed, and dirt was piled high enough that one couldn’t really see around what was already a sharp curve.

All of a sudden, a Chevy Lumina came hurtling around the corner. When it first appeared, it was swerving in the middle of the road, but as it took the curve the Lumina fishtailed, sliding sideways into our lane. As soon as I saw it, I could tell it was coming right at us. I immediately cranked the steering wheel to the left. The Lumina slammed into us, and everything went blank.

Police later told us that because of that quick turn to the left, instead of T-boning the oncoming car, the front of our Suburban hit the rear of the Lumina. This allowed the Lumina to spin off to the right and lessened the force of the impact. Things would have been a lot worse had that not happened, or if we had been in a smaller vehicle. From the time we saw the oncoming vehicle to impact was no more than two to three seconds –– the Lumina came at us at approximately 80 miles per hour just before the curve, and an estimated 60 mph upon impact.

I awoke to airbag dust and smoke filling our vehicle. My ears were ringing. As the ringing started to go away, I could hear my little siblings and mother crying. In a panic, I checked to see if everyone was okay, and eventually stumbled out of the vehicle. I don’t remember much else from that day. I do remember that my right forearm was dark purple, as cranking the wheel to the left had placed my forearm directly over the airbag when it exploded.

Thankfully, nobody in my family was seriously hurt, though my sister had braces and her mouth was bloodied. By providence, the younger kids sitting in the back had been wearing their seat belts. A few people in our vehicle had back pain after the accident, and I still have a herniated disk with the accompanying neck, shoulder, and arm issues, a result of the airbag blowing my arm back as my body went forward (my right arm and hand ache as I write this today).

U.S. Taxpayers Spent Many Thousands to Save This Man

The drunk driver was thrown from his car and almost died. Bystanders who ran a bait shop on that road, along with arriving police officers, administered emergency care and helped save the man’s life. He was later airlifted to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The man was not only drunk when he hit us, but had also snorted cocaine before heading down the road. If the man hadn’t hit us, we were told, it was likely he would have careened into a house or business on the other side of the road.

We moved on with our lives. The police officers told us the man had no insurance, and was in the United States illegally. Because of this, we assumed he was deported. We harbored no ill-will toward him, and were grateful that nobody had died.

Fast-forward to this month. While doing research to write about the accident, I found out the man had not been deported. For hitting us that Sunday morning, a judge convicted the man of driving under the influence and gave him less than a year of electronic monitoring and two years of probation. At the time of the accident, the man had several assault convictions, and four years after he hit us he was again charged with assault. All these charges were for domestic abuse. On one occasion he caused a woman permanent damage after hitting her, say court records.

As to why he was never deported, a retired police officer I talked to said “illegal immigration was not as big a deal [politically]” in 2004, so there was likely no state or local policy to inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of illegal immigrant crimes. I was also informed by a source with knowledge of the situation that sometime during the last decade, the man had received legal protection to live in the United States.

Some Are All-American Kids

Just as true is the story of a young man, let’s call him John, who was brought here as a child from Mexico. John worked hard in school, graduated, and works hard to support his family now. He’s the type of guy who knows all the police officers in my home town — not because he’s ever been in trouble, but because every time he sees a cop he walks up and says “Hi.” They say “Hi” back, big smiles all around. John is the most likeable guy you’d ever meet.

He was excited to file taxes and open a bank account. George told me ‘the American Dream is the ultimate dream.’

Then there is George, my friend. He was brought here as a baby while his parents had a “border-crossing visa.” All he remembers is America. George is patriotic — a strong guy, he tried to join the Marines after graduating high school, but was turned away because he didn’t have his legal status at the time. George is also very smart. He thought about going to college for civil engineering, but he and his family could not afford college without grants or loans.

For a while, George helped his parents, who have legal status, at a Hispanic grocery store in our home town. While working there, he was arrested by ICE and had to pay $13,000 to get out of “federal hold” at a jail in a town about an hour away. His parents eventually sold the business after his dad was diagnosed with cancer.

A few years after graduating high school, George eventually received a visa. He was excited to file taxes, and open a bank account. George told me “the American Dream is the ultimate dream.” He says many people take things like being able to get a driver’s license for granted. Not him. George recently married. He is working while his wife goes to college, and trying to save money for their first home at the same time. George hopes to be a small business owner someday.

Another young man, Jack, is from a town that sits a half-hour away from mine. Jack was also brought here illegally as a child. Jack grew up in a rough part of that town, and hung out with the wrong crowd for a while. He sold drugs for a spell. Now, Jack is a Christian. Jack and his family are friends with my mother. Jack used to drive a half hour to go to my parents’ church.

Eventually, my parents’ church helped him, his family, and his friends start a Hispanic-focused church in Jack’s hometown. Many people who go to this church came here illegally as adults. They all live family-oriented and productive lives, and are intertwined with their communities.

The Illegal Immigration Extremists Aren’t Conservatives

Stories like those of John’s, George’s, and Jack’s play out in millions of lives across America. Millions more came here illegally as adults and didn’t commit any crimes after coming to America. Many of these people are husbands, wives, brothers, or sisters of American citizens.

For every undocumented drunk driver, there are many Johns, Georges, and Jacks. But while its incidence is far less likely, the story of the illegal immigrant who was high on cocaine and drunk on a Sunday morning has also played out across the country. Many times the ending has been much worse than it was for my family.

Because of this, to pretend that illegal immigration is no problem jeopardizes the lives of ordinary Americans. Tucker Carlson has done a great job highlighting this. Several weeks ago, he reported that the U.S. Sentencing Commission finally released stats on the percent of federal crimes non-citizens have committed. Carlson noted that this data wasn’t collected for years, an oddity in a country that collects data on everything.

According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, non-citizens receive 22 percent of all federal murder convictions, 18 percent of fraud convictions, 33 percent of money laundering convictions, 29 percent of drug trafficking convictions, and 72 percent of convictions for drug possession. Non-citizens, meanwhile, make up 7 percent of the population.

Yet many on the Left and in the Democrat Party do pretend that illegal immigration is no problem. They say the problem is mean-spirited policies pushed by some Republicans, whose motive is racism. In this vein, the Washington Post recently wrote a highly sympathetic story about a dance instructor from Mongolia, here illegally, who now faces deportation after he was convicted of two DUIs and a hit-and-run.

At the Washington Post, multiple DUIs and a hit and run aren't deportation-worthy as long as you're a good dance instructor. https://t.co/zwnILvCkZ4 — Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) December 28, 2017

The Post makes sure to highlight that one of the dance instructor’s friends is now no longer a Republican because of the deportation proceedings. The story implies the proceedings are due to the harsh policies of the Trump administration. The problem? Barack Obama’s immigration order from 2015, which sought to narrow deportations to those convicted of serious crimes, specifically targeted convictions of DUIs and domestic violence as the non-felonious route to deportation.

But in 2018, the Left has become so extreme that laws Democrats recently passed in California and Oregon seek to stop the feds from deporting even serious criminals like rapists or murderers. Democrats used to at least claim that they wanted to secure the border. Why have Democrats become so extreme on illegal immigration?

California used to be a Republican state, and now it is deep blue, in no small part due to an influx of immigrants from Mexico.

Back in 1986, President Reagan and Congress passed an amnesty bill that helped change the political landscape of the United States. California used to be a Republican state, and now it is deep blue, in no small part due to an influx of immigrants from Mexico. Democrats hope to do the same thing to other states, such as Texas. Don’t take my word for it, they have only written about such a strategy a million times.

In fact, if most illegal immigrants were dyed-in-the-wool Republicans (many are but don’t know it, though that’s another story), Democrats would be chanting “Build a wall!” faster than Rep. Adam Schiff can say “Russia!” Democrats’ calculus is simple. Win permanent political power by importing a large group of people who will disproportionately support Democrats.

So even if open borders are bad for Americans, including Americans of Mexican descent, Democrats support open borders. This is a party that cares more about political power than about Americans’ safety or economic wellbeing.

To Fix Immigration, Look to Middle America

Trump’s immigration proposal strikes the balance that the stories from Middle America require. The Trump administration has also been continuing Obama’s policy of prioritizing certain crimes for deportation, and not directly going after illegal immigrants with family here who haven’t been convicted of a serious crime. Many of the heartbreaking deportations highlighted in the media today occurred under the Obama administration with little fanfare.

It is unacceptable that undocumented immigrants with a serious criminal history aren’t shown the door.

On the other side of the same coin, it is unacceptable that undocumented immigrants with a serious criminal history aren’t shown the door. The president is right to think that states like California should face consequences for flouting federal law. Finally, any elected official who cares about the safety of ordinary Americans and the rule of law should seek to end or significantly curtail future illegal immigration. This means, among other things, building the entire border wall.

The above moderate approach is what most people in Middle America hope for, Democrat or Republican. But if Democrats want to use this as a political issue, how do conservatives move forward?

First, call Democrats’ bluff. Put the above compromise — including a border wall — up for a vote and show America that the “compassionate” party really prioritizes political power. Explain why Democrats have a politically driven interest in a leaky Southern border. Then hold off on deporting non-criminal DACA recipients, and hammer Democrats for their refusal to make a common-sense bargain.

Make a case that the conservatives are not the extremists on illegal immigration. Tell stories of productive and successful immigrants, and tell stories of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. These stories are not, nor have they ever been, mutually exclusive. At some level, the people in flyover country have already figured all this stuff out. But voters need to know that their politicians have figured it out too.

The Reported Spike In Anti-LGBT Homicides Is Fake News,"LGBT media outlets are implying the Trump administration is responsible for reports that the LGBT homicide rate doubled from 2016 to 2017. The media reports are citing an 86 percent increase in homicides, indicating a disturbing and sudden rise in violence. The details are laid out in a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs titled, “A crisis of hate a report on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and Queer Hate Violence Homicides in 2017.” But a closer look at those details, as is often the case, reveals some problems with the conclusion drawn in the headline.

In 2016 there were 28 murders of LGBT Americans. This increased to 52 murders in 2017. Remarkably, the 2016 Pulse Night Club Islamic terrorist attack, always referred to as a “shooting,” in which 49 members of the LGBT community were intentionally targeted and murdered, is not included in these statistics. The context of the murders, however, suggest most of them were not necessarily motivated by the victim’s sexual orientation.

“We are releasing this report during a time when our communities are witnessing the few civil rights protections and policies being rolled back and discrimination being instituted into law,” the report begins, “when media organizations and organizations working with survivors are receiving an unprecedented number of stories of hate fueled attacks.”

The murders are referred to as “hate violence” and “anti-LGBT homicides” throughout the report, which helpfully includes a comprehensive list of all the murder victims and a brief description of the details surrounding their deaths. Each individual has multiple news reports associated with their murder, including the original local report as well as larger media pieces. Although many lack sufficient information to determine a motive, a majority provide enough details to understand some of the context surrounding the murders.

There were 27 transgender victims included in the report. The LGBT media tends to give a special spotlight for transgender murder victims in yearly collections meant to persuade the reader of a unique threat to this community. But according to the report, roughly 15 of the 27 crimes against transgender people have no suspect, motive or resolution. A victim is simply discovered in an ally or a street with no indication of what occurred. Fewer than half of all violent crime and property crimes (burglary or theft) are solved in the United States. Without sufficient evidence, the police are simply unable to make any clear determinations.

Of the remaining transgender victims, three were killed during police altercations. In all of those scenarios, the transgender individual was behaving erratically and aggressively towards police officers with a weapon. Of the others with murder charges associated, none were apparently motivated by the victim’s gender identity. Most of the crimes against transgender people appear to be random acts of violence, associated with sex work, or altercations between people who knew each other. One 17-year-old victim was killed by a romantic partner and their friends.

The next largest grouping of murders in the report relates to gay hook-up websites or apps. The report cites 45 percent of the known homicides of gay men were the result of online hook-ups. This scenario reflects the gay male community’s long-held fear of violence during anonymous sexual encounters going back to movies like “Cruising” (1980) and the death of Hollywood icon, Sal Mineo. “Cruising” featured a gay serial killer who targets gay men in known areas where gay men “cruise” for anonymous sex. Mineo was murdered in 1976 during a sexual encounter that turned violent in a cruising spot in Hollywood.

In 2016 there were several examples of gay men being lured to their deaths by men attempting to rob them or intentionally kill them. An Idaho man lured a gay man into the woods with the promise of sex before beating him to death, and four Texas men lured multiple gay men into robberies. One was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In another disturbing trend, as detailed in Vice in an article titled, “I Tried to Score as Much Free Stuff as I Could Using Grindr,” young gay men attempt to manipulate older gay men with the promise of sex for gifts. The article discusses three writers intentionally trying to scam people on hook up apps for fun.

Sadly, many young gay men listed in the report were last known to have met someone online and were later found murdered. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs rationalizes this by stating, “Furthermore, there are ways that stigma, shame, and societal pressure may be contributing factors in hook up homicides where both individuals are queer, bi, or gay men.” In other words, it is well known that many gay male homicides are committed by other gay men. One victim was a lesbian murdered by a lesbian woman she met online.

Many on the list were killed by people they knew personally or in domestic violence. Roughly 11 of the 52 murders were committed by individuals the victim knew personally. Domestic violence is astonishingly high in the LGBT community. In 2010 the CDC reported that 43.8 percent of lesbians, 61.1 percent of bisexual women, 26 percent of gay men, and 37.3 percent of bisexual men experienced sexual assault, stalking or other physical violence from intimate partners. While it’s possible the murders committed by people the victim knew personally were motivated by a hate for their sexual orientation or gender identity, it’s much less likely, particularly in the case of loved ones and romantic partners.

After reviewing each of the 52 cases individually, it seems there are four pretty definite cases of anti-LGBT motivated homicides. Giovanni Melton, 14, was shot by his father during an altercation. The father, a convicted felon on previous battery charges, was vocally opposed to the young man’s sexual orientation. Rap icon, Kidd Creole, was charged with the murder of a homeless man when he stabbed him after interpreting the man’s greeting as a sexual invitation. He was walking with a large steak knife up his sleeve when he encountered the man.

Brandon Alexander Lyons and Jerrett Jamal Allen have been charged with the murder of one gay man and the possible abduction of another missing man. Both men were Asian, and the police believe the two men were targeting Asian men specifically. The two men themselves are Black. The dating app used was not specified so the homophobic motivation is speculation.

Juan Javier Cruz, 22, a straight man, was fatally shot in an altercation outside a night club in Lake Worth, Florida. He was with a group of gay friends when Nelson Hernandez Mena, 48, reported as an Honduran national, confronted them. As detailed by The Advocate, “Juan and Pedro Cruz stood side-by-side when Hernandez Mena and four other men confronted them. One of the men in the other group said that in other nations, men like Pedro and his friends would get killed. Hernandez Mena then said, ‘In my country I kill them like rats,’ according to Pedro Cruz.”

One final example that stands out is the murder of two lesbian women and their children in a brutal and intentional home invasion and murder. Two suspects were arrested and one of the suspects knew the women. According to the police, the suspects tied up the family and brutally killed them to steal their TV and Xbox.

While each life is valuable, and the goal of our society should be to end violence, random or intentional, there’s simply not enough here to claim a dramatic rise in “anti-LGBT” hate crimes in the United States. Reports like these, titled “A Crisis of Hate” propagate fear and paranoia in a specific community for the sake of political goals. LGBT media and organizations are stretching the narrative extremely thin when reporting these events. The new standard seems to be that if a victim is gay or transgender, their murder must be “anti-LGBT” in nature.

It’s important to continue researching and challenging these claims, but no victim listed here is necessarily honored or avenged by the positioning their murder as a larger political act. No future victim is potentially protected by perpetuating an exaggerated narrative of homophobic hatred and violence. Data must be accurate and reports like this must present a true picture of events.

On closer examination it appears that 4 of the 52 cases in 2017 were possibly anti-LGBT driven, and yet the headlines will continue to shout an 86 percent increase in anti-LGBT hate crimes. The more the LGBT media manipulates the narrative to perpetuate politically convenient fear, the less average Americans will appreciate true violence towards the gay and transgender community. This unethical behavior in journalism and advocacy organizations only harms the people it is attempting to protect.

"Right Now, Democrats Have No Obstruction Case Against Trump","After more than a year, Donald Trump opponents — at least those who don’t care about convincing the American people on policy differences — are starting to realize they are drilling a dry hole when searching for his alleged collusion with Russia. Not to be dissuaded, the “Resistance” is now hoping that former FBI director and now special counsel Robert Mueller is building an obstruction-of-justice case against the president.

Obstruction of justice is defined as “corruptly” attempting to “influence, intimidate, or impede” an investigation or legal proceeding. How exactly do some think President Trump obstructed justice? There are supposedly many examples, the latest being the New York Times’ report that Trump wanted to fire Mueller but decided against it, only after the threat of resignation by his top lawyer (this portrayal has since been disputed, and said to be far less dramatic).

Wait a second. President Trump talking about firing Mueller but not actually doing so — a move that would be politically dangerous but also totally within his power as president — amounts to obstruction? That’s exactly what CNN’s top #MeToo campaigner Ryan Lizza thinks, and so do many elected Democrats (especially those facing a primary opponent or who would like to run for president). Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) just told not-crazy Rachel Maddow that there is now a “credible case” of obstruction of justice against President Trump.

Their fantasy of an obstruction case against Trump also rests on when Trump asked former FBI director James Comey, before firing him, to go easy on former national security advisor Michael Flynn. Mueller has interviewed Comey, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Flynn, and is hoping to interview President Trump — the cast of characters involved in the firings of both Flynn and Comey.

It’s Not a Crime for the President to Exercise His Powers

On this angle, here’s Vox’s Zach Beauchamp: “The case against Trump on obstruction grounds is very strong — stronger even than the evidence that the Trump campaign broke the law by colluding with Russian’s campaign to influence the election.” Beauchamp says this is particularly true “when it comes to the Comey firing.”

Huh? How was Comey’s firing, which was perfectly in Trump’s power as president, a crime? President Bill Clinton, for example, fired his FBI director. The theory is that if Trump intended to interfere in the Russia investigation when he fired Comey, this amounts to obstruction. “This all hinges on what was in the president’s mind when he fired Comey,” says Beauchamp.

Beauchamp and his sources believe there is good evidence of intent to obstruct: “There’s an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in which Trump admits to removing the FBI chief because he felt ‘this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.’ There was Trump’s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov the day after the firing, where he told the foreign diplomat that ‘I faced great pressure because of Russia [and now] that’s taken off.’ And then there are his endless tweets about how he thinks the Russia investigation is a ‘witch hunt’ and should be shut down.”

Open and shut, at least according to Beauchamp. But Mueller can’t just prosecute the president. If Mueller really believes he has an obstruction case, what would he do? First, he would have to go to Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general for the Russia investigation (Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation). If Rosenstein approves it, Mueller would issue a report outlining the obstruction charge. At that point, if Congress wants to take up impeachment, it can.

The ‘Obstruction’ Charge Is Junk Law

This kind of liberal chatter is simply junk law, like the recently trashed Emoluments Clause suit against Trump brought by left-wing law professors who should have known better. It’s also like the junk science that other anti-Trumpers have been practicing in claiming that the president’s mind is unsound.

First of all, every one of Trump’s actions cited as grounds for an obstruction charge are well within the powers of the presidency, regardless of intent. On this note, famed attorney Alan Dershowitz rightly says that an obstruction case would need to contain an explicit misdeed outside of the president’s powers, such as paying hush money, telling people to lie, or destroying evidence. These are specific and corrupt actions, present in the Clinton and Nixon investigations and impeachment proceedings, a president doesn’t have the constitutional power to do. There is zero evidence any of these actions occurred in the case at hand. Democrats are twisting the definition of obstruction of justice to mean almost nothing.

What of President Trump’s comments about Flynn or the Russia investigation? A president is perfectly entitled to weigh in on an investigation, even one that touches him, just as President Obama did on multiple occasions. The Constitution’s Article II “Vesting” Clause, coupled with its “Take Care” Clause, puts the president in charge of all federal criminal investigations and prosecutions. As a result, the president can order any investigation or prosecution discontinued at his or her sole discretion. Period.

The president can also end an investigation for any reason. Just like the absoluteness of the veto power, federal criminal law cannot look behind the president’s lawful decisions pertaining to an investigation. In addition, because the president has the pardon power, the president may weigh in on criminal investigations and prosecutions (an investigation would make no sense if the individual subject to investigation were pardoned).

The late Antonin Scalia argued as much in the 1988 “Independent Counsel” case, Morrison v. Olson. He argued the Constitution confers on the president the exclusive power to conduct federal criminal prosecutions — including in their investigative phase. Although a dissent, Scalia’s opinion has garnered widespread approval from liberal and conservative legal scholars alike. (Professor Cass Sunstein, later an Obama appointee, said Scalia’s opinion had “nailed it.”) What’s to stop improper behavior by a president, then, when that behavior falls under constitutionally granted powers? The political process, which flows from the people, of course.

What’s more, Trump did not interfere with or terminate the FBI investigation; he only terminated Comey. And there is no reason to believe Trump even attempted to exert improper influence on Comey’s investigation of Flynn. This is so even if one accepts Comey’s recollection that Trump told him he “hope[d] you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go . . . . He is a good guy.” If it becomes an impeachable offense for a president to “hope” an FBI director will “see his way” to ending an investigation, then the president’s control over federal law enforcement, not to mention his or her ability to present the issue to the public, has been shredded.

But for the sake of argument, let’s say that the Left’s legal experts are correct, and that a president may be charged for exercising his or her constitutionally granted power if the intent of the action was “illegal.” Put aside the obvious problem of allowing the intent of a president’s otherwise-lawful actions to be analyzed for illegality by that president’s political opponents — which makes the same point as above but from an angle of practicality — and accept that Trump’s intent, if it was meant to interfere with the so-called Russia investigation, could be damning. What do the facts show?

Comey’s Firing Was Not Obstruction

Trump had crystal-clear reasons to fire Comey, even if Trump thought he would be treated more fairly after Comey was gone. Comey’s intervention before the election to re-open then close the Clinton email investigation after Clinton emails were found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop was, as Rep. Matt Gaetz correctly labeled it, a classic “CYA” move.

Comey was telling Trump privately that he was not under investigation, but hinting to Congress publicly that the president was under investigation.

Democrats like to complain about this, but Comey’s intervention was necessitated by the FBI’s corrupted handling of the Clinton email investigation. We now know that former FBI number two Andrew McCabe (who was just pushed out last week) knew about the emails on Weiner’s laptop and sat on the information for weeks. Eventually, FBI agents threatened to bypass McCabe and take the information public.

Comey couldn’t risk the FBI’s bias coming under public scrutiny. If he had done nothing, the news of Weiner’s laptop would have leaked and been even worse for Clinton and Comey. On top of this, Comey assumed Clinton was sure to win.

Right before being fired, Comey was also telling Trump privately that he was not under investigation, but hinting to Congress publicly that the president was under investigation. This likely caused some “fire and fury” in the Oval Office, and would provide ample intent for firing Comey.

Also keep in mind that during this time, frustration with the FBI was already at a maximum. Howard Kurtz’s new book, “Media Madness,” tells how McCabe asked former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus for a private meeting. McCabe wanted to tell Priebus that a New York Times story, sourced by four anonymous intelligence officials and saying that Russian intelligence had contacts with the Trump campaign, was “bullsh-t.”

The meeting seems to have been a set-up. Mollie Hemingway tells it this way:

McCabe claimed to want Priebus to know the FBI’s perspective that this story was not true. Priebus pointed to the televisions that were going non-stop on the story. He asked if the FBI could say publicly what he had just told him. McCabe said he’d have to check, according to the book. McCabe reportedly called back and said he couldn’t do anything about it. Then-FBI director James Comey reportedly called later and also said he couldn’t do anything, but did offer to brief the Senate Intelligence Committee on the matter later that week, suggesting they’d spill the beans publicly. You’ll never guess what happened next…

A week later, CNN blared that the FBI had refused a White House request to “knock down” stories of Trump campaign contacts with the Russians. This wasn’t the only time something like this happened. Here’s Hemingway again: “Partisan operatives in or close to the FBI communicated snippets of information with reporters who didn’t demand proof or substantiation, then FBI officials denied to White House officials who knew the facts that they were seeding that information, then officials suggested that White House operatives were obstructing justice by asking for the truth to out.”

The decision to fire Comey couldn’t have conceivably delayed or impeded the Russia investigation, because that remained in the hands of Comey’s deputy.

Was Comey involved in setting up White House officials for obstruction charges like this? Who knows, but this certainly would give a president grounds to clean house at the FBI. If that also meant an investigation without basis, and possibly meant to cover up FBI wrongdoing, might end (it didn’t), and the president would stop seeing his election victory undermined as a bonus (he didn’t), then so be it. If that’s obstruction, then Adam Schiff is Santa Claus.

But the real arrow in the heart of the obstructionistas is what Trump knew about the Russia-investigation at the time. The decision to fire Comey couldn’t have conceivably delayed or impeded the Russia investigation, because that remained in the hands of McCabe, Comey’s deputy, who became acting FBI director in Comey’s absence.

McCabe reported to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, who gave the green light to fire Comey. And the Trump administration waited for Rosenstein’s approval before firing Comey, in an attempt to observe process. It is also no small coincidence that Comey was fired soon after the Senate confirmed Rosenstein, as it would be completely natural for Rosenstein to do a staff review in his first several weeks on the job.

Trump turned out to be more than right about Comey. We now know that Comey lied when he said Obama’s attorney general Loretta Lynch didn’t know whether he would recommend charges against Hillary Clinton, at least according to the Page-Strzok texts. We also know that Comey leaked classified information to a law professor friend to get a special prosecutor appointed, and is now claiming this friend is his attorney to attempt to protect their conversations with attorney-client privilege.

How Trump Handled Flynn Was Not Obstruction

When Comey was fired, the alleged big concern that sparked Comey to write and leak recollections of conversations with the president and testify to Congress — with the explicit goal of getting a special counsel appointed — was that Trump had urged Comey to “go easy” on Flynn. What happened with Flynn?

Flynn was doing what every national security advisor does: talking to foreign officials.

After Trump was elected and before the inauguration, Flynn was doing what every national security advisor does: talking to foreign officials. Flynn’s job was especially busy, because Obama’s administration was flouting presidential decorum to place new sanctions on a major foreign power — Russia — and planning on abstaining (not vetoing, a first for U.S. policy) from a U.N. Security Council vote that would declare Israel’s settlements illegal.

So during the presidential transition Flynn phoned the Russian ambassador, asked him to help delay the U.N. vote, and asked him to not retaliate against Obama sanctions. These actions, while Obama was still in office, supposedly ran afoul of the 1799 Logan Act, that forbids “any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government … in relation to disputes or controversies with the United States.”

The Obama administration had warned the Trump transition about the Logan Act, and a long line of Democrats during the 2016 campaign called for Trump or his officials to be prosecuted based on Logan Act violations. This is why, at the behest of Obama DOJ holdover Sally Yates, FBI agents including Strzok went to interview Flynn, days after Trump’s inauguration, about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Flynn, likely worried about the Logan Act, lied to the FBI agents about his transition-period conversations.

Now, a Logan Act violation is a non-crime. The law, signed by John Adams, has been widely disregarded by incoming administrations, including the Obama administration, never been prosecuted, and is likely unconstitutional. Heck, John Kerry is a walking Logan Act violation. We all eagerly await Yates’ calls for the former secretary of State to be prosecuted. In this light, Trump’s admonition to “go easy” on Flynn could easily have meant just that. The FBI did “entrap” Flynn (at least in the colloquial sense) with a fake pretext, after all.

Do Democrats Want to Tear the Country Apart?

Most troubling is the politics at play, and what all this means for the country. Previous cases of investigation and impeachment in the modern era, against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, started because of some underlying crime that had occurred in which the president was complicit.

Without a crime in mind, the Department of Justice should never have appointed a special counsel.

Here, we still have no evidence of any underlying crime. There is no evidence Trump had anything to do with any Russian interference in the 2016 election. As Andrew McCarthy has pointed out, without a crime in mind, the Department of Justice should never have appointed a special counsel. The only meager evidence offered of collusion has been a Trump Tower meeting and a dossier, both of which were engineered by Fusion GPS, a firm with ties to the Kremlin that was being paid by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign to come up with evidence of collusion.

So none of this is like anything in modern history. But this is like the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. Johnson, a Southerner, was Lincoln’s vice president. After Lincoln’s assassination, a Republican Congress wanted Johnson out, and passed a law that said he couldn’t fire members of his cabinet (with whom he didn’t get on well).

Johnson fired away, and the House voted to impeach. In the end, Johnson hung on to office by a single vote in the Senate. That was right after a civil war. The fact that things could be getting that bad again should tell us something about the current state of America, and of today’s Democrat Party.

This type of thinking will tear the country apart. Amazingly, it is coming from people claiming to stand up for American institutions.

Let’s be blunt. Trump’s supporters know the facts above. They know that this entire affair has been manufactured out of whole-cloth. These voters also have real concerns that official Washington — both parties — has ignored for decades.

If Democrats move for impeachment, again depending on what Mueller does, there is no sex harassment case (Paula Jones), cajoling of witnesses, or break-in at the Watergate Hotel to at least somewhat justify such an action. There is only a power-hungry establishment, still feeling the sting of an election that they should have won.

This type of thinking will tear the country apart. Amazingly, it is coming from people claiming to stand up for American institutions, like Morning-Prozac Joe Scarborough. What can be done? Voters must ask their elected officials, both Republican and Democrat, to deal with the abuse of power at our intelligence agencies, then move on from the 2016 election.

Republicans should give Mueller the benefit of the doubt, but should not feel they are being Trump sycophants if they have to thwack Mueller, or ignore him, for exceeding his ill-defined boundaries. Mueller’s boundaries need to be clearly laid out, and voters should support politicians that call for this, not who think this unimportant.

Democrats also have something to gain from ending this madness. Obsessing over collusion and obstruction is not good for the Democratic Party, or for the people Democrats claim to champion. This country needs a responsible left-of-center party, maybe now more than ever. So far, such a party is nowhere to be found.

"As A Nation, Poland Was Not Complicit In The Holocaust","When the Polish government passed a bill on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day in an effort to criminalize attributing responsibility for the Holocaust to Poles, many Israeli leaders and Jews became furious considering the move tantamount to a form of Holocaust denial.

The proposed legislation reads: “Whoever claims, publicly and contrary to the facts, that the Polish Nation or the Republic of Poland is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reich… or for other felonies that constitute crimes against peace, crimes against humanity or war crimes, or whoever otherwise grossly diminishes the responsibility of the true perpetrators of said crimes – shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to 3 years.”

If the act is committed unintentionally, “the perpetrator shall be liable to a fine or a restriction of liberty” and, “No offence is committed if the criminal act specified in clauses 1 and 2 is committed in the course of the one’s artistic or academic activity.”

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and opposition member Yair Lapid blasted Poland’s leadership for the new legislation, with the latter tweeting “Poland was complicit in the Holocaust” and firing back at the Polish embassy, “I don’t need Holocaust education from you.” Meanwhile, the Facebook page “German Death Camps” has 36,000 “likes” demonstrating the popularity of the Polish initiative aimed at setting the record straight that the death camps were Nazi German and that Poles were victims, too. Still today, Poles are struggling to assert their sovereignty through commemorating World War II and the Holocaust after decades of ideologically motivated and historically misconstrued “memorializing” by the Soviets.

The Enmity Between Jews and Poles

There is indeed a long history of tension between Poles and Jews, and it persists. Consider that, in 1998, Polish Catholics erected hundreds of crosses along the periphery of Auschwitz and a Polish man named Kazimierz Switon set up a tent beside them as a self-appointed guard who claimed to be defending Polish soil against the Jews: ”We do not tell the Jews what to do in their country, and they have no right to tell us what to do on our Polish soil.” Roughly a decade earlier, when Lech Wałęsa became the first Polish leader to visit Israel, Yitzhak Shamir, then Israeli prime minister, remarked, “every Pole sucked anti-Semitism with his mother’s milk.”

The antagonism between Poles and Jews is not the same as base racism; there is enmity on the level of rival religious truth claims, adding layers of complexity. It is impossible to understand the conflict between Israel and Poland without understanding the religious tension between Judaism and Christianity.

I’m a Jewish Catholic. My Polish-Jewish grandfather fled the country because of anti-Semitic economic policies of the Polish government in the 1930s. If ever I mention to Jews that I chose to go to graduate school in Poland, this is often met with a searching, “How could you?” In those moments, I recall the times I visited some small Polish town. I would read the Wikipedia description of it and, standing in that very place, learn the date during the Second World War that the town had been pronounced free of Jews. I thought to myself solemnly, “And yet, here I stand.”

But Poland is also a country of saints, heroes, and martyrs. I did not move there, though, because of patriotism for the flag but rather out of love for John Paul II, Janusz Korczak, and Maximilian Kolbe. In fact, I love Poland and Israel so deeply that asking me to choose loyalties between the two is like asking me to say whether I love my mother or father more.

Poles Were Not Complicit in the Holocaust En Masse

Now, I completely oppose the Polish bill. There should not be laws against speech. However, saying in some general sense that Poles were complicit in Holocaust crimes is as inappropriate as saying that Jews were complicit. Generally, Poles and Jews were both victims of the Nazis. Poles should never dare to say, “We did enough” no matter the heroism of many of their citizens, which is of course commendable. And Jews, so keen to preserve the memory of those who perished and the accuracy of historical truth, should never dare to minimize the suffering of the Poles with whom they have so much in common as both a suffering and triumphant people.

I spent the past summer in Israel and visited Yad Vashem for my second time. On this visit, our Israeli guide Assaf told us a story about his grandfather.

His grandfather, who had fled Poland and made it to Israel via the Soviet Union, thought it his mission, after the Second World War, to return to Poland to help survivors get to Israel illegally. So in 1946 he was on a train from Warsaw to Białystok, in a train car with two Polish women — one elderly and the other a teenager. Between stations, armed men entered the train and announced, “All the Jews on the train, identify yourselves!”

Assaf’s grandfather froze. It was 1946. Having survived the war for five years, his life was now threatened and he was terrified. The younger woman sneered at him, “I can see that you are a Jew and that you are scared. When they come to our car, I’m going to tell them about you.” At this moment, the elderly woman scolded the younger one, “You won’t dare tarnish the honor of the Polish people, or I’ll kill you!” Seventeen Jews were removed from the train and shot by Poles. Assaf’s grandfather survived because of the older Polish woman’s firm and courageous words, her refusal to be a bystander, and the noblest understanding of true patriotism.

But what about the 17 Jews on that single train murdered that day? What about all of the passengers on the train who stayed silent?

‘Above All, Be Not a Bystander’

When I was 18, I participated in a Holocaust study trip to Germany and Poland with 60 students and two survivors. The backs of our T-shirts said, “Be not a victim, be not a perpetrator, but above all be not a bystander.” This was the moral of the trip, and I hope to never forget it as long as I live. Good men who do nothing are not morally good after all. Evil triumphs and the good men have sins of omission.

Like Solzhenitsyn said, “the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” While nations can be spoken of in a general sense and the spirit of a people is somewhat real, what matters morally are the actions of individual persons. As the Pole who would become pope explained, “The concept of social morality is, of course, something very real and continually evolving, but it in no way represents an attempt to substitute society for the human person as the substantial subject of moral values and the proper center of morality.” It remains, therefore, the task of every person in every generation to recover and affirm the dignity and humanity of others.

The Polish law purports to “protect the reputation of the Republic of Poland and the Polish Nation… on the protection of personal rights.” But the “Republic” and the “Nation” are not a person. By contrast, Yad Vashem confers on behalf of the State of Israel the title of Righteous Among the Nations (honoring heroic non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews) only to individuals and not to groups. In this respect, Israel justly affirms the primacy and precision of personal responsibility while Poland surprisingly veers toward the collectivism they are usually apt to resist.

According to Yad Vashem: “Poles constitute the largest national group within the Righteous Among the Nations recognized by Yad Vashem. Considering the harsh punishment that threatened rescuers, this is a most impressive number. On the other hand, when evaluating the role of Poles in the rescue of Jews, one also has to take into consideration that Poland’s Jewish community was by far the largest in Europe and that only about 10% of its Jews survived.” How can we fail to mourn the lives of all who perished with anything but humility and profound sadness?

Let us remember that John Paul II, the greatest son of Poland, always sought to call people to more activity, more resistance against injustice, and more responsibility for our neighbor. It was not at the site of any of the countless invaded, occupied, and besieged places in Poland that John Paul II said, “I have come and I kneel on this Golgotha of the modern world.” He said that at Auschwitz.

In these tense times, what is truly being sought? What do we stand to gain and to lose? How do we honor the victims who perished and, a fortiori, how do we honor the Righteous Among the Nations, who should be our truest exemplars of how to live together and defend one another more valiantly?

Why It Shouldn’t Be A Federal Crime To Punch Reporters,"Earlier this month, Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell introduced a bill to make it a federal crime to physically attack a journalist. As a member of the minority party, Swalwell likely knows that his bill has little chance of passage and is more an exercise in virtue-signaling than legislating.

But the bill demonstrates two troubling trends: a lack of respect for the limits of federal power and a profound misunderstanding of the rights protected by the First Amendment. Swalwell’s bill, which has the Orwellian title of “Journalist Protection Act , ” would for the first time define reporters as a protected class with special privileges. In the name of protecting reporters, the bill would degrade First Amendment freedoms for all Americans.

Can They Do That?

The most obvious flaw in the bill is that it would involve Congress exercising a power that the Constitution does not grant to the federal government. The section of the U.S. Code to which Swalwell would add his new law, Title 18, Section 7, deals mostly with assaults against federal officers, or assaults committed on federal property. The reason for this is simple: these are the only assaults the federal government has the power to punish.

Our Constitution created a federal government of limited powers. Although Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution provides a lengthy list of things over which Congress has the power to make laws, the list is intended to be exhaustive.

Enacting a criminal code for federal lands is easily encompassed within the grant of power to “exercise exclusive Legislation … over such District … as may … become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over … [federally owned] Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.” Likewise, one could extrapolate a power to ban assaults on federal officers as being “necessary and proper” to carry out federal laws—federal laws would not be obeyed very often if federal officers could be assaulted at will.

When the first federal Congress (which included some of the same men who wrote the Constitution) passed a crimes act, the act concerned crimes of uniquely federal jurisdiction, including treason, piracy, and counterfeiting. Where “ordinary” crimes like murder were banned in that act, it was only when they were committed in the sort of federal property or district the Constitution specifies.

There is a good reason that Congress did not seek to punish ordinary crimes committed outside of federal property: there was no grant of power in the Constitution to do so. Nor was there intended to be such a provision: common-law crimes—including assault and battery—were already illegal in every state, just as they are today.

Modern members of Congress are less restrained, although the Constitution could check their excesses should a more expansive law, like this one, be challenged. Swalwell attempts to throw a fig leaf over his naked power grab by limiting the law’s scope to injuries to journalists committed “in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.” But this is merely boilerplate language added to many a law that overreaches federal authority, and courts are likely to see through it.

In the challenges to Obamacare, for example, courts found that Congress’s enumerated power over interstate commerce did not give them the power to compel purchases of health insurance; that requirement only survived through a creative reading to the power to tax. The same result would likely apply here. What part of punching a journalist in the face could possibly implicate interstate commerce, unless the assaulter paid someone to cross state lines to do it?

Reporters Are Not a Separate Caste

Many of the Founding Fathers believed that the limits to federal power were so clear in the Constitution’s text that no Bill of Rights would be necessary. After all, if Congress does not have the power to establish a state religion, why would it be necessary to explicitly ban it from doing so?

In this case and others, the Anti-Federalists’ wisdom has benefitted us. Clever lawmakers will always find a way to stretch an enumerated power to cover something they want to do, and judges are increasingly unlikely to call them out on it. The explicit prohibitions of the Bill of Rights have time and again saved us from creeping tyranny.

But Swalwell’s bill also deeply misunderstands the Bill of Rights, specifically the freedom of the press protected by the First Amendment. In writing a bill for the specific protection of one class of people—journalists—Swalwell and his cosponsors make a mistake that many journalists do: believing that the freedom of the press is a right granting certain privileges to a certain group. This is not the case, either with press freedoms or any others guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. The First Amendment does not create a caste system; its protections are the birthright of all Americans.

The trouble springs in part because journalists as a group refer to themselves as “the press.” The practice, which probably arose because of the words of the First Amendment, is an example of metonymy, the rhetorical device by which a thing is referred to by the name of something closely associated with it. For example: when a news report says “the White House refused comment,” it is not talking about the building itself, but the people who work there.

Likewise, the “press” originally referred to the printing press on which newspapers and books were made. Later, it became extended by metonym to include the entire publishing industry and even people who work in publishing. Members of the press have used this to claim a special “reporter’s privilege,” a claim the Supreme Court rejected in Branzburg v. Hayes in 1972 and lower courts have continued to reject ever since.

Freedom of the press, therefore, is shorthand not for the freedom of a group of people, but for the freedom to publish. Comparison to state constitutions written at the same time bears this out. Pennsylvania’s 1776 constitution, for example, declares that “the people have a right to freedom of speech, and of writing, and publishing their sentiments; therefore the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained.” The emphasis clearly is on the right to publish, which is guaranteed to all people. In restricting the practice of journalism to a select group, the bill’s author misses this crucial point about our natural rights.

Swalwell would turn this universal freedom on its head, and not only by extending special protections to one class. By naming that class—journalists—in his bill, he is also obliged to define it. In doing so, he would have Congress define this group of people for the first time, and give unprecedented powers to the federal government in the process.

The Government Should Not Have This Power

Presidents have long feuded with their enemies in the press. Barack Obama famously and repeatedly snubbed Fox News, while Donald Trump is constantly locked in a war of words with CNN, among others. Under current law, words are the only weapons at the government’s disposal. A president may attempt to discredit reporters or news companies by criticizing them, but his words do not carry the force of law.

Under Swalwell’s bill, the government would now define “journalist.” As the proposed act states:

The term ‘journalist’ means an individual who— (A) is an employee, independent contractor, or agent of an entity or service that disseminates news or information— (i) by means of a newspaper, nonfiction book, wire service, news agency, news website, mobile application or other news or information service (whether distributed digitally or otherwise), news program, magazine, or other periodical (whether in print, electronic, or other format); or (ii) through television broadcast, radio broadcast, multichannel video programming distributor (as such term is defined in section 602(13) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 522(13))), or motion picture for public showing; and “(B) with the primary intent to investigate events or procure material in order to disseminate to the public news or information concerning local, national, or international events or other matters of public interest, engages in newsgathering.

The first problem is that this requires a journalist to act on behalf of a company; independent writers need not apply. Absurdly, an article like the one you are reading now would be treated differently under law if it were published on my personal website instead of here in The Federalist.

Secondly, the bill limits how information may be published in order to be considered “real” journalism. Thirdly, and most importantly, the statute defines the permissible intent of a journalist, which is the dissemination of things that are “matters of public interest.”

Putting the government in charge of what counts as ‘real’ reporting would be a disaster for press freedom.

Who defines public interest? As of now, the public does. If you are interested in something, you read it. If not, you don’t. Journalists catch on pretty quickly about what the public is interested in and direct their efforts accordingly. Under Swalwell’s bill, the government is the judge of where those efforts should be directed, with the direction of those efforts determining who is considered a journalist under the law. Whether this classification would be determined by regulation or by courts, the bill does not say.

There is a lot of fake news out there, but putting the government in charge of what counts as “real” reporting would be a disaster for press freedom. The Clinton White House told the public repeatedly in the late 1990s that the president’s sexual adventures were not a legitimate topic for reporters to pursue. President Trump would likely say the same about his tax returns, business dealings, and extramarital affairs. Journalists and their readers and viewers decided otherwise, as is our right—for now.

Swalwell’s bill would limit a universal freedom to a discrete class, and place the government—either through bureaucracy or through the courts—in charge of defining that class. In the process, it would expand federal government powers ever farther beyond the bounds of the Constitution. The proposed Journalist Protection Act is just the latest example of governmental overreach and ignorance of the nature of our fundamental rights.

Jewish Americans Deserve Better Than The Anti-Defamation League,"Anti-Semitism is a serious, albeit relatively small, problem in American life. Still, it’s a shame that the folks at the Anti-Defamation League, self-styled spokespeople of we Jews, are in the business of exaggerating threats when it serves their partisan interests and underplaying threats when they do not.

The ADL’s most recent study on rising anti-Semitism was, as always, carried by a number of media outlets. “Antisemitic incidents in US soar to highest level in two decades,” read one headline atop a picture of angry Tiki-torch Nazis in Charlottesville. “Largest year-on-year increase since 1979 comes as Trump administration is accused of failing to condemn bigotry.”

Anti-Semitism isn’t “soaring” in America, and the ADL knows it. Among 330 or-so million Americans, the ADL notes that there were 1,986 anti-Semitic reported incidents across the United States in 2017. That’s a 57 percent increase over the 1,267 reported incidents in 2016. Yet the ADL admits a part of the spike was driven by a surge in self-reporting rather than a surge in incidents.

Yet, even if we were to take all of this unscientific survey at face value, it hardly supports the dramatic contention that the number is “soaring.” Put it this way, in 1939 the German-American Bund could pack Madison Square Garden with 22,000 cheering fascists, but today neo-Nazis can barely pull together 200 people for a national conference.

The ADL’s report states that there “were 1,015 incidents of harassment, including 163 bomb threats against Jewish institutions, up 41 percent from 2016.” No one should doubt that harassment exists. I’ve been on the ugly end of such efforts myself. And bomb threats are a form of terrorism, a threat of violence used to intimidate entire communities. The thing is that every single one of the bomb threats in the ADL survey were made by a single deranged self-hating Jewish teenager who was arrested in Israel. His actions have little to do with any supposed “soaring” animus towards American Jewry.

It is true that Jews are most often the victims of the rare faith-based hate crimes in America. In 2016, the FBI reported that 21 percent of hate crimes were prompted by religious bias and, of those, 54.4 percent were victims of crimes motivated by an anti-Jewish bias. (The next closest is anti-Muslim crimes, at 24.5 percent.) This consists of 834 total hate crimes against Jews in 2016, the vast majority non-violent. That is 834 too many, of course, but also 834 of among tens of million criminal offenses. Those genuinely concerned about anti-Semitism don’t do anyone a favor by exaggerating the problem.

It should be pointed out, though, that there is a population that runs into anti-Jewish sentiment more than most. The ADL and its activist head, Jonathan Greenblatt, would have you believe that “white supremacy” is the leading cause of anti-Semitism on college campuses throughout the United States. The narrative must be fed, after all. The ADL tells us that from Sept. 1, 2016 to Feb. 1, 2018, “346 incidents” of Nazi types handing out propaganda on campus were recorded. This, according to the ADL, is the most disturbing trend on campuses.

As one of my Twitter followers correctly noted, “The idea that Jews are more likely to encounter white supremacists than aggressively anti-Israel bds groups is utter delusion.”

The BDS movement, for example, embraced not only by most progressive groups these days but also by some school administrations, specifically — and, for that matter, exclusively — targets businesses that deal with the ideologically diverse population of Jews. As the AMCHA Initiative, a group that tracks anti-Semitism on campus, puts it, “BDS campaigns are coordinated internationally by groups committed to the elimination of the Jewish state, including terrorist organizations such as Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, that engage in and promote the murder of Jews worldwide.” How many “incidents” do you think are there on college campuses of the BDS spreading its message?

Unsurprisingly, this effort is associated with the uptick in anti-Semitism on campus. In 2016, researchers at Brandeis University conducted a study concentrating on Jewish undergraduate students at 50 U.S. campuses who had applied to go on the Birthright Israel trip. The study found that CUNY schools and University of California systems had become “hotspots” of hostility towards Jewish students. The more campuses were involved in BDS, the higher their rates of anti-Semitic harassment and hostility, driven by animosity toward Israel.

There is a long history of leftist anti-Semitism and a corresponding history of liberal Jewish groups belittling its importance. Jew hatred, of course, isn’t confined to one fringe. But Nazis and Klansmen remain stigmatized and excluded by the vast majority of political operators. On the other hand, terror-apologists like Linda Sarsour, a leader of the Resistance who claims Zionism is incompatible with feminism, are being increasingly welcomed into the fold of mainstream left-wing activism.

The idea of Zionism being an “inherently white supremacist ideology” has gained some popularity not only on campuses but among a growing group of progressives. While the ADL notes this trend — and it has to be stressed that the ADL does often note instances of anti-Semitism on the Left— it has a bad habit of burying that pertinent news to create a more convenient plot for political purposes.

4 Things We Can All Do To Stop The Next Shooting,"“Did you see that story on the news today?” my dad asked when I was about 11 years old. “A man caught his wife and kids trying to leave him. He came home, and they were packing up their things. He went in the house and got his gun. First, he shot the kids, then he shot the wife, and then he shot himself. They all died. You won’t ever leave me, will you?”

This was how my dad ensured my silence and submission. And my dad knew how to use his gun too. He proved that when he shot a neighbor kid’s dog right in front of me, from thirty feet away, just for the fun of it. I can still hear the dog’s yowls. They weren’t yelps, like you’d expect from a dog. They were screeches of pain and terror.

About a decade later, my dad once again threatened to murder my entire family. He didn’t threaten frequently, but I can recall a handful of occasions. He usually posed the threats as a joke or cloaked them in the context of a news story. This time, I was engaged to be married. I feared that the stressor of losing control of me might be the straw that broke the demon’s back. I stole his gun. I hid it, unloaded and wrapped in a towel, in a box of chintzy craft supplies, knitting, and fashion accessories I’d accrued as a teenager. It was the last place he’d look.

I left the ammo in his dresser drawer. It was my way of mocking him, as if to say, “I’ve taken your power, but left the bullets so you can play marbles with them.”

I never told the police about my dad’s abuse; his sexual perversion, murderous threats, or violent assaults. I loved my dad. I feared my dad. I still do. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I also didn’t want to risk being stuck in the same house with him if the police failed to arrest him. As a survivor of 20 years of domestic violence, I fully support my right as a mother to arm and defend myself should anyone ever threaten me or my family again.

My dad is not a school shooter. As far as I’m aware, he’s never shot anyone, although there is a family story that he once stabbed his sister in the hand. Nevertheless, he could have become a shooter and I didn’t tell a soul. I am certain that he is just one among thousands of violent offenders who slip under the radar because no one ever reports them. I suspect, like me, most don’t report because they both love and fear their abuser. No one wants to believe that their dad, brother, son, mother, daughter, or friend, could be the next monster on the five o’clock news.

Peter Langman, Ph.D., is a respected authority on mass shooters, particularly youth and school shooters. He has conducted extensive research and published works regarding the psychology of adolescent murderers. In a harrowing and fascinating study, “Rampage Shooters: A Typology,” Langman divides school shooters into three basic categories: Traumatized, Psychotic, and Psychopathic.

Traumatized Shooters come from dysfunctional families. Each of these shooters in his study experienced physical or sexual abuse. They all had at least one parent who abused drugs or alcohol or who had a criminal history. “Among the traumatized shooters … all three had father-figures who engaged in criminal behavior involving the misuse of firearms,” notes Langman in his report. “In two of these cases, the fathers engaged in armed stand-offs with police.”

Psychotic Shooters come from intact families with no history of abuse, parental addiction, or incarceration. They exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia or a schizotypal personality disorder such as delusional paranoia, delusions of grandeur, and auditory hallucinations. “The psychotic shooters were misfits in their own families,” Langman states, “and the differences between them and their siblings were obvious to their parents and teachers.”

Psychopathic Shooters also tend to come from intact families with no significant dysfunction. These shooters exhibit narcissism, sadistic behavior, little to no empathy, and a lack of conscience. Langman notes that, “the psychopathic shooters successfully recruited followers to join them in their attacks … Thus, the presence of peer support may have contributed to their decision to commit a school shooting.”

Langman’s career has involved researching manifold cases, but this specific paper focuses on 10 school shooters who were all teenagers, with the exception of one, who was 23. The youngest was only 11. Together, these young shooters murdered 69 people and injured 92 between 1997 and 2007.

For any person, abused or not, to progress to a state in which they are capable of such profound cruelty, requires a process of moral and emotional deterioration which would be marked by increasingly aberrant behavior and attitudes. How did people miss the red flags that preceded these heinous crimes? How does a person grow violently abusive without someone noticing or intervening? How can a teenager manifest schizophrenic or sociopathic behaviors, yet no one sees?

Based on my experience with an abusive dad, I would suggest to you that many people saw.

In the case of the Parkland school shooter, there were 23 police reports warning the Broward County Sheriff’s Department that he was a dangerous threat. These reports include accounts of him hitting his adoptive mother, throwing her against a wall, fighting with his brother, exhibiting suicidal behavior, and threatening to shoot up the school on social media. There were several occasions where it seems he should have been hospitalized or arrested, but nothing was done. At one point, he called the police to tell them that he was deeply troubled. One woman even reported him to the FBI, stating that he was “going to explode,” and her worry about him “getting into a school and just shooting the place up.”

Stories are emerging of an angry and disturbed teen who held a gun to the head of his mother and brother; who assaulted several people, including the son of Roxanne Deschamps, the woman who took care of him and his brother following the death of their adoptive mother in November, 2017. In a chilling 911 call, Deschamps warned police that she believed he might shoot her and her family. Nevertheless, the police did not intervene. Notes were taken, reports were logged, but no apparent effort was made to provide for his mental health or the safety of those around him.

This is every abuse victim’s worst fear: That they’ll report abuse, but the police will do nothing, and they’ll be left alone with an abuser who knows that they reported them. Unfortunately, this seems to be exactly what happened in Florida. Broward County Sheriff’s Department has demonstrated to the nation that being disbelieved or abandoned by law enforcement is a reasonable fear. Abuse reports across the U.S. will now likely decrease as gun purchases for self-defense skyrocket.

While the shooter is an abuser, it’s safe to say he falls under Langman’s “traumatized” category, if not others. His biological parents died, he was adopted, and then his adoptive parents died. According to police reports, he has a history of being bullied, bullying others, and fighting. Whether he suffers a schizotypal illness or psychopathic dysfunction is something for his doctors to decide. While reports assert he was diagnosed with disorders such as ADHD and OCD, these are not the type of diagnosis that would or should ever raise red flags. On the other hand, his suicidal behavior and murderous threats should have warranted medical evaluation.

But this isn’t the first time that school shooters have been enabled by neglectful family, friends, educators, physicians, or law enforcement officers. The following is a list of school shooters, most of whom were not included in Langman’s paper.

A 23-year-old killed 32 people and wounded 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 using two semi-automatic pistols. An investigative panel later criticized educators and medical professionals who failed to notice his deteriorating mental health. It also noted gaps in Virginia’s mental health system and gun laws.

In 2005, a teenager murdered nine people, including his grandfather, before committing suicide at Red Lake Senior High School in Minnesota. The shooter was born into a broken home. His mother was an alcoholic who abused him. His father had a criminal history and committed suicide by shooting himself during a police standoff.

A six-year-old brought a gun to Buell Elementary School in 2000 and killed his classmate, Kayla Rolland. “I don’t like you,” he told her before he shot her dead. The boy’s father was in prison for dealing cocaine. He had been living with his abusive, drug addicted mother before moving into his uncle’s crack house. Just a few weeks before he murdered Rolland, the boy had gotten into trouble at school for bullying and hitting other students, including for stabbing one little girl with a pencil.

Another teenager killed two and injured 13 at Santana High School in California in 2001. He had allegedly been bullied and abused by classmates. On two occasions he told people about his plan to “pull a Columbine,” but no one ever reported his threats to police.

In 2003, a teenager murdered 15-year-old Seth Bartell and 17-year-old Aaron Rollins. During his trial, three mental health experts diagnosed him with schizophrenia, while others diagnosed major depression and emerging personality disorder. The families of the victims later sued the school district, the principal, and the shooter’s family, alleging that they knew what he was planning during the days preceding his crimes. The lawsuit was settled out of court for $200,000.

Yet another teenager murdered three of his fellow students and seriously injured two others in 2012 at Chardon High School in Ohio. He had a criminal history including domestic violence and disorderly conduct, and posted death threats on social media accounts prior to the shooting.

Also in 2012, a 20-year-old murdered 20 children between six and seven years of age at Sandy Hook elementary school. The shooter had been diagnosed with multiple mental health issues. A report from the Office of the Child Advocate noted his “severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems … combined with an atypical preoccupation with violence… [and] access to deadly weapons … proved a recipe for mass murder.”

“It is fair to surmise that, had Lanza’s mental illness been adequately treated in the last years of his life, one predisposing factor to the tragedy of Sandy Hook might have been mitigated,” the report concluded.

Each and every one of these perpetrators manifested traumatized, psychotic, or psychopathic behavior in the weeks, months, and years leading up to their crimes. And each one was surrounded by people who failed to report or intervene when they witnessed disturbing red flags. Whether the people surrounding them were parents who were negligent, absent, or abusive; teachers, counselors, and school officials who ignored warning signs; law enforcement who failed to press charges or follow up on reports; or bystanders who failed to notice or report troubling behavior and threats, the people who surrounded these shooters enabled tragedy by either neglecting to speak or failing to act.

The Parkland shooter’s friends and acquaintances had the courage to report him to the authorities. They recognized the danger and they did exactly what they should have done. The fact that law enforcement failed them so miserably is something that will haunt every abuse victim who is thinking about picking up the phone. The damage that the FBI and Broward County Sheriff’s Office have done to the psyche of crime witnesses and victims across the nation through this catastrophic lapse is incalculable.

The words of Sheriff Israel and his repeated denial of blame for the inaction of his department, typifies an unfortunate culture of irresponsibility. “Deputies make mistakes. Police officers make mistakes. We all make mistakes,” Israel told Jake Tapper on CNN. “But it’s not the responsibility of the general or the president, if you have a deserter … Jake, I can only take responsibility for what I knew about. I exercised my due diligence. I have given amazing leadership to this agency.”

How many times have we seen stories of teens eating Tide Pods, but instead of asking where their parents are, people blamed Tide for looking too much like candy? How many times have we seen people blaming television, video games, or social media for the bad behavior of children, rather than examining that child’s parental figures or educational environment?

Most people don’t want to intervene into the mess of another person’s life. Most of us are happy gossiping and gawking at celebrities, but don’t even know our next-door-neighbor’s name. Most of us, when we see evidence of familial or mental dysfunction, think, “Oh well. Somebody else will do something about it. It’s not my responsibility or place, and I’m sure everything will turn out fine.”

But too often, we see that everything does not turn out fine. If we want to stop the next school shooter, there are a few practical things we must do.

1. Foster a culture that of emotional investment in relationships

We must foster a culture where people are aware and involved in each other’s lives. We must branch beyond Facebook and Twitter and talk to friends face to face. When we’re involved with each other on a personal level, we’re more likely to notice when things aren’t going well. We’ll see the black eye, the distracted stare, and hear the private worries of a stressed mind. People facing struggles will be more likely and better able to seek help, and children being neglected will be less likely to fall through the cracks. This is one area where small family-oriented churches play a vital role in keeping our culture emotionally healthy and physically safe.

2. Reestablish and reinforce a healthy family ideal

A large percentage of the violence in America would vanish within a decade if we focused on eliminating child abuse, child neglect, and domestic violence. Broken homes lead to broken communities, broken culture, and a broken nation. If we heal the family, we can fix the future. A large percentage of school shooters and violent criminals in general, report having had dysfunctional childhoods.

3. Diligently prosecute criminals

We must enforce existing laws that combat crimes, such as child abuse laws and the unlawful possession of guns. With few exceptions, it is illegal for a person convicted of a felony (such as domestic violence or drug possession) to purchase a gun. If criminals are prosecuted for their crimes, and entered into the national database, it will become much more difficult for them to acquire guns. The recent school shooting in Parkland could possibly have been averted had the shooter been prosecuted for domestic violence or assault. Had he been convicted, he would never have been able to purchase a gun.

4. Take care of the weak and the sick

We must make sure that people suffering from mental illness and emotional challenges receive the care they need. When a teenager calls the police to tell them he’s disturbed, that teenager should never be ignored. We must maintain a system that efficiently and comprehensively addresses the needs of people exhibiting depressive, delusional, psychotic, or psychopathic behavior. This is vital for their own happiness and health, as well as for the safety of our communities.

There is no question that every criminal owns complete responsibility for his or her actions. However, we as a society must also take responsibility for protecting each other, supporting one another, and providing for the very weakest and underserved among us. Our boys and girls deserve safe schools. Our kids deserve whole families. Our young adults deserve mental health care. Our teenagers deserve our love. We must promote a culture that fosters strong families, reinforces healthy marriages, nurtures tightly knit communities, encourages involvement in church and other familial organizations, treats individuals as dignified and valuable, and supports stay-at-home parenting and involved moms and dads.

We need to get back to the basics and love our neighbor. That is how we stop the next school shooter.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/01/4-things-learned-abusive-father-can-stop-next-shooting/,2018-03-01
Former Prosecutor: Getting Permission To Spy On Page Was Likely Tough,"I had a wide range of investigative and prosecutorial duties as a special attorney with the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department of Justice in the 1970s. From trying cases in court and conducting grand jury investigations, to visiting crime scenes, developing confidential informants, and taking to the streets to locate and interrogate witnesses, I was privileged to work closely with the FBI, DEA, ATF, IRS and state and local police agencies. I also prepared numerous applications for court-ordered electronic surveillance and monitored the wiretap and bugging operations that followed.

If we wanted authorization to plant a listening device or wiretap someone, we had to submit a sworn affidavit to a federal district judge demonstrating we had probable cause to believe a crime was being committed and that evidence of that crime would be obtained by intercepting communications over the phone lines to be monitored or at the location to be bugged. We also had to explain that normal, less invasive investigative procedures had been tried and failed, or would be unlikely to succeed, or would be to dangerous.

“Probable cause” here did not mean proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but that the facts in the affidavit would lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime was being committed and that the proposed intercept would produce evidence of that crime.

The supporting affidavit would invariably be based on information from a so-called “reliable informant.” Reliability could be established two ways. The affidavit could show the informant had previously provided truthful information, by including a statement indicating the number of times the source had proved reliable and a brief description of the information they provided.

The affidavit could also set forth corroboration of the information from the source, whether from physical surveillance or some other means. For example, the results of surveillance showing a person going in and out of a relevant location. This kind of corroboration would be included to support a probable cause finding, even if the informant had proved previously reliable.

Drafting the application and probable cause affidavit was rigorous and difficult. To the extent humanly possible, we made sure that both were completely truthful and amply established all of the legal elements necessary to show probable cause. There were no shortcuts taken and no fudged facts.

Those supporting facts had to be “fresh” too. They could be no more than 14 days old. This requirement caused no end of aggravation. The application and affidavit had to undergo time-consuming parallel vetting processes at Main Justice and FBI headquarters. As a result, those of us in the field were constantly working against the clock and were forced to laboriously update the probable cause application, while the bureaucrats in Washington took their sweet time reviewing our handiwork. It was not unusual for the paper pushers to reject an application which had gone “stale” while it sat in their inboxes awaiting their attention.

In any event, once the package was approved, we would receive a letter from the Attorney General authorizing us to apply to the court for an interception order. This letter would be attached to the application.

The attesting agent and I would then meet in chambers with a federal judge to present the application and obtain the interception warrant. This, of course, was done in secret, and the length of these meetings depended on the complexity of the case and the judge’s interest and diligence.The average application with affidavit and exhibits ran about an inch thick. The size varied with the scope of the case.

Some judges would read the package carefully and ask probing questions before signing the intercept order. But most would do a quick review and then issue the warrant. And by quick, I do mean quick.

There was one judge who simply refused to read the application. This legal giant had been appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt in the mid 1930s. He was very old, hard of hearing, cantankerous and impatient. All he wanted to see was the letter from the Attorney General. As far as he was concerned, if the Attorney General thought this wiretap or bug was a good idea, that was good enough for him. So, scribble-scribble, here’s your order, now get out!

To his credit, he was a stand up guy. When defense lawyers would later argue for the suppression of the intercepted communications, he would thunder from the bench, “That’s stupid! I signed the order! You want me to reverse myself?”

So much for the Founding Father’s quaint notions about an independent judiciary and illegal search and seizure.

The intercept orders were limited to the shortest time needed to achieve the investigative purpose, up to a limit of thirty days. If we wanted an extension of the order, we had to demonstrate to the court that the intercept had been “productive,” that we were getting results. For example, if we were wiretapping bookmakers, we had to show the court that we had intercepted evidence of bookmaking. We also had to demonstrate a need for continuing the wiretap, such as to follow an evolving criminal scheme.

Now everything that I just told you pertains to court ordered electronic surveillance procedures in domestic criminal cases. I have never appeared before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), but I have studied its procedures and have compared them to my experiences with electronic surveillance as a federal and state prosecutor and as a defense lawyer.

So hear me out.

The standard for obtaining a warrant pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is somewhat lower than that required for a domestic wiretap. This is because the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to domestic surveillance. But FISA deals with counterintelligence operations against foreign powers which don’t have constitutional rights.

Nevertheless, to obtain a FISA warrant to conduct electronic surveillance on a United States’ citizen, the FBI must show probable cause that the target is an “agent of a foreign power” who is knowingly engaging “in clandestine intelligence activities.” In addition, these clandestine activities must likely constitute one or more felonies under federal law, such as engaging in sabotage, terrorism or using a false or stolen identity.

The FISA probable cause standard is similar in many respects to that in domestic criminal cases. It is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather it is comprised of evidence that would cause a reasonable person to conclude that the subject could be a spy for a foreign government or organization. From this standpoint, the FISA probable cause standard is slightly lower lower than that required in a domestic criminal case.

In the FISA context, issues related to probable cause may include whether the proposed surveillance target had access to classified information, was a likely candidate to be recruited by foreign agents, or had been mentioned in intercepts of other foreign actors or similar considerations. It has to tend to support a claim that the subject is knowingly and intentionally acting on behalf of a foreign government or organization.

FISA warrants go through purportedly stringent parallel vetting processes by FBI headquarters and the DOJ’s National Security Division. The effort is said to ensure the application is truthful and to eliminate unsupported or unsubstantiated assertions.

Once the FBI and DOJ have approved, the application is presented to the FISC for its consideration and action. How careful and diligent are the FISC judges in reviewing the applications before they issue the intercept orders? I have no idea. Presumably they take their obligations seriously. But I wouldn’t be surprised if the level of care varied depending on the individual judge reviewing the application. Hopefully none of them behave like the antiquarian Roosevelt appointee who signed off on some of my wiretaps.

Now let’s apply all this to the FISA warrant and three renewals used to spy on Carter Page, the former affiliate of the Trump presidential campaign. Unfortunately, since we do not have access to the actual FISA documents, our analysis must be based on the dueling memos by the majority and minority of the House Intelligence Committee.

The Republican memo states that the probable cause affidavit for the Page warrant relies almost exclusively on the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy and FBI informant Christopher Steele. This memo also states that neither the initial FISA application nor any of the renewals “disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.”

Instead, according to the Republican memo, the initial application merely recites that there was an unspecified political provenance to the dossier but “does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of — and paid by — the DNC and Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the same information.”

The memo also states that, although Steele had admitted to DOJ official Bruce Ohr he was “desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president,” this “clear evidence of Steele’s bias” was “not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications.”

Continuing in this vein, the memo states, “While the FISA application relied on Steele’s past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations.”

The implication here is that these omissions misled the FISC into issuing the warrant to spy on Page when, if all of the facts had been included, the court would have rejected the application. While this may be true, and there may have been a calculated effort to deceive the court, I am struck by how the Page application — at least as characterized by the Republican memo — seems to follow the same probable cause format that we used in our domestic criminal affidavits.

In my cases, I frequently based probable cause on the word of felons, many of whom had questionable motives for providing the information which was put in the affidavits. It was almost impossible to find an informant who wasn’t a criminal. In some cases, they were absolute scum. But they had previously provided accurate information so they were reliable enough for our purposes.

The point here is that Steele may have been anti-Trump and he may have been paid by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. But was there a clearly defined legal obligation to disclose those matters to the FISC? In our domestic criminal probable cause affidavits, we never dwelled on our informants’ seedy backgrounds and less than honorable motives. Why? Because all of our informants were morally challenged, and we weren’t required to discuss their repellent characters or nefarious ulterior motives.

Things may be different under FISA, but I doubt it. Moreover, if the FISA application spelled out how Steele had previously provided true information, that would, under ordinary circumstances, be enough to qualify him as a reliable informant.

While I think that the failure to advise the court of Steele’s bias and ties to the Clinton campaign is a glaring material omission, it is difficult on the record presently available to tell whether that was or should have been a fatal defect. For example, in addition to Steele’s reliability, does the application set forth any corroboration of his information? Former FBI Director James Comey has publicly described the Steele dossier as “salacious” and “unverified.” But does that mean the application is devoid of corroboration of any kind? If Steele’s information is corroborated, how and to what extent? We need to see the actual document to make those critical determinations.

Some Republican members of Congress and some in the media have claimed that the FISC is “unique” in that only the government appears before it to obtain warrants. They have suggested that such proceedings are unfair in that the “other side” is unrepresented. But how else can the FISC do its job? Electronic surveillance by its very nature must be conducted covertly in order for it to work.

I was once called as a prosecution witness to lay the foundation for evidence obtained by a body wire worn by one of my informants. The defense lawyer exuded white-hot anger as he cross examined me. After pacing back and forth in an agitated manner, he wheeled suddenly and, pointing an accusing finger, shouted, “When you wired up Mr. Linguini (not the informant’s real name, but you get the drift), you didn’t see fit to tell my client that he was being bugged, did you?”

“No, counselor,” I replied, “that wouldn’t have been an effective investigating technique.” (Note: to avoid a mistrial, I left out the part about how it also would have gotten Linguini killed.)

I’m not saying that the pols and talking heads are as dumb as that defense lawyer, but come on. Fair is fair. The FISC has to operate in secret to avoid tipping off the targets of the intercepts. Complaining that the FISC is a secret, one-sided court is silly and counterproductive.

Finally, given that there were three renewals of the Page warrant, I can only assume that the intercepts were productive and that they produced evidence of clandestine intelligence activity. Otherwise, why would the court grant the renewals unless evidence of those intercepted activities was included in the renewal applications? But again we don’t have an answer to that question because we don’t have the actual FISA documents.

Congress has asked the DOJ, FBI and the FISC to release the warrants and all related documents. The New York Times has filed a motion with the FISC seeking publication of “all orders authorizing surveillance of Carter Page, a United States citizen, together with the application materials and renewal application materials upon which those orders were issued.”

The motion cites “the overwhelming public interest in assessing the accuracy of the Nunes Memorandum and knowing the actual basis for the Page surveillance orders.” I agree with The New York Times.

The issue of whether the FBI and the DOJ took sides in a presidential election by illegally wiretapping the Trump campaign is too important to be resolved by dueling congressional memos and political talk show conjecture. The public needs to see the unredacted warrants and the related documents. All the facts need to come out. And they need to come out now.

"Dear Parkland Kids: We Gave You An Awesome World, Don't Mess It Up","All the reasons for refusing to allow ourselves to be led by children were summed up in the latest coronation of the Parkland kids, this time by ancient leftist Bill Maher. He invited David Hogg and Cameron Kasky on his show so Hogg could boast about hanging up on the President of the United States, and so Kasky could give us this sanctimonious little lecture: “I mean this sincerely, I really do, to all the generations before us, we sincerely accept your apology. We appreciate that you are willing to let us rebuild the world that you f—ed up.”

This sums up everything that’s wrong with these kids’ astroturfed ride to fame. They get flown around the country, they get invited on TV, they get puffball interviewers like Bill Maher, all because they are willing to repeat in a cloyingly self-righteous manner the message favored by their adult handlers. But not because they actually know what they’re talking about.

Let’s look at their arrogant presumption that previous generations messed up the world, so that today’s kids, in their superior wisdom, have to “rebuild” it.

Start with the issues most directly at hand here. School shootings are actually down over the last 20 years. Northeastern University Professor James Alan Fox analyzed the data and concluded that mass school shootings are “extremely rare events” and that “there is not an epidemic of school shootings.” Here’s what the data look like.

Moreover, Fox adds that “over the past 35 years, there have been only five cases in which someone ages 18 to 20 used an assault rifle in a mass shooting,” meaning that the most common proposed new gun control measure would have little effect.

Speaking of guns, you might think that without gun control, we’re living in a lawless post-apocalyptic hellscape. In fact, crime is down. Murders are down. Violent crimes committed with guns are way down.

This is the period in which restrictions on gun ownership have been substantially rolled back — the assault weapons ban of the 1990s was allowed to expire, and Supreme Court rulings invalidated gun bans in cities like Washington and Chicago. Americans now own about 300 million guns. So clearly, gun ownership is not causing an increase in crime rates. In fact, statisticians who looked closely at gun deaths concluded that none of the frequently suggested gun control measures would do much to reduce these numbers.

But cite these statistics and you will be told that you cannot contradict the Parkland kids because being present at the scene of a mass shooting makes them unquestionable experts on the topic. No, really. Kasky tells us, “We’ve seen our friends text their parents goodbye. We are the experts.” I can hear Tom Nichols grinding his teeth from here. Obviously, being an expert on guns, crime, and mass shootings requires actual knowledge and research, including the ability to read and understand crime statistics.

This presumption that we adults have ruined the world has wider roots. Today’s young people are bombarded with a lot of doom and gloom that tells them everything is getting worse, pushed onto them by people who have an interest in recruiting them as activists.

They may be surprised to learn, for example, that in addition to crime being down, war has decreased across the globe. The number of wars and the number of deaths in wars decreased dramatically after World War II, of course, but it decreased dramatically again when the Soviet Union collapsed, almost as if Communism was an engine of global conflict.

Along with war, extreme poverty across the world is down significantly over recent decades and especially since the Industrial Revolution.

America has done especially well. Median family income in America is nearly triple what it was in 1950. The rich have gotten richer, and the poor have also gotten richer.

Surely, all of this economic growth is ruining the environment. Yet according to the EPA, U.S. GDP has grown by 253 percent since 1970, while emissions of “six common pollutants” — things like lead, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide — are down 73 percent. Our air and water are about as clean as they have ever been.

And so on. The world we older generations have given today’s kids is actually pretty awesome. We can’t protect them from every danger and every risk, and we can’t stop every tragedy like the Parkland shooting. But by historical standards, our kids will be safer, healthier, and wealthier, and they can expect to live longer and more untroubled lives than we did, or than our parents did, or than our grandparents did.

I can see, though, why they wouldn’t realize any of this, because there are some who have a political interest in making things look worse. If you want young people to think capitalism is the cause of war — a view they hear often — you don’t want them to find out that the triumph of the capitalist countries in the Cold War led to a decrease in war. If you want them to rail against “global capitalism” — I can’t decide if this is a cause of the left or of the right these days — you can’t have them realizing that capitalism and trade are wiping out global poverty. If you want them to think free markets are inferior to socialism, you don’t want them to understand the massive increases in prosperity in free market societies, or to question the latest environmentalist panic. And if you want them to become televised activists for gun control, you have to create the impression that there is an epidemic of gun crimes and mass shootings.

The Parkland kids have swallowed all of this, and hence their ignorant ranting to us about how the older generations have messed everything up.

To be sure, the kids we’re seeing on TV are not representative of their peers. We don’t hear much about the Parkland students who don’t fit the left’s narrative. Instead, we’re mostly getting a couple of the high-school debate club types. Once I found out that detail, it all fell into place, because we all remember the guys from high-school debate club. They weren’t the smartest kids, just the most preening and self-important.

The important point is that too many of today’s young people are not being taught to see and appreciate what has made the world as good a place as it really is for them. They have no idea who designed the large and complex systems that produce the peace and prosperity they enjoy, no idea how those systems work, and no idea how much they can foul them up by knocking out pins and levers and constitutional amendments just because they’re angry.

The fastest way to mess up the world the older generations gave them is to think that they are all experts at age 17 because they read some lefty rhetoric and got “woke.” You know who also thought that? The Baby Boomers. People my age — technically, I’m Gen X, but early enough in it that we never thought of ourselves that way — grew up with this. We grew up with smug Boomers like Phil Collins assuring us that, “My generation will put it right. We’re not just making promises that we know we’ll never keep.” Spoiler alert: they didn’t keep those promises, and everything turned out just fine. But now the same people who were wrong about war, wrong about poverty, wrong about capitalism, and wrong about guns want to get the grandkids to give one more shot at fixing what isn’t broken.

Then again, they also thought lame hand-puppet parodies of Ronald Reagan were really clever, so the lesson from this is to show a little humility, kids. You’re still learning, and you would be well served not to be content to repeat what you learn at school, but to go do your own reading and research and listen to people who disagree with you. It’s not as traumatic an experience as you have been led to believe. When you can show that you understand what’s good about the world we are giving you, and you have some idea of how it got to be that way — then we’ll listen to your ideas for changing it.

Then again, the previous generations are not blameless. We did create cable news, and for some reason none of us can really remember, we made Bill Maher famous. Sorry about that.

"Okay Adam Schiff, Show Us The Russia Collusion","This week the Republican majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) announced the conclusion of its investigation into Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, concluding in a summary of the draft report, “We have found no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

As they say, HPSCI hath no fury like a Schiff scorned.

Naturally, the Democratic congressman and prominent Russiagate peddler Rep. Adam Schiff was incredulous.

Fascinatingly, in his press release castigating the Republican-led committee for closing its probe into among other things collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign that Schiff has adamantly alleged for over a year, the very word “collusion” was absent. Let us put a finer point on it: Those who subscribe to the Russiagate conspiracy theory have settled on “collusion” with Russia as the central charge against the Trump administration. Schiff has screamed it from the rooftops. Is it not curious this this allegation is missing from Schiff’s latest missive, replaced by “Russian interference” and the “the role of U.S. persons connected to the Trump campaign in that intervention?”

Let us also recognize that under a presidency that has generated hyperbolic partisan action ranging from a slew of attacks on President Trump’s mental fitness pointing towards 25th Amendment removal, to the drawing of impeachment papers, “collusion” would appear to be a relatively restrained charge. This might indicate an implicit lack of confidence in there being any “there” there among the president’s detractors and believers in nefarious Russia dealings.

‘Collusion’ Is Not In Itself A Crime

The trouble with the notion of “collusion” — or perhaps its attractiveness depending on your perspective — is that it is an amorphous catchall. It does not constitute a crime. The closest related crime would be a conspiracy to commit an offense against or defraud the United States. Therefore, in context of a special counsel investigation for example, which requires that a crime be cited, it should be meaningless.

As former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy wrote back in August 2017:

The lack of an apparent crime — which would cause a normal prosecutor to close his investigative file — has become a blank check for [special counsel Robert] Mueller. Trump’s Justice Department having failed to place limits on his warrant, the special counsel is free to conduct a fishing expedition. Mueller has used his bottomless budget to hire a legion of lawyers with a history of Democratic-party activism and hardball prosecutorial aggression. The vaporous concept of collusion implies no boundaries on Mueller’s jurisdiction.

There is reason to believe the Mueller team thinks otherwise, something perhaps to be adjudicated as the seemingly limitless investigation proceeds. Regardless, as Schiff has noted, it is not HPSCI’s job to prosecute a crime, but rather to provide oversight and inform the American people. In the hands of politicians, undefined “collusion” becomes a potent political weapon in which every meeting, statement and action can be cast as sinister.

However you define it, Schiff has indicated repeatedly that he is sure collusion occurred. Consider the history:

In March 2017, Schiff said, “There is circumstantial evidence of collusion,” between Russia and the Trump campaign. Later that month he asserted a link with even more confidence, telling Chuck Todd there was “more than circumstantial evidence,” though he could “not go into the particulars,” something Schiff has had a tendency to suggest over the last year.

In December 2017, The Wall Street Journal’s James Freeman summarized an exchange between CNN’s Jake Tapper and Schiff in which the host questioned the congressman on his evidence of collusion, noting conversations with him often follow this pattern: “Mr. Schiff has spent months commenting on the state of the evidence about Russia and the Trump campaign, and he’s claimed over and over that it points to collusion. What he has refused to do is disclose the evidence for his claims.”

In February 2018, Schiff told reporters, “There is already, in my view, ample evidence in the public domain on the issue of collusion if you’re willing to see it.”

Earlier this month, under questioning on The View, Schiff sang somewhat of a different tune. He noted that what is in the public domain is “pretty damning,” alluding briefly to the infamous George Papadopoulos and Trump Tower meetings.

All The Evidence Schiff Says Is ‘Pretty Damning’

Perhaps Schiff’s most comprehensive attempt at explaining Trump-Russia collusion came in a December 2017 editorial he published in The Wall Street Journal, where he cites five data points as evidence of collusion.

1. The April 2016 Papadopoulos meetings

The neophyte foreign policy adviser was allegedly informed that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of hacked emails. Papadopoulos would later plead guilty to making materially false statements and material omissions to the FBI regarding his conversations with Russian government-linked individuals. Note: he pled guilty to process crimes – a consistent theme in the Mueller investigation – not to any illegal activities associated with the meetings he took.

2. The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting

As Rep. Schiff argues, the Trump campaign participants came away from the meeting disappointed that they never obtained opposition research. Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya instead used the meeting to allegedly lobby against the Magnitsky Act and attack the man who inspired it, Bill Browder.

3. The summer release of hacked DNC emails disseminated through WikiLeaks, DC Leaks and Guccifer 2.0

While Schiff asserts these hacked emails came from the Russians, we still do not have independent confirmation from the U.S. government, as only a third-party investigator inspected the relevant hardware. Moreover, Schiff does not draw any direct link to the Trump campaign here, except to note that the then-candidate supported their release.

4. The Russian social media campaign

The campaign was to, in Schiff’s words, “help the Trump campaign, vilify Mrs. Clinton and sow general discord.” Note that the evidence of the Mueller indictment of 13 Russians in connection with these activities does not show singular support for Trump and attacks on Clinton, but rather that the Russians at varying times supported up to four candidates including both Trump and Clinton, all with the intent of “sow[ing] general discord.”

5. Then-National Security Advisor designate Gen. Mike Flynn allegedly “conspired” with Russia

Flynn allegedly “conspired secretly with the Russian ambassador to undermine the effect of the sanctions.” We now know however that according to none other than FBI Director James Comey, contrary to Schiff’s assertion and Flynn’s guilty plea, the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn regarding his call with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak indicated that they thought Flynn was being honest and not intentionally misleading them. Moreover, the interview itself was convened on highly dubious terms, and Flynn — in a conversation with a foreign counterpart that would appear reasonable — merely asked Kislyak that Russia, in the words of the statement of offense, “refrain from escalating the situation in response to U.S. sanctions against Russia.”

Schiff summarized the evidence like this: “Each of these contacts between the Russians, the Trump campaign, and the transition is now uncontested, yet time and again, the president’s team, and in some cases the president himself, had lied about them. To claim that these facts show no evidence of collusion requires a willingness to avoid seeing what is in plain sight, or to credit the self-serving explanations of the same Trump officials who misled the country about these same meetings.”

But is this really a compelling case?

Taking meetings with Russian officials with the belief they might yield information helpful to your campaign may reflect poor judgment, but do those meetings equal collusion or worse something illegal? Committing process crimes in conversations with law enforcement officials may look suspicious, but does it reflect an intent to conceal a plot to collude with Vladimir Putin? If indeed the Russians hacked and released the DNC emails, Schiff provides no evidence that the Trump campaign “colluded” with them in this act.

While Russia’s use of social media to support a variety of candidates and issues during the 2016 election provides a convenient scapegoat in Silicon Valley for Hillary Clinton’s loss, a rationale for regulating online political speech and an avenue to engage in legal extortion by threatening the tech titans with further regulation in exchange for protection in the form of campaign donations, the remarkably cheap operation did not collusion make. As the relevant Mueller indictment notes, “Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities. [emphasis mine]”

Lastly, is the national security advisor-designate’s discussion with a foreign counterpart regarding sanctions imposed on that counterpart’s nation just before the president-elect assumes office some kind of treasonous act?

Do these questions reveal willful blindness, or Schiff’s superhuman ability to see links that we cannot? What exactly is it that binds Schiff’s presumably strongest points together? To what end were these acts colluding towards? Do you find this “ample evidence” convincing? Or as Republican Rep. Mike Conaway who led the HPSCI probe intimates, is this all just a case of “bad judgment, inappropriate meetings, inappropriate judgment in taking meetings?”

The Context On Trump And Russia Schiff Ignores

If we stipulated that Schiff was pointing at disconcerting smoke regarding Russia, how, one wonders would Schiff weigh it against the ample evidence of the Trump team making moves detrimental to Russia? The Trump administration has among other things: Armed the Ukrainians; dramatically increased military sales to Europe; sold the Patriot missile defense shield to Poland; crushed Russian mercenary forces in Syria; is developing weapons pursuant to the new nuclear posture review that violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty to counter Russia’s treaty-breaking efforts; is developing a missile defense strategy specifically oriented towards Russia; and is countering the Russia-backed Iran Deal. Does Schiff believe these are false flag acts meant to throw the nation off of the scent of Russia collusion?

The California congressman never points to a smoking gun or series of smoking guns tying the available data points together to craft a clear, compelling, cogent case for collusion. Given Schiff is politically adept and articulate, that he has not made the 30-second case tells us something about the strength of his position. Meanwhile, to my knowledge, he has never been asked to grapple with the contrary evidence of the administration’s actual policies.

And remember, the foregoing takes Schiff’s assertions at face value. We could examine the alleged deluge of leaks from his side of the HIPSCI aisle. We could point out Schiff’s persistent stonewalling relating to the Steele dossier. We could dissect the disingenuous campaign around the Nunes counter-memo, in which Schiff first falsely claimed Republican procedural unfairness around consideration of the memo when it was subjected to the same process as the Nunes memo; he then cried suppression when the counter memo’s reviewers took the time to redact the sensitive and/or classified information that Schiff and his fellow HIPSCI Democrats had cynically intentionally included, threatening national security for political purposes after claiming Republicans would do the same with their memo. Lastly, we could limn the litany of instances of hypocrisy, deception and sins of omission and commission, as The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway has chronicled. To recognize these points would only further call into question Rep. Schiff’s credibility on Russia and Trump.

Leave all that aside.

Let us ask the seminal question once again: Where is the collusion Schiff?

‘Wind River’ Grippingly Portrays Crime-Ridden Indian Reservations,"“Wind River” is easily the best movie to have premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film festival, and is now available on Netflix. It’s a nuanced, well-told story of life in Wyoming on and off the Wind River Reservation.

The film does justice to a state many people only know from visits to Yellowstone, or a ski trip to Jackson Hole, or perhaps a summer trip to the rodeo in Cheyenne. The setting is an integral part of this story.

Wyoming is the ninth largest state by land area, but it has the smallest population in the nation by far, even including Puerto Rico and Washington DC, with only 585,501 people in the whole state. Many U.S. cities have populations in excess of our state’s whole population. This fosters an isolation that can be hard for people in the rest of the nation to grasp. This isolation sets the stage for the crimes at the center of the film and the hardships for the law enforcement investigating wrongdoing in it.

The Setting Helps Drive the Plot

Elizabeth Olsen plays Jane Banner, a rookie FBI agent from Tallahassee, Florida. She is sent to help tribal police with a murder and a rape because she’s the nearest officer, and her discomfort at the whole situation is one of the best written parts of this film. When Banner initially meets the tribal police chief and other star of the movie, Jeremy Renner playing Cory Lambert, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service agent who found the murdered woman, she points out that there are only six officers trying to patrol and police an area the size of Rhode Island and Delaware, together.

It’s impossible and improbable for six people to do this job well, not because they don’t care or want crimes to go unsolved but because the resources are inadequate. A rape kit needs to be sent some 360 miles away for processing in Loveland, Colorado, because that’s the nearest place with capacity. Lambert’s assistance with the case uncovers his connections with the reservation, his painful past, and deep connection to the crime, and why he’s so personally invested in helping the FBI agent solve it. “Wind River” isn’t just a typical crime drama, it’s also the story of how isolation changes people, both for the better and the worse.

It’s in this setting that the character- and crime-driven “Wind River” grips you. I don’t watch a lot of crime movies, but I watched this one on the recommendation of a local friend. She described it as intense and warned me I would cry, and she was right.

I’m a Wyoming transplant, here for some seven years, but I’ve been to the places in this film. The scenery and resiliency of the people is so familiar. For example, Lambert pushes aside Banner’s ideas about luck, because surviving in Wyoming’s winters takes more than that. People die in the snow, like in the movie, even in the capital.

A Fake Crime that Emulates True Crime

One of the most sobering parts of the movie comes after it ends. The closing title cards note that while missing person statistics are tracked for all U.S. demographics, they’re not kept for Native American women. No one knows how many are missing. There are some 14,000 residents on Wind River, and life expectancy on is short, at only 49 years.

Between the high suicide rate, an unemployment rate over 80 percent, and a drug problem that has gotten worse despite help from federal agencies, Wind River struggles with the kinds of problems many people tend to associate with developing nations. The New York Times compared the reservation’s joblessness to that of Zimbabwe, and noted the people there can expect to live 20 years fewer than an Iraqi. Wind River is one of the country’s most dangerous reservations.

Many of the jobs in the region are either very low-paying and service-based, in gas stations or tiny convenience stores, or they require a clean drug screen that people in the grips of addiction can’t pass, like the oilfield jobs. The oilfields in the movie present another real-life problem that might be surreal for people outside Wyoming and other areas with reservations.

Law enforcement’s complicated and conflicting jurisdictions due to antiquated precedent that allows Indian tribes to run as mini-nations despite Native Americans’ U.S. citizenship is another important plot focus in the film, organically woven in multiple scenes. FBI agents can only investigate certain crimes, including homicide, but not assault or rape. An oilfield leased on federal land, however, is a touchy no-man’s-land where the county and tribal police have no authority and require an FBI agent to interact with workers.

This Confusion Stymies Justice for Victims

“Wind River” invites viewers to investigate how these things are happening so quietly in our country. The Department of Justice keeps some pertinent statistics: 84.3 percent of Native American and Alaskan Native women have experienced violence in their lifetimes; 56 percent have experienced sexual violence. Of Native American and Alaskan men, 81.6 percent have experienced violence in their lifetimes; 27.5 percent have experienced sexual violence. These are striking numbers, and the individual stories of heartache and loss that make up each of these numbers inspired the film’s storyline.

Some affected families have told their stories, including how difficult or impossible it is to really get answers for violent deaths on the reservation. CNN has a lengthy story about the families of three girls who died in 2008 under circumstances that have never been cleared up. The girls were 13, 14, and 15 years old, and died from methadone overdoses in what were ruled homicides.

The men responsible were reportedly only sentenced to two years in Wyoming prisons, and the victims’ families were never able to find out what happened or why on the night their daughters died. The details of their sentencing and pleas are also sealed, keeping these families from closure in their grief.

“Wind River” also ends with no solutions, and no tightly wrapped ends. This is not a movie to watch for a happily ever after, where the good guys sweep in and fix all the problems, because that would do a disservice to all of the people living and dying in Wind River. Instead, it presents an uncomfortable mash-up of gorgeous scenery depicting mountains covered in snow against deteriorating homes, wrecked families, and the tragic loss of young lives.

"10 Common Arguments For Gun Control, Debunked","School shootings have dominated the news cycle and the common theme anti-gunners express is how gun control can somehow solve the problem.

The most common gun-control arguments of today go something like this: “These shootings would stop if we banned AR-15s or other semi-auto rifles; raised the minimum age for firearm ownership; and/or created tougher gun laws.”

These are emotion-based arguments and will do nothing to solve the problem. In fact, they can even make the problem worse while infringing on the liberties of Americans. Let’s explore, and debunk, 10 of the most common gun-control arguments.

1. The Second Amendment Only Gives the Right to Own Guns for Use in a Militia

Our Second Amendment reads: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Our Constitution does not give us any rights. Rather, it affirms rights that we already have in order to safeguard them. Note that the “right of the people to keep and bear arms” isn’t given by the language above. Instead, our right to keep and bear arms, which exists outside of the Constitution, is protected from infringement.

The militia is mentioned as the goal for the protection of our right to keep and bear arms — it is not a requirement. A helpful analog from an unknown author goes like this: “A well-educated electorate, being necessary to the preservation of a free society, the right of the people to read and compose books, shall not be infringed.”

In this example, it should be easy to see that the right to read and compose books is not reserved only to those that are registered voters or well-educated. Instead, the goal is a well-educated electorate, for which tools of education are needed. Likewise, our right to keep and bear arms is protected in the event a well-regulated militia is needed to defend our country.

2. The Second Amendment Only Applied to Muskets

Anti-gunners often claim that “modern/rapid-fire” arms are not protected. This argument assumes that muskets were the only type of arms in existence when the Second Amendment was written, and therefore our founding fathers never intended our protections to extend to modern firearms.

First, repeating rifles were in existence for more than 100 years before our Bill of Rights were included in our Constitution. Second, muskets were military-grade firearms. Our founding fathers wanted to protect our ability to overthrow a tyrannical government, which would include the capability to match whatever arms an opposing military possessed.

Third, if this argument were valid, then smartphones and social-media would not be protected as forms of speech under the First Amendment, because these “modern/rapid-fire” forms of communication were not around back then.

3. Criminals Won’t Have Guns if We Ban Them

Simply, law-abiding citizens will obey the law and criminals won’t. That’s how life works. After all, that’s the definition of a criminal: someone who doesn’t obey a law. Keeping guns out of criminal’s hands because they’ve been banned will be just as successful as our ban on crystal meth.

If the crime of, and penalty for, murder doesn’t stop criminals from conducting mass shootings, neither will another law. As an example, bombs are already illegal. However, neither the penalty for murder nor the penalty against making bombs has stopped the Oklahoma city bombing, the Boston marathon bombing, or the serial bomber in Austin.

Not only will a gun ban not work, it will ensure that the only people with guns are criminals.

4. AR-15s/Certain Semi-auto Rifles Should Be Banned

Again, criminals won’t obey laws. The France mass shooting mentioned above was carried out where those types of rifles were already banned.

Also, rifles, although popularized by the media, are not regularly used in violent crimes. In fact, according to the FBI, hammers and blunt instruments are used in more murders than rifles are.

Rifles have been used in some recent mass shootings. However, the shooters at Maryland, Ft. Hood, and Virginia Tech did not use rifles. Even if they did, rifles are merely a tool used by a murderer, much like box cutters by the terrorists on 9/11.

Likewise, vehicles are most commonly used by drunk drivers and those texting while driving to kill people. No, these people don’t have a murderous intent, however, many more deaths are caused in this manner and it is still the fault of the person and not the tool used.

5. We Must Raise the Rifle Purchase Age to 21 Years Old

Currently, under federal law, an 18-year-old can legally purchase a rifle or shotgun, but a purchaser must be 21 years old for a handgun. Either 18-year-olds are adults or they aren’t. If an 18-year-old is not responsible enough to purchase a rifle or shotgun, then he or she isn’t responsible enough to vote, join the military, drive a car, or be treated as an adult in crimes.

Raising the minimum age to purchase firearms wouldn’t have changed 29 of the 30 worst mass-shootings in U.S. history. Twenty-six of the 30 were committed by someone 21 years of age or older, one (No. 4) was committed by a 20-year-old who stole his mother’s firearms, another (No. 7) was committed by students who used a pistol they couldn’t legally purchase, and a third (No. 22) was committed by a 16-year-old who couldn’t purchase any firearms legally.

The most recent shooting in Maryland was committed by a student with a handgun and who was 18 years old. It is yet another example of a minimum age law not working.

6. Gun-Free Zones Are Safe Spaces

No. In fact, the opposite is true. Gun-free zones are a magnet for mass shooters — almost every mass shooting we have experienced has occurred in a gun-free zone.

It is logical that these monsters prefer unarmed victims. In fact, most of the shooters are stopped once they are confronted with armed resistance. If politicians believe that gun-free zones work, why do they hide behind armed security themselves?

7. Places With Strict Gun Laws Don’t Have Shooting Problems

Not true. Take a look at Chicago, a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation. In the year 2016 alone, Chicago saw 762 gun deaths and experienced 4,331 shootings.

Or France, where there were 532 casualties from mass-shootings in 2015. As a comparison, America, experienced 527 casualties from mass-shootings over an eight-year period from 2009 to 2016.

Those numbers mean that France, which has incredibly strict gun control and is one-fifth of our population, experienced eight times the amount of casualties from a mass shooting in one year. Clearly, 2015 was an anomaly for France. However, the comparison is used to show that gun control does not prevent gun violence.

Also, note the rampant violent crime in much of Europe, which generally maintains very restrictive gun laws.

8. Reducing Guns Will Reduce Gun Violence

For the reasons above, we know that this isn’t true. However, even if it were true, our goal should be to reduce all violence. Completely eradicating gun violence wouldn’t have stopped the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Boston marathon bombing, the serial bombings in Austin, Texas, or other violent crimes.

According to FBI crime stats, in 2004, after the 1994 federal “assault weapons” ban ended, violent crime actually fell. In fact, violent crime has fallen by more than 50 percent since 1997, when the ban was in effect. Since 2004, sales and ownership of AR-15-style rifles have skyrocketed. Thus, contradicting claims made by gun control components, violent crime fell when the number of guns owned by the population significantly increased.

Often Australia is used as an example for how banning guns works. Yes, their firearm-related crime went down, but their violent crimes, to include sexual assault, kidnapping, manslaughter, and robbery, have all stayed the same or increased.

Also, gun restrictions can lead to an increase in violence when law-abiding citizens are unable to protect themselves. Everywhere would be a gun-free zone.

9. Only Law Enforcement Should Have Guns

When seconds count, law enforcement is often minutes away. According to the Department of Homeland Security, “the average duration of an active shooter incident at a school is 12.5 minutes. In contrast, the average response time for law enforcement is 18 minutes.”

A firearm is the best method of self-defense for a single mother defending her children from a home intruder. If police officers need firearms because of the violent people they encounter, then surely average citizens need firearms even more. We’re the ones who must face the violent people without backup and while the crime is being committed.

Additionally, the argument that only the government should have guns defies the purpose behind our Second Amendment protections. It is baffling how many of the people who vilify law enforcement are also the same ones insisting that only law enforcement should have guns.

10. High-Capacity Magazines Should Be Banned

In addition to trying to ban guns, anti-gunners also try to vilify another inanimate object: “high-capacity magazines.” Typically, the most popular target of their ire are magazines with the capability to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, especially AR-15-style magazines. They claim that by stopping to reload, a mass-shooter can be stopped.

The facts don’t support this. One of the Columbine shooters used 10-round magazines, and the Virginia Tech shooter used mostly 10-round magazines. The shooter from the recent Florida school shooting, although he had an AR-15-style rifle, used 10-round magazines to commit the crime. And Maryland, where the most recent school shooting occurred, already has laws banning the purchase of “high-capacity” magazines.

The common theme among most of these arguments is that more laws will make us safer. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Criminals don’t obey laws. Instead, maybe it’s finally time to realize that gun-free zones don’t work and that we are our own best defense against being a victim.

Why The Greitens Prosecutor Could Be The One Who Ends Up In Jail,"It didn’t take long for the wheels to start coming off the wagon of St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s prosecution of Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens.

An indictment with dubious origins and few facts has led to a trial with almost unbelievable moments of legal comedy. There was the initial hearing, when the prosecution admitted to the judge that they don’t have evidence to win the trial. Then there the moment when the prosecutors had to tell the defense that they didn’t have the photo that is supposedly the reason for the indictment in the first place.

And last, but most certainly not least, there was the moment when the prosecution allegedly broke the law by bringing on a prosecutor who was serving elsewhere as a criminal defense attorney. Yep, that’s a crime in the state of Missouri, and the prosecution allegedly committed it. Whoops.

It’s been my experience, after decades in law enforcement, that prosecutors tend to know the difference between what is and is not a crime. Most of the time, that is. In the case of Kim Gardner, I’ll admit: I’m not sure she does. Because in her action against Greitens, she appears to have missed the boat on what a crime is. In this case, she has no victim, very little evidence, no legal standing — and given all that, almost no hope of conviction. The slipshod work by the prosecution led one high-level member of law enforcement in the state of Missouri to call this “a clown show prosecution,” and that opinion is widely shared in legal and law enforcement circles in Missouri.

Obviously, Gardner probably didn’t think it would go this way. She was probably thinking this case against a high-profile, popular, sitting Republican Governor would make her name. Now it might ruin her career. Here’s why: It’s almost certain, at this point, that the case will either be thrown out by the judge or that the governor will be found innocent. But there might be more fallout to come — for Gardner, that is. What if the Greitens team files a civil suit against Gardner, one that could cost her millions in damages? What if citizens in the city of St. Louis file complaints with the police or Missouri’s attorney general about Gardner’s conduct, leading to a criminal investigation? Ironically, a case that began on illegitimate grounds could end with the quite-legitimate investigation of the prosecutor who started it.

Five new facts have emerged in the course of the trial that point to this being a real possibility. Together, they tell the story of a seemingly malicious and reckless prosecution driven by politics, ignorance, and ego, rather than a pursuit of justice.

1. It appears that Gardner began preparing the paperwork for the indictment prior to conducting any investigation.

Take a look at the bottom right hand corner of the indictment Gardner filed in this case. Notice the date: 12/22/2017.

That appears to be the date on which this document was first created. And it’s an interesting timestamp. Why? Because according to a letter released by the circuit attorney’s office, Gardner did not launch her investigation of Greitens until Jan. 11, 2018.

That means the indictment paperwork was apparently begun by the circuit attorney’s office a full 20 days before that office publicly became involved in this case. In other words, Gardner (or someone on her team) began writing out an indictment document before evidence of a crime was ever brought forward, before her office conducted any kind of inquiry, and before a grand jury ever sat. You don’t need a law degree to be bothered by this: Why would you prepare an indictment about a crime weeks before investigating that crime?

Answer: You wouldn’t. Unless of course the evidence didn’t matter to you, because you were just looking for any crime that fit and any jury that would indict.

Now, Gardner might claim this date screwup was a simple administrative oversight, a mere clerical error. If that’s the case, it’s just as troubling: Who makes mistakes like that when they charge a sitting governor with a felony? Did Gardner’s office just boot up a computer and decide to grab whatever indictment popped up most recently? And why not double-check a document like that before submitting it? What other “mistakes” of this kind have been made during the course of her investigation and indictment? Or worse: What mistakes has Gardner made prosecuting other cases, where the stakes for the people involved are just as significant?

Getting an explanation for this “12/22/2017” date is important. It seems Gardner was either plotting this indictment since late December, prior to gathering any evidence, or she and her team have been careless, reckless, and flippant about the documents and procedures involved in something as serious as charging the state’s leading official with a crime. Either possibility is damning.

2. Gardner allegedly broke the law in the course of her prosecution.

According to Missouri law, a prosecutor in the state cannot also serve as a criminal defense attorney. It’s a section of the law that Gardner would have done well to read twice before inviting Professor Ronald Sullivan of Harvard University to join her prosecutorial team. Greitens’ lawyers allege in a motion to disqualify Sullivan that when she offered, and he signed, a $12,000 per month contract to join her prosecution team, Sullivan committed a misdemeanor offense — and Gardner became party to a crime.

Gardner’s spokeswoman has rejected the allegation, claiming it’s legal because Sullivan does not have any pending litigation against the state of Missouri, but there’s really very little room for gray area here: Sullivan allegedly committed a crime, and his boss, Gardner, likely should have known better. She’s a prosecutor, one of the leading law enforcement officials in the city of St. Louis.

There’s another issue with the hiring of Sullivan to assist the prosecution, according to the motion filed by Greitens’ lawyers. They claim the deal Sullivan struck with Gardner allows him to hire whoever he wants to assist him, and that those people can be paid for with private funds. The way Gardner set this up, Greitens’ political opponents can apparently pay to prosecute him. In other words, the contract between Gardner and Sullivan essentially “privatizes” prosecution. We now have a bizarre case of what appears to be a weaponized and privatized prosecutor, a potential abuse of authority that should deeply concern all citizens.

There is a reason Missouri doesn’t allow this kind of thing: because it’s flat-out wrong. Our system of justice depends on public prosecutors, paid for by public funds, with their work, their methods, their sources, and their funding made public for all to see. The fact that Sullivan was apparently given such wide latitude to use private money to assist the prosecution — and the fact that he was brought aboard in the first place — represents a threat to the legitimacy of the judicial system.

3. Gardner’s assistant prosecutor allegedly misled the grand jury about the indictment.

Already in this case, the prosecution has struggled to show evidence of a crime. They have to depend on the testimony of an aggrieved ex-husband and a copy of a secretly recorded audio tape that ex-husband made — a taping done without the alleged victim’s consent or knowledge. That’s basically all they’ve got.

And that might explain why, during the grand jury proceedings, Gardner’s assistant prosecutor, Robert Steele, allegedly misled the grand jury to get them to indict the governor. That’s right: He gave a “false and misleading” statement about the statute the governor is alleged to have violated, according to Greitens’ defense lawyers. And he allegedly gave it in order to make the grand jury believe that a crime had been committed.

The defense’s opening two sentences in a recent motion make it plain what can happen if a prosecutor gives a misleading statement to a grand jury: “There are only a few actions by a prosecutor in presenting her case to a grand jury which can result in dismissal of the indictment. Offering misleading legal instructions is one of them.”

4. Gardner’s investigators were under FBI investigation.

A note to prosecutors: Beware the company you keep.

In my prior piece about this case, I covered the utter strangeness of a prosecutor using out-of-state private investigators to conduct an investigation of a public official. As it turns out, I was only scratching the surface. The out-of-state private investigators Gardner hired were led by a man who was once under FBI investigation himself. You couldn’t make this up if you tried: The private investigator, William Don Tisaby, worked for the FBI when he was accused of bigamy, and what’s worse, he allegedly lied to the FBI about it.

It was already odd to have a private investigative firm looking into a governor. Their work, as has been reported, was sloppy and irregular for a case like this. They weren’t allowed to write down any of the facts they found, and they were paid sums of money well above-and-beyond what a police officer would make for the same work. Now you add to that the fact that the investigators were being investigated, and you have another supporting fact for the countersuit that could await Gardner at the conclusion of this case.

5. Even the chief of police of St. Louis is demanding answers.

Another tip for prosecutors: Don’t pick a fight with the people who arrest the criminals you’re supposed to prosecute.

Gardner has developed a negative reputation among police officers in St. Louis. She’s looked the other way on cases into which they’ve poured time and energy; and she’s gone after police officers with more aggressiveness than she’s gone after killers and thieves.

That might explain why the new police chief in St. Louis, John Hayden, was so quick to point out to the press that the police had no involvement in the Greitens case. Not only did they not investigate, but the chief took issue with Gardner’s suggestion that the police had been asked to and didn’t: “It makes me frustrated because it’s as if she’s saying I failed to do something I’m supposed to do here, and that’s not the case at all. To date, nobody has tried to report this to the police department.”

Hayden went further and asked for answers, specifically why private investigators would be brought in to do an investigation given his police department’s decades-long history of, you know, conducting investigations. As Hayden put it, “This has all been oddly done to me as far as I’m concerned. She has to explain why she did what she did.”

Chief, when you said that, you could have been speaking for all St. Louisans — and indeed, all Missourians.

The Endgame

When prosecutions like this fall apart, they don’t go quietly. It is very possible that Kim Gardner will not only lose this trial, but that the process by which this case was handled will prove a case study in how not to prosecute someone. She could lose her bar license, and it is possible that a countersuit by the governor and his defense team would lead to millions in damages and fines. If the police or FBI or US attorney begin looking at her conduct in this case, she could even end up serving time herself.

Because of the stakes, here is how I suspect this will play out: The prosecution will get desperate. They will start grasping at anything, any shred of an attack on the governor, the better with which to support their failing case. So don’t be surprised if they begin to poison the well in the press, even more than they already have. They may make more outlandish claims about what the governor did or did not do to the alleged victim. They may even try to indict the governor on some other charge, as a way of distracting the public from the flimsiness of the first one. Already subpoenas have been issued from Gardner’s office on matters unrelated to the first indictment. Another ludicrous indictment is likely to come for a prosecutor who needs to dig her way out of the hole she made.

A story making the rounds in St. Louis police circles speaks to just how far the prosecution is willing to go now that their core case has begun to fall apart. As word has it, on Tuesday of this week, Gardner invited someone she knew from her school days over to her office. The gentleman was a cop. She told him to come to her office, a chance for old friends to catch up.

When he came into the office, he was brought in to sit with Gardner — and with the lead investigator on the Greitens case, William Tisaby. Quickly, Gardner and Tisaby began pressing the cop for details on the security procedures at the Chase Park Plaza hotel, where the woman who the governor had the affair with worked. Were there tapes available of people’s comings and goings in the hotel that they could get their hands on?

The cop was, correctly, bothered by their questions. This wasn’t why he had come to her office. He asked if he needed to bring in his department representation. Presumably he knew, as the police chief himself stated, that the police were not involved in this case. He told them nothing. Sensing that her “source” was not going to cooperate, Gardner is said to have excused herself, and the meeting ended.

That story reveals the great lengths to which the circuit attorney may be having to go to find evidence: deceiving police officers in order to get help in her investigation that appears to be falling apart. And, perhaps worst of all, she’s said to be wasting a cop’s time by involving him in a case about the personal lives of private citizens (the governor was a private citizen when all this took place). St. Louis had one of its bloodiest weekends in a long time just this past weekend. And our circuit attorney is said to be busy asking about hotel rooms at the Chase Park Plaza.

But we now have ample evidence to suggest this is just how Gardner does business. And if she sees the inside of a jail cell or watches her bank account go to zero because of her actions against the governor, then she will simply reap what she has sowed — and what many in law enforcement believe she has deserved since her earliest days as circuit attorney.

"400,000 U.S. Rape Kits Are Untested. See How Texas Began Fixing This","A grave injustice has prevailed over the United States for decades, but things are finally being set right in Texas. In 2018, Texas is the only state to have enacted comprehensive statewide reform to address the national crisis of rape kit backlogs. Texas is showcasing creative solutions to this injustice, and other states should take notice.

For far too long, vulnerable women have been twice victimized: first by their rapists and sexual assailants, and then by bureaucratic indifference. Two of the most fundamental and inherent functions of government are to protect citizens and promote justice. This not only means keeping the peace through crime deterrence, but also investigating crimes and rectifying wrongs. It also means providing an avenue for citizens to seek justice in courts.

In the early part of the 2010s, wide-scale public awareness of rape kit backlogs arose. By some estimates, more than 400,000 untested rape kits were sitting in evidence rooms and crime labs across the country. These kits contain samples of clothing fibers, hair, body fluid, and other identifying evidence found on the victims of rape and sexual assault. In many cases, women have waited for justice without any updates or notifications on their case.

Worse still, more women were and are still victimized by serial rapists and sexual assailants whose incriminating DNA evidence simply has not been tested. Failing these and future women is unacceptable, and allowing criminals to roam free without the due diligence of investigation is indefensible.

Texas Stares Down 20,000 Rape Kits

Like any backlog, once it starts, it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve. The stock of untested rape kits increases every day, as a new flow of victims go to hospitals, clinics, and police stations. Since it costs between $500 and $2,000 to analyze each kit, some backlogged jurisdictions simply lacked the resources to begin, or prioritized resources for other evidentiary investigations. Many states identified lack of funding as the reason for the backlog, making funding a critical part of the long-term solution.

For Texas, the problem included an estimated 20,000 untested kits in 2012, according to the Department of Public Safety. For context, the total number of sexual assaults reported for the state in 2012 was 17,835.[1] Today, that backlog is around 2,100. So how did Texas reduce its backlog by 90 percent in six years with more kits added every day? Here is what happened.

The second state to enact reform legislation after the national problem came to light, Texas first went after the flow of new kits. The injustice of the backlog could not be ignored, but preventing new injustice was a critical step. A unanimously passed 2011 law set a 30-day window for all new sexual assault evidence to be reported to a public accredited crime lab. While that may seem like a long time for a victim to wait, this was an ambitious timeline given the existing state of affairs. The law also set a deadline for counting, reporting, and analyzing the backlogged kits.

Because the Texas Department of Public Safety includes transportation, funds are occasionally appropriated from the state highway fund for other public safety uses, but law limits this. The 2011 law also authorized the use of grants, gifts, or donations from federal or private sources to supplement funding to tackle the backlog. Several federal grants have since been awarded and the state legislature directly appropriated $4.2 million toward the backlog for fiscal year 2018.

Texas Goes to Citizens for Donations

In 2017, to further supplement the funding, the legislature passed a new law to help crowdsource money. The law created a new category on driver license application and renewal forms to allow Texans to donate $1 or more to the sexual assault evidence testing grant fund. The state currently uses this popular form of funding for Texas veterans, organ donation, and blindness education screening and treatment programs.[2] In the first month of the new program, 8,900 citizens donated nearly $25,000 to support the evidence testing fund.

Also in 2017, the state codified a requirement for creating and managing an electronic tracking system for sexual assault evidence kits. This provides greater accountability and transparency, as it identifies each kit’s status and location, allows health-care professionals, law enforcement officials, and survivors to anonymously track kits, and provides an efficient and effective database for officials to monitor. It also keeps the information confidential and prevents unwarranted disclosures.

In addition to directly addressing the backlog through quicker reporting times for new kits, funding for testing old kits, and digitalizing records, the Texas legislature also bolstered victim rights and medical access relating to sexual assault. Access to high-level care and transportation at health facilities ensures proper handling of evidence and helps to ensure the responsible handling of kits. Together these reforms have been effective, and while new reforms and perspectives on policy may emerge, the results speak for themselves.

Donations Are an Exercise of Fiscal Democracy

By approving outside funding and promoting voluntary donations, the state supported the cause without additional financial strain on taxpayers. Of course, criminal justice and public safety are proper roles of government and justifiable spending, but creative funding mechanisms should not be frowned upon.

While all 50 states use driver license applications and renewal forms for organ donation registration, far fewer offer the opportunity for voluntary donations to state grants. This clever strategy not only encourages charity and strengthens public programs, but it allows individual citizens to direct funds exactly where they want them without legislative and bureaucratic interference. In this instance, legislators were not allocating the appropriate level of funding to prevent the issue. Voluntary, citizen-directed money is an exercise of direct fiscal democracy, and through millions of dollars, it is clear that the people support this.

The Lone Star State is used to standing out and setting an example. This is one area in which Texas should not be unique. Other states should follow Texas’ lead and join it in the pursuit of justice and reform.

To be sure, virtually every state is taking the issue on, and the particular challenges differ by state, but these reforms show that the rape kit backlog can be reconciled and prevented. As Texas continues the fight, states should take notice of its effective reforms.

[1] This total includes male and female victims, male and female aggressors, and all classes of sexual assault; not all resulted in administration of a rape kit. Crime reports for other years here.

[2] For 2016, the program netted the following donations: Texas Veterans, $1,452,937; Glenda Dawson Donate Life Texas donor registry, $501.516; Blindness, Education, Screening and Treatment Program, $362,461.

Conrad Black On Trump’s Place In The History Of Populism,"Lord Conrad Black discussed his compelling essay in “Vox Populi” with Federalist Senior Contributor and Senior Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research Ben Weingarten. What follows is a full transcript of their discussion, slightly modified for clarity.

You can also listen to their interview in its entirety below.

Ben Weingarten: “Populism” is a term that’s thrown around often pejoratively in American politics, and even world politics. How do you define it?

Lord Conrad Black: I guess you’re absolutely right. It is bandied about rather loosely. I would say that it is a feeling of alienation by a substantial part of the population that had, at one time, either legitimately aspired to or enjoyed a greater degree of direct attention from people in government and in the political apparatus generally. And it tends to be people who have been either shortchanged on the basis of what they had…they felt legitimate aspirations to expect, or shortchanged on the basis of what they actually received as a deferentially treated section of the polity, the public forum. And it is not revolutionary in character because rarely do such people want to throw out the institutions altogether, or the personnel who direct them. They just want a change in policy, and to the extent, that’s basically a change of personnel.

What you normally get is the arising of such a thing, and then when its presence becomes adequately impossible to ignore, one or other of the established political parties then takes up its cause, at least to some degree, in the hopes of adding its support to what it already has. And I believe this is normally called “fusionism”. Ronald Reagan would agree to that. He took over the Republican Party with a different message from what he represented, as a kind of Tweedledee-Tweedledum performance by those immediately preceding him. And he undoubtedly added a good many people, habitually Independents or from the Democratic side, to the big majorities he won.

And it is the way that, historically, in the United States and some other countries, there are quite sharp changes in public policy outside a transition back and forth between traditional parties, right and left. And I think it’s becoming quite manifest in a number of the leading democratic countries now basically because of the difficulties we’re having finding jobs for everyone in an era when technological advance creates unemployment more than employment, which doesn’t really have a precedent, and in an era when the potentialities of aggressive capitalism create these extraordinary disparities in income greater than we’ve seen before, certainly in the industrial era. And these are challenges to be assimilated by all these political cultures.

You’ve had them in the United States on such occasions as when William Jennings Bryan took over the Democratic Party, calling for bimetallism. And as I put in the essay you mentioned in Vox Populi, the Democratic Party in the five elections prior to him, from 1876 to 1892, won the popular vote or came, on one occasion, within a few thousand of winning it, even though they only won the election twice with Cleveland. But when Bryan took over with his bimetallist faction, their performance deteriorated; and the Republicans won quite easily for some time after that, including three occasions when Bryan himself was the candidate.

But it is a time-honored manner of making a political alliance with a force of considerable discontent that could otherwise become potentially revolutionary, or at least slightly insurrectionist, and bringing it back into the political process and giving it…where it has numbers that justified some sense of being listened to, and contributing to government. That does, in fact, appear to have happened in the last year in the United States. And it’s certainly happened in France.

Ben Weingarten: And I should add, it’s hard to imagine a time where the passions of the body politic would be aroused over a silver versus a gold standard, or all of the above. Hard to imagine that such a time existed in American history.

Lord Conrad Black: It is indeed. It was just one of these peculiar fads, like Prohibition. It became a truism that grew and grew. We had something like that in this country [Canada] at one time, and to a slight degree in the United States, on the theory that if you just had state-owned hydroelectricity, everyone would prosper. There is a weakness, I guess, in all of us, or at least in all nationalities among us, to attach ourselves, in large numbers, to a simplistic formula for a panacea. And of course, experience teaches that they don’t really work usually, but that doesn’t deprive them of their attraction.

Ben Weingarten: In terms of the ideological character of populism today — and I’m thinking here particularly of American populism, although it may extend beyond our borders as well — a question for you: To be a populist in America, do you believe one necessarily need be or ought to be in a sense anti-progressive, given that the elite class, in and of itself writ large, has been marinated in progressivism by dint of the schools the elites attend, the neighborhoods in which they live, and the generally monolithic progressive culture that pervades all of the institutions they inhabit?

Lord Conrad Black: I think that in the way you’re using the word “progressive,” the answer to your question is “yes” because there is this monochromatic uniform view that is politically correct, and populism is almost certain to be to some substantial extent reactive against that. Let us face it, as I’m sure a great many of your listeners would agree, it is an attitude that it is easy to become impatient with. It is so complacent, and frequently so erroneous. In general, of course, I would not, any more than I imagine you would, concede that all progress resides with the left. I would say that is demonstrably not the case.

Ben Weingarten: Yeah, I would say, actually, it’s regress that is dominated by the left. But that’s my editorializing.

Lord Conrad Black: Yeah. And I don’t disagree with it, but you’ve got a current usage question slightly at odds with a semantic question, I guess.

Ben Weingarten: Since you mentioned William Jennings Bryan and the history of populist movements in the U.S., what is it in your view that defines the distinction between President Trump’s populism and populist currents that have come before him in American politics?

Lord Conrad Black: Well, taking Bryan as the most prominent example of it, his ideas simply weren’t practical. He had some interesting elements of, as he would say, a progressive program. I’m no great enthusiast about income taxes, but he was a little ahead of his time in that area. He was somewhat ahead of his time in women’s rights too, including the right to vote. But the idea [of bimetallism] was nonsense. The idea that if you just brought silver, the second precious metal, in to back the currency, everyone would get richer — it was just foolishness. It was just gonna create inflation, that’s all, as you increase the money supply out of any proportion to productivity increases. Now, in fairness, the general subject of economics had not been so thoroughly studied at that time.

But in direct reference to the present Trump phenomenon, he composed a rather artistic combination of traditional conservative views, but sensible conservative views, that he could exploit a nostalgia for and an aspiration for, and added to them a couple of populist flourishes that consisted of a particular emphasis on a couple of points that were not in themselves radical or unheard of or frightening, but from him received greater emphasis, particularly questions of immigration and trade, and to some extent, the imposition of law enforcement.

And these were all ideas that were out there, but he hammered them very hard. He didn’t just take out of thin air a harebrained theory that had never been tried, like bimetallism. He just said, “Look here, we’ve allowed 11 or 12 million people to come into our country, most of them unskilled workers not easily assimilable into our society, including a good many undesirables that other countries in this hemisphere wished to be rid of themselves. And we haven’t even taken their names as they’ve entered. They just came in completely unannounced and unrecorded, and they’re a terrible weight to our social safety net and our education system and so on. This won’t do, countries must have borders.” Now it is so obvious it is hard to imagine that anyone needed to be told that, and I think historians of the United States of the future will be flabbergasted that the political class sat on their hands, both parties, the President’s and the Congress’s, for 20 years or more and allowed these millions of people to come in. It was a shocking lapse in political responsibility, and he finally made the political establishment pay for it.

Ben Weingarten: And you write in your essay of President Trump’s election, that it was only the third time in 100 years that, “The political center moved.” What do you mean by this?

Lord Conrad Black: The others that I was referring to were in 1932 with Franklin D. Roosevelt, and in 1980 with Ronald Reagan. And I believe those three elections are the only ones where there really was a clear demarcation between the outgoing administration and the incoming one, even if it only became altogether clear after the new one was installed.

In, let’s say, the ideological orientation of the administration, Roosevelt, obviously faced with a terrible economic crisis, had a far more government interventionist view of how to get out of that crisis than Herbert Hoover did. And I think they were both in approximately the same socioeconomic group themselves. Roosevelt had a more patrician heritage, but they were both high-income, well-educated men. So it wasn’t that they were at war between themselves in some Marxist class way, they just had a disagreement about how to deal with an unprecedented economic emergency.

In the case of Reagan, there was a strong foreign policy element to it as well, as he believed that the Kennedy, Johnson administrations, and to some degree the Nixon, Ford administrations, had been too accommodating of the Soviet Union. But domestically, he was an advocate of reduced tax and less intervention and smaller government, and to some degree, he was a bit of a confidence trickster, of a very benign and admirable kind. He didn’t really shrink the government very much. Even when he was in office five or six years, he was still running against Washington, the City of Washington and the people in it, and the public sector people, and yet he’d been the president for years. And he was very skillful at doing it. But he didn’t, in fact, seriously undertake a reduction of the role of government. He just changed… Essentially cut taxes, and increased the military capacities and ability to be more assertive politically of the United States very successfully.

In the case of President Trump, again, I think it’s not very difficult to see the change in policy all along the line that he’s conducted from the Obama administration, whether it’s environmental questions, treatment of most foreign policy areas, tax policy, various areas of regulation. It is a sharp change in traditional terms, it’s a change to the right; but not the radical right, just the same sort of right that Reagan talked about and to some degree acted upon.

Ben Weingarten: Yeah, and that Trump agenda, which loosely we can define as — and this is what the National Security Strategy released at the end of last year termed it — a “principled realism” abroad, and at home, an emphasis on sovereignty, the rule of law, and economic nationalism…in your view, does that agenda have staying power? In other words, is Trump’s populist agenda sort of a blip in history that has emerged due to a forceful and charismatic personality, or is there a broader political movement that has real legs?

Lord Conrad Black: Of course, it could go either way, and a lot depends on leadership and more specifically, on how it plays out over the next couple of years. But I believe that it does have legs, and I think it is, on balance, better policy. Let us face facts: The alternative, the policy that he has run against and substantially changed, has been a policy of essentially taking money from people who’ve earned it, and giving it to people who haven’t, with what a very large number consider to be an inadequate criterion of merit, but in a way that coincidentally happens to lead towards the offense of fewer voters than it pleases. That’s essentially what we’re dealing with here.

And if President Roosevelt, who founded the modern social safety network of the United States, had ever seen what it degenerated into, he would have been outraged. He said, “I’m not paying people…” He said that he wouldn’t pay people to be idle. He would if they simply couldn’t work, or we couldn’t find anything for them. But in general, he put people to work in conservation projects, and what would today be called “infrastructure projects.” And they were extremely successful at endowing the country with a great mileage of highways, and many national parks, and great projects like the Lincoln Tunnel and the Triborough Bridge and the TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] and so on. It was a temporary alternate form of work, and I think it’s been a mistake by American historians to fail to reduce that number of people in his workfare programs from their calculation of the unemployed.

As you know, in more recent times, we’ve had a shrinkage of the workforce, and huge numbers of people simply paid to be idle. And to some degree, it’s a necessity because it is difficult to find work for everyone at a time when most areas of productivity can be accomplished with far fewer people than in the 1930s. But I think what Trump is trying to do is go back to economic growth and fair trading so the U.S. doesn’t just import unemployment in its trade deals, and soak up the unemployed and underemployed that way, and make a more contented and purposeful workforce, and reduce the trade account deficit, and that sort of thing. So I think that is fundamentally a sound policy that will be at least partially successful, and therefore partially durable. I think it would be a terrible mistake and a very sad thing if his policies, economic policy failed. Now there’s no sign of that at this point, but we’re only a year into it now.

Ben Weingarten: Yeah. And you wrote an article towards the end of last year for National Review where you reflected a bit on the president’s first year, and you see a great divergence at its highest level between style and substance, reflected well in kind of the apoplexy and criticism of “The Resistance” on the one hand, and then the actual policies that were promulgated and executed during the year on the other. Reflect for us a little bit on the president’s first year in office as it relates to populism.

Lord Conrad Black: Well, look, I think he’s had the most successful first year since Eisenhower, who ended the Korean War in his first year. And this is disguised by these endless controversies, some of which are created by his deliberately goading his opponents because the tumult seems to amuse him personally. And he is a showman; and he believes, up to a point, that politics is entertainment. And he does make it entertaining — I think even most of his opponents would agree with that.

But the fact is, it’s been a year of considerable achievement. He’s drastically reduced the number of illegal entrants into the country. He’s got a much higher level of cooperation from the Chinese in dealing with North Korea. They have, with allies — but the U.S. playing a very important role in it — effectively smashed ISIS as we knew it. I’m not saying there are no people professing to be ISIS sympathizers around, but they don’t occupy any defined territory in Syria or Iraq as they did. And of course, the economic numbers have been extraordinarily good. And he’s got some of the NATO countries, including Canada, I’m happy to say, raising their defense budgets in accordance with their commitments, instead of just complacently sitting with an American military guarantee, and reducing the whole alliance to talking shop. And all of these things, I think, have worked out well.

And I personally think that he was right not to proceed with the Paris climate agreement, which essentially was based on very questionable scientific analysis, producing a conclusion that would cause the advanced economies, in a very apologetic manner, to enrich less developed countries, who are, in fact, frequently the greatest offenders in environmental matters. And it was just, at least in a large measure, a transfer of money from rich to poor countries in the manner of the long preferred, let’s say, Obama-level model of transferring internal resources from the middle class to people of lower incomes. The Obamas took pretty good care, as the Clintons did, of very wealthy people, who tended to take good care of them too, personally and otherwise.

But the fact is that…I have no standing to mind-read, but it appears that the Clinton camp had terrible problems accepting the fact that they’d lost the election. And as a result of that, given their preeminence in the media, largely because Trump identified the national media as one of the problems, part of the “swamp,” and one of the afflictions of the country and its political system, the Democrats have had no difficulty at all getting solidarity with most of the national media attacking Trump at every conceivable opportunity.

So we’ve had this procession of utterly absurd, preposterous attempts to undermine his presidency, that he had colluded in a treasonable manner with the Russians. Of course, it’s nonsense. There’s not a shred of evidence of it. He wouldn’t dream of such a thing. Or that he’s completely mentally incapacitated — he’s so unbalanced, and therefore, should be removed under the 25th Amendment. Again, this is nonsense. That would have applied at the end of President Wilson’s time after the strokes he had, or something like that, not at a situation like this…The Logan Act, which has never been successfully applied in 219 years, that he improperly conducted foreign policy before he was President, this is nonsense. Obstruction of justice from firing Comey, which he would have no difficulty establishing that Comey richly deserved to be fired after some of the things he did, and I don’t think even Democrats would dispute that now, all of this was just nonsense.

But in this atmosphere of the sort of denial that Trump had won, and therefore, a question about the legitimacy of him being in the White House at all, there’s been this recurrence of attempts to demonstrate that he is either morally or psychologically unqualified to be president. And so we’ve had this red herring of a confected threat to his legitimacy hanging over him, and that has been the chief reason why the atmosphere has been so contumelious. But in fact, his accomplishments as president have been very substantial, and precisely along the lines he promised. Obviously, some of the things he said in his campaign, as is the case with most candidates, successful and otherwise, were exaggerations on what he actually did in office. But in general, he has done what he said he would do, and that in itself is a refreshing change.

Ben Weingarten: The ultimate goal of the litany of charges against the President, as we all know, but which is left unsaid frequently, is to, as you said, undermine his legitimacy, and ultimately, from the Democratic perspective, to try to remove him from office — to create, kind of build the case, real or imagined, and then be able to apply high crimes and misdemeanors, and seek to impeach him. All of the signs look fairly ominous for what will happen at the very least in the House, in the midterm elections, for the Republican Party. What do you anticipate happening if Republicans do, in fact, lose the House?

Lord Conrad Black: Well, I agree. I think they’re trying to either remove him…First of all, sort of taint him and plant this generalized view that there’s something illegitimate about him, and therefore, he shouldn’t receive the respect normally offered to a [president]…Secondly, if they can’t push him out altogether, to distract him so much that he can’t perform properly, so they can then accuse him of being a do-nothing president and a mere controversialist, and have him as a sort of…immobilized president sitting in the White House, awaiting the end of his term.

On your specific question, if the Democrats got control of the House of Representatives, certainly there would be a much greater danger that they would try and put an impeachment bill through. I doubt that…On anything we can see at this point, there would be no really serious reason to do it, other than their own partisanship. And there are some sane people in that party and in their House of Representatives delegation. I think Trump would have to do something that the media could successfully represent as really seriously outrageous before they could get a positive vote. I don’t think they…unless Trump actually committed a crime, which he’s not going to do, has not done and will not do, but unless he did that, they would have less chance of actually getting a vote to remove him in the Senate, a two-thirds vote, than the Republicans had when they tried it with Clinton.

So I think the price we paid essentially for the terrible overreaction to Watergate, accompanied by the fact that Mr. Nixon didn’t handle the investigation properly — I don’t think there is any evidence even now that Nixon himself committed illegalities in Watergate, but some people in his entourage did — but the price we paid for that is the routinization of the criminalization of policy differences. “I don’t agree with this person. We’re imaginative and adaptive Americans. Let’s see if we can avoid this policy option we don’t like, and as a bonus, get rid of this President we don’t like ’cause he’s in the other party” — like accusing him of crimes, as if it was just a confidence vote in a parliamentary system like Britain or Canada. And that is not what the authors of the Constitution intended.

Mr. Nixon was a patriotic man who, in fact, was convinced himself that he did not commit crimes; and if he was judged fairly, would be judged not to have committed crimes. But as a patriot, since impeachment had not been mentioned in the presidential context for over a century, for a president, he just didn’t want to put the country to such a demeaning process. And Bill Clinton had no such reservations, but he did achieve something by showing that it wasn’t a process that would necessarily be very successful. They had not even got that far with Reagan and the Iran-Contra nonsense.

But what should happen at some point soon is both parties, and the powers that be politically in the country generally, should realize that impeachment of a president is something that should be regarded as an absolutely extreme measure, as it was intended to be, in the case of utterly profoundly unconstitutional conduct. It was really designed to prevent a domestic George III coming in. Not that he was that bad a king either, but…he wasn’t. He wasn’t that good either. And he was mad half the time, but he was not a madman…I mean, a mad despot, an autocrat, as he was accused of being. But again, that’s beside the point.

But if the United States — and Alan Dershowitz speaks very well about this, he’s a liberal Democrat who supported Clinton — if the U.S. is going to criminalize in an accelerated and unjust way, or purport to criminalize the conduct of people who are just doing what they said they would do when they ran for election, and then psychiatrize them too, and claim that they’re mentally unbalanced and so forth, you’re going to get chaos in the country. The whole system will break down.

What should happen as a result of all this talk is, have an all-party, nonpartisan resolution and agreement, not legislation, but just a state of mind that is agreed upon, that discussion of the impeachment or removal from office of a president should only be entertained in the event of high crimes and misdemeanors on which there’s real evidence, and not in a routine and frivolous and dangerously irresponsible way, which is what we’ve got now.

[Additionally] I don’t think the Democrats will win the House. I think what will happen is that the President will carefully assemble his healthcare reform that the Republican Party is pretty much agreed upon, and an immigration reform that it’s pretty much agreed upon, put those out very firmly to the voters, stand on his high economic growth and continuing excellent economic numbers, and order the release by the Justice Department, relatively close to the midterm elections, of everything to do with the collusion investigation, to reveal in its ghastly infirmity the absolute vacuity of that argument, the falsity, the malice and the defamatory destructiveness of the entire argument that he or anyone closely associated with him ever colluded with a foreign power to rig an American election. Just administer a bone-crushing defeat to the Democrats, and their echo chamber in the national media. And do it right…just coming into the midterm election campaign. And I think he will gain seats in both the House and the Senate.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/04/05/conrad-black-on-trumps-place-in-the-history-of-populism/,2018-04-05
Why The Raid On Trump’s Lawyer Might Be A Fishing Expedition,"Billy Bush and “Access Hollywood” are back in the news. Yesterday, The New York Times reported that the search warrant for the office of President Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, contained references to the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape. Unless you were living under a rock, you remember that shortly before the 2016 election, a tape was made public in which Trump made comments to Bush that when you’re famous you can do anything, including “grab” women by the—well, you know the rest.

It was previously reported that the FBI was seeking records on a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a woman who depicts sex onscreen for pay. Together with the news about the “Access Hollywood” tape, it seems that, at least partly, the Southern District of New York investigation is focused on payments that may have been made to silence potentially damaging information during the 2016 presidential campaign. That’s where the Federal Elections Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) comes into play.

In addition to reporting contributions, FECA also requires political campaigns to report expenditures. Thus, the feds may be looking into payments (perhaps as part of a pattern) Cohen made to prevent the disclosure of information that could have negatively affected Trump’s campaign. The legal theory would be that such payments were also “in-kind contributions” that should have been reported under FECA.

Indeed, in January 2018, a complaint was filed with the Federal Elections Commission against Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and The Trump Organization regarding the $130,000 payment to Daniels. While the “Access Hollywood” tape eventually became public, one wonders if there were efforts to pay for its non-release.

There are still a lot of unknowns, and it’s unclear at this time if a crime was committed. The added layer, however, is what, if anything, Trump knew about any such alleged efforts to pay “hush money” during the 2016 election. Several days ago, the president said he knew nothing about the $130,000 payment to Daniels. With the seizure of Cohen’s computers and files, the feds now potentially have in their possession communications between Cohen and Trump.

Now, you might be screaming, “What about attorney-client privilege? How can the feds just look at communications between Trump and his lawyer?”

I previously wrote about the “taint team” that reviews potentially privileged materials in these kinds of law enforcement raids. While ordinarily they will separate privileged materials that the prosecuting attorneys never see, they will also likely have a separate category of materials that may be exempt from privilege under the “crime-fraud exception.”

Essentially, privilege is moot for communications between an attorney and a client that are used to further a crime. Simply talking about a crime isn’t enough, though. The communications themselves must be “in furtherance” of a crime. Needless to say, if there are indictments, expect a lot of litigation over this issue.

One final thought. If this really is all about failure to disclosure payments that may fit the definition of in-kind contributions, this long-time criminal defense lawyer wonders if the SDNY and FBI’s actions were entirely appropriate. A raid on an attorney’s office is not a common occurrence. While undoubtedly a subpoena would have met claims of privilege, this is looking more and more like a fishing expedition.

"Britain’s Knife Control Is A Bad, Real-Life Parody Of Gun Control","If you set out to write a parody showing the folly of gun control, it might look something like this.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced a crackdown on knives Sunday in response to the rising levels of violence in London, which recently surpassed New York City’s homicide rate for the first time. ‘No excuses: there is never a reason to carry a knife,’ Khan tweeted. ‘Anyone who does will be caught, and they will feel the full force of the law.’… Guns are strictly regulated in the United Kingdom and the rising homicide rate in London is directly attributable to a rise in knife-related crimes, with stabbings claiming at least 31 lives to date in 2018. By contrast, New York—which has a population roughly the same size as London—has seen a steady decline in violent crime. There were 15 murders committed in London in February and another 22 in March, while New York saw 14 murders in February and 21 in March, according to murder rate statistics provided…by London’s Metropolitan Police and the New York Police Department.

But this is not a parody. It’s a real news report, which goes on to describe Britain’s existing knife control laws.

In Britain, it is currently illegal to carry a knife longer than three inches in public ‘without good reason’ and illegally carrying a knife can be punished with up to four years in prison and an ‘unlimited fine.’ Self-defense is not listed among the examples of ‘good reasons to carry a knife.’

If we outlaw knives, only outlaws will have knives—which might explain commonplace news reports like this one, which sounds like a weekend crime report from Chicago but with “stabbing” substituted for “shooting.”

Let’s not look at this as a parody, but as a kind of scientific experiment. On the one side, we have a nation in which the availability of guns has been increasing while violent crime has been going down, consistently, year over year, not just in one big city but across the country. On the other side, we have a nation that is famous for its strict gun control and confiscation of firearms, yet we see violent crime increasing. Clearly, the availability of guns is not the primary driver of crime. But we should have known that already.

I don’t know enough to say exactly what is causing Britain’s crime wave. The reports say that “much of the violence is tied to gangs,” which just kicks the question back a step: why are there more gangs and why are they more violent? But we do know enough to say what is not causing it. It is not some material factor—not poverty, because Britain is a wealthy country, and not guns, because they have taken virtually all of them away.

To look at the actual causes of crime, you would have to look at human causes, at changes in the culture and in public policy. To borrow another pro-gun cliché that turns out to be true: guns don’t kill people, people kill people. Take away their guns and they will do it with knives.

But what happens when people resolutely refuse to learn from this experiment? They will continue to follow their examined assumptions to the point of absurdity—and beyond. As we should all know by now, there is no limit to self-parody. Once you cross the Poe Horizon, there is no logical stopping point. So along comes this follow-up.

Dr. John Crichton, the new chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland, wants the sale of pointed kitchen knives to be banned to help reduce the number of fatal stabbings. He first suggested the move three years ago, but his proposal did not win enough support from policy-makers. Since then dozens of people, including schoolchildren, have lost their lives as a result of attacks involving bladed instruments. Dr. Crichton, who took on the role of chairman in June this year, is championing a switch to so-called ‘R’-bladed knives, which have rounded points and are far less effective as weapons…. ‘We are very quick to be critical of our American cousins and the prevalence of guns but this is an issue which doesn’t even occur to us.’

As a friend put it to me, “You can’t parody this anymore. If I said next on the list will be a ban on rope to prevent suicides and strangulation, they would take it up.” But only after we finally defeat the National Cutlery Association and purge our politics of the corrupting influence of the rope manufacturers’ lobby.

The Syria Strikes Are Really A Reset Of Obama’s Failed Foreign Policy,"On Friday, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom launched twice as many missile strikes against Syria’s chemical weapons capability as the United States did last year on its own. The United States has twice struck Bashar al-Assad’s regime for crossing President Donald Trump’s red line, and the second time did so in coalition with European powers and hit harder.

Why underscore that? Because despite much commentary that Trump really wants to get out of Syria and that this latest strike was really about chemical weapons, there is a bigger picture than chemical weapons or Syria. The Trump administration is not simply spanking a rogue regime for human rights atrocities and war crimes. They are showing Russia, Iran, and others what happens when aggressive powers try to shape the world order to their interests and contrary to those of the West.

There is no doubt that President Trump, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and French President Emmanuel Macron were motivated by Syria’s horrific crimes against innocent civilians. But Syria’s use of chemical weapons is not happening in a vacuum. It is the last five years of Russian, Iranian, and Syrian behavior—and the failures of the Obama regime—that have brought us to this point.

The Obama Administration Messed Up Royally

President Obama’s greatest error was not simply drawing red lines regarding Syrian chemical weapons use then failing to enforce them. Rather, his greatest failure was failing to appreciate that Russia and Iran have been angling for years to control the fate of the Middle East. He blew it, and they took advantage of his fecklessness by acting contrary to U.S. interests and those of our allies in the region.

They now have unacceptable leverage over the region. Russia isn’t enamored of Assad, and neither is Iran. Assad is a loser who can’t hold his country together without outside support. He is nothing more than an opportunity for them.

But holding Assad in contempt doesn’t mean these regimes can’t recognize a bird’s nest on the ground when they see it. When Obama failed to act in time to stop the Islamic State’s rise, drew red lines and didn’t enforce them, and foolishly turned over to Russia the task of curbing the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capability, he gave Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei a gift: massive leverage in the Middle East.

That’s so much so that Iran is bolstering a Shia crescent that threatens the United States, Israel, and Sunni powers allied with the United States (and putatively Israel), and Russia is once again able to shape events in the eastern Mediterranean after being boxed out by the United States for more than 40 years.

These Strikes Are an Important Diplomacy Tool

With this latest strike and the administration’s justifications for it, Trump’s foreign policy team has not only increased the pressure on Assad by decimating his chemical weapons capabilities, it has humiliated the Russian and Iranian regimes. That is important for our diplomacy regarding aggressive dictatorships.

The Russians take the world stage regularly to extol the virtues of international cooperation, their role in the war on terrorists, and respect for what they call legitimate regimes. Yet for years Putin has governed as a dictator who kills his political enemies at home and abroad; invades and occupies other countries; enables rogue regimes like Assad’s; and regularly harasses other states by violating international air space. Iran has also for years played the victim while supporting terrorism across the globe; threatening its neighbors; amassing nuclear weapons capability and pledging to use them to annihilate Israel and other Iranian enemies; and killing Americans in Iraq as it seeks to control that country’s future.

The Russian and Iranian regimes do these things because of who they are and what they believe in, not because any other state has provoked them. The Russian regime believes in its destiny as a great power equal to or stronger than the United States. The Iranian regime, depending on which violent leader we are discussing, believes in its right to be the leader of the Islamic world. Some believe they are key to ushering in the 12 Mahdi where we all get to live under Islam.

Neither regime will be talked out of its goals. They will respond only to force and the threat of it. Besides, they cannot do otherwise: each holds power not by bolstering free markets and free peoples at home, which is the foundation of a peaceful international order, but by pretending they are protecting their country from enemies at home and abroad. They do not seek to cooperate in an international order built by the West that serves freedom and growing prosperity. They seek to destroy that order so they might stay in power, shape the world, and benefit from hegemony over their regions.

The Trump administration is showing them the United States will not allow powers like these to control the future of countries we consider important for our interests and security, and by extension, the international order we built and must protect.

This Is about Securing World Stability

So this weekend’s actions are not simply about chemical weapons violations. True enough, if such weapons are used in “Nowherestan,” the United States and its coalition allies are not likely to bomb, even if a good argument can be made for enforcing international law against such crimes. The United States is not the world’s police force. But if such crimes take place in a region whose destabilization can lead to global disorder, and if they take place with the cooperation of powers, like Russia, that mean us ill, then the United States can and should act.

This weekend, the United States under Trump understood it had an interest in punishing Russian and Iranian hubris just as it did when the administration struck Syria the first time (while Chinese President Xi Jinping was visiting with Trump—you can be sure this timing was a message for Xi and his ward in North Korea); provided lethal weapons to Ukraine; confronted Iran over Obama’s sweetheart deal with them; embraced fully a U.S.-Sunni partnership; sailed U.S. ships through the South China Sea; and went after rogue regimes’ elites and commercial interests.

Don’t expect U.S. rhetoric to match exactly what I am putting forth here. There has been some confirmation of it from Trump and May, and Vice President Mike Pence’s comments Saturday can be read as geopolitical and not just about chemical weapons crimes. But the administration likely has a strategy in mind to change the way U.S. enemies have gotten used to thinking after eight years of Obama.

Then they did as they pleased and paid little cost. Now they must understand that they are making a grave error if they seek to run the United States out of certain regions, threaten and deny our relations with allies, and force us to accommodate a world order that our enemies prefer. The United States will no longer tolerate banishment, threats, or intimidation of itself or its allies.

That Doesn’t Mean We’re Getting a Bush Retread

But just as the administration’s actions are not about regime change, intervention, or getting involved in civil wars, neither is it about force and missile strikes as the only path to peace and cooperation. It is about laying the groundwork for negotiated settlements where our enemies appreciate that it is a new day and that the United States is not a lap dog or paper tiger anymore.

It is about laying the groundwork for negotiated settlements where our enemies appreciate that it is a new day.

The Trump foreign policy team is arguably the most Jacksonian we have seen in a while. It is not interested in policing the world, nor is it going to act on every human rights crisis that pops up. Its priority is national security, which means defending a world order that suits our security and economic interests and using force or the threat of it when necessary—and believing it will always be necessary.

Our enemies want a different order, and the Trump team is saying, “You can’t have it.” If someone is confused by Trump’s tweets versus Defense Secretary James Mattis’s statements, they are missing that big picture, or trying too hard to paint Trump as “unstrategic” and irrational.

Fine, he’s not like other presidents who measure every word and run their remarks by 20 aides. But I am pretty sure that not only our allies but also our enemies are clear on what is happening. Professors, bureaucrats, and people who trade stocks all day might be nervous, but they might calm themselves a bit if they’d first get past the uniqueness of the administration but also focus on what a great power like the United States is supposed to be doing in the world for its own interests.

What Rogue Nations, Enemies, and Terrorists Are Learning

Who is to learn the new lesson the Trump administration is teaching about how to get along with the United States? Iran and North Korea are rogue states for which there will likely never be peace until those regimes are gone. Russia, China, and Turkey are states who don’t have to be at serious odds with us but currently believe they can be. Hamas, Hezbollah, and various other terror organizations (Islamic State has pretty much learned the lesson even if it isn’t completely neutered) are just that, and they should learn the lesson that their only hope for survival is to go to ground and stay there, spending every moment of every day avoiding our deadly wrath.

It is the destiny of the most powerful state to have to lead.

Who is taking heart from the Trump administration’s policies and actions? Obviously Israel and the Sunni powers. But we can speculate that so, too, are our staunchest and boldest European allies— France and Great Britain (see here for an excellent essay on Western collaboration)—and many other states, those of NATO included, who had to bite their fingernails nervously during the Obama years as that administration gambled on the “arc of history bending,” or something.

Not all of these states are on the exact same page as the United States, but we are definitely in the same chapter. The United States is almost always several steps ahead of others. It is the destiny of the most powerful state to have to lead if there is to be a satisfactory order to the world.

Will this weekend’s actions be enough? That’s doubtful. Putin’s gonna Putin, Ayatollah’s gonna Ayatollah. They are who they are and have grown used to behaving as they do. It is the Trump administration’s job to help them clear their heads of the habits they acquired during the previous U.S. administration, to help them understand that their habits and goals must change or they will pay an ever-increasingly high price for them.

Strikes Alone Won’t Accomplish the Necessary Job

But Trump has another job: find, through diplomacy backed by force, a way for each of them to save some face as they accommodate themselves to U.S. interests. It can be done—indeed, it is being done as Trump has steadily ratcheted up the cost of their bad behavior despite all their bluster in response.

Not one of these states can afford to be on the wrong side of a United States when we are pursuing our interests.

The president has a solid team around him, and there is plenty of evidence they are seeking the same policy goals and outcomes. Those nice things Trump has said about Putin and other bad actors? Well, there is clearly less of that now, but I always chalked it up to Trump’s style of negotiating, which is very personal. That requires a relationship where one can sit down with the other side and say hard things. If his interlocutors aren’t going to respond to that, at least he tried.

What Putin, Xi, Turkey’s Recep Erdogan, and others must be made to grasp is that the United States once again gets how the world works. We are the preeminent power, but not the only power. We have interests and they have interests. All are seeking their own advantage.

That is the starting point, not some vague and naïve notion of an international community that can automatically go to harmony once the bureaucrats and pundits are set free to organize by consulting their diplomacy manuals. The United States doesn’t have to eject Putin from the Middle East, but Putin can’t partner with a sworn enemy of the United States (Iran) to succor another regime (Syria), all of which constitutes a threat to the United States and its allies.

Our goal should be preserving our preferred order because it is morally and strategically the right one.

The United States doesn’t seek a weak, poor, and disorderly China, but China should understand that we will never leave them in charge of Asia, as our interests in trade and the sovereignty of our allies in Asia are important. The United States doesn’t seek a neutered Turkey, but neither can we tolerate a NATO member supporting terrorists, aligning with our enemies, threatening our friends, and making a hash of its domestic tranquility by treating a huge portion of its population as enemies solely for the regime’s political gain.

Not one of these states can afford to be on the wrong side of a United States when we are pursuing our interests. Not one of these dictatorial regimes who rule by force at home can afford to be seen as losing a struggle against the nation their masters say is their enemy. We have leverage and might; all we need is political will.

The United States can work with friend or foe as long as the goal is preserving a peaceful international order of sovereign states freely engaging in commerce—the order we and our allies built, not the one the gas-attacking, land-grabbing dictatorships want to build. True, it is always going to be harder to do this in a world with so many dictatorships, and we should work with zeal but also prudence in seeking to support democracy. Nevertheless, our goal should be preserving our preferred order because it is morally and strategically the right one.

For any regime that desires otherwise, that seeks an order favorable to their inhuman and violent ways, the United States will bleed them dry, making them pay indefinitely if not ultimately, until they are ready to drop their nefarious project.

Seven Reasons Donald Trump Should Pardon Martha Stewart,"Martha Stewart was released from federal prison March 4, 2005. She exited the pen more hard-as-nails and more admired than the day she entered the facility, where she earned the nickname “M. Diddy” while serving a five-month sentence for felony convictions of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to investigators.

Her six-week trial had enthralled the nation and national media. She was put in a West Virginia penitentiary where she endeared herself to fellow prisoners and took on a role as liaison between them and the prison administration. She went on to serve another two years under house arrest, while mounting a hit-and-miss comeback that more than 10 years later has secured her place among America’s iconic entrepreneurs and badasses.

Also, she is friends with Snoop Dogg.

For all she’s given us, she deserves a pardon. And I know just the guy to do it. Here are seven reasons Donald Trump should pardon Martha Stewart.

1. The Whole Thing Was Nonsense

If you ask an average American why Stewart went to jail, they’d probably tell you “insider trading.” In fact, that is not what brought her down. She was never charged with insider trading over the 2001 sale of ImClone stock that started the whole affair. She was charged with conspiring to lie about the crime with which she was never charged.

“Stewart has always asserted that she sold the stock because it fell below a ‘predetermined price [$60] at which she planned to sell,'” Slate reported. “The U.S. attorney, in contrast, alleges that Stewart sold because she heard that Sam Waksal, ImClone’s CEO, was trying to sell his own stock in the company. The alleged crimes, in any event, took place after the sale.”

That move, which she said she did on the advice of her broker, prevented a loss of about $45,000. The case for insider trading was weak, so the government went after her on more novel charges.

One was so novel it got tossed out by the judge. That particular legal theory was that because Stewart publicly professed her innocence of insider trading, she thereby propped up the value of her own company, with which her personal reputation was inextricably linked. That amounted to “securities fraud.”

There’s a reason “don’t make a federal case out of it” is a phrase for blowing something out of proportion, and this case is a perfect example. It shouldn’t have been a federal case, and Stewart shouldn’t have lost her freedom, her executive position, and a bunch of earning potential over it.

2. To Take A Swipe At Comey

Hey, we know what makes the guy tick. Guess who decided to go after Stewart on these charges when he was a federal prosecutor? James Comey. A pardon to Stewart would be a blow to Comey that is perfectly within Trump’s power and a much less controversial move than firing him was.

3. They’re Both Famous New Yorkers

As long as we have a celebrity president, let’s commence with some real celebrity justice. Stewart was arguably targeted aggressively because she was famous, despite Comey’s protestations otherwise at the time, so if she gets a break for the same reason because Trump is president, so be it.

“This criminal case is about lying. Lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC and lying to investors,” Comey, then the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said at a 2003 press conference. “That is conduct that will not be tolerated by anyone. Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not because of who she is, but because of what she did.”

Trump often does the right thing for the wrong reasons, and he’s now considering a pardon for heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson based on Sylvester Stallone’s recommendation. Good. Stewart’s a model-turned-hard-nosed-businesswoman-and-TV-personality. She sounds like a perfect candidate for piquing Trump’s fleeting interest and impulsive decision-making.

Stewart isn’t a native New Yorker, but the city has been home to her or her business since her marriage to Andrew Stewart in 1961 (they divorced in the ’80s and have one child). She recently revisited her old Upper East Side penthouse for a feature in New York Magazine, during which she was stripped once again of her rightful belongings when a pie plate went missing after the photoshoot in a scandal that set the world on fire.

One of the hallmarks of a Trump administration has been to introduce us to quintessentially New York characters and their special brand of famous rich people infighting. Give me Stewart over Cohen any day.

4. Because She Took Her Punishment With Dignity

One of the reasons Stewart is compelling is that despite the knock on her as cold and privileged, she took her lumps without complaint. She requested a sentence in a Connecticut or Florida prison so that her elderly mother could more easily visit her, but she was denied and ended up in West Virginia — a move even the Department of Justice worried looked “vindictive.” Her attorneys planned to appeal, but she decided to go ahead with her sentence, and she did it with the grace and aplomb she applies to every pie crust (whether she has her purloined pie plate or not). The appeal later failed.

In an era of Lindsay Lohans and Paris Hiltons sobbing their way through day-long jail stays, when they weren’t missing court appearances for drunk driving, Stewart was a dignified breath of fresh air. She didn’t really do much of a crime, but she did the time. At every turn in the case, she defied the stereotype of a rich celebrity getting special treatment. For that alone, she should be officially forgiven.

5. Maybe We’ll Get To See Someone Refuse a Pardon

Is Martha Stewart badass enough to refuse a pardon? Now, that would be a power move. The woman has ice in her veins. I wouldn’t put it past her. Given the odd politics of the Trump era, there’s always a chance she calculates her crime and comeback are a long-completed chapter in her life and the optics of being given a pass by Trump aren’t worth her reinstatement as a non-felonious American in good standing. But the way this week is going, her bestie Snoop may be sporting a MAGA hat by Friday and he and Martha will show up at the White House with a perfect apple pie for Melania.

Either way, it’ll make great TV.

But it wouldn’t be the first time in history someone had turned down a pardon. George Wilson, convicted of robbing the U.S. Mail in Pennsylvania in 1829, was lobbied for by friends and awarded a pardon by President Andrew Jackson. He refused it, spurring a Supreme Court case to consider the odd turn of events. The Supreme Court ruled a pardon is a deed “the validity of which delivery is essential and delivery is not complete without acceptance.” Subsequent rulings determined accepting a pardon can be an admission of guilt and therefore must not compel a recipient to accept.

6. To Make His Own Point About Lying To Investigators

We’re in the middle of a bit of a national conversation about “lying to federal investigators.” Special Counsel Robert Mueller has slapped former Trump aides Gen. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos and lawyer Alex van der Zwaan on counts of “making false statements.” The charge of making false statements was added to Paul Manafort’s indictment. That’s entirely within Mueller’s purview, but should it be?

When there’s no underlying crime with which a person is charged, as in the Stewart case, the false statement can simply stand in as a way to prosecute, because the government couldn’t make its original case. Ken White writes in Reason:

In the old westerns, rather than take the trouble of hauling mustachioed miscreants to desultory trials, lawmen would often provoke them into drawing first, thus justifying shooting them down where they stood. A modern federal interview of a subject or target is like that. One purpose, arguably the primary purpose, is to provoke the foolish interviewee into lying, thus committing a new, fresh federal crime that is easily prosecuted, rendering the original investigation irrelevant. Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, which makes it a felony to lie to the feds, is their shiny quick-draw sidearm. This result not an exception; it is the rule. It happens again and again. Consider George Papadopoulos. The special counsel secured his guilty plea not for improper contact with the Russians but for lying about that contact to the FBI. Consider Michael Flynn. He too pled guilty not to unlawful contact with Russians but to lying to the FBI about that contact. Consider Scooter Libby, or Martha Stewart, or Dennis Hastert, or James Cartwright, all taken down by the feds not for their alleged original misconduct but for lying about it.

Leaving aside whether making a false statement should be a crime, it should at least be pursued evenly. Instead, there are different reactions in the court of public opinion and the actual court for McCabe vs. Flynn. (McCabe’s case has been referred for criminal prosecution, so we’ll see what happens.)

Comey himself is quite serious about the value of truthtelling, as he has indicated on his book tour innumerable times, but he’s more serious about it for some than others.

On Martha Stewart, he writes in the book:

The Stewart experience reminded me that the justice system is an honor system. We really can’t always tell when people are lying or hiding documents, so when we are able to prove it, we simply must do so as a message to everyone. There was once a time when most people worried about going to hell if they violated an oath taken in the name of God. That divine deterrence has slipped away from our modern cultures. In its place, people must fear going to jail. They must fear their lives being turned upside down. They must fear their pictures splashed on newspapers and websites. People must fear having their name forever associated with a criminal act if we are to have a nation with a rule of law. Martha Stewart lied, blatantly, in the justice system. To protect the institution of justice, and reinforce a culture of truth-telling, she had to be prosecuted. I am very confident that should the circumstance arise, Martha Stewart would not lie to federal investigators again.

But on Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, he struck a different tone in testimony before Congress, “Having done many investigations myself, there’s always conflicting recollections of facts, some of which are central [to the investigation], some of which are peripheral.”

And on Andrew McCabe, he tweeted: “Special Agent Andrew McCabe stood tall over the last 8 months, when small people were trying to tear down an institution we all depend on. He served with distinction for two decades. I wish Andy well. I also wish continued strength for the rest of the FBI. America needs you.”

He also said of McCabe, “Good people lie.”

7. Lots of Worse People Have Been Pardoned

I mean, come on. Mark Rich. Oscar Lopez Rivera. Joe Arpaio. Chelsea Manning’s clemency.

Give us Martha.

And, if they want to make a federal case out of something, maybe focus on the pie plate. Now, that is a crime worth sending a message about.

Why The FBI’s Raid On Michael Cohen Sets A Dangerous Precedent,"A few years back, I was sitting in federal court here in Manhattan, waiting for a jury verdict. To pass the time, I started quizzing Mike, the long-serving courtroom deputy, as to how long juries typically deliberated before reaching a verdict. While I didn’t specify, he focused his answer on criminal cases: “I’ve seen juries take as short as two hours and as long as two weeks to convict.” What about acquittals, I asked him? “Never seen one,” he responded.

Statistically, that’s the norm. The federal court conviction rate in 2015 was 99.8 percent; in 2014, 99.76 percent; in 2013, 99.75 percent. In 2015, there were 20 federal judicial districts with a 100 percent conviction rate; another 28 had only one defendant acquitted that year. You get the point: federal prosecutors have a series of inherent structural advantages.

The main bulwark to this is the defendant’s right to counsel, enshrined by the Founding Fathers in our Sixth Amendment: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” The right to counsel is the foundation upon which all other due process rests. We ought not to mess with it. Yet messing with it we are, all in the name of “the Resistance.”

How the Special Counsel Broke Attorney-Client Privilege

It has been long recognized that, for the right to counsel to have any value, clients must have absolute confidence in their ability to communicate confidentially with their lawyers, whether in person, by phone, or on email. That is what is known as the attorney-client privilege, and it is indispensable to the practice of law. After recent events, however, only a fool would place any trust in it.

Like most folks with day jobs, I do not generally follow the ins and outs of the special counsel investigation. But no attorney in America could possibly have missed last month’s news. The FBI, on referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, raided the office, home, and hotel room of Michael Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, and hauled off “thousands if not millions” of pages of documents. In court filings, the feds further revealed that, for weeks prior to the search, they had been secretly reading Cohen’s emails as he was sending them.

Moreover, prosecutors apparently convinced a federal magistrate to issue this warrant on the flimsiest of pretenses—the so-called “crime-fraud exception” to the attorney-client privilege. If media reports are to be believed, Cohen is being investigated for one or more payoffs to old Donald Trump paramours, payments that, because they theoretically benefitted a candidate for president, could be deemed an unreported “in-kind” campaign contribution.

Clever theory, I suppose. The jury did not think much of it when the federal government used it to criminally prosecute former U.S. senator and presidential candidate John Edwards, based on his rent payments for his baby mamma’s apartment. The senator beat the rap and is back practicing law.

I suppose the feds can try again, if they like. But what part about that potential prosecution justified the government raiding an entire law office and hauling off all the client files for prosecutors to snoop through? One can argue over its legal significance, but the fact of the payment itself is not in dispute. Nor is the purpose for which it was made.

Why Breaching Attorney-Client Privilege Is Horrifying

I have discussed this issue with dozens of lawyer colleagues. They are, to a man or woman, horrified. Yet aside from Alan Dershowitz, the legal press has been strangely short of outrage. The American Civil Liberties Union actually went so far as to publish an article defending the raid.

Dershowitz, as usual, hits the nail on the head: “the very fact that this material is seen or read by a government official constitutes a core violation [of the Sixth Amendment]. It would be the same if the government surreptitiously recorded a confession of a penitent to a priest, or a description of symptoms by a patient to a doctor, or a discussion of their sex life between a husband and wife. The government simply has no right to this material.”

He is plainly correct. So why the silence? It is fairly obvious: the fear of being next. If you are an attorney, and the government comes and takes away all your client files to be snooped through by FBI agents, then your law practice is kaput. Sure, you can sue to retrieve the files, but it will ultimately prove pointless. No client will ever trust you again.

The bar’s silence is both dubious and self-defeating. This should not be about Trump. The president is one of the richest men in the world. He can well afford to vindicate his rights through the judicial system. But the rest of our clients, now that this precedent has been set, will not be so fortunate. If we actually care about them, and about our profession, then we ought to draw a line in the sand here and now. The privilege must be defended.

As the Supreme Court has explained, the attorney-client privilege exists to encourage “full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice.” It is not a new concept. According to John Henry Wigmore: “The history of this privilege goes back to the reign of Elizabeth [i.e., 1533-1603], where the privilege already appears as unquestioned.”

At a minimum, we ought not to dispense with this centuries’ old tradition without at least some discussion. So here are my two cents. Political battles should be fought in the political realm, not in the legal one. This is, of course, not the first political spat to intrude into the courts, but it is far and away the most serious infringement of the latter by the former.

Back When Judges Looked Askance At This Sort of Thing

Folks my age and older will remember the ‘90s edition of Mueller, another budding Inspector Javert named Ken Starr. Starr was originally tasked with investigating a shady Clinton land deal but ended up stinging a White House intern into confessing an illicit relationship with the president. He then produced a salacious report that needlessly humiliated and traumatized a young woman, who still seems not to have fully recovered.

But even Starr never raided a law office. At least not that of a living lawyer. He did try to grab the privileged communications of a deceased one: Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster. At some point, Starr moved beyond the land deal and took to investigating President Clinton’s firing of the White House’s travel staff, a ridiculous endeavor if ever there were one. When the investigation began, Foster turned to the law firm of Swidler Berlin for legal advice. Nine days later, he took his own life, launching a decade’s worth of conspiracy theories. Starr then tried to subpoena Foster’s privileged communications.

(Full disclosure: through a dizzying series of mergers, Swidler Berlin ultimately came to be Borged into the Morgan Lewis firm, a collective at which I was once a partner. To the extent this matter was ever water cooler talk around the firm, I was not a witness to it.)

The case went all the way up to the Supreme Court, with Starr arguing that attorney-client privilege should be interred with the client’s bones. In a 6-3 decision penned by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court disagreed. According to the High Court, the attorney-client privilege was so sacrosanct to our legal system that clients must be assured even of its posthumous application: “Knowing that communications will remain confidential even after death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with counsel.”

In an amicus brief, the esteemed American College of Trial Lawyers went even further, arguing that the elimination of the posthumous privilege would be a sort of slippery slope “paving the way for elimination of the privilege in a wide variety of additional contexts.” Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling, we now lie at the bottom of that slope.

The Client, Not the Attorney, Owns the Privilege

For the most part, legal commentators have cheered. For example, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bhahara, who is widely believed to have further political aspirations, tweeted out: “Long live the crime-fraud exception.”

The crime-fraud exception is an exceedingly narrow exception that courts have applied in only the rarest and most extreme of circumstances.

Bhahara may still be stinging from his abrupt termination by the president, but there is no excuse for the rest of the bar. Certainly not the “crime-fraud exception,” which has been the subject of more recent media blather than any other legal term in recent memory. The concept is basic: a client who communicates with his or her attorney for the furtherance of a future crime (as opposed to the defense of a past crime) will be shorn of the privilege.

The attorney, in such instance, has become a criminal co-conspirator with the client. Think Saul from “Breaking Bad,” who routinely advised his client Walter White on how to expand his meth operation.

The crime-fraud exception is an exceedingly narrow exception that courts have applied in only the rarest and most extreme of circumstances. The privilege is not removed simply because the attorney has committed a crime. It is the client, not the attorney, who owns the privilege, and he or she is not to be punished for attorney misconduct of which he or she was not involved. It certainly is not removed merely because criminal acts are discussed. Indeed, that would put the entire criminal defense bar out of business, and negate the Sixth Amendment.

Nobody Should Judge In His Own Case

In these cases, the most important question is always Who gets to judge what falls within the exception? Here we arrive at the most extraordinary aspect of the Cohen affair. The prosecutor’s office has declared that it gets to decide, by having the materials first reviewed by a so-called “taint team” of fellow prosecutors and FBI agents supposedly uninvolved with the case. In other words, their colleagues from down the hall. The whole thing is absurd.

It is also illegal. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous 8-0 decision in a case called United States v. Zolin, held that the applicability of the crime-fraud exception to privileged materials is to be adjudicated through an in camera inspection by the presiding judge. The 1989 decision seems to have been lost to the mists of time, as no one has yet cited it in the Cohen case. But it remains governing law and sound precedent.

Even at the district court level, the use of “taint teams” has met consternation from many judges, and the judge assigned the Cohen case, Kimba Wood, to her credit, quickly rejected their use in this case. (More disclosure: Many years ago, Wood appointed me as receiver to oversee the liquidation of a failed broker-dealer firm.)

Welcome to the Tabloids, People the FBI Doesn’t Like

Wood, who is no stranger to a political witch hunt, has handled the matter in an exemplary manner, assigning a retired federal judge, Barbara Jones, as special master to review the privileged materials. But the court order only cures the injury going forward. What about the weeks the FBI already spent peering into Cohen’s emails before conducting its raid? As the Supreme Court explained in Maness v. Meyers, once privileged materials are disclosed, the court cannot “unring the bell.” Knowledge, once known, cannot be forgotten.

In the very weekend Wood was considering Cohen’s TRO application, a series of tabloid-worthy stories from Cohen’s files came flooding out.

Unfortunately, Wood waved off such concerns. “I have faith in the Southern District U.S. Attorney’s Office,” she said. “Their integrity is unimpeachable.” That is nice of her to say, but it flies in the face of reality.

In the very weekend Wood was considering Cohen’s TRO application, a series of tabloid-worthy stories from Cohen’s files came flooding out, cited to persons with “knowledge of” the privileged materials—presumably one or more members of the supposedly unimpeachable “taint team.” Nor is this an aberration. The leaks spewing out of the special counsel’s Paul Manafort prosecution have been so extensive that Manafort’s attorneys have demanded the judge investigate.

The common thread here is Robert Mueller. Space prohibits me from delving into Mueller’s long, strange career. Suffice it to say that he is emblematic of that peculiar DC phenomenon known as “failing upward,” whereby every act of corruption and incompetence ends in a promotion.

Is Mueller Solving More Crimes Than He’s Committing?

In any event, the problem is bad enough merely focusing on the present. The special counsel’s investigation reminds one of that old Christopher Hitchens saw: The true measure of a police department is does it solve more crimes than it commits?

Unless respected mainstream media sources are routinely fabricating sources and stories, Mueller’s team have committed a slew of crimes.

Mueller certainly flunks that test. Unless respected mainstream media sources are routinely fabricating sources and stories, Mueller’s team have committed a slew of crimes. As the Department of Justice—the agency that vested Mueller with his prosecutorial authority—explains on its own website, the unauthorized disclosure of grand jury information is illegal and punishable under a number of criminal statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. § 1503.

That is all well and good. But when was the last time the feds prosecuted a prosecutor for leaking grand jury evidence? Has it ever happened?

The leaks are only part of the problem. The bigger issue is the underlying criminality of the investigation itself. An onscreen prostitute allegedly got paid $130,000 to stop her from spilling the beans. There is a crime there, but curiously not the one being investigated.

In New York, the crime is called “Larceny by Extortion.” It is a class B felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Under N.Y. Penal Law 155.05(2)(e)(v): “A person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so delivered, the actor or another will … [e]xpose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject some person to hatred, contempt or ridicule”

Seems fairly on the nose. But if the prostitute’s lawyer is to be believed, Mueller is in active collaboration with the extorter against the victim. Also, on “referral” from Mueller, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has now undertaken an egregious breach of privilege. In other words, the special counsel’s investigation has become, in itself, a criminal enterprise.

This Is More Important Than Today’s Events

The main victim is our justice system. I am a lifelong registered Democrat, but this is more important than mere partisanship. There will be an endless number of political spats in the future, but trust in the law, once destroyed, will not easily be restored.

There will be an endless number of political spats in the future, but trust in the law, once destroyed, will not easily be restored.

The time has come for the federal judiciary to step up and save the Sixth Amendment. (Along with the Fifth Amendment which, through its due process clause, extends the right to counsel to all civil matters as well.) It has a straightforward way of doing so: throw out every case in which the government has infringed the right to counsel.

That would not be unprecedented outcome. In the early 2000s, the giant accounting firm KPMG found itself under criminal investigation for an alleged wide-ranging tax evasion conspiracy. The government indicted 17 former partners and employees of KPMG. It also threatened to indict, and thereby destroy, KPMG itself. In so doing, it coerced KPMG to cut off its payment of the legal fees of the indicted KPMG employees, despite a corporate indemnification that required such payment. As a result, four of the defendants were deprived of counsel of their choice altogether, and the rest were limited in their ability to stage a full defense.

Unfortunately for the government, the case came to Judge Lewis Kaplan, a no-nonsense Manhattan federal judge who quickly came to appreciate how the government’s conduct imperiled the constitutional right to counsel. While acknowledging the significance of the alleged crimes in that case—charges far more serious than the click-bait and other nonsense Mueller is pursuing—Kaplan, “with the greatest reluctance,” threw out the indictments.

Kaplan’s opinion should be required reading for the entire federal judiciary today:

This indictment charges serious crimes. They should have been decided on the merits as to every defendant. The Court well understands, moreover, that prosecutors can and should be aggressive in the pursuit of the public interest. It respects the distinguished record of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York [USAO], which long has been, and continues to be, a model for the nation. But there are limits on the permissible actions of even the best prosecutors. As the Supreme Court wrote long ago, a prosecutor ‘is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor — indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.’ …[T]he USAO … deliberately or callously … foreclosed these defendants from presenting the defenses they wished to present and, in some cases, even deprived them of counsel of their choice. This is intolerable in a society that holds itself out to the world as a paragon of justice. The responsibility for the dismissal of this indictment as to thirteen defendants lies with the government.

The Cohen affair presents a set of circumstances every bit as egregious as those that caused Kaplan to conclude that his only choice was to toss indictments. Here, the same USAO that Kaplan deemed “a model of the nation,” at the instigation of the special counsel’s office, brazenly spied on what it knew to be attorney-client communications.

In so doing, it has seemingly run roughshod over the rules governing our profession. To name one example, Ethics Opinion 318 of the DC Bar, the jurisdiction wherein Mueller practices, requires that an attorney who obtains a document that is privileged on its face, without authorization from the opposing party, must refrain from reviewing and using it.

In his obsessive pursuit of the president, Mueller has plainly employed this and other improper means to deprive Trump of his right to the counsel of his choice. The precedents set for Trump today will apply tomorrow to all Americans. For the good of us all, any prosecution brought by, or on referral from, Mueller should be dismissed.

3 Reasons Rosenstein’s Special Counsel Appointment Was Illegal,"After more than one year investigating claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Robert Mueller’s special counsel team has exposed exactly zero evidence of misconduct involving the president in the run-up to the 2016 election. This absence of proof has prompted calls for an end to the special counsel investigation.

What should be garnering our attention, though, is not that there is no indication of collusion, but that there is evidence Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s appointment of a special counsel violated the Constitution, federal regulations, and his authority as acting attorney general. Let’s take these problems in reverse order.

Rosenstein Overreached His Authority Big Time

On March 2, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a statement announcing his recusal “from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.” Sessions’ recusal elevated Rosenstein to acting attorney general with respect to the matters from which Sessions had recused.

A little more than two months later, on May 17, 2017, as acting attorney general, Rosenstein appointed Mueller to serve as a special counsel to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).”

Section 600.4(a) provides a special counsel the authority “to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.”

Then on August 2, 2017, Rosenstein dispatched a memo to the special counsel purporting to clarify Mueller’s authority, stating: “[t]he following allegations were within the scope of the Investigation at the time of your appointment and are within the scope of the Order: Allegations that Paul Manafort [c]ommitted a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych.”

Mueller’s office later charged Manafort in two separate indictments: one in the DC district court, charging multiple counts of money-laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine, and a second indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging counts of tax evasion, bank fraud, and failure to report foreign accounts. Manafort sought to dismiss both indictments, arguing Mueller exceeded his authority as special counsel to charge him with crimes unrelated to Russia’s meddling in the election.

The D.C. district court rejected that argument, while the Eastern District of Virginia has yet to rule on the motion, although the court is likely to follow suit given the expansive authority Rosenstein bestowed on Mueller.

Therein lies the first problem: Rosenstein did not have the authority to grant Mueller such wide-ranging powers because Sessions only recused as attorney general from the investigation of “matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.” Yet Rosenstein purported to authorize Mueller to investigate, among other things, “[a]llegations that Paul Manafort [c]ommitted a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych.”

This matter could not possibly have “related, in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.” Why? Because Yanukovych was ousted from office in February of 2014—long before the 2016 run for the White House attracted Trump’s attention. Thus, Rosenstein did not have authority to direct a special counsel investigation of these alleged crimes.

This Special Counsel’s Activities Are Not Authorized

Second, in appointing Mueller as a special counsel, Rosenstein apparently ignored governing federal regulations. Those regulations are codified at 28 C.F.R. § 600.1-600.10 and limit the circumstances under which a special counsel may be appointed. A special counsel may only be appointed when, among other requirements, a “criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted.” The regulations also require the attorney general (or in the case of recusal, the acting attorney general) to provide the special counsel “with a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated.”

The May 2, 2017, special counsel appointment, however, referred not to a criminal investigation, but to a counterintelligence investigation. It also lacked any specific factual statement. It was not until more than two months later that Rosenstein referenced a detailed factual scenario—and one that had no connection to the presidential campaign!

Two weeks ago, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote to Rosenstein expressing these and other concerns. After noting that “it is unclear precisely how, or whether, the Department is following its own regulations, what the actual bounds of Mr. Mueller’s authority are, and how those bounds have been established,” Grassley directed Rosenstein to respond to a series of question to explain whether (and how) he complied with the governing DOJ regulations.

Mueller’s Appointment Violates the Constitution

There is yet a third problem stemming from Rosenstein’s decision to grant Mueller such sweeping jurisdiction and power: Rosenstein’s appointment of Mueller to serve as a special counsel violates the constitution’s appointments clause.

Steven G. Calabresi, a constitutional law professor at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, provided an in-depth explanation of this conclusion in a recent paper. As Calabresi explained, Article II’s Appointments Clause provides:

[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.

The Supreme Court has interpreted the appointments clause as “constitut[ing] a vital power of the President.” Thus, Calabresi stresses, while “inferior officers” may be appointed by “the President alone, by heads of departments, or by the Judiciary,” “principal officers” may only be “selected by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.” Also, “Congress has specified that the 96 U.S. Attorneys are all principal officers who must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.”

After analyzing controlling Supreme Court precedent and the circumstances and scope of the special counsel appointment, Calabresi concludes that Mueller is behaving like a U.S. attorney:

Mueller has acted and has behaved like a principal officer even though he was never nominated by the President nor confirmed by the Senate. In fact, Mueller is much more powerful than is a U.S. Attorney because he has nationwide jurisdiction and can indict foreign citizens and corporations without clearance from main Justice as he did when he indicted more than a dozen Russian citizens and three Russian business entities. This action had a major effect on our foreign policy with Russia. Mueller’s actual powers are greater than those of a U.S. Attorney and are akin to those of an Assistant Attorney General. It is thus crystal clear that Mueller is a principal officer.

As a “principal officer,” the Constitution’s Appointments Clause required Mueller to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. He was not. Consequently, Calabresi posits, Mueller’s appointment was unconstitutional and “[a]ll actions taken by Mueller since his appointment on May 17, 2017 are therefore null and void including all of the indictments he has brought, all the searches he has conducted included his phone-logging of Michael Cohen, and all plea arrangements he has entered into.”

Legally, Manafort and other defendants can challenge the constitutionality of the charges Mueller has lodged against them based on the appointments clause violation Calabresi exposed. Politically, though, what should be done? Ideally, Rosenstein would reign in Mueller’s reach to comply with the constitution, DOJ regulations, and Rosenstein’s own narrow authority, and then Mueller’s investigation could wrap up expeditiously.

The New York Times has moved to trying to goad Trump into firing Sessions.

Of course, President Trump could fire Rosenstein or Sessions (for allowing Rosenstein to deviate from his charge), but that would be a huge political blunder. Trump currently has the upper hand, as the evidence continues to mount supporting his “spygate” theme. Axing Rosenstein or Sessions would only distract from this bigger story that the mainstream media succeeded in burying for two years.

The New York Times seems wise to this fact and has moved from publishing leaks designed to soft-peddle the Obama administration’s use of an informant to trying to goad Trump into firing Sessions. On Tuesday, we saw the opening salvo when, under the guise of reporting that Mueller is investigating whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice by asking Sessions to “unrecuse,” the Times rehashed in detail the bad blood between Trump and Sessions prompted by the attorney general’s decision to recuse from the Russia investigation.

Unfortunately, yesterday Trump took the bait and responded to the article by tweeting that he wished he had “picked somebody else” as attorney general. This was a mistake: Trump should stick with “spygate” and leave Manafort’s attorneys and congressional oversight committees to address the abuse of the special counsel appointment.

"Why Alice Johnson Deserved Punishment, Despite The Narrative","By the headlines and opening paragraphs of countless articles about the push to grant clemency to a “nonviolent first-time drug offender,” you’d think President Trump had just commuted the life sentence of a little old lady with five children who hit hard times in the ’90s and fell in with the wrong crowd when she needed to make ends meet.

What a great day for drug law reform, right? What sort of “first-time offender” deserves a life sentence in prison? In a short article Alice Johnson wrote for CNN, she says, “I am only one of thousands of first-time, nonviolent offenders given mandatory and lengthy prison terms after committing crimes under financial distress….It’s hard to imagine that I have now served 20 years of my life sentence for that one mistake.”

Johnson confessed that she served as a “telephone mule, passing messages between distributors and sellers.” Mic framed it similarly: “Johnson was convicted and sentenced to life without parole in 1996 for her role facilitating communications in a cocaine trafficking operation in Memphis, Tennessee.”

It was just one mistake, she says. She was just a middlewoman trying to make ends meet and not involved in any of the icky parts of cartel operations, or so Johnson would have us believe.

That’s not the truth, though. The original article in The Tennessean that reported her sentencing got much closer to reality than any of the media two decades later, despite efforts to downplay it as drug war propaganda. “A 41-year-old Memphis woman was sentenced to life in prison for leading a multimillion-dollar drug ring that dealt in tons of cocaine from 1991-94,” it reads.

Court Documents Say She Was a Drug Trafficker

Johnson was charged for money laundering and cocaine conspiracy. According to the article, Judge Julia Gibbons noted that, “clearly the impact of 2,000-3,000 kilograms of cocaine in this community is very significant.”

The Federalist obtained court documents relating to Johnson’s trial and sentencing. The indictment lays out in detail the “overt acts” members of the conspiracy performed. These details show Johnson was not just a middlewoman passing messages between parties otherwise unaffiliated with her. She was instead a manager in a tightly orchestrated drug trafficking operation.

Among the acts court documents say Johnson committed are:

Allowing cocaine to be exchanged outside her residence (at least 11 kilos on two separate occasions). Renting an apartment under the pseudonym Tretessa Johnson (presumably for trafficking purposes). Delivering “large sums” of currency to other members of the conspiracy as payment for cocaine. Discussing “further cocaine transactions” with other members of the conspiracy. Directing another member of the drug ring, Paul Duventre, to make “a series of trips transporting cocaine from Houston, Texas to Memphis, Tennessee.” Giving a plane ticket to Houston under a pseudonym to Mose Williams, who had just delivered a Nissan station wagon “containing approximately $1.5 million in U.S. currency” to another member of the operation, for the purposes of receiving another Nissan station wagon filled with 75 kilograms of cocaine. Instructing Williams to deliver 10 kilograms of cocaine to another member of the operation, “to be distributed in Marion, Arkansas.” Receiving a delivery of cocaine. Meeting conspirators at a house while $1.5 million dollars was loaded into a Nissan station wagon.

The jury convicted Johnson on counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 15 below, which represent all counts on which she was charged:

Count 1: “To unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, a controlled substance, and to unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally distribute cocaine, a controlled substance.”

Count 2: “…Attempt to possess with the intent to distribute approximately 12 kilograms of cocaine, a controlled substance.”

Count 3: “…attempt to possess with intent to distribute approximately nine kilograms of cocaine…”

Count 5: “…attempt to possess with intent to distribute approximately 75 kilograms of cocaine…”

Count 8 …attempt to possess with the intent to distribute approximately ten kilograms of cocaine…”

Count 9: “knowingly conduct and attempt to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate commerce; to wit the purchases of cocaine with funds transferred from Tennessee and delivered to places outside the State of Tennessee, which involved the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity; that is, the possession with the intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine…and that while conducting and attempting to conduct such financial transactions knew that the property involved in the financial transactions, represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity.”

Count 12: “…did knowingly cause, conduct, and attempt to conduct a financial transaction affecting interstate commerce; to wit, the transfer and payment of approximately $1.5 million dollars for cocaine, which involved the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity; that is the possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine…”

Count 15: “…for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of Section 5313(a) of Title 31…and the regulations promulgated thereunder, did knowingly structure and cause to be structured and did assist in structuring a transaction with domestic financial institutions; that is, the purchase of two cashier’s checks…”

This Is Some Serious Stuff

Whether you’re a proponent of the drug war or not, these are serious charges. Johnson wasn’t caught exchanging a wad of cash for some marijuana on a street corner, or smoking crack in a back alley, and then found her hopes and dreams quashed by a draconian state bent on putting all minor dealers and junkies in prison. These weren’t crimes committed out of financial desperation.

Alice put her skills as a former FedEx manager back to work, only the packages she shipped weren’t Christmas toys and knit sweaters.

One doesn’t lose her job and think, “Gee, well I guess I better start trafficking cocaine and laundering money for the mafia to pay the bills.” One doesn’t see her child die tragically in a motorcycle accident and think an honorable way to carry on is to start dealing in highly addictive, highly destructive illicit drugs.

Over a period of four years, Johnson helped manage regional operations of the Cali mafia’s drug business (based in Colombia), what the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) called “an incredibly sophisticated, highly-structured drug trafficking organization.” It wasn’t a side gig she did a couple of times to put food on the table. Nor did she commit it in her youth and naivety (when most crime is committed). She was 41 years old when she was convicted.

No, Alice put her skills as a former FedEx manager back to work, only the packages she shipped weren’t Christmas toys and knit sweaters. They were huge loads of drug money and cocaine. That’s probably the reason Obama refused to grant her clemency when he pardoned more than two hundred other inmates in 2016, and it’s the reason she lost her appeal in federal court. She really didn’t deserve it.

Scrutinize the ‘Nonviolent Offenders’ Narrative

Johnson and her advocates have been hiding behind thousands of other “first-time nonviolent offenders” who maybe didn’t deserve their harsh sentences. They have been using the larger narrative that the United States is “over-incarcerated” and that its drug laws are locking up millions of addicts and other “nonviolent offenders” to push for Johnson’s release.

But not even these narratives reflect reality all that well. Only 3.4 percent of all state prisoners were convicted on the most serious offense of drug possession, and 99 percent of all federal drug offenders are sentenced for trafficking, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Cocaine destroys lives, rots communities, empowers dangerous cartel leaders, and leaves a trail of misery and violence wherever it’s found.

By contrast, in 1991, 12 percent of all violent crimes, 27 percent of robberies, and 17 percent of all crimes were committed out of wanting money to buy drugs. Close to a fifth of all homicide defendants in the 75 most populous U.S. counties were involved in drug trafficking, drug theft, drug manufacturing, or drug dealing.

As far as the specific drug in question, cocaine is highly addictive and highly lethal. In 1999, about 4,000 people fatally overdosed, according to the Centers for Disease Control. 2016 saw more than 10,000 cocaine overdose deaths.

Cocaine destroys lives, rots communities, empowers dangerous cartel leaders, and leaves a trail of misery and violence wherever it’s found. According to the DEA, it’s estimated that cartels under the Cali mafia, in which Johnson had entwined herself, “collectively produced and exported from Colombia between 500 and 800 tons of cocaine a year.”

This is not a drug to treat lightly, and Johnson was rightly held to account for knowingly, intentionally participating in putting such destructive material into the streets of her hometown.

Johnson says she’s reformed. She became an ordained minister in prison, and has apparently been a model prisoner. Sincere reform is certainly a valid reason to consider commuting a sentence, and two decades in prison is a long time indeed.

What is not a valid reason for clemency is the falsehood that Johnson didn’t deserve a harsh sentence in the first place. This “nonviolent first-time offender” malarkey should be seen as the grossly irresponsible spin it is. Alice Johnson acted like a career criminal, so she was sentenced like one.

Real-Life Heist Film ‘American Animals’ Makes Crime Exciting,"Proving that reality can trump fiction, “American Animals” tells the true story of four college students who perpetrated one of the most daring art heists in U.S. history. British writer-director Bart Layton designed this thrilling heist film around the candid interviews of the four thieves themselves.

Bored with finals, frats, and smoking weed, college friends Spencer and Warren lament about their sad lives and sad futures, and decide they should commit a major crime to shake things up. They recruit their friends, Eric and Chas, watch a bunch of heist movies, and hatch a plan to rob the rare book library at Transylvania University in Kentucky.

While it is based on a true story, and includes interview footage, this is actually an incredibly good heist movie. From the moment the idea to steal the valuable books is spoken, the film moves at break-neck speed.

The spliced-in documentary footage is more enriching than it is distracting, the director thoughtfully choosing when and how to insert footage to help move the story forward. As the more awkward details of the plan are addressed in the scripted version, it is fascinating to see how the real perpetrators begin to squirm as they recount their experiences.

“Animals” isn’t just a retelling of an incredible true story, Layton has created a unique style of heist movie that is not only exciting, nerve-wracking, and highly rewarding, it shows the real-life effects and consequences of committing a crime. It’s a delightful combination of well-textured characters, humor, and high stakes.

With the exception of only a few scenes, the movie takes place in the small community of Lexington, Kentucky, and its hometown charm adds specific identity. The crew of four does not include any technology wizards, master cat burglars, or security system experts, just four nervous young men who are yearning for a huge “boom” in their life.

Warren, the unofficial ring leader, is played masterfully by Evan Peters, a recognizable talent best known from “American Horror Story.” Peters brings an energy to the role best described as “charismatic chaos.”

On the day of the heist, Warren and Eric, played by Jared Abrahamson, have to subdue the librarian, played by Ann Dowd, and grab all the books on their list before they are caught. This spectacular scene is stupid thief excitement at its best. The two scream at each other, terrified for their lives, trying to get as many items as they can before their hearts explode.

Layton had an incredible story to start with, but he found a way to weave two genres and make it uniquely thrilling. Hearing from the real thieves while watching their counterparts relive the incredible day satisfied a craving for “more story” that is inevitably associated with movies based on real people.

The question of redemption for Warren, Spencer, Eric, and Chas becomes inevitable. As they now appear on camera, in a movie, retelling the story with a funny twist, it is easy to forget that they all committed a serious crime. They bound, gagged, and terrified a middle-aged librarian, lied to their families, and took things that didn’t belong to them. It’s easy to look at them now and laugh along with their antics, but maybe it shouldn’t be.

Layton made the correct choice to make “American Animals” a fun time for the audience instead of a lesson in morality, however. It is never completely clear whether the four are protagonists or antagonists, but it is impossible not to be excited by their scheming. “Animals” has been described as “docu-fiction,” but history will prove this is a heist film for the ages.

What Netflix’s True-Crime Doc ‘The Staircase’ Can Teach Us About Justice,"Netflix has been slowly coming under criticism for very hit and miss productions. But so far their documentary series have set the bar for true-crime storytelling today.

It all started with “The Making of a Murderer,” and the poetic zenith was probably “The Keepers.” But now “The Staircase” gets to finish a story that seemed told back in 2004. Director Jean-Xavier de Lestrade had added more to this documentary over the intervening years but now on Netflix three more episodes finally conclude the Michael Peterson murder trial.

This new conclusion provides few answers. I’ll avoid dramatic spoilers, but there are some amazing twists and turns along the way.

This epic tragic story starts on December 9, 2001, with the unexplained death of Kathleen Peterson. It ends on February 17, 2017 with her husband Michael’s Alford plea. An Alford plea allows the defendant to enter an official guilty plea and accept its consequences while maintaining innocence of the crime.

The Petersons seemed like a perfect couple to their children and community. But when Kathleen dies, everything about them becomes questioned. Her last breaths were taken at the bottom of a staircase, so it’s possible that she simply fell. But the large amount of blood and damage done to her body looks suspicious.

After a lengthy trial, Michael is convicted of murder and goes to prison. But he always maintained his innocence. Even when submitting an Alford plea of guilty to first-degree manslaughter, he never admitted to any guilt regarding killing Kathleen.

The Film Style Is Different But Gets Boring

Differently than other docu-series, this is essentially a blow-by-blow of the events while they happened. There’s no recreations. It’s almost entirely filmed while the events of the trial are ongoing or simply verbal testimony from the people involved. And it’s pretty much warts and all. The filmmakers seem to not attempt to cast anyone in a particularly positive or negative light. The persons involved are simply allowed to speak. When they look bad, it’s on them, and vice versa.

This also means that it isn’t always interesting. Lestrade might channel Werner Herzog and say something very film schoolish and pretentious in response to that, such as: “The the human condition in its raw form is the most interesting thing imaginable,” or “Your bourgeois values make you the boring one!”

Or he might say something more interesting, which would reflect the quality of what he has managed to produce. Perhaps his desire was not to entertain but to honestly examine these events. If this was his intent, of course these people will not always be interesting to watch and listen to.

That is what he has done. In many ways, this is a reality TV drama, which is a spin-off genre from traditional documentaries. The traditional doc uses a semblance of reality to tell a story in something approaching or intending to seem real. Reality TV is inherently about attention-getting and -keeping. But most docs come about after the fact, or document the condition of something rather than events as they unfold. Reality TV ostensibly covers what actually happens.

How Objective Can Film Really Be?

Guilty or not, Michael Peterson gave a great gift when he allowed Lestrade essentially full access to his life. This was probably calculated to some point. Perhaps they thought it would help acquit Peterson or sustain his credibility as a novelist. But it’s hard to believe Peterson would have let the filmmakers in if he thought a documentary would harm the case in the slightest.

That is potentially the insidious part of all this. Lestrade seems to be as objective a documentarian as he can. But how objective can film be? Early philosophers of film happened to be Kantians. To them, the human mind experiences the world indirectly through filters of meaning. They claim that direct knowledge of the external world in its actual nature isn’t possible.

In film these philosophers saw a further metaphor for this way of thinking. Film is fundamentally a lie that can convey truth. It seems to be a continuous objective record of the external world, but it is not.

Film is a constructed reality. It gives no steady stream but tiny chunks that are stitched together to form what only appears to be a continuous narrative. Traditional 35mm film creates the image you see at 24 frames per second. That means there are 24 pieces to every moment of a film. Every moment of a film is a montage.

That is by definition an illusion. You are not seeing the thing as it is, but rather the effect it produces. Of course, you don’t see the frames in isolation. The filmmaker didn’t produce it frame by frame, either, but as a reality he manufactured to be caught on camera.

So if film itself is an illusion, then how much more illusory is a film that purports to document reality instead of create a fiction? After all, Michael Moore seems to believe his films document the world as it is (a claim that is, to put it politely, unsustainable).

None of this is helped by the advent of digital film. At least actual light actually affects traditional film. It gives evidence of an event. But digital film is an interpretation of light based on the information the sensors capture. That sounds like it should be more objective, but it actually exacerbates the montage problem, because each frame is constructed of pixels. If traditional film is a quilt, digital film is a quilt in which each patch is a quilt as well.

Who Is Documenting and Who Is Fabricating?

None of the mediums through which humans communicate are perfect. They are imprecise contrivances that must follow strict syntax to convey their meanings. Film is no different. So, did Lestrade portray this story objectively? We can’t really know, just like nobody except Mike Peterson knows exactly what happened the night his wife died.

If Lestrade is taking us for a ride, then his veneer of objectivity is deeply insidious.

But if Lestrade is taking us for a ride, then his veneer of objectivity is deeply insidious. Nobody thinks “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” reflects anything resembling reality (or at least I hope no one thinks that). But “The Staircase” does seem to be documenting reality, and is more important now than it was in 2004, just like the Duke lacrosse case of 2006 is more important as well.

That case involved several members of the men’s lacrosse team being falsely accused of rape. The story was brilliantly told in the “30 for 30: Fantastic Lies.” Greg Taylor’s exoneration for murder based on problems with blood evidence partially led to Peterson’s freedom, too, because the same police department and forensic experts apparently mishandled both cases’ evidence.

Taylor was convicted of murder in 1991 and eventually exonerated in 2010. The excellent podcast “Actual Innocence” let Taylor tell his story. These cases are all relevant to the Me Too world, and surprisingly connected to the same police department: Durham County.

There are loads of differences between the cases, but what they have in common is convicting white men of crimes against women based on scanty evidence. The cases also have essentially “happy” but tragic endings for the accused.

Justice Isn’t Getting What You Wanted

They also reveal Americans’ common naiveté about the justice system. When decisions don’t go the way we want, people often find themselves in an existential crisis over whether the system works. But the system shouldn’t be tested by how well it works, but whether its fundamental pillars are philosophically durable. Is our system built fundamentally on wisdom or folly?

The system shouldn’t be tested by how well it works, but whether its fundamental pillars are philosophically durable.

That is rarely the question people ask when they get an undesired result. The response virtually always falls along the same lines: I don’t believe in the system anymore, and we need reform. Actual reforms are rarely mentioned, because if the desired outcome had occurred they wouldn’t be asking the question at all.

Such people don’t have a rational relationship with the system, but a religious one. It’s something they have put their faith in. But the most perfect system can always be undone by bad actors. In our system it’s hard for bad actors to flourish without help. That isn’t the fault of the system, it’s the fault of people who choose to do evil.

The system is entirely based around the idea that a naive justice system can easily be used for injustice. The least naive and most fundamental part of our system is that we would rather protect the guilty than persecute the innocent. This is an admission that the state’s monopoly on violence is far from divine. The exact opposite is true. Power will more than likely be misused.

This kind of system should have protected Michael Peterson and Taylor, even with the bad actors within the Durham Police Department. The jury should not have returned a guilty verdict in either case from the very beginning. “Junk science” and perjury from State Bureau of Investigation analyst Duane Deaver seems to be the ultimate culprit in both cases.

Both juries should have had serious reasonable doubts about the guilt of these men, but they didn’t because they trusted what “science” supposedly had to say. Yet neither case had a clear or strong motive for the murder, and without a clear motive you should have considerable doubts. The prosecution should have to provide overwhelming evidence without a motive. An overreliance upon fallible expert opinion has harmed our system.

Innocent Until Proven Guilty Needs To Be Revived

Today we are far too willing to believe any accusation. We have become predisposed to the idea of guilty before proven innocent, which is the inverse of what we’re supposed to be. Instead of being predisposed to science, we should be predisposed to skepticism, especially when someone’s life is on the line.

The sad truth is we get the society we deserve, and by extension the juries we deserve.

I’m not convinced that Peterson is innocent, and don’t think this doc tries to make the case that he is. It leaves room for reasonable doubts. But thankfully our legal system doesn’t require that you be proven innocent. It requires that you be proven guilty. The state didn’t even come close to doing that with Peterson. That jury was simply wrong.

This is the dilemma of living in a Me Too world. It explains why these cautionary tales are more important than ever. We’ve become primed to believe every purported victim. Now, the court of public opinion isn’t ruled by the same principles as the legal system, but it should be ruled by charity and graciousness. It should be open to the stories of victims but with the corollary that every story has multiple sides.

The sad truth is we get the society we deserve, and by extension the juries we deserve. We all need to be a bit more skeptical and more charitable. Many have said that conservatives have hard hearts and hard heads, while leftists have soft hearts and soft heads. We really need is hard heads and soft hearts.

That fundamental principle should govern juries of every sort. Charity and skepticism should balance and inform each other. This is the lesson we must learn from these stories of men whom were treated unfairly by our system of justice, and of women who claim to be wronged by men. These Netflix docuseries are an amazing place to create space for these most important of conversations.

How Abolishing The Death Penalty Degrades Both Justice And Mercy,"A recent Pew survey shows that a majority of Americans favor capital punishment, with Christians leading the way. It is not just Republican-leaning white evangelicals: a majority of American Catholics support the death penalty, despite the pope’s objections. Tradition seems to be on the side of the laity here, although in the interest of ecumenical harmony I shall not recount the details of the Catholic Magisterium’s previous enthusiasm for executions.

Nonetheless, last year there was a significant (by the standards of Catholic intellectual circles) dust-up over a book by Edward Feser and Joseph Bessette that offers a Catholic defense of capital punishment. Public Discourse published articles by E. Christian Brugger (1, 2) and Christopher Tollefsen (1, 2) that relied on the so-called new natural law theory to argue that capital punishment is intrinsically immoral. These essays, and Feser’s responses (1, 2, 3), have some Catholic inside-baseball elements, but their broader claims against the death penalty are meant to be binding for all Christians, and even for all rational persons.

Meanwhile, in Commonweal, which vies with the Jesuit magazine America to be the voice of left-wing Catholicism in this country, Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart provided an alternative critique of capital punishment that reaches back to the early days of the church and Christian radicalism. These arguments are made in good faith, and merit engagement from those they seek to persuade, whether Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant.

Thus, although a Protestant jumping into a Catholic or Orthodox theological debate is usually as welcome as a streaker running through a team’s scrimmage, I shall respond to their broad claims metaphorically dousing myself in orange paint and sprinting onto the field.

The Two Big Death Penalty Criticisms

There are two distinct, and largely incompatible, criticisms of the death penalty. The first, advanced by the new natural lawyers, is that moral reason shows the death penalty is unjust because it directly and intentionally harms the basic human good of life. The second, made by Hart, is that although the death penalty may accord with natural justice, Christians must live according to Christ’s radical teachings without any public-private distinction—Christians must forgo state violence and seek mercy for even the worst murderers.

Despite their differences, these arguments overlap in several significant ways. Both seek more than a unified Catholic (or Orthodox) teaching on capital punishment. The new natural lawyers present their case as one of philosophical reason, knowable by all rational persons regardless of religious belief. Hart makes his case to all Christians, asserting that “no Christian who truly understands his or her faith can possibly defend the practice of capital punishment.”

Those making such broad claims insulate themselves against directly engaging the merits of the death penalty. To effectively critique the new natural lawyers in a fashion they will acknowledge requires engaging with their entire system. This is a worthy project, but it is also a book-length one. Shorter critiques, such as this one, can only be partial and preliminary. Likewise, addressing Hart requires extended discussion of the relationship between Christ’s radical teachings and the responsibilities Christians in public office have—if Christians should be in government at all.

Both Hart and the new natural lawyers sidestep this question of responsibility, which explains why Augustine is largely absent from their contributions to the current debate. Yet they are undoubtedly familiar with Augustine’s consideration of a judge who, in ignorance, may bring the full brutal force of Roman law against the innocent, torturing and even condemning them.

He wrote, “If such darkness shrouds social life, will a wise judge take his seat on the bench or no? Beyond question he will. For human society, which he thinks it a wickedness to abandon, constrains him and compels him to this duty.” But while the judge may be guiltless (he injures from ignorance, not malice), his happiness will be marred by the “misery of these necessities” and if he is pious he will cry to God to be delivered from them.

This passage does not contain any definitive teaching that is binding on Catholics, let alone other Christians, nor does it directly address the death penalty. Indeed, its primary purpose was to illustrate the miseries of earthly life. Yet it introduces an axis of theological and philosophical reflection that Hart and the new natural lawyers have abandoned—that of responsibility and our duties to the necessities of our fellow men with whom we share this life.

Hart simply disavows such responsibilities if they conflict with what he takes to be Christ’s commands, writing that, “On the whole, the Gospel is probably not a very good formula for protecting public safety.” Likewise, the new natural lawyers dismiss any concern for the consequences of following the moral absolutes they believe their system provides. For example, during the Cold War, they insisted on unilateral nuclear disarmament even though they thought it would likely lead to worldwide communist tyranny. They have also argued that it is always wrong to lie, even to save Jews from the Nazis (their example, not mine).

Participating in Government Requires Violence

To be sure, radical otherworldliness is part of Christian ethical reflection, Augustine’s included. But it is only part—the sense of responsibility Augustine described is another part. And if Christians are to participate in earthly government, whether by holding office or simply by voting, they will have to reckon with the violence that is intrinsic to the survival and well-being of any polity in the City of Man.

Indeed, if Hart wants Christians to abolish the death penalty, they will only be able to do so through participation, and inevitable complicity, in a government that requires violence to sustain itself. Those who seek to improve governance in the City of Man will become responsible for it, and therefore will experience the tension that Augustine so eloquently illustrated in the figure of the wise judge. It is wickedness to abandon their duty, though they may pray even more fervently for the Kingdom of God to come, that they might be delivered from the evils of their necessities.

The new natural lawyers respond to this challenge by claiming that adherence to the moral absolutes their philosophy picks out is a fulfillment of responsibility—a protection of basic human goods. No other responsibility, no matter how weighty, can override these moral absolutes. However horrible the situation is, and regardless of the consequences of inaction, one must avoid the guilt of violating a moral absolute.

However, this philosophy of moral purity is less stringent than it might appear. Their philosophical analysis of act and intention provides a backdoor by which ostensibly forbidden acts may return to consideration, if the acting agent frames his intentions just so. But although their casuistry may cleverly weave its way through apparent contradictions in the pages of a philosophy journal, it collapses in the real world because their model of moral reasoning bears no resemblance to moral knowledge and deliberation as experienced by ordinary people.

Same Action, Finely Parsed Different Intent

This failure may be seen in their discussions of justifiable killings, where they emphasize disavowing the intention to do what one knowingly does. For instance, John Finnis, the dean of the new natural lawyers, has argued that one must never perform an abortion to save the life of the mother in a childbirth gone disastrously wrong. However, the doctor may dismember the child, so long as his intention is not to kill the child (however foreseeable that may be), but only to relieve the obstetrical blockage that will kill the mother.

Thus, if the physician reasons that the child must die so that the mother may live, he is a damnable murderer. If he reasons that the mother should be saved, even if the means involve the foreseeable (but “unintended”) death of the child, he is morally upright. This distinction may hold in a philosopher’s faculty office or armchair, but it will not hold in the hospital, where the doctor will, if he be pious, pray to be delivered from his necessities.

The new natural lawyers reject concrete responsibilities in the name of justice and personal moral purity; Hart rejects them in the name of mercy. For the former, one’s personal responsibilities have no weight against the moral absolutes derived from their philosophizing. For the latter, they have no worth against what he takes to be the requirements of Christian mercy.

Neither of these viewpoints is solely, or even primarily, about the death penalty; each encompasses much more. And both are vulnerable to a critique rooted in the life and writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German pastor and theologian martyred by the Nazis.

Christians Have Duty to Resist Evil

Unlike Hart, Bonhoeffer came to reject Christian quiescence and to recognize the Christian duty to resist grave moral evils. Unlike the new natural lawyers, Bonhoeffer did not prioritize his personal moral purity (as determined by adherence to analytical moral absolutes) over his concrete responsibilities. Contrary to the new natural lawyers’ emphasis on the imperative of maintaining personal moral purity even in extreme situations, Bonhoeffer suggested that the only thing we cannot avoid is guilt.

In some situations, even principled inaction violates one’s responsibilities. The responsible man or woman will sometimes (and those times cannot be clearly delineated in advance) be willing to incur the guilt of violating abstract principles in order to fulfill concrete responsibilities. In this, Bonhoeffer argues, they will follow the example of Jesus, who

took upon Himself the guilt of all men, and for that reason every man who acts responsibly becomes guilty. If any man tries to escape guilt in responsibility he detaches himself from the ultimate reality of human existence, and what is more he cuts himself off from the redeeming mystery of Christ’s bearing guilt without sin and he has no share in the divine justification which lies upon this event. He sets his own personal innocence about his responsibility for men, and he is blind to the more irredeemable guilt which he incurs precisely in this; he is blind also to the fact that real innocence shows itself precisely in a man’s entering into the fellowship of guilt for the sake of other men. Through Jesus Christ it becomes an essential part of responsible action that the man who is without sin loves selflessly and for that reason incurs guilt.

Those who avoid the guilt of acting to fulfill their responsibilities incur the guilt of the self-righteousness and lack of charity shown in their abdication of responsibility. Rather than using strategies of evasion and redescription (such as the principle of double effect) to deny responsibility for what one deliberately and knowingly does, Bonhoeffer urged a clear acknowledgement of the deeds one is responsible for, including the guilt one might thereby incur.

Abolishing Punishments Also Abolishes Mercy

The new natural lawyers’ flight from concrete responsibilities to theoretical responsibilities rooted in ostensibly basic human goods is a result of their fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of moral knowledge. By attempting to establish universal, impersonal moral absolutes that are demonstrable to any rational person, they discard that which is in need of moral guidance—the individual in all of his or her particularity. Their attempt to demonstrate irrefutable moral truths fails, as, according to Bonhoeffer, all such systems must, and it leads to neglecting actual moral responsibilities to one’s neighbors.

Their attempt to demonstrate irrefutable moral truths fails, and leads to neglecting actual moral responsibilities to one’s neighbors.

Furthermore, these critics of the death penalty struggle with mercy as well as responsibility. The new natural lawyers abolish mercy in capital cases by declaring that it is unjust to execute anyone. But there is no mercy in letting them live if justice demands that they be spared. Those who would abolish the death penalty for mercy’s sake also eliminate mercy. There is no mercy in agents of the state not doing that which is no longer within their power.

If the death penalty is pre-emptively abolished, then it is no longer mercy to spare murderers, it is simply following the law, and mercy established as law is no longer mercy. Only those who established the law could make a claim to mercy, and it would be an attenuated and impersonal one.

Other criticisms may be added. Lifelong incarceration was generally impractical for most of human history, and historically each village was forced to hang its own. Under such difficulties, the case for the death penalty as a form of self-defense was stronger. Furthermore, the new natural lawyers struggle to adequately reckon with Scripture, in which God enjoins the death penalty, and at times even total war, as well as smiting people directly. In response, they flirt with voluntarism to explain away God acting (and ordering others to act) directly against the basic human good of life.

The Death Penalty Restrains State Violence

None of these arguments, or others that could be made, are dispositive. I do not offer a system of moral philosophy and moral absolutes that is universally demonstrable to all rational persons. Like Bonhoeffer, I consider such to be impossible. Therefore, I do not hope to offer an indisputable case for the death penalty, nor shall I offer the inverse of Hart’s casual dismissal of the understanding of the many saints who have approved of the death penalty.

Nonetheless, reflection on the origins and nature of state violence offer reasons to think that both justice and mercy require the possibility of capital punishment for the worst crimes. The origins of the death penalty are clear enough. Every successful polity rests upon a foundation of state violence, and capital punishment is a continuation of pre- and proto-political violence. As Augustine knew, a conqueror such as Alexander the Great was like a pirate or brigand operating on a grand scale.

Every successful polity rests upon a foundation of state violence, and capital punishment is a continuation of pre- and proto-political violence.

However, establishing the death penalty as part of a system of law ritualizes and may restrain the lethal violence on which governments are founded. Law provides for the possibility of public justice, as opposed to private retribution or warlord justice. In developing the state, the death penalty is part of a codification and regulation of state violence, which may develop into a legal system that aspires to justice and proportionate punishment of the wicked.

However, that the death penalty codifies the violence inherent in establishing a political order does not mean that it should be retained. The new natural lawyers would say that capital punishment is a residual injustice that we should remedy—though, as Feser points out, they do not directly dispute that the death penalty is a justly proportionate punishment for some crimes. Hart concedes the natural justice of the death penalty, but holds that Christians should replace it with mercy.

However, eliminating the death penalty does not abolish lethal state violence. The government will still use force against those who do not comply with its directives, even if it will not deliberately execute them. This may seem to be a moral advance, but it actually disassociates state violence from justice. Genuine self-defense, whether by a private citizen or an agent of the state, is justified, but because the violence used in stopping or restraining someone is imprecise, it is not necessarily just.

It may be justified, in defense of self and others, to fatally shoot a violent lunatic, a fleeing suspect, or a home invader. But these deeds, however justified, are not the administration of justice, which demands deliberate proportionality in punishment—something that is impossible in defensive violence.

The Death Penalty Connects State Violence and Justice

A government dedicated to only using defensive violence will still commit lethal violence that is neither just nor merciful. Only including the death penalty as a proportionate punishment for certain heinous crimes can maintain the connection between justice and lethal state violence. Without this final proportionate response to heinous crimes, there will be only the haphazardly lethal outcomes of defensive violence, including defensive violence used to ensure that lesser punishments are meted out. In such a state the deadly violence necessary to the existence of any polity will be not only accidentally unjust, but intrinsically unjust, as it will never be administered deliberately and proportionately.

Without this final proportionate response to heinous crimes, there will be only the haphazardly lethal outcomes of defensive violence.

To abolish the death penalty is to abdicate the civilizational attempt to instantiate justice in law, and precludes the possibility of mercy. Unless proportionate punishment extends to lethal state violence, then all the deadly violence necessary to state survival will be intrinsically unjust. And unless death is a deserved and possible penalty, there is no mercy in sparing a murderer’s life.

These arguments are not dispositive, and perhaps Christians ought to abandon violence (whether defensive or proportionate punishment) altogether, in an attempt to more fully live the gospel. I find Hart’s emphasis on the radicalism of the gospel and early church more sympathetic than the analytic philosophical precision of the new natural lawyers.

Quietism has an attraction that casuistry does not. And I agree that Christians should be uncomfortable with the violent necessities of keeping such earthly peace as there can be. But does this require Christian quiescence, or might we, like Augustine’s judge, fulfill the responsibilities of earthly life while praying for the heavenly kingdom to come and deliver us from them? Perhaps, no matter what, the only thing we cannot avoid is guilt.

6 Quick Takeaways From Paul Manafort’s Latest Setback In Court,"On Tuesday, federal judge T.S. Ellis refused to toss out criminal charges Special Counsel Robert Mueller had filed against Donald Trump’s former campaign advisor Paul Manafort. Manafort must now stand trial in the Eastern District of Virginia on multiple counts of filing false income tax returns, failing to file reports of foreign bank accounts, and bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.

Manafort also faces charges in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal, making false statements to the Department of Justice, and the most recently added counts charging that Manafort conspired to obstruct justice by attempting to influence a witness.

Here are six quick takeaways from Ellis’ order denying Manafort’s motion to dismiss.

1. Despite His Harsh Words, Ellis Grants Mueller’s License

Judge Ellis’ Tuesday order came a little more than a month after the 78-year-old Ronald Reagan appointee made headlines by excoriating attorneys representing Special Counsel Robert Mueller during a hearing on Manafort’s motion to dismiss the indictment.

“You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort’s bank fraud…You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment or whatever. That’s what you’re really interested in,” Ellis declared during the May 4, 2018 hearing. “And how much is this investigation costing Americans?” Ellis asked, before adding: “What we don’t want in this country is…anyone with unfettered power.”

When Ellis stated from the bench in looking at the indictment that “none of that information has anything to do with links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of Donald Trump,” this caused some to think Manafort stood a chance of having the indictment dismissed. Nope. Not likely, as I explained at the time:

First, on the merits, Manafort will likely lose because, for all of Ellis’ bravado, Rosenstein did grant Mueller broad powers, including the authority to investigate ‘any links . . . between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.’ While Manafort’s time with the Trump team proved transient, his association with the presidential campaign, links with Russia, and work for the government of the Russian-backed Ukrainian president fell within the special counsel’s expansive reach.

In finding Mueller’s investigation of Manafort fell within the authority granted to the special counsel, Ellis applied an identical analysis, writing: “[I]n the May 17 Appointment Order, the Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other things, ‘any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.’ It is undisputed that defendant is an ‘individual[] associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump[;]’ indeed, defendant served as the chairman of President Donald Trump’s campaign from March 2016 until August 2016. Moreover, the Special Counsel’s investigation focused on potential links between defendant and the Russian government.”

2. The Legality of Mueller’s Appointment Is Still Shaky

In denying Manafort’s motion to dismiss, Ellis also made passing mention of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, which requires the president to appoint, and Congress to confirm, “principal officers.” After noting that “the parties do not dispute that the Special Counsel’s appointment was consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution,” Ellis nonetheless mused that the special counsel was not a principal officer, but an “inferior officer,” whom “the Attorney General (or Acting Attorney General) could appoint without running afoul of the Appointments Clause.”

This dicta seemingly conflicts with Professor Steven Calabresi’s conclusion that Mueller’s appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, an argument I cribbed—with credit, of course. So, is a mea culpa due?

No. Ellis is correct in the abstract, but Calabresi’s argument is more nuanced than what the federal judge considered. Manafort “does not argue that the appointment of the Special Counsel violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, so that particular objection need not be addressed in detail here,” Ellis wrote, before adding that “it is worth noting that such an objection would likely fail.”

But the devil is in the details. If those details reveal that Rosenstein has abdicated any real supervisory authority over Mueller, converting him, de facto, into another U.S. attorney, then his appointment would violate the Appointments Clause because only the president can appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate, U.S. attorneys.

3. Ellis Is Entertaining But Also Serious

Ellis’ discussion of the Appointments Clause argument, however, demonstrates that he is a serious jurist, as does the totality of his decision. While his in-court persona proved more entertaining, when it came time to address the important legal issues at stake, Ellis put forth a methodical and tightly reasoned analysis. The serious tone and detailed discussion provide some comfort to Americans of both political stripes that—at least in his courtroom—both Manafort and the special counsel will be given a fair shake.

4. Ellis and Everybody Know It When We See It

Ellis is also no rube and he recognizes that, while justice in his courtroom is blind, the special counsel’s team has eyes . . . only for Trump. And everyone knows it! “Given the investigation’s focus on President Trump’s campaign,” everyone can “see that the true target of the Special Counsel’s investigation is President Trump, not defendant, and that defendant’s prosecution is part of that larger plan,” Ellis wrote. “Specifically, the charges against defendant are intended to induce defendant to cooperate with the Special Counsel by providing evidence against the President or other members of the campaign.”

5. Ellis Schools Americans on the Special Counsel

For Ellis, though, it is not merely Mueller’s squeezing of Manafort that proves problematic: It is the entire special counsel scenario. To prove his point, Ellis walks readers through the history of the special counsel regulations that began “[i]n the wake of Watergate and the so-called Saturday Night Massacre,” when “Congress enacted the first iteration of the independent counsel statute, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.”

It was reauthorized over the years, until the last iteration passed Congress as the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994. Then, in 1999, Congress allowed the independent counsel law to expire when, as Ellis put it, “[b]oth Republicans and Democrats had come to the conclusion that in practice the 1994 Reauthorization Act and its predecessors had become more often a political weapon to be unleashed in the ongoing, indeed escalating culture wars, than a tool for ferreting out and prosecuting crimes ostensibly committed by high-ranking government officials.”

While Congress did away with independent counsels, the Department of Justice adopted special counsel regulations “to replace the procedures set out in the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994.” The same independent counsel flaws now plague the appointment of a special counsel, as Ellis explains:

But the regulations do not require the Special Counsel’s investigation to be limited as to time or budget. Thus, to provide a Special Counsel with a large budget and to tell him or her to find crimes allows a Special Counsel to pursue his or her targets without the usual time and budget constraints facing ordinary prosecutors, encouraging substantial elements of the public to conclude that the Special Counsel is being deployed as a political weapon. Furthermore, although the regulations require the Attorney General to provide a Special Counsel with a factual statement of the matters to be investigated, notably missing from the regulation is any requirement that the Attorney General specify any particular crime or statutes that are believed to have been violated. The failure to specify to the Special Counsel the types of crimes and statutes involved contributes to the public perception that appointment of a Special Counsel is wielded as a political weapon, not as a tool for prosecuting specific crimes believed to have been committed by high-ranking officials as to which the DOJ has a conflict. Furthermore, the Special Counsel regulations’ failure to require identification of specific crimes creates strong incentives for Special Counsel to allege that those individuals have committed criminal acts, even if the criminal acts the Special Counsel ultimately prosecutes are unrelated to the original reasons for appointing the Special Counsel. If a Special Counsel discovers no criminal activity then the investigation is likely to be perceived as a waste of time and resources, and thus a Special Counsel has a strong incentive to find criminality and to prosecute criminal conduct by the people he has been charged with investigating — here persons connected with the Trump campaign.

6. Ellis Has High Hopes, But They’re Perhaps Too High

Yet the law is the law, and no matter the flaws with the special counsel regulations or the appointment of Mueller, “dismissal of the Superseding Indictment on the grounds urged by defendant is not warranted here,” Ellis held. “But that conclusion should not be read as approval of the practice of appointing Special Counsel to prosecute cases of alleged high-level misconduct,” Ellis added before concluding with a final reminder—and hope:

The appointment of special prosecutors has the potential to disrupt these checks and balances, and to inject a level of toxic partisanship into investigation of matters of public importance. This case is a reminder that ultimately, our system of checks and balances and limitations on each branch’s powers, although exquisitely designed, ultimately works only if people of virtue, sensitivity, and courage, not affected by the winds of public opinion, choose to work within the confines of the law. Let us hope that the people in charge of this prosecution, including the Special Counsel and the Assistant Attorney General, are such people. Although this case will continue, those involved should be sensitive to the danger unleashed when political disagreements are transformed into partisan prosecutions.

Regrettably, with Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s recent revelation that at least four members of Mueller’s special counsel team held strong anti-Trump animus, I hold out no hope that “people of virtue, sensitivity, and courage,” are “work[ing] within the confines of the law” in investigating Russia’s interfering with the 2016 presidential election.

"Mexico’s New President Is Not A Threat, But The Collapse Of Mexico Is","Andrés Manuel López Obrador won the Mexican presidency in a landslide election on Sunday. Obrador—or Amlo, as he’s commonly called—is a left-wing populist of the sort common to Latin America. A former mayor of Mexico City who twice ran for president and lost, in 2006 and 2012, the 64-year-old Obrador, who spent decades as a radical outsider in Mexican politics, now finds himself in the seat of power in a country that’s falling apart.

During his populist campaign, the silver-haired Obrador railed against the corruption of incumbent President Enrique Peña Nieto and his the conservative Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which Obrador denounced, not without good reason, as a “mafia of power.” Indeed, under Peña Nieto Mexico’s economy has stagnated and crime has spiraled out of control. It’s not a stretch to say the intertwined crises of poverty, corruption, and crime have driven Mexicans in desperation to elect their first leftist president since 1934.

Conservative media in America have greeted the news with alarm. Writing here at The Federalist on Friday, Helen Raleigh warned that Obrador’s “radical ideas will spell trouble for both Mexico and the U.S.,” citing his affinity for socialist dictators like Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro. His positive view of illegal immigration to the United States could precipitate “a surge of illegal crossings at our southern borders.”

Concerns about Obrador and the border are especially acute among conservatives. Victor Davis Hanson declared last week in National Review that Americans should be concerned about Obrador because he is “anti-American” and will position Mexico as an “aggressor” by promoting the notion that Mexicans have a “human right” to illegally enter the United States.

Beyond illegal immigration, conservatives fear Obrador’s socialist tendencies. The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal warned Friday that an Obrador victory would cause Mexico to “slide backward,” undoing the economic progress of recent decades and undermining Mexico’s rising middle class. Fears of a leftist Mexican president have been echoed by The Daily Caller, Fox News, and even Sen. John McCain.

A Deep Crisis South Of The Border

But Obrador is no Fidel Castro—or even a Chávez or Maduro. The problem with all these conservative analyses is that they ascribe far more agency and ability to Mexico’s president and central government than is warranted. The Mexican state as it exists is almost entirely incapable of the sort of strategic vision and planning that Obrador’s detractors in the American press ascribe to it. Conservatives with hawkish views on immigration especially write about Mexico as if it’s a healthy, functioning country with control over its own borders, north and south, not a place where civil society is in a state of collapse.

Hanson nods toward this reality, noting that “drug cartels all but run the country on the basis of their enormous profits from unfettered dope-running and human-trafficking into the United States.” Yet the thrust of his argument is that Obrador represents a serious threat—as if the Mexican state is in control of the country in a meaningful way.

By all accounts, it is not. Last week, the Associated Press reported on the rise of “mass crimes” throughout Mexico, in which “whole neighborhoods [defy] police and military personnel,” stealing freight trains full of merchandise or illegally tapping fuel pipelines. Much of the crime is reportedly driven by widespread despair and disgust for the government among common people, which powerful criminal syndicates are exploiting:

‘The logic of the people is that they see politicians and officials stealing big time … and they see themselves as having the same right to steal as the big-time politicians,’ said Edgardo Buscaglia, an international crime expert and research fellow at Columbia University. ‘You begin to create an ethical code in which, ‘If the upper-class people can steal and get away with it, we can steal, too, with complete justification.’’



In May, armed men broke the locks on two supermarkets in the southern city of Arcelia in Guerrero state and allowed local residents in to loot them. Police didn’t show up for hours.



Guerrero security spokesman Roberto Alvarez said the stores’ owners had refused extortion demands from a local splinter of La Familia cartel and the looting was punishment for not paying.

Cartels across the country no longer limit their activities to drug smuggling or human trafficking, but have branched out into fuel theft, illegal fishing, mining, and logging. Ordinary Mexicans, especially those in rural areas, are often left with few options except to work for cartels, sometimes growing opium poppies or working as lookouts and drug mules. In some parts of the country, the “social controls” that might prevent mass crimes are simply gone, drawing comparisons to places like Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Somalia.

Meanwhile, violence is rampant across the country and on track for a record number of homicides this year. In the state of Guanajuato, an agricultural and manufacturing hub northwest of Mexico City that had one of the lowest murder rates in 2010, there were more than 2,000 execution-style killings last year and more than 1,000 in the first four months of this year. In 2007, there were only 51.

Mexico Is Becoming Ungovernable

None of this is to say that Americans shouldn’t be interested or concerned about who is president of Mexico. Indeed, it would behoove all Americans—and especially policymakers in Washington—to pay more attention to our southern neighbor’s health and state of affairs. But the most important question about Mexico is not whether a left-wing populist is president, it is whether the Mexican state, under any president, can govern the country.

Obrador has been elected on a litany of impossible promises and flimsy socialist rhetoric one would expect from any Latin American leftist. But he is unlikely to unleash a Chavez-style takeover of the economy or summarily withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Indeed, Obrador has significantly diluted his opposition to NAFTA and has campaigned on moderate, if vague, economic policies.

Whatever risks Obrador presents, the far greater problem is that Mexico is becoming ungovernable—a failed state with which we share a 2,000-mile border. If we think the growing chaos and unrest south of the border will not spill over into the United States, we’re deluding ourselves. It has in fact already spilled over, and is now only a matter of severity.

If we continue to ignore the collapse of our southern neighbors and maintain our longstanding—and misbegotten—policy of benign neglect, we should expect the flow of illegal immigrants and families seeking amnesty to number not in the tens of thousands but in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps the millions. At that point, U.S. policymakers and American voters must regard the crisis for what it is: a foreign policy and national security matter, not a proxy for domestic political disputes and our never-ending culture war.

Make no mistake, it won’t be Obrador’s populist rhetoric or left-leaning governance that brings on such a crisis, it will be the ongoing collapse of civil society in Mexico and Central America. It won’t matter what Obrador says or does, because he will not be in control.

True Crime Drama ‘Gosnell’ Backed By $2 Million In Crowdfunding,"“Gosnell: The Trial of America’s Biggest Serial Killer” has traversed a far longer road to release than its producers ever expected. The true crime drama follows a Philadelphia narcotics investigator (Dean Cain) who stumbles upon a serial killer operating near the local university.

Nick Searcy, whose decades of acting roles include this year’s Academy Award winner “The Shape of Water,” directs the feature film also starring Sarah Jane Morris (“Coyote Ugly”) and Earl Billings (“Con Air”). “Gosnell” will open in theaters on October 12.

This impressive roster belies the challenges this production has faced since it started in 2013. An initial crowdfunding campaign was yanked due to the subject matter. Some actors walked from the project. When producers compiled their research on the case as a book, The New York Times refused to rank it as a bestseller.

Once the producers shopped the finished movie around Hollywood, distributors were cagey. “Each one would say: ‘Great, important film—just too controversial for us,’” says producer Phelim McAleer in a phone interview. “It’s been one thing after another.”

They finally secured a national release last year. Then, in a move the media called “highly unusual,” the Philadelphia judge on the case sued them to stop its release. “All we can say about that is that it was resolved,” producer Ann McElhinney tells The Federalist. “Unfortunately, that’s all we can say.”

Their own investigation, and now dramatization, of the case speaks for itself—including why so many in power don’t want this story to be made public.

True Crime, Appalling Horrors

In 2010, as the opioid crisis was accelerating, reports surfaced of a Philadelphia abortion provider selling prescriptions for narcotics to drug dealers. A task force of Drug Enforcement Administration agents and local cops soon conducted a raid.

“They went in on a drug warrant, and found out much more was going on,” says McAleer, a veteran journalist. “Dead bodies were coming out of this clinic. Women were being maimed and complaints were being made. Yet he was very respectable, upper middle class. America’s biggest serial killer operated in plain sight.”

In 2013, a jury convicted Kermit Gosnell of three murders and more than 200 counts of violating state abortion laws. Among his victims was 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, a refugee from Nepal who came to his clinic for an abortion.

She died of a drug overdose administered by unlicensed workers. Prosecutors revealed that Gosnell specialized in partial-birth abortion, a procedure banned by a 2003 federal law (later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court). Gosnell is currently serving three consecutive life sentences in a state prison.

“The bureaucrats were told from higher-ups that abortion clinics were ‘sacred spaces,’” recalls McAleer. “They couldn’t be touched. This originally started with Governor Tom Ridge, who ran as a pro-choice Republican. He stopped the inspections of abortion clinics and the Democrats just continued that policy.”

The political role reversal was one of several factors that made the Irish journalist, previously a writer for The Economist and The Financial Times, curious enough to book a trip to see the Philadelphia case unfold.

“When I went into the courtroom, I saw horrendous photographs and evidence,” he continues. “But the most shocking thing of all was when I looked behind me and saw the empty press benches. In modern-day America, so crime-obsessed, this was somehow a non-story?”

His partner McElhinney finishes the thought. “This is exactly what journalists are meant to get excited about covering,” she says. “But we had crickets in the press.” When columnist Kirsten Powers wrote in USA Today on Gosnell, some outlets were shamed into covering his crimes against humanity. Then the story quickly faded.

Why No Interest In A Salacious Story?

In recent years, true-crime drama has become a hub of cultural buzz. Top-rated FX anthology series “American Crime Story” exemplifies the trend. Over two seasons, it has dramatized the investigations of crime suspect O.J. Simpson and murder victim Gianni Versace, diving deep into their trials, both personal and in the courtroom.

Scripted and documentary crime dramas have proven ideal for Netflix. After “Making a Murderer” became a binge-watching obsession in 2016, several shows such as “Mindhunter” and “The Staircase” soon followed.

On the big screen, director Quentin Tarantino has cast Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in his take on infamous serial killer Charles Manson. Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” is currently filming near Los Angeles.

Hallmarks of the genre are on display in the Gosnell case, notably how many local players turned a blind eye to his crimes. “Insurance companies knew, lawyers knew, politicians knew, bureaucrats knew, even some police officers knew,” says McAleer. “You have a political and media cover-up on multiple levels over decades.”

McAleer and McElhinney became documentary filmmakers in the past decade. Their successful films have explored controversies surrounding hydraulic fracking, environmental activism and other hot-button topics.

Initially, McAleer couldn’t sell his partner on making their next film a crime drama, especially about abortion. The subject matter was too offputting for her. Then boxes of trial transcripts arrived at their production office. “We started reading them, and it was a very swift conversion,” says McElhinney.

“The actual stories of the children who died in that clinic are shocking,” she continues. “The testimony of witnesses to what went on there is horrific. Then the Department of Health hadn’t inspected the clinic in 17 years, despite the fact that two women had died? It’s the kind of stuff you can’t even begin to believe.”

They had a compelling story. But could their project make it through production?

Their Unexpected Challenges

Since their past films were funded via Kickstarter, the producers planned to once again use the popular crowdfunding platform. They submitted their campaign to Kickstarter and days passed, despite the site’s 48-hour commitment to respond.

“It really screwed us up,” says McAleer, recalling the long wait. “When we pressed them, they said our campaign offends Kickstarter’s community values.” McElhinney elaborates: “They wanted everything about the story out,” she says. “This doctor was convicted of murdering and stabbing babies. Yet they wanted those facts out. It didn’t make sense.”

Their campaign moved to Indiegogo and raised more than $2 million in 45 days, setting a new record for the site. The producers got to work interviewing involved law enforcement officers, witnesses, jury members, and even Gosnell himself. They brought on screenwriter Andrew Klavan, producer of the Clint Eastwood-directed “True Crime,” among other films, to write the script.

“Much of the film, including the trial evidence, is verbatim and directly from the actual transcripts and interviews,” McAleer says.

Known for his lead role on FX’s “Justified,” Searcy soon signed on as director. Dean Cain, star of the 1990’s show “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,” was enthusiastic about the story. He met his real-life counterpart when detective Jim Woods visited the movie set. Assistant district attorney Christine Wechsler, portrayed by Sarah Jane Morris, also saw the work in progress.

Smaller roles were harder to lock down. “We had a few actors on-board, and they seemed all for it,” says McAleer. “But they came under pressure from leftist Hollywood that they shouldn’t do this film. Hollywood is a community that’s supposed to value controversy, but they didn’t want to promote what they saw as a different ideology.”

“Really what they didn’t want is the truth.”

The Great Divide in American Politics

McElhinney recalls a telling conversation from five years ago, at the start of the “Gosnell” project. “Someone pulled me aside and said, ‘You think you’ve seen controversy and angry people before? You ain’t seen nothing until you touch this issue.’ It’s true, we’ve never experienced this kind of hostility.”

Gallup reports Americans are evenly split on the issue of abortion laws. A Daily Beast columnist contends that, “Every political fight will eventually be an abortion fight.” The filmmakers believe a lack of knowledge plays into this great divide.

‘One of the things we’ve learned through doing this is how little people know about abortion.’

“One of the things we’ve learned through doing this is how little people know about abortion,” said McElhinney on The Federalist Radio Hour last year. “It’s actually a compliment to Planned Parenthood. They’re very clever. They’ve managed to do a thing where no one in America knows the laws on abortion. Even very few pro-life people know that you can have an abortion at nine months.”

She compares U.S. abortion policies to those of North Korea and China, for allowing abortions until the babies are born. This statistic was regularly cited — and fact-checked by even the Washington Post as true — during this spring’s debate over the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The law, which passed the House and was rejected by the Senate, would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of fetal development in the womb.

In a recent phone interview, McElhinney notes the two female assistant district attorneys on the Gosnell case: “They are both mothers, both sharp, professional women,” she says. “They did not know the law on abortion in Pennsylvania, which can take place up to six months. All the jury members we spoke to didn’t know either. When they found out, they thought the law should change.”

With another Supreme Court nomination fight consuming Washington this fall, the politics of abortion will once again be front and center. The filmmakers are seeking to cross partisan lines and present a cultural narrative to truth-seekers of all stripes.

“The film I directed @GosnellMovie does not push an agenda,” stated Searcy in a recent series of tweets. “It tells the truth about an event that happened, and allows the audience to make up their own minds about what they think about it.”

“It is neither pro-life nor pro-choice; both sides will enjoy and learn from the film.”

Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, “Gosnell: The Trial of America’s Biggest Serial Killer” will release in theaters nationwide on October 12.

"If Maria Butina Was A Russian Spy, She Was Terrible At It","Maria Butina wanted to see Mount Rushmore. A Russian gun-rights advocate, she had come to the United States in the spring of 2014 to attend the annual conference of the National Rifle Association in Indianapolis, where she rang the NRA’s replica of the Liberty Bell to open a day’s sessions. She decided to use the rest of her American visit to see the touristy sights: the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, and the like, including, naturally, the faces carved on Mount Rushmore.

Maria was escorted on her travels by the Republican activist and South Dakota businessman Paul Erickson. Since he was planning to visit my family on that trip to the Black Hills, he brought her along for a dinner of buffalo steaks at my parents’ house.

The company was good, the conversation lively. I quoted to her Robert Heinlein’s line that an armed society is a polite society, and she laughed. Americans are so friendly, she told me, but not deep. In Russia, when someone asks how you are, they expect long, detailed, and philosophical answers, not the American reply of “Good. How are you?”

Maria and I seemed to hit it off that night, enough anyway that after several drinks, she leaned over to hug me and tell me I had the soul of a Russian. She came back to America over the coming years, meeting far more famous and influential people, attending graduate school at American University, and, as of July 16, being indicted by the Justice Department for the federal crime of failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign power.

If the indictment and FBI affidavit are any guide, the now 29-year-old has been working the whole time for the man she called her “funder,” the Russian billionaire Aleksandr Torshin, an ostensibly retired oligarch reported to have close ties to the Kremlin. Of course, if the information released thus far about her indictment is any guide, she also doesn’t seem to have committed much of a crime.

Over the past few weeks, from the New York Times to Mother Jones, the Washington Post to GQ, Fox News to NBC, the media has been overflowing with reports about her. Nearly every report has a kind of breathless quality, a suggestion that a straight line connects Butina’s efforts to meet powerful people with Trump’s assumed collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election.

Add a salacious element of sexual shenanigans, the connection with the NRA, and her indictment’s proximity to the recently announced indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officials, and the story almost writes itself. She is a spy, you see. She is the missing link that ties together everything bad, from guns to Trump, all in a neat Russian bow.

For a spy, however, she doesn’t seem to have been any good. Butina obtained no secret information, failed to bring about any actual meetings for senior Russians, and communicated with her alleged handlers via Twitter messages and unsecured email. It’s hard to believe that anybody is this bad a spy. The public evidence so far of her supposed spying suggests she wasn’t actually spying.

She wanted to meet influential people, apparently at the behest of her Russian backer, which is not a crime. She also apparently wanted to influence those influential people, which could be a crime for an unregistered foreign agent. But what we don’t have is evidence that she actually succeeded in influencing anyone.

Not necessarily for lack of trying. She is alleged to have sent Torshin a picture of herself on the street at Trump’s inauguration, along with thousands of other people, which prompted Torshin to reply, “You’re a daredevil girl! What can I say!”

She posed with automatics and skimpy clothing for the Russian version of GQ magazine, and Torshin told her she had “upstaged” the sultry Russian spy Anna Chapman, arrested in New York in 2010. Chapman “poses with toy pistols, while you are being published with real ones,” he noted with satisfaction.

Butina also made the news in January 2018, when The New York Times breathlessly circulated the short-lived rumor that she had been the conduit through which the Russian government could have funneled millions of dollars to the NRA to help finance a pro-Trump advertising push during the election. The rumor died when further investigation found no public evidence that Russians funneled millions of dollars through the NRA to Trump.

Perhaps more to the point, the publicity might have pleased Torshin, but it would have made any actual spying far more difficult. Still, that brief-lived story suggested the reason for the torrent of news stories that have followed Maria’s indictment: It all feels as though, somehow, it ties together the NRA, Russia, and the Republicans’ unlikely 2016 victory.

In truth, all the evidence revealed so far points indicates Butina probably wasn’t a spy or even much of a successful agent of a foreign power. Strip from her story all the other narratives floating around these days in American politics, and she seems mostly to be a recognizable type.

Maria looks basically like a young woman on the make. She wanted to meet powerful people and be thought of as someone important. She convinced Torshin to finance her while she did it. She got to speak at Republican events, from a summer camp in South Dakota to panel discussions on gun rights in Washington DC. She got invited to events. She could persuade herself that she was helping paint Russia in a good light, while she got her graduate degree paid for.

It was all exciting and fun, thrilling for a young woman. Possibly it crossed some lines into the crime of being an unregistered agent, but spying isn’t the name for it.

Of course, even if she was primarily a young woman looking to advance herself, that doesn’t preclude her reporting back to her funder in Russia and him passing her reports to Russian authorities. It doesn’t seem intelligent for spies to use Twitter messages for secret communiqués, but it is difficult to prove a negative and demonstrate that she was not a spy. Still, the narrative being built around her doesn’t seem to fit the young woman I met.

In a way, she was better off pursuing that ambition in the United States than in Russia, even if it did end up getting her indicted. Her conversation at dinner back in 2014 was certainly not opposed to Vladimir Putin, but it wasn’t much in praise of the man either. Running a pro-gun organization in an autocracy is dangerous business. Guns, she told me, are the citizens’ last defense against tyranny. Left unsaid was that the tyrant in question was Putin.

Even while we drank together, I could sense that she was looking for a different path for her life.

"Yes, Trump Could Pardon Himself, But It Would Be Self-Defeating","Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court is showing that, in one area at least, the Trump administration has done an excellent job of vetting its appointees. How can you tell? Look at the quality of attacks on the man, which so far have focused mainly on how much credit card debt he incurred in buying baseball tickets.

Even most policy-based objections are no more than the hyperbole prepared in advance of any Republican president’s nominee. There is one objection from the Left, however, that relates to Kavanaugh’s legal scholarship: his opinions about whether a sitting president should be indicted while in office.

President Trump added fuel to the fire on a similar issue when he tweeted last month that “As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?”

Does the president have the right to pardon himself? Is he immune from prosecution? Is he, as his detractors have claimed, attempting to put himself above the law? And is Kavanaugh’s nomination intended to bolster Trump’s defenses from the Robert Mueller investigation? The answers are more complicated and uncertain than either side is willing to admit.

Prospects for a President’s Subpoenas and Testimony

Even before reaching the special prosecutor’s ability to charge the president with a crime, we have to consider how much Mueller can force Trump to comply with an investigation without his consent. Although the president has more leeway than an ordinary citizen, there is little reason to believe that he is immune from all pre-trial discovery requests.

It is not unprecedented for a president to testify under oath in an investigation of his own administration. In 1876, President Ulysses Grant agreed to issue a sworn affidavit in the investigation of his corrupt private secretary, Orville Babcock. Grant chose to comply, hoping his words would clear Babcock’s name, but later presidents have had to obey subpoenas they would rather have avoided.

When special prosecutor Leon Jaworski subpoenaed tapes and documents related to the Watergate investigation in 1973, the Supreme Court held in United States v. Nixon that the president must hand them over, subject to certain safeguards. One of the accusations against Kavanaugh is that he would overturn Nixon, which was decided by an 8-0 majority in 1974. But his objection to the case was not that the Supreme Court decided wrongly, but that it decided at all.

Nixon was one in a series of changes to the political question doctrine, a theory by which courts used to stay out of disputes that the Constitution dedicates to the political branches. Whether Kavanaugh disagrees with the precedent in Nixon or not (he only commented that “maybe” it was wrong,) the point was that the Supreme Court stepped into something that it once would have stayed out of.

It was not the last time they would do so. Jaworski wanted items, not testimony, an important distinction when considering the effect such a request has on the president. During the Clinton administration, the subject arose again. President Clinton claimed immunity from all civil suits during his term in office, but the Supreme Court in Clinton v. Jones thought that went too far. While expressing concern over the extent to which a civil suit might place unreasonable demands on the president’s limited time, they allowed the request to go forward. Given the boatload of civil suits currently filed against President Trump, the Supreme Court may have reason to reconsider that assumption.

Clinton also testified before a grand jury in the Jones case but, as with Grant’s testimony, it was voluntary, so the courts never had to reach a decision on whether such testimony by a president may be compelled. In this, Clinton protected some of the privileges of the office. Had he refused to testify, the courts may have compelled him to do so, which would have created a precedent to bind all future administrations. By consenting to appear, he lost the fight on that case but preserved the privilege for future presidents, including Trump.

Kavanaugh never objected to the mere investigation of a president and is unlikely to do so. As a young lawyer, he worked on the very investigation of Clinton that led to the ruling in Jones.

It is easy to see how the principle laid out in Jones could be abused, and a president tied down like Gulliver by the strands of a thousand frivolous Lilliputian suits against him. That said, the status of the Mueller investigation as a government action by a specially appointed prosecutor suggests that courts might give Mueller’s requests for testimony more weight since they are unlikely to set the precedent for other less worthy suits by various plaintiffs.

Trump might be able to limit discovery requests, but it is unlikely he would be able to avoid them completely. As to demands for his testimony, the law is unclear, but he might be better off agreeing to testify under negotiated conditions, rather than refusing and risking the courts deciding against him.

The Prospects for Jailing a President

Let’s take the question a step further: if Mueller or any other prosecutor discovers evidence that the president committed a crime, what happens next? Can he be indicted? Arrested? Jailed? There has been a great deal of disagreement about this question, and the Constitution provides no explicit answer.

Kavanaugh has been pilloried on the Left for allegedly suggesting that a sitting president could not be indicted. But consider the source: in the 2009 law review article from which his opponents draw their conclusions, Kavanaugh merely suggests that presidents should be immune from civil suits and indictments. In fact, he goes out of his way to say that Clinton v. Jones may well have been correctly decided to the extent that it said the president is not immune from civil suits.

On the issue of indictment, which has not been before the court, he simply offers his thoughts on a good policy for Congress to enact. “The indictment and trial of a sitting President,” he writes, “would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.”

These are political ideas, not constitutional interpretations. While some judges confuse the two, Kavanaugh is a judicial conservative who knows that his policy preferences and the U.S. Constitution are not the same thing.

Prosecutors may be less willing to cut the president some slack, especially prosecutors elected in jurisdictions are hostile to the current head of state.

Where serious crimes would almost always result in impeachment and conviction, lesser offenses are unlikely to have the same result. Congress exercises some discretion in choosing only to use the impeachment process for serious offenses, although what constitutes a serious offense is inherently a political judgment.

Prosecutors may be less willing to cut the president some slack, especially prosecutors elected in jurisdictions are hostile to the current head of state. The New York attorney general’s office has already shown willingness to investigate Trump’s charity organization and has sued over alleged violations of law. These are civil, not criminal charges, but success in one court may encourage them to seek justice, as they see it, in another.

Could the government function if the president were sitting in a state prison? How could federal law be supreme over state law if the federal chief executive were allowed to be imprisoned by one of them? It is not specifically banned by the Constitution, but it makes a mockery of our system of federalism.

If you don’t particularly care about that, or you think President Trump is especially odious and wouldn’t mind seeing him in jail, bear in mind that allowing a president to be jailed is not something that would only happen once. Consider the time President Barack Obama ordered an American citizen to be killed without trial. That sounds like something a politically motivated prosecutor could make a lot of hay out of, and in parts of this country such an action could be very popular.

Allowing a president to be jailed is not something that would only happen once.

If you’ve forgotten about this incident—understandable, since the press virtually ignored this angle of the story—the killing in question was a drone strike against Anwar al-Awlaki that Obama ordered in 2011. Al-Awlaki was, unquestionably, a bad guy. He was a recruiter for al-Qaeda and the spiritual advisor of Nidal Hassan, the terrorist who killed 13 people in the Fort hood massacre.

He was also, unfortunately, a native-born U.S. citizen born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where he spent the first seven years of his life. Al-Awlaki deserved execution, but American citizens are also entitled to due process of law. If he had been legally stripped of his citizenship, as Rep. Charlie Dent proposed in 2010, the legal uncertainty might have been avoided. Instead, the Obama administration chose to kill an American without due process.

That is arguably a greater crime than any Trump has ever committed, even if the victim richly deserved his fate. Yet no prosecutor brought a charge against Obama, or even against any member of his administration. This is likely due, in part, to the fact that no prosecutor is anxious to defend a terrorist’s rights, but also due to the custom that has developed against indicting sitting presidents.

The Prospects for Self-Pardon

Even if the president cannot be indicted or imprisoned while in office, that does not foreclose the possibility of him being convicted of a crime after he leaves office. That much is clear in the Constitution’s text: “Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” Once a president leaves office, any protection he may have no longer applies.

The power to pardon crimes was meant to be sweeping.

But can Trump pardon himself of any alleged crimes, as he said in his tweet? Again, the Constitution is not verbose on the topic, but in this case the silence itself speaks volumes. Article II, section 2, clause 1 states with regard to pardons that the president “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”

The Constitution grants a broad power with just one limitation. That still leaves a tremendously broad range of pardoning power. Moreover, the fact that the Framers added one limitation but not others means that they knew some limit was necessary but only chose to impose that one. This was not an oversight; the power to pardon crimes was meant to be sweeping.

A recent Vox article surveyed various experts on this question, and the results were mixed. The quality of the answers, though, was revealing. Those who replied that the president could self-pardon focused on the text; those who said he couldn’t talked about how outrageous and wrong it would be.

Good Law, Bad Politics

They are both correct, in a way. It would be outrageous, but it is also not barred by the Constitution. That is an important distinction. As much as many of us revere that document and the men who wrote it, it is not a comprehensive list of right and wrong behavior. The government has powers under it that may be used in ways that don’t fit personal morals. That makes them wrong, perhaps, but not illegal. As in the case of presidential indictments, Kavanaugh is the sort of judge who understands that distinction.

If Trump were to pardon himself, he would avoid jail time but would have admitted to the entire country that he was a criminal.

Trump grasps the problem with the self-pardon when he tweets “why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?” This is the trap of the pardon and, maybe, the reason self-pardons need not be banned: acceptance of a pardon constitutes an admission of guilt. If Trump were to pardon himself, he would avoid jail time but would have admitted to the entire country that he was a criminal.

Maybe that doesn’t matter. Who cares what they call him if he gets away with it, right? But Trump would still be in office and still have to face the one thing the pardon cannot wash away: impeachment. Right now, that is no great threat. Even if Mueller’s eventual findings demonstrate some alleged criminal behavior by the president himself, his actual guilt would still be a matter of debate. He would maintain his innocence, and his supporters might believe him and use that to justify voting against impeachment.

That argument falls to pieces after a self-pardon. Trump’s defenders in Congress would go from defending a possibly guilty man to defending an admitted criminal who wants to get off scot-free. We believe that a man is innocent until proven guilty, but one who admits his guilt has a much harder time garnering his countrymen’s sympathies. A president who takes a self-pardon is a dead duck electorally and in the inevitable impeachment trial.

All of this goes to show that law and politics diverge on these questions. There are probably ways for the president to avoid testifying in the Mueller investigation, and there are almost certainly ways to avoid indictment or arrest. Even if he is accused without being charged, he can avoid jail with the stroke of a pen. These things are legally true, but they bear a tremendous political cost, and Trump knows it.

Kavanaugh’s nomination does not change that political and legal reality. A self-pardon is legal and would keep Trump out of jail, but it would be the end of his presidency.

"In The Latest Issue, Batman Isn’t An Atheist. He’s An Episcopalian","Spoilers ahead.

If you look hard enough, you’ll find support for all your positions in every bit of pop culture that comes around. Such is the case with the latest issue of “Batman,” in which, the internet tells us, we discover that Batman is an atheist.

Perusing various articles under permutations of the headline “DC Confirms Batman’s An Atheist,” we find the same arguments, all of which hinge on one line early in the issue and a healthy dose of projection. Batman is about science and rational thought, you see. Plus, when he’s asked if he believes in God, he replies, “I used to.”

Case closed, and we didn’t even have to read past page two! Given that Batman was most likely Episcopalian prior to leaving the faith, that’s fitting. As the joke goes, you know an Episcopalian is serious when he gets out the Bible. That is why I, an Episcopalian in good standing, didn’t get out my Bible, but did actually read the issue. (It’s much shorter than the Bible, for starters, so it didn’t interfere too much with my Sunday.)

In it, we find that Batman—that is, Bruce Wayne—definitely doesn’t subscribe to any faith tradition, although he did spend time wandering around, vaguely looking for transcendence and flirting with Buddhism. Instead of faith, he found the bat, which became his faith.

That’s a little more interdenominational than the Episcopal Church normally is, but it probably fits in the small-c catholic tradition. Also, he doesn’t go to church. In other words, whatever he wants to claim, Batman is still an Episcopalian.

The Case for Batman Being an Episcopalian

He’s affluent, he’s influential, and he isn’t averse to tippling when he’s not on duty. (You know what they say, whenever you find four Episcopalians, you’ll find a fifth.) Granted, the whole fighting crime thing, which involves both “fighting” and “crime,” isn’t super cool and most parishes would probably turn him away if they knew the truth of his identity. On the other hand, with membership at many parishes declining, a parishioner with especially deep pockets would probably get some leeway. He’d need to be cool on discussing his particular views about justice, though.

On the other, other hand, there is the passage from the Bible about being as wise as a serpent and as gentle as a dove, so maybe Batman fits right in. That’s pretty deep in, however. One has to read all the way into the New Testament—the book of Matthew, to be precise—so it can be forgiven if the other parishioners weren’t aware of that particular admonition.

But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. If Batman is about to become the C.S. Lewis of crime-fighting due to the crisis of faith evinced, that plotline isn’t evident in Issue 53. What is evident, however, is that while that crisis is central to the issue, reducing it to “Batman’s an atheist” is a superheroically simplistic reading.

Instead, we see that Wayne has stopped believing in Batman, in himself. He’s lost touch with his roots, the ones planted when he chose a life of fighting crime. Batman went too far in apprehending Freeze and found his way onto Freeze’s jury—as Bruce Wayne, of course—to ensure Freeze would be found not guilty. He didn’t do so because Freeze was innocent, but because Freeze still deserved justice, which Batman had not afforded him.

The Sins of Pride, Idols, and Probably More

Batman had not just abandoned his parents’ religion, but begun behaving as though he were God. Of himself, he said, “If you define God as the infallible, the responsible … the one who determines life and death. Then yes, that is my argument. I thought he was God.” I suppose that is one form of atheism, although it’s not the traditionally accepted definition.

That was Wayne’s crisis of faith. He exalted himself before all others; he even prayed to himself. Then, suddenly, he was no longer there. The spirit abandoned the son, leaving him to wander Gotham as before, but without the belief.

“He does not provide solace from pain. He cannot give you hope for the eternal,” Wayne continues, in his attempt to convince the other jurors. “He cannot comfort you for the love you lost. God blesses your soul with grace. Batman punches people in the face.” (So maybe that C.S. Lewis-style conversion and crossover is possible still.)

Except that’s not how it ends, either. To suggest so would be a projection not based on the text too heavy a lift for even an Episcopalian. No, Wayne isn’t getting ready to get up on Sunday morning and head to his local parish, any more than the issue “confirms” that he’s an atheist. His crisis is in himself.

The Power of Positive, Batman-Style Thinking

After the jury finds Freeze not guilty, Wayne tells Alfred to fetch his original suit. “Alfred, I’m lost. I need to remember who I am.” The issue closes with a passage from the Bible’s book of Job, one Wayne referenced during jury deliberations, which also doesn’t paint a picture of a man about to return to the flock.

“Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, and said, naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; Blessed be the name of the Lord.”

Omitted is the line that follows those: “In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.” Given Job had dared to question God, it was crucial to Job’s conversion. Omitting it may be stylistic or a nod to the humanity Wayne expressed while talking to his fellow jurors. He realized he was not a god, definitely not God, and that he was all too fallible and prone to sin, even if it was in his own name.

So Batman’s an atheist? Sure, why not? As a friend wryly noted, that wouldn’t be much of a change from his previous faith anyway. Since there aren’t any signs that he’s about to forego the symbols from that previous faith—particularly for funerals, which he does attend—we can probably just keep counting him when counting the broader membership numbers.

Even if he’s a nonbeliever and doesn’t attend, he does still believe in the laws of man and, presumably, historic preservation, as good Episcopalians do. He just needs to remember the power of a forgotten icon, and he’ll be back to himself in no time.

Until then, some number of us will be there most Sundays, waiting. We’re the denomination he deserves, if not the one he needs right now.

6 Takeaways About Paul Manafort And Michael Cohen’s Legal Woes,"Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was found by a jury to be guilty on eight fraud charges yesterday. At roughly the same time, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of personal income tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution to get a loan, and two counts related to illegal campaign contributions. Manfort’s case is being handled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office. Mueller spun off the Cohen case to federal prosecutors with the Southern District of New York.

The special counsel was ostensibly appointed and given unlimited funds and wide-reaching powers to investigate allegations of treasonous collusion with Russia by President Trump to steal the 2016 election. It was the continuation of an FBI investigation into the Trump campaign that used human informants, wiretaps, national security letters, and other surveillance.

While no treasonous collusion between Russia and Trump has been unveiled despite two years of thorough investigation, the special counsel has rung up Trump associates for lying to the FBI, as well as various crimes unrelated to Trump or Russia. Mueller also indicted some Russian corporations for crimes related to low-level election meddling and Russian military intelligence officials for hacks of Democratic officials’ emails.

Here are six takeaways from yesterday’s news.

1. Nothing To Do With Russia

President Trump insists he never colluded with Russia to steal an election. He claims the Russia investigation is a “witch hunt.” Yesterday, various members of the Resistance, including Never Trump members and some voices in the media, mocked the notion of a witch hunt on the grounds that Manafort and Cohen had been found or pleaded guilty to crimes unrelated to Russia collusion. For example:

First off, witch hunts are routinely “successful” by this standard. During the Salem Witch Hunt, for example, more than 200 people were accused, 20 were executed, and 5 died in prison. More recently, countless people were accused and plenty of people were convicted during the day-care hysteria of the 1980s and 1990s, and many had their cases overturned and were compensated for their time in prison. We use the term to describe bouts of paranoia and injustice. Successful convictions and even executions don’t debunk the claim of a witch hunt, though they can support the claim.

Even with the pace and vigor of the Mueller investigation, we’re unlikely to reach the numbers our forbears attained in their witch hunts. All of which to say, at this point, even the dimmer members of the Resistance should know that “witch hunt” refers not to finding bad Russians, or shady Americans, but to the orchestrated campaign of suggesting Trump is a “Salem witch” who treasonously colluded with Russians to steal election.

The Washington Post called the Manafort conviction “a major if not complete victory for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as he continues to investigate the president’s associates.” Voices claiming that the Manafort and Cohen legal problems vindicate Mueller should note that the Manafort conviction had literally nothing to do with Mueller’s charge of investigating collusion with Russia to steal an election, and not just because the charges predate Trump.

Mueller has been throwing the book at Manafort, presumably in hopes he’d spill the beans on Russia collusion. Facing decades in prison, he has not been able to provide Mueller anything supporting the claim. Cohen’s attorney Lanny Davis has talked a big game about help he can provide Mueller the goods for the theory, but even Mueller didn’t seem to think the Cohen case was worth hanging on to. And he kept Manafort, so that’s saying something.

When federal prosecutors induced Cohen to plead out after poring over his finances and legal work, the most they got from him was to claim that non-disclosure agreements he arranged with two women were actually campaign contributions. He didn’t cop to anything in the dossier that has undergirded the Russia investigation — not an alleged visit to Prague to arrange treasonous collusion, nor any involvement with the hacking of Democratic emails.

Still, Andrew McCarthy suggests the entire reason Mueller held onto the Manafort case was so he could squeeze him on Trump-Russia collusion. That remains the optimistic vision for the Resistance.

As Byron York notes, “The importance of the financial crimes case against Manafort was never the financial crimes themselves. It was the prosecutors’ hope that, by charging the hell out of the offenses alleged, by playing hardball with the defendant with a guns-drawn-at-dawn search-warrant raid, by jailing him over a debatable obstruction of justice charge that Manafort could be pressured into spilling what prosecutors apparently thought were a lot of beans about the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election.”

He notes that as of this date, there is still no support for the theory from Manafort, national security adviser Michael Flynn, or deputy campaign manager and Manafort aide Rick Gates, all of whom have been investigated and charged with crimes, and that none of those crimes included a Trump-Russia conspiracy. As York put it, “Could such a conspiracy exist, and Flynn and Gates be totally out of it?”

2. Fraud Is Bad

Although the charges have nothing to do with Russia, that doesn’t mean Manafort and Cohen aren’t shady and corrupt. Had they not lied on their tax returns for years to keep money that was legally owed to the U.S. government, they wouldn’t be facing jail time and large fines for their failure.

Nobody likes paying onerous taxes, but the way to fight high taxes is through political means, not by lying to the federal government. Likewise, lying to a financial institution about the amount of debt you have in order to secure a line of credit, as Cohen pleaded guilty to doing, is also fraudulent and a form of theft.

The 10 Commandments teach us that we should not steal, we should not lie, and we should not covet. U.S. laws are built on this moral foundation and we are not to break them.

3. Infidelity Is Destructive

Nothing in Manafort’s legal troubles implicates Trump. It’s a different story with Cohen, whose guilty pleas on campaign contributions are related to non-disclosure agreements he facilitated with two women. While we don’t know the facts underlying the situation with the two women, both claimed a sexual relationship with Trump while he was married.

Whether they were lying and receiving payment from him for their silence, or telling the truth and receiving payment from him for their silence, his history with women made him an easy target. Yes, men with wealth and power face such situations more than others do, but you should live your life in such a way that you do not have to pay off women who are making allegations.

Adultery is wrong. Spouses are called to live a sexually pure and decent life in what they say and do. Husband and wife are to love and honor each other. Infidelity has an effect far beyond the person philandering, including the temporary lover, the betrayed spouse and children with the spouse, the children that arise from sexual unions with various women, and even business associates and voters.

It may not be illegal to have an affair, or to be induced to sign a non-disclosure agreement because infidelity is a believable charge, but it is a moral failing. It’s a lot more difficult to blackmail Vice President Michael Pence on these grounds, even if the media mock him for his fidelity to his spouse. This sordid tale of non-disclosure agreements signed with two pornography actresses should be a warning to anyone who even thinks about cheating that there is much to be lost from the act.

4. Targeted For Political Connections

Manafort had been previously targeted and examined by the federal government and never charged with anything. The FBI even in some cases examined the exact same records and documents that resulted in charges this time. Washington D.C. is teeming with political consultants engaged in similar shenanigans who walk free every day. One of Manafort’s associates in the whole lobbying enterprise was Tony Podesta, who has yet to be indicted for his role.

When he announced Cohen’s guilty plea, the federal prosecutor gave a nice little speech about the rule of law and its importance. But one of the things that undergirds the rule of law is its equal application.

A big problem for federal prosecutors is that public trust in their application of the rule of law is low because of how they handle political cases. You can read about how Mueller’s FBI routinely abused prosecutorial discretion, including the anthrax case bungling, leniency for Clinton associate Sandy Berger, the disgraceful Scooter Libby prosecution, the railroading of Ted Stevens, and more.

You can read about James Comey’s long history of botching obstruction cases. Or you can read the inspector general report into the Hillary Clinton investigation, where at every single step along the way, the FBI tread lightly and gently in the face of demonstrable crime, unquestionable lying to agents, and other prosecutable activity.

It’s not that Cohen and Manafort aren’t shady people. They are. It’s that the American public can see that Washington D.C. is teeming with shady people and those with the right connections get off scot-free. That is an extremely dangerous situation for the preservation of the republic and trust in her institutions.

It is in this sense that the guilty pleas and guilty verdicts are irrelevant. The larger message is that if you don’t fight the establishment, you can continue your operations and avoid jail time or harsh penalties. But if you do try to significantly change the status quo, be prepared to spend a lot of money on legal fees and general disruption, if not destruction to your way of life.

These cases are really about Trump, and those who helped him take on the establishment. The goal, of course, is to remove Trump from office some way, some how. As we’ll see below, some are even calling for impeachment over — at best — an unreported campaign contribution. As Mike Doran puts it, “The crime, if it was one, is minor. It pales in comparison to the crimes committed to prevent Trump’s election & to annul it after the fact, Those crimes threaten our democratic institutions, & their magnitude is compounded by the active efforts of the press to cover them up.”

5. Campaign Finance Violations Might Implicate Trump, But Might Not

The big excitement in the Resistance over Cohen’s guilty plea is that Cohen says he made illegal campaign contributions by paying two women for non-disclosure agreements. These payments were later reimbursed by Trump. Reimbursements for illegal campaign contributions would be a problem for Trump since he didn’t report them on his Federal Election Commission reports.

There are a few things to consider. One is whether non-disclosure agreements even are campaign contributions, a not-insignificant hurdle to overcome. If that burden is met, the question would also be how to handle the violation, including by fine or trial — the former being far more common and the latter being a not-insignificant difficulty when the candidate is now the president.

The most recent historical analog to this situation is the John Edwards case. The 2004 vice presidential nominee for the Democratic Party was charged with taking and conspiring to take illegal contributions in excess of what the law allowed, and lying about it by not including the contributions on forms filed with the Federal Election Commission. The contributions went to his mistress Rielle Hunter, with whom he had a daughter.

The government claimed the payments were campaign contributions since he was in the middle of a campaign and trying to conceal his affair. Edwards, however, said the hush money was to conceal the affair from his wife. That case resulted in zero convictions — one acquittal and a deadlock on five other counts. The Justice Department never tried the five counts again. The Trump situation is different, dealing with reimbursed payments for non-disclosure agreements. If they were considered campaign contributions, it would be covered here.

A few months ago, Cohen said the payments had nothing to do with the campaign, claiming “people are mistaking this for a thing about the campaign. What I did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients. I would have done it in 2006. I would have done it in 2011. I truly care about him and the family — more than just as an employee and an attorney.”

Now he claims he made these payments in concert with Trump for the “principal purpose of influencing an election,” as his attorney Lanny Davis put it. Perhaps he has evidence to support this claim, and can convince others that Trump wasn’t far more interested in the purposes of protecting his marriage, his reputation, his children, or his businesses — just the campaign.

Federal Election Commission experts disagree whether such reimbursed payments would meet the standard for a campaign law violation, for what it’s worth. And there are conflicting precedents in FEC law about what it would mean if contributions such as Cohen’s were part of a pattern that pre-dated the campaign. This could mean that if Trump ever paid for a non-disclosure agreement prior to the campaign, it would help his case. But as McCarthy noted months ago, the non-disclosure agreements — and not any silliness about Russia or obstruction — were Trump’s real legal threat.

There is also some disagreement about how an undisclosed non-disclosure agreement, even if held to be a campaign contribution, compares next to other campaign finance violations. The Obama campaign, for example, had to pay a $375,000 fine for concealing major donors’ contributions in the weeks before the 2008 election, among other reporting irregularities. No media called for Obama’s impeachment over these violations, major though they were for the campaign he led.

6. A Trap For The Resistance?

There is no question that Democrats, the media, and Never Trump are tremendously excited by yesterday’s guilty plea and conviction. NBC News’s Jonathan Allen wrote an article headlined, “A dark day for Trump. The darkest day for the presidency since Watergate.”

It included this passage elevating a campaign finance disclosure failure allegation to a high crime and misdemeanor: “In 1998, President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his affair with Monica Lewinsky. But Clinton was not accused of any underlying crimes as serious as those which Cohen suggests Trump may have committed.”

Resistance members took the cue to immediately call for impeachment on similar grounds:

Or as one Twitter wag put it:

2016: “RUSSIA!” 2017: “RUSSIA!!!” 2018: “told you we’d nail them on campaign finance and tax charges” — Razor (@hale_razor) August 21, 2018

Now, maybe the critics are right, and the American people who were promised treasonous collusion with Russia will notice the lack of treasonous collusion with Russia but be moved to impeach by an alleged campaign finance violation or the knowledge that Trump associated with political operatives and lawyers who failed to pay taxes. Maybe they’re right.

But it’s also possible that this is yet another example of overreach from an elite establishment out of touch with the American electorate that put Trump in power and that the previous attempts to unseat President Trump from his rightful election will bear poorly on latter-day attempts. Democrats, Never Trump, and some media voices have been calling for impeachment for months, if not years. The details for impeachment are unimportant since the real crime seems to have been winning the 2016 election.

The New York Times’s Maggie Haberman says political consultants are expecting cries for impeachment will be central before the midterms. At least one Republican consultant says that’s an argument that motivates Republican voters and helps them understand the stakes of the election.

For many in the media, impeachment is — and always has been — a foregone conclusion. Then again, so was the election of Hillary Clinton.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/22/6-takeaways-about-paul-manafort-and-michael-cohens-legal-woes/,2018-08-22
"Despite Comey Claim, FBI Didn't Examine Vast Bulk Of Weiner Emails","When then-FBI Director James Comey announced he was closing the Hillary Clinton email investigation for a second time just days before the 2016 election, he certified to Congress that his agency had “reviewed all of the communications” discovered on a personal laptop used by Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, and her husband, Anthony Weiner.

At the time, many wondered how investigators managed over the course of one week to read the “hundreds of thousands” of emails residing on the machine, which had been a focus of a sex-crimes investigation of Weiner, a former Congressman.

Comey later told Congress that “thanks to the wizardry of our technology,” the FBI was able to eliminate the vast majority of messages as “duplicates” of emails they’d previously seen. Tireless agents, he claimed, then worked “night after night after night” to scrutinize the remaining material.

But virtually none of his account was true, a growing body of evidence reveals.

In fact, a technical glitch prevented FBI technicians from accurately comparing the new emails with the old emails. Only 3,077 of the 694,000 emails were directly reviewed for classified or incriminating information. Three FBI officials completed that work in a single 12-hour spurt the day before Comey again cleared Clinton of criminal charges.

“Most of the emails were never examined, even though they made up potentially 10 times the evidence” of what was reviewed in the original year-long case that Comey closed in July 2016, said a law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the investigation.

Yet even the “extremely narrow” search that was finally conducted, after more than a month of delay, uncovered more classified material sent and/or received by Clinton through her unauthorized basement server, the official said. Contradicting Comey’s testimony, this included highly sensitive information dealing with Israel and the U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas. The former secretary of state, however, was never confronted with the sensitive new information and it was never analyzed for damage to national security.

Even though the unique classified material was improperly stored and transmitted on an unsecured device, the FBI did not refer the matter to U.S. intelligence agencies to determine if national security had been compromised, as required under a federally mandated “damage assessment” directive.

The newly discovered classified material “was never previously sent out to the relevant original classification authorities for security review,” the official, who spoke to RealClearInvestigations on the condition of anonymity, said.

Other key parts of the investigation remained open when the embattled director announced to Congress he was buttoning the case back up for good just ahead of Election Day.

One career FBI special agent involved in the case complained to New York colleagues that officials in Washington tried to “bury” the new trove of evidence, which he believed contained the full archive of Clinton’s emails — including long-sought missing messages from her first months at the State Department.

Timeline: How the FBI Ignored Hundreds of Thousands of Clinton Emails

RealClearInvestigations pieced together the FBI’s handling of the massive new email discovery from the “Weiner laptop.” This months-long investigation included a review of federal court records and affidavits, cellphone text messages, and emails sent by key FBI personnel, along with internal bureau memos, reviews and meeting notes documented in government reports. Information also was gleaned through interviews with FBI agents and supervisors, prosecutors and other law enforcement officials, as well as congressional investigators and public-interest lawyers.

If the FBI “soft-pedaled” the original investigation of Clinton’s emails, as some critics have said, it out-and-out suppressed the follow-up probe related to the laptop, sources for this article said.

“There was no real investigation and no real search,” said Michael Biasello, a 27-year veteran of the FBI. “It was all just show — eyewash — to make it look like there was an investigation before the election.”

Although the FBI’s New York office first pointed headquarters to the large new volume of evidence on Sept. 28, 2016, supervising agent Peter Strzok, who was fired on Aug. 10 for sending anti-Trump texts and other misconduct, did not try to obtain a warrant to search the huge cache of emails until Oct. 30, 2016. Violating department policy, he edited the warrant affidavit on his home email account, bypassing the FBI system for recording such government business. He also began drafting a second exoneration statement before conducting the search.

The search warrant was so limited in scope that it excluded more than half the emails New York agents considered relevant to the case. The cache of Clinton-Abedin communications dated back to 2007. But the warrant to search the laptop excluded any messages exchanged before or after Clinton’s 2009-2013 tenure as secretary of state, key early periods when Clinton initially set up her unauthorized private server and later periods when she deleted thousands of emails sought by investigators.

Far from investigating and clearing Abedin and Weiner, the FBI did not interview them, according to other FBI sources who say Comey closed the case prematurely. The machine was not authorized for classified material, and Weiner did not have classified security clearance to receive such information, which he did on at least two occasions through his Yahoo! email account – which he also used to email snapshots of his penis.

Many Clinton supporters believe Comey’s 11th hour reopening of a case that had shadowed her campaign was a form of sabotage that cost her the election. But the evidence shows Comey and his inner circle acted only after worried agents and prosecutors in New York forced their hand. At the prodding of Attorney General Lynch, they then worked to reduce and rush through, rather than carefully examine, potentially damaging new evidence.

Comey later admitted in his memoir “A Higher Loyalty,” that political calculations shaped his decisions during this period. But, he wrote, they were calibrated to help Clinton: “Assuming, as nearly everyone did, that Hillary Clinton would be elected president of the United States in less than two weeks, what would happen to the FBI, the Justice Department or her own presidency if it later was revealed, after the fact, that she still was the subject of an FBI investigation?”

What does it matter now? Republicans are clamoring for a special counsel to reopen the Clinton email case, though a five-year statute of limitations may be an issue concerning crimes relating to her potential mishandling of classified information.

However, conducting a broader and more thorough search of the Weiner laptop may still have prosecutorial justification. Other questions linger, including whether subpoenaed evidence was destroyed or false statements were made to congressional and FBI investigators from 2014 to 2016, a time frame that is within the statute of limitations. The laptop was not searched for evidence pertaining to such crimes. Investigators instead focused their search, limited as it was, on classified information.

Also, the FBI is still actively investigating the Clinton Foundation for alleged foreign-tied corruption. That probe, handled chiefly out of New York, may benefit from evidence on the laptop.

The FBI did not respond to requests for comment.

The Background

In March 2015, it was revealed that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server located in the basement of her Chappaqua, N.Y., home to conduct State Department business during her 2009-2013 tenure as the nation’s top diplomat. The emails on the unsecured server included thousands of classified messages, including top-secret information. Federal law makes it a felony for government employees to possess or handle classified material in an unprotected manner.

By July, intelligence community authorities had referred the matter to the FBI.

That investigation centered on the 30,490 emails Clinton handed over after deeming them work-related. She said she had deleted another 33,000 because she decided they were “personal.” Also missing were emails from the first two months of her tenure at State – from Jan. 21, 2009, through March 18, 2009 — because investigators were unable to locate the BlackBerry device she used during this period, when she set up and began using the basement server, bypassing the government’s system of archiving such public records as required by federal statute.

One year later, in a dramatic July 2016 press conference less than three weeks before Clinton would accept her party’s nomination for president, Comey unilaterally cleared Clinton of criminal wrongdoing. While Clinton and her aides “were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” he said, “no charges are appropriate in this case.”

Comey would later say he broke with normal procedures whereby the FBI collects evidence and the Department of Justice decides whether to bring charges, because he believed Attorney General Loretta Lynch had engaged in actions that raised doubts about her credibility, including secretly meeting with Clinton’s husband, the former president, just days before the FBI interviewed her.

Fast-forward to September 2016.

FBI investigators in New York were analyzing a Dell laptop, shared by Abedin and Weiner, as part of a separate sex-crimes investigation involving Weiner’s contact with an underage girl. A former Democratic congressman from New York, Weiner is serving a 21-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to sending obscene material to a 15-year-old.

On Sept. 26, 2016, the lead New York agent assigned to the case found a large volume of emails – “over 300,000” – on the laptop related to Abedin and Clinton, including a large volume of messages from Clinton’s old BlackBerry account.

The headers indicated that the emails on the laptop included ones sent and/or received by Abedin at her clintonemail.com account, her personal Yahoo! email account as well as a host of Clinton-associated domains including state.gov, clintonfoundation.org, presidentclinton.com and hillaryclinton.com.

The agents had reason to believe that classified information resided on the laptop, since investigators had already established that emails containing classified information were transmitted through multiple email accounts used by Abedin, including her clintonemail.com and Yahoo! accounts. Moreover, the preliminary count of Clinton-related emails found on the laptop in late September 2016 — three months after Comey closed his case — dwarfed the total of some 60,000 originally reported by Clinton.

The agent described the discovery as an “oh-shit moment.”

“Am I seeing what I think I’m seeing?” he asked another case agent.

They agreed that the information needed “to get reported up the chain” immediately.

The next day, Sept. 27, the official in charge of the FBI’s New York office, Bill Sweeney, was alerted to the trove and confirmed “it was clearly her stuff.” Sweeney reported the find to Comey deputy Andrew McCabe and other headquarters officials on Sept. 28, and told Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that “everybody realized the significance of this.”

(McCabe told Horowitz he didn’t remember Sweeney briefing him about the Weiner laptop, but personal notes he took during the teleconference indicate he was briefed. Sweeney also updated McCabe in a direct call later that afternoon in which he noted there were potentially 347,000 relevant emails, and that the count was climbing. McCabe was fired earlier this year and referred to the U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., for possible criminal investigation into allegations he made false statements to federal agents working for Horowitz.)

McCabe, in turn, briefed Strzok – who had led the Clinton email probe – that afternoon, text messages show.

Comey was not on the conference call, but phone records show he and McCabe met privately that afternoon and spoke during a flurry of phone calls late that evening. McCabe said he could not recall what they discussed, while Comey told investigators that he did not hear about the emails until early October — and then quickly forgot about them. (“I kind of just put it out of my mind,” he said, because he claimed it did not “index” with him that Abedin was closely connected to Clinton. “I don’t know that I knew that [Weiner] was married to Huma Abedin at the time.”)

FBI officials in New York assumed that the bureau’s brass would jump on the discovery, particularly since it included the missing emails from the start of Clinton’s time at State. In fact, the emails dated from the beginning of 2007 and covered the entire period of Clinton’s tenure as secretary and thereafter. The team leading the Clinton investigation, codenamed “Midyear Exam,” had never been able to find Clinton’s emails from her first two months as secretary.

By Oct. 4, the Weiner case agent had finished processing the laptop, and reported that he found at least 675,000 emails potentially relevant to the Midyear case (in fact, the final count was 694,000). “Based on the number of emails, we could have every email that Huma and Hillary ever sent each other,” the agent remarked to colleagues. It appeared this was the mother lode of missing Clinton emails. But Strzok remained uninterested. “This isn’t a ticking terrorist bomb,” he was quoted as saying in the recently issued inspector general’s report. Besides, he had bigger concerns, such as, “You know, is the government of Russian trying to get somebody elected here in the United States?”

Strzok and headquarters sat on the mountain of evidence for another 26 days. The career New York agent said all he was hearing from Washington was “crickets,” so he pushed the issue to his immediate superiors, fearing he would be “scapegoated” for failing to search the pile of digital evidence. They, in turn, went over Strzok’s head, passing their concerns on to career officials at the National Security Division of the Justice Department, who in turn set off alarm bells at the seventh floor executive suites of the Hoover Building.

The New York agent has not been publicly identified, even in the recent IG report, which only describes him as male. But federal court filings in the Weiner case reviewed by RCI list two FBI agents present in court proceedings, only one of whom is male – John Robertson. RCI has confirmed that Robertson at the time was an FBI special agent assigned to the C-20 squad investigating “crimes against children” at the bureau’s New York field office at 26 Federal Plaza, which did not return messages.

The agent told the inspector general that he wasn’t political and didn’t understand all the sensitive issues headquarters may have been weighing, but he feared Washington’s inaction might be seen as a cover-up that could wreak havoc on the bureau.

“I don’t care who wins this election,” he said, “but this is going to make us look really, really horrible.”

Once George Toscas, the highest-ranking Justice Department official directly involved in the Clinton email investigation, found out about the delay, he prodded headquarters to initiate a search and to inform Congress about the discovery.

By Oct. 21, Strzok had gotten the word. “Toscas now aware NY has hrc-huma emails,” he texted McCabe’s counsel, Lisa Page, who responded, “whatever.”

Four days later, Page told Strzok – with whom she was having an affair – about the murmurs she was hearing from brass about having to tell Congress about the new emails. “F them,” Strzok responded, apparently referring to oversight committee leaders on the Hill.

The next day, Oct. 26, the New York agent finally was able to brief Strzok’s team directly about what he had found on the laptop. On Oct. 27, Comey gave the green light to seek a search warrant.

“This decision resulted not from the discovery of dramatic new information about the Weiner laptop, but rather as a result of inquiries from the Weiner case agent and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Office [in New York],” Horowitz said in his recently released report on the Clinton investigation.

Former prosecutors say that politics is the only explanation for why FBI brass dragged their feet for a month after the New York office alerted them about the Clinton emails.

“There’s no rational explanation why, after they found over 300,000 Clinton emails on the Wiener laptop in late September, the FBI did nothing for a month,” former deputy Independent Counsel Solomon “Sol” L. Wisenberg said in a recent interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “It’s pretty clear there’s a real possibility they did nothing because they thought it would hurt Mrs. Clinton during the election.”

Horowitz concurred. The IG cited suspicions that the inaction “was a politically motivated attempt to bury information that could negatively impact the chances of Hillary Clinton in the election.”

He noted that on Nov. 3, after Comey notified Congress of the search, Strzok created a suspiciously inaccurate “Weiner timeline” and circulated it among the FBI leadership.

The odd document, written after the fact, made it seem as if New York hadn’t fully processed the laptop until Oct. 19 and had neglected to fill headquarters in on details about what had been found until Oct. 21. In fact, New York finished processing on Oct. 4 and first began reporting back details to top FBI executives as early as Sept. 28.

Fearing Leaks

Fears of media leaks also played a role in the ultimate decision to reopen the case and notify Congress.

FBI leadership worried that New York would go public with the fact it was sitting on the Weiner emails, because the field office was leaking information on other sensitive matters at the time, including Clinton-related conflicts dogging McCabe, which the Wall Street Journal had exposed that October. At the same time, Trump surrogate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was still in touch with FBI sources in the city, was chirping about an “October surprise” on Fox News.

During the October time frame, McCabe called Sweeney in New York and chewed him out about leaks coming out of his office. On Oct. 26, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch was so worried about the leaks, she called McCabe and Sweeney and angrily warned them to fix them. Sweeney confirmed in an interview with the inspector general that they got “ripped by the AG on leaks.” McCabe said he never heard the attorney general “use more forceful language.”

Lynch — who had admonished Comey to call the Clinton case a “matter” and not an investigation, aligning FBI rhetoric with the Clinton campaign, and who inappropriately agreed to meet with Bill Clinton aboard her government plane five days before the FBI interviewed Hillary Clinton — sought to keep the Weiner laptop search quiet and was opposed to going to Congress with the discovery so close to the election.

“We were quite confident that somebody is going to leak this fact, that we have all these emails. That, if we don’t put out a letter [to Congress], somebody is going to leak it,” then-FBI General Counsel James Baker said. “The discussion was somebody in New York will leak this.”

Baker advised Comey that he also was under obligation to update Congress about any new developments in the case. Just a few months earlier, the director had testified before Hill oversight committees about his decision to close the case. Baker said the front office rationalized that since Clinton was ahead in the polls, the notification would not have a big impact on the race. The Democratic nominee would likely win no matter what the FBI did.

But this time, Comey made no public show of his announcement. On Oct. 28, 2016, Comey quietly sent a terse and private letter to the chairs and the ranking members of the oversight committees on the Hill, informing them, vaguely, that the FBI was taking additional steps in the Clinton email investigation.

Those steps, of course, started with finally searching the laptop for relevant emails.

‘Giant Nothing-Burger’

Prosecutors and investigators alike, however, approached the search as an exercise in futility, even prejudging the results as a “giant nothing-burger.”

That was an assessment that would emerge later from David Laufman, then a lead prosecutor in the Justice Department’s national security division assigned to the Clinton email probe. He had “a very low expectation” that any evidence found on the laptop would alter the outcome of the Midyear investigation. And he doubted a search would turn up “anything novel or consequential,” according to the IG report.

Hired by former Attorney General Eric Holder, Laufman complained it was “exceptionally inappropriate” to restart the investigation so close to the election. (Records show Laufman, who sat in on Clinton’s July 2016 interview at FBI headquarters, gave money to both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns.)

His boss, Mary McCord, discounted the laptop trove as emails they’d already seen. “Hopefully all duplicates,” she wrote in notes she took from an October 2016 phone call she had with McCabe, who shared her hope.

McCord opposed publicly opening the case again “because it could be a big nothing.”

In an Oct. 27 email to the lead Midyear analyst, Strzok suggested the search would not be serious, that they would just need to go through the motions, while joking about “de-duping,” or excluding emails as ones they’d already seen.

The reactivated Midyear investigators were not eager to dive into the new emails, either. They also prejudged the batch as evidence they had already analyzed — while at the same time expressing pro-Hillary and anti-Trump sentiments in internal communications.

For example, the Midyear agent who had called Clinton the “future pres[ident]” after interviewing her in July, pooh-poohed the idea they would find emails substantively different than what the team had previously reviewed. Even though he expected they’d find some missing emails, even new classified material, he discounted their significance.

“My best guess — probably uniques, maybe classified uniques, with none being any different tha[n] what we’ve already seen,” the agent wrote in an Oct. 28 instant message to another FBI employee on the bureau’s computer system. (Back in May 2016, as Clinton was locking up the Democratic primary, the agent had revealed in another IM that there was “political urgency” to wrap up her email investigation.)

The unnamed agent, who is identified in the IG report only as “Agent 1,” is now married to another Midyear investigator, who on Election Day IM’d her then-boyfriend to say Clinton “better win,” while threatening to quit if she didn’t. Known as “Agent 5,” she also stated, “fuck trump,” while calling his voters “retarded.”

At the same time, the lead FBI attorney on the Midyear case, Sally Moyer (whose lawyers confirmed is the anonymous “FBI Attorney 1” cited in the IG report), was in no hurry to process the laptop. Before examining them, she expressed the belief that the massive volume of emails “may just be duplicative of what we already have,” doubting there was a “smoking gun” in the pile.

A Hurried, Constrained Search

Moyer, a registered Democrat, was responsible for obtaining legal authority to review the laptop’s contents. She severely limited the scope of the evidence that investigators could search on the laptop by setting unusually tight parameters.

Working closely with her was Strzok, who forwarded a draft of the warrant to his personal email account in violation of FBI policy, where he helped edit the language in the affidavit. By processing the document at home, no record of his changes to the document were captured in the FBI system.

(Strzok had also edited the language in the drafts of Comey’s public statement about his original decision on the Clinton email investigation. He changed the description of Clinton’s handling of classified information from “grossly negligent” — which is proscribed in the federal statute — to “extremely careless,” eliminating a key phrase that could have had legal ramifications for Clinton.)

The next day, the search warrant application drafted by Strzok and Moyer was filed in New York. It was inexplicably self-constraining. The FBI asked the federal magistrate judge, Kevin N. Fox, to see only a small portion of the evidence the New York agent told headquarters it would find on the laptop.

“The FBI only reviewed emails to or from Clinton during the period in which she was Secretary of State, and not emails from Abedin or other parties or emails outside that period,” Horowitz pointed out in a section of his report discussing concerns that the search warrant request was “too narrow.”

That put the emails the New York case agent found between 2007 and 2009, when Clinton’s private server was set up, as well as those observed after her tenure in 2013, outside investigators’ reach. The post-tenure emails were potentially important, Horowitz noted, because they may have offered clues concerning the intent behind the later destruction of emails.

Also excluded were Abedin’s Yahoo emails, even though investigators had previously found classified information on her Yahoo account and would arguably have probable cause to look at those emails, as well.

Also removed from the search were the BlackBerry data — even though the FBI had previously described them as the “golden emails,” because they covered the dark period early in Clinton’s term.

“Noticeably absent from the search warrant application prepared by the Midyear team is both any mention that the NYO agent had seen Clinton’s emails on the laptop and any mention of the potential presence of BlackBerry emails from early in Clinton’s tenure,” Horowitz noted.

Even though the BlackBerry messages were “critical to [the] assessment of the potential significance of the emails on the Weiner laptop, the information was not included in the search warrant application,” he stressed, adding that the application appeared to misrepresent the information provided by the New York field agent. It also grossly underestimated the extent of the material. The affidavit warrant mentioned “thousands of emails,” while the New York agent had told them that the laptop contained “hundreds of thousands” of relevant emails.

That meant that the Midyear team never got to look, even if it wanted to, at the majority of the communications secreted on the laptop, further raising suspicions that headquarters wasn’t really interested in finding any evidence of wrongdoing – at least on the part of Clinton and her team.

“I had very strict instructions that all I was allowed to do within the case was look for Hillary Clinton emails, because that was the scope of our work,” an FBI analyst said, even though Horowitz said investigators had probable cause to look at Abedin’s emails as well.

In addition to limiting the scope of their probe, the agents were also under pressure from both Justice Department prosecutors and FBI headquarters to complete the review of the remaining emails in a hurry.

One line prosecutor, identified in the IG report only as “Prosecutor 1,” argued that they should finish up “as quickly” as possible. Baker said there was a general concern about the new process “being too prolonged and dragged [out].”

Lynch urged Comey to process the Weiner laptop “as fast as you can,” according to notes from a high-level department meeting on Oct. 31, 2016, which were obtained by the IG.

On Nov. 3, Strzok indicated in a text that Justice demanded he update the department twice a day on the FBI’s progress in clearing the stack. “DOJ is hyperventilating,” he told Page.

De-Duplicating ‘Wizardry’

Before the search warrant was issued, the Midyear team argued that the project was too vast to complete before the election. According to Comey’s recently published memoir, they insisted it would take “many weeks” and require the enlistment of “hundreds of FBI employees.” And, they contended, not just anybody could read them: “It had to be done by people who knew the context,” and there was only a handful of investigators and analysts who could do the job.

“The team told me there was no chance the survey of the emails could be completed before the Nov. 8 election,” Comey recalled, which was right around the corner.

But after Comey decided he’d have to move forward with the search regardless, Strzok and his investigators suddenly claimed they could finish the work in the short time remaining prior to national polls opening.

At the same time, they cut off communications with the New York field office. “We should essentially have no reason for contact with NYO going forward on this,” Strzok texted Page on Nov. 2.

Strzok followed up with another text that same day, which seemed to echo earlier texts about what they viewed as their patriotic duty to stop Trump and support Clinton.

“Your country needs you now,” he said in an apparent attempt to buck up Page, who was “very angry” they were having to reopen the Clinton case. “We are going to have to be very wise about all of this.”

“We’re going to make sure the right thing is done,” he added. “It’s gonna be ok.”

Responded Page: “I have complete confidence in the [Midyear] team.”

“Our team,” Strzok texted back. “I’m telling you to take comfort in that.” Later, he reminded Page that any conversations she had with McCabe “would be covered under atty [attorney-client] privilege.”

Suddenly, however, the impossible project suddenly became manageable thanks to what Comey described as a “huge breakthrough.” As the new cache of emails arrived, the bureau claimed it had solved one of the most labor-intensive aspects of the previous Midyear investigation – having to sort through the tens of thousands of Clinton emails on various servers and electronic devices manually.

Advanced new “de-duplicating” technology would allow them to speed through the mountain of new emails automatically flagging copies of previously reviewed material.

Strzok, who led the effort, echoed Comey’s words, later telling the IG’s investigators that technicians were able “to do amazing things” to “rapidly de-duplicate” the emails on the laptop, which significantly lowered the number of emails that he and other investigators had to individually review manually.

But according to the IG, FBI’s technology division only “attempted” to de-duplicate the emails, but ultimately was unsuccessful. The IG cited a report prepared Nov. 15, 2016, by three officials from the FBI’s Boston field office. Titled “Anthony Weiner Laptop Review for Communications Pertinent to Midyear Exam,” it found that “[b]ecause metadata was largely absent, the emails could not be completely, automatically de-duplicated or evaluated against prior emails recovered during the investigation.”

The absence of this metadata — basically electronic fingerprints that reveal identifying characteristics such as To, CC, Date, From, Subject, attachments and other fields – informed the IG’s finding that “the FBI could not determine how many of the potentially work-related emails were duplicative of emails previously obtained in the Midyear investigation.”

Contrary to Comey’s claim, the FBI could not sufficiently determine how many emails containing classified information were duplicative of previously reviewed classified emails. As a result, hundreds of thousands of emails were not actually processed for evidence, law enforcement sources say.

“All those communications weren’t ruled out because they were copies, they were just ruled out,” the federal investigator with direct knowledge of the case said. The official, who wished to remain anonymous, explained that hundreds of thousands of emails were simply overlooked. Instead of processing them all, investigators took just a sample of the batch and looked at those documents.

After Comey announced his investigators wrapped up the review in days – then-candidate Donald Trump expressed skepticism. “You can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days,” he said during a rally on Nov. 7.

He was more correct than he knew.

Exoneration Before Investigation

At the urging of Lynch, Comey began drafting a new exoneration statement several days before investigators finished reviewing the sample of emails they took from the Weiner laptop. High-level meeting notes reveal they even discussed sending Congress “more-clarifying” statements during the week to “correct misimpressions out there.”

As the search was under way, one of the Midyear agents – Agent 1 — confided to another agent in a Nov. 1 instant message on the FBI’s computer network that “no one is going to pros[ecute Clinton] even if we find unique classified [material].”

On Nov. 4 – two days before they had completed the search – Strzok talked about “drafting” a statement. “We might have this stmt out and be substantially done,” Page texted back about an hour later.

The pair seemed confident at that point that Clinton’s campaign had weathered the new controversy and would still pull off a victory.

“[O]n Inauguration Day,” Page texted Strzok, “in addition to our kegger, we should also have a screening of the Weiner documentary!” The film, “Weiner,” documented the former Democratic lawmaker’s ill-fated run for New York mayor in 2013.

Filtering

Even after the vast reservoir of emails had been winnowed down by questionable methods, the remaining ones still had to be reviewed by hand to determine if they were relevant to the investigation and therefore legally searchable as evidence.

Moyer, the lead FBI attorney on the Midyear team who had initially discounted the trove of new emails as “duplicates” and failed to act upon their discovery, was also head of the “filtering” team. After various searches of the laptop, she and the Midyear team came up with 6,827 emails they classified as being tied directly to Clinton. Moyer then culled away from that batch emails she deemed to be personal in nature and outside the scope of legal agreements, cutting the stack in half. That left 3,077 which she deemed “work related.”

On Nov. 5, Moyer, Strzok and a third investigator divided up the remaining pool of 3,077 emails — roughly 1,000 emails each — and rifled through them for classified information and incriminating evidence in less than 12 hours[P34] , even though the identification of classified material is a complicated and prolonged process that requires soliciting input from the original classification authorities within the intelligence community.

“We’re doing it ALL,” Strzok told Page late that evening.

The trio ordered pizza and worked into the next morning combing through the emails.

“Finishing up,” Strzok texted Page around 1 a.m. that Sunday.

By about 2 a.m. Sunday, he declared they were done with their search, noting that while they had found new State Department messages, they had found “no new classified” emails. And allegedly nothing from the missing period at the start of Clinton’s term that might suggest a criminal motive.

Later that evening of Nov. 6, after he announced to Congress that Clinton was in the clear again, an exuberant Comey gathered his inner circle in his office to watch football.

As news of the case’s swift re-closure hit the airwaves, Page and Strzok giddily exchanged text messages and celebrated. “Out on CNN now … And fox … I WANT TO WATCH THIS WITH YOU!” Strzok said to Page. “Going to pour myself a glass of wine … .”

Page noted that “Trump is talking about [Clinton]” on Fox News, and how “she’s protected by a rigged system.”

New Classified Information

Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, earlier prognostications that the results of the laptop search would not be a game-changer turned out to be accurate. Yet investigators nonetheless found 13 classified email chains on the unauthorized laptop just in the small sample of 3,077 emails that were individually inspected, and four of those were classified as Secret at the time.

Contrary to the FBI’s public claims, at least five classified emails recovered were not duplicates but new to investigators.

RCI has learned that these highly sensitive messages include a Nov. 25, 2011, email regarding talks with Egyptian leaders and Hamas, and a July 9, 2011, “call sheet” Abedin sent Clinton in advance of a phone conversation she had that month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The document runs four pages.

Another previously unseen classified email, dated Nov. 25, 2010, concerns confidential high-level State Department talks with United Arab Emirates leaders. The note, including a classified “readout” of a phone call with the UAE prime minister, was written by Abedin and sent to Clinton, and then forwarded by Abedin the next day from her huma@clintonemail.com account to her then-husband’s account identified under the rubric “Anthony Campaign.”

Judicial Watch, a Washington-based government watchdog group which has filed a lawsuit against the State Department seeking a full production of Clinton records, confirmed the existence of several more unique classified emails it has received among the rolling release of the 3,077 “work-related” emails.

“These classified documents are not duplicates,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told RCI. “They are not ones the FBI had already seen prior to their November review.”

He accused the FBI of conducting a “sham” investigation and called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to order a new investigation of Clinton’s email.

The unique classified emails call into question Comey’s May 2017 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when he maintained that although investigators found classified email chains on the laptop, “We’d seen them all before.”

No Damage Assessment

Comey, in subsequent interviews and public testimony, maintained that the FBI left no stone unturned.

This, too, skirted the truth.

Although Comey claimed that investigators had scoured the laptop for intrusions by foreign hackers who may have stolen the state secrets, Strzok and his team never forensically examined the laptop to see if classified information residing on it had been hacked or compromised by a foreign power before Nov. 6, law enforcement sources say. A complete forensic analysis was never performed by technicians at the FBI’s lab at Quantico.

Nor did they farm out the classified information found on the unsecured laptop to other intelligence agencies for review as part of a national security damage assessment — even though Horowitz confirmed that Clinton’s illegal email activity, in a major security breach, gave “foreign actors” access to unknowable quantities of classified material.

Without addressing the laptop specifically, late last year the FBI’s own inspection division determined that classified information kept on Clinton’s email server “was compromised by unauthorized individuals, to include foreign governments or intelligence services, via cyber intrusion or other means.”

Judicial Watch is suing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the State Department to force them to conduct, as required by law, a full damage assessment, and prepare a report on how Clinton’s email practices as secretary harmed national security.

Comey and Strzok also decided to close the case for a second time without interviewing its three central figures: Abedin, Weiner and Clinton.

Abedin was eventually interviewed, two months later, on Jan. 6, 2017. Although summaries of her previous interviews have been made public, this one has not.

Investigators never interviewed Weiner, even though he had received at least two of the confirmed classified emails on his Yahoo account without the appropriate security clearance to receive them.

The IG concluded, “The FBI did not determine exactly how Abedin’s emails came to reside on Weiner’s laptop.”

Premature Re-Closure

In his May 2017 testimony, however, Comey maintained that both Abedin and Weiner had been investigated.

Pressed to answer why neither of them was charged with crimes, including mishandling classified information, Comey explained:

“With respect to Ms. Abedin, we didn’t have any indication that she had a sense that what she was doing was in violation of the law. Couldn’t prove any sort of criminal intent.”

At the time, the Senate Judiciary Committee was unaware that the FBI had not interviewed Abedin to make such a determination before the election.

What about Weiner? Did he read the classified materials without proper authority? the committee asked.

“I don’t think so,” Comey answered, before adding, “I don’t think we’ve been able to interview him.”

Pro-Clinton Bias

The IG report found that Strzok demonstrated intense bias for Clinton and against Trump throughout the initial probe, followed by a stubborn reluctance to examine potentially critical new evidence against Clinton. These included hundreds of messages exchanged with Page, embodied by a Nov. 7 text referencing a pre-Election Day article headlined, “A victory by Mr. Trump remains possible,” about which Strzok stated, “OMG THIS IS F*CKING TERRIFYING.”

Strzok is a central figure because he was a top agent on the two investigations with the greatest bearing on the 2016 election – Clinton emails and the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. These probes overlapped in October as the discovery of Abedin’s laptop renewed Bureau attention on Clinton’s emails at the same time it was preparing to seek a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to spy on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Some Republicans have charged that the month-long delay between the New York office’s discovery of the laptop and the FBI’s investigation of it can be explained by Strzok’s partisan decision to prioritize the Trump investigation over the Clinton one.

Among the evidence they cite is an Oct. 14 email to Page in which Strzok discussed applying “hurry the F up pressure” on Justice Department attorneys to secure the FISA surveillance warrant on Page approved before Election Day. (This also happened to be the day the Obama administration promoted his wife, Melissa Hodgman, a big Hillary booster, to associate director of the SEC’s enforcement division.) On Oct. 21, his team filed an application for a wiretap to spy on Carter Page.

IG Horowitz would not rule out bias as a motivating factor in the aggressive investigation of Trump and passive probe of Clinton. “We did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,” he said.

Asked to elaborate in recent Senate testimony, Horowitz reaffirmed, “We did not find no bias in regards to the October events.”

Throughout that month, the facts overwhelmingly demonstrate that instead of digging into the cache of new Clinton evidence, Strzok aggressively investigated the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Moscow, including wiretapping at least one Trump adviser based heavily on unverified allegations of espionage reported in a dossier commissioned by the Clinton campaign.

In a statement, Strzok’s attorney blamed the delays in processing the new emails on “bureaucratic snafus,” and insisted they had nothing to do with Strzok’s political views, which he said never “affected his work.”

The lawyer, Aitan D. Goelman, a partner at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP in Washington, added that his client moved on the new information as soon as he could.

“When informed that Weiner’s laptop contained Clinton emails, Strzok immediately had the matter pursued by two of his most qualified and aggressive investigators,” Goelman said.

Still, contemporaneous messages by Strzok reveal he was not thrilled about re-investigating Clinton. On Nov. 5, for example, he texted Page: “I hate this case.”

Recovering the Laptop

A final mystery remains: Where is the Weiner laptop today?

The whistleblower agent in New York said that he was “instructed” by superiors to delete the image of the laptop hard drive he had copied onto his work station, and to “wipe” all of the Clinton-related emails clean from his computer.

But he said he believes the FBI “retained” possession of the actual machine, and that the evidence on the device was preserved.

The last reported whereabouts of the laptop was the Quantico lab. However, the unusually restrictive search warrant Strzok and his team drafted appeared to remand the laptop back into the custody of Abedin and Weiner upon the closing of the case.

“If the government determines that the subject laptop is no longer necessary to retrieve and preserve the data on the device,” the document states on its final page, “the government will return the subject laptop.”

Wherever its location, somewhere out there is a treasure trove of evidence involving potentially serious federal crimes — including espionage, foreign influence-peddling and obstruction of justice — that has never been properly or fully examined by law enforcement authorities.

"Immigration Status Is Relevant, But It's Not A License To Discriminate","There is an uncontrollable reflex in politics to seize on immigration status when someone commits a violent crime. Leftists generally downplay crimes by immigrants, while the Right generally puts immigration status front and center to drive home the need for enforcement. Immigration status is relevant, but extreme messaging only fosters division. It is important to dissect the meaning of immigration status in connection with violent crime.

When an unlawful immigrant commits a high profile crime, it is natural to ask why this crime happened. Is there a moral component to immigration status? And what are the practical implications of immigration status? Statistics are important for establishing trends, but empirics aside, there is some common sense framing of the issue that is helpful.

Simply stated, immigration status in violent crimes is relevant chiefly if the perpetrator is unlawfully present, because those crimes are preventable. Secondly, a violent lawful immigrant could highlight a need to reform the vetting process. Beyond these considerations, undue focus on immigration status is likely unnecessary and potentially discriminatory. We should rightly recognize when newcomers perpetrate harm, without holding disdain for those who share our values.

The Moral Question

Anyone who uses an individual immigrant to make generalized pronouncements on the morality of immigrants is intellectually vapid and morally confused. Individuals are responsible for their actions, and a violent crime committed by an illegal immigrant is the egregious choice of that person, but should not be used as a tool for labeling all immigrants as dangerous. This is separate from the practical implication of that person’s presence in the country.

People are not implicitly bad because they entered this country illegally. They are here in open defiance of our laws, making them law breakers by definition, but this does not make them inherently bad people. It may be that a willingness to break immigration law correlates with willingness to break other laws, but I am not supposing that without data.

When candidate Donald Trump said that Mexico was sending rapists and crime, he did not mean that immigrants from Mexico are necessarily rapists and murderers, but that such offenders are among those entering. There is no reason — logically or otherwise — to assume that by nature of being an unlawful immigrant, one has a higher propensity for rape or murder. Violent crime categorically differs from other civil offenses. A violent criminal being among those entering is disconcerting, however, and is worth noting when discussing enforcement.

A frequent retort is that people here commit crimes every day. Stephen Paddock killed 58 people last year, and he is a citizen. So how can anyone say that immigration status is relevant? If others do it too, and immigrant status doesn’t make one inherently bad, then why talk about it at all?

Practical Implication

Capacity to commit atrocities is not related to immigration status. Human nature holds the inherent capacity for all people to commit wrongs. Look no further than the experiments of Philip Zimbardo or Stanley Milgram or literally any chapter of a history book. Given that all people can do bad things, it is in the interest of a sovereign nation to screen and select whom it allows to enter.

Citizens and legal immigrants can of course commit crimes, but an illegal immigrant’s presence is in itself a crime. That crime of illegal entry is not of the utmost moral station, but it does mean that there is no vetting or knowledge of the person’s history or potential. Unknown individuals are riskier than those who follow the procedures. Some of those could be decent and others violent, but not knowing is a risk to the sovereign nation.

When it comes to violent crimes, it is obvious that if a murderer or rapist never came into the country, he could not victimize a resident of the country. Of course murders, rapes, and theft will happen anyway throughout the country, but on an individual level, particular victims would certainly be spared by robust immigration enforcement. Every crime committed by an unlawful immigrant is a preventable crime. That is simple enough: If the immigrants are not here to commit the crime, the crime does not happen. This does not mean that with no unlawful immigrants the aggregate level of crime would necessarily decrease. It might, but other factors could keep it at a constant or higher level — a counterfactual that is impossible to know. We only know definitively that their particular crimes would not occur.

For the families of victims, it is a terrible loss, and clouding that with the unsolicited spotlight and toxicity of politics cannot be easy or desirable. It nevertheless is clear that Kate Steinle and Mollie Tibbetts would still be alive if their particular killers were not in the country. These two young women, and many more like them would not have perished when or how they did if not for the unlawful presence of their murderers. Border enforcement and deportation literally saves lives when violent immigrants are apprehended in time.

All illegal immigrants are not prone to commit violent crimes, but the presence of an unlawful population can create other problems. Kind but unlawful immigrants can also cause tragedy, and this is where immigration status can become sensitive. Take accidental vehicle collisions — the same tragedy would befall the family as with murder, and they would certainly ask whether their child would be alive if not for the presence of that immigrant. Vehicle accidents are incredibly frequent, but at an individual level, it is still relevant to the family because someone with no legal right to be here just took their child from them. This is not murder, or violent crime; it is a tragic accident. But it contributes to the question of considering immigration status. All harm done nefariously or accidentally by an unlawful person is needless and preventable.

So What

When illegal immigrants do commit high profile evil acts, it is natural to wonder why they are in the country. It is also natural to wonder what other nefarious actors are unlawfully here. The impulse of the right to highlight these incidents as a rallying cry for immigration enforcement makes some sense. When that rallying cry is about law and order, the security and safety of our citizens, and national sovereignty, there is little problem. When it is used to justify or promote xenophobia, it is intellectually lazy and morally weak. This is particularly easy to spot when ethnicity is highlighted.

Anyone in the country without lawful status is rightly subject to deportation. That is just how the rule of law must work. That means that otherwise law-abiding and decent illegal immigrants are obliged to move along or be deported. Their underlying decision to break our law is what jeopardizes their status here, and while it may seem unfair to sweep them up during a push caused by egregious crimes, it is no less legitimate to deport them before or after such high profile crimes.

It makes the most sense, however, to focus enforcement on violent offenders and those committing other crimes like fraud, theft, or reckless driving. It is not efficient to deport every unlawful immigrant. Calls to deport every illegal immigrant are reactionary and undesirable. Calls to build the wall may be warranted, but must be tempered with nuance and context. It may seem inconsistent to call for a wall if the high profile murderer actually overstayed a visa after lawful entry, but a border barrier does decrease entry, and to the extent that border control helps reduce infiltration and allow us to vet immigrants, this solution is relevant. After all, we are no longer narrowly concerned with how one criminal got here, but how to prevent others from getting here.

Taking immigration status and violent crime into account is common sense. Using that as a cover for generalizations and xenophobic policies is wrong. We are a nation of immigrants, but also of laws, and we must enforce them consistently. As a part of this, we must do a better job of vetting good immigrants who believe in American values, and getting rid of those who would do us harm.

The Murder Of Mollie Tibbetts Isn’t A Reason To Restrict Immigration,"The murder of Mollie Tibbetts has created a perfect storm in the immigration debate ahead of midterm elections. The details of the case — a young woman kidnapped and brutally killed in small-town Iowa, allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant from Mexico, who stuffed her in the trunk of a car then dumped her body in a cornfield — embody the worst fears of immigration hardliners, especially President Trump, who has turned Tibbetts’s murder into a cause célèbre.

Trump invoked Tibbetts last week in West Virginia as proof of a badly flawed immigration system and lax border security. The next day, he released a video of himself on Twitter, arguing that Tibbetts’s killing shows why we need a wall, and why the GOP needs to keep its congressional majority in November: “We need our immigration laws changed. We need our border laws changed. We need Republicans to do it because the Democrats aren’t going to do it.”

The same day, the White House released an emotional video of families whose loved ones were killed, many in horrifying ways, by illegal immigrants. They have been “permanently separated,” in their words.

Democrats have tried to downplay the illegal immigration aspect of the Tibbetts murder and re-focus the public’s attention on the “real problems” of family separation and Trump’s “zero tolerance” border policy, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren said last week when asked about the Tibbetts case on CNN.

But for as much as the Tibbetts case plays into a tidy narrative about the dangers of illegal immigration on the right, and distracts from a tidy narrative about the cruelty of the Trump administration on the left, it also exemplifies the contradictions inherent in our immigration system. Far from suggesting we need to restrict immigration, the case shows why we need to make it easier for migrants to come here and work.

The Alleged Killer Worked In The United States For Years

Consider that the accused killer, 24-year-old Cristhian Bahena Rivera, worked at a dairy farm owned by Craig Lane, a prominent state Republican leader. Rivera had been at the farm for four years, living under a false name and staying in a mobile home on the property. A spokesman for the farm said Rivera provided a state-issued government ID and Social Security number when he applied for the job, passed a Social Security-number check, and was considered an “employee in good standing” who showed up to work every day and cooperated with other employees.

Rivera, it turns out, has been living in the United States for seven years, since age 17. His lawyer has said that he diligently filed tax returns with the IRS, albeit under a false identity. He had no driver’s license but did have a car, reportedly registered under someone else’s name, that he drove for years. He even fathered a child with a high school classmate of Tibbetts.

All of that to say, Rivera had substantial interactions with U.S. institutions and significant ties to his local community. Yet he lived for years under the radar. His illegal status didn’t prevent him from doing all the things legal immigrants do — work, start a family, file tax returns. He simply found a way around the law, just as millions of other illegal immigrants do every day, all across the country.

Crossing The Border Illegally Is a Victimless Crime

The lesson to take from all this is not that we need an even bigger wall. Nor will it suffice to turn away from the problem, as Democrats are especially inclined to do right now because it renders their “abolish ICE” rhetoric absurd.

The lesson in the tragedy of the Tibbetts murder is that people who want to come here and work will find a way to do it, regardless of the bureaucratic barriers placed in their path. Need a Social Security number to get hired? A state ID? Anyone with sufficient motivation can procure those things — and migrants, legal and illegal, are a self-selecting group of highly motivated people.

Immigration hardliners will reply, not without reason, that just because some people break the law doesn’t mean we should reward them by changing the law. That’s a fair point, but it only goes so far. After all, we as a nation are currently in the process of doing away with long-standing prohibitions on marijuana for no other reason than a critical mass of people persist in using it despite the prohibitions. We have decided, in effect, that smoking weed is a victimless crime, and therefore prohibiting its use makes no sense.

Suggesting that illegal immigration is also a victimless crime will no doubt be met with howls of outrage from the right, especially after the heinous murder of a young woman by an illegal immigrant, to say nothing of the specious claim that illegal immigrants undercut wages for American workers.

But the reality is that the vast majority of illegal immigrants, like legal immigrants, come here to work. Despite the Trump administration’s rhetoric, they are not more likely than American citizens to commit crime. Yes, they violated our laws by entering the country illegally, but assuming they don’t otherwise violate the law, their illegal presence here amounts to a victimless crime.

It’s easy to dismiss all that in the face of something like the Tibbetts murder. As David French noted last week at National Review Online, the murder of people like Tibbetts and Kate Steinle are particularly painful because “the murderer wasn’t supposed to be here.”

But ending the discussion there is a kind of dodge. That Rivera murdered Tibbetts actually tells us nothing about how we should reform immigration. Far more significant to the immigration debate is the fact that Rivera lived and worked here for years and no one noticed.

It is a stark reminder that the desire of people to come here is greater than our desire to keep them out, and that if we want to fix our immigration system we should start by making it easier for people to come here and work — legally.

Mob Hounding OSU Over Assault Claims Are Destroying Due Process,"If the media crusade against domestic violence in sports can teach us anything, it is perhaps to re-emphasize the genius of the Founders in emphasizing that due process is more important than outcome — and enshrining that concept in our Constitution.

The idea may seem cold to a family watching the killer of a loved one walk after being acquitted. As someone whose family members were harassed by stalkers, I know the inefficiency of our judicial system can be unbelievably slow and frustrating. But in a free society, people accused of a crime must have the ability to defend themselves and, when falsely accused, reclaim their good name. That can only happen if we allow the guilty the same opportunity, which is why process is more important than specific outcomes.

The frenzy surrounding allegations of abuse by a coach in Ohio State University’s football program is a prime example of what happens when we decide that if the courts won’t punish that SOB, why, we’ll just do it ourselves to force the outcome we want.

Here’s what we know about the OSU situation: An assistant football coach was arrested in 2009, while he was employed by another university, for allegedly throwing his wife against a wall. She declined to press charges, and he was never charged or convicted. The wife also claims she told OSU head coach Urban Meyer’s wife that her husband had abused her other times.

Based on this, various columnists, reporters, and TV hosts are claiming Meyer should have been fired for not firing the assistant coach. They are basing their argument on Title IX, the 1972 law that guarantees women equal access and opportunity in higher education, saying the law requires Meyer to fire the assistant based on the wife’s accusation that he’d abused her.

Here’s the thing: Congress does not have the authority or power to amend the Constitution by statute, and the Constitution holds that all citizens are to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Further, the 14th Amendment spells out the right of the accused to “due process” — meaning a judicial hearing of some sort (a trial, usually) where they can question witnesses, present their own witnesses, and argue to the jury that they are innocent.

Even if Title IX requires schools to fire all athletic staff accused of domestic violence (not a unanimous viewpoint, by the way), that would be unconstitutional, particularly for public universities like OSU, which are by definition branches of the state government. A private university could more easily fire someone accused of domestic violence for violating their employment rules, but a state university is bound by the Constitution.

Even private universities firing people accused but not charged or convicted of a crime because of pressure from the federal government could be in violation of the Constitution. (Title IX ties eligibility for federal education funds to compliance with enacting various policies and meeting certain measurable criteria.)

Numerous lawsuits are working their way through the courts challenging the constitutionality of Title IX, or at least current interpretations of its requirements. Most of these lawsuits were filed by male college students expelled or otherwise punished for allegedly committing violent sexual crimes. Their lawsuits hold the Title IX standards violated their due process protections, because university policy denied them a fair trial. To date, the courts have sided largely with these students.

The notion that the best way to address the problem of domestic violence is to permanently and publicly destroy those who stand accused of committing the crime (well, some of them, anyway) goes against other important values: fairness, compassion, and redemption.

We have a judicial system for dealing with accusations of criminal wrongdoing. Although the system is flawed — note the numerous death row convicts who have been cleared by advances in DNA analysis — it’s a recipe for disaster to expect universities and professional sports teams to step in and add adjudication of their employees to their existing duties.

Here are some questions all those columnists and TV commentators demanding that this or that coach be fired for not “doing the right thing” should consider: What is your employer’s policy on domestic violence that occurs away from the workplace? Does it have one? If you are accused of domestic violence, but not charged nor convicted, will you be suspended? Will you get paid while suspended? What if a member of the sales team or production department is so accused? Someone who runs the press?

And how many of these folks preaching from their bully pulpits have, in their lives, heard rumors or even allegations of colleagues committing domestic violence? Having worked in that industry for more than a quarter century, I can tell you that journalism is no more immune to domestic violence than any other career path. Did every columnist, every reporter now calling for Meyer’s head report every rumor and allegation to their own human resources department?

There’s a lot of sanctimonious finger-pointing by the media right now, but very little in the way of thoughtful reflection. For starters, the media’s obsession with athletes and coaches accused of domestic violence seems oddly subjective. What about accountants? Line cooks? Auto mechanics? Doctors? School teachers? Should everyone who is accused of domestic violence immediately be fired? Why just athletes and coaches?

And what do these talking heads suggest society actually do with those convicted of domestic abuse? Which jobs are they to be allowed to hold? Will they be permitted to drive trucks? Wash dishes? Work as reporters? Or are they to be pariahs for life, presumed unable and thereby denied the opportunity to reform? And who is to fulfill their financial obligations to their ex-spouses and children if we ban them from the workplace for life?

And since we’re no longer content to allow the justice system to decide these issues, who does get to decide? The media? If so, and they’re no good at it, how do we remove them? Corrupt or incompetent judges can be voted out of office at the state level, impeached by Congress at the federal level. But an unelected media elite deciding who is guilty and who is not does not seem to have much of the flavor of democracy or accountability about it.

This whole bout of self-righteousness is equally haphazard and sclerotic — no different in tone or implementation than other “zero tolerance” campaigns against drugs (“just say no”) or repeat criminals (“three strikes”) that ended up ruining more lives and doing more harm to society than the scourges they were intended to correct. After all, the concept of “zero tolerance” is that we are going to remove discernment from the equation and simply throw the book at everyone.

The great irony here is that overreach on domestic violence can counterproductively belittle the seriousness of the issue. Media coverage of the issue has devolved to the point where there is no credible attempt to explore the roots of the issue, of what drives little boys to grow up into men who hit their partners or other women, of what programs can reduce the recidivism, or of how we bring the greatest possible number of these men back into the fold of society as trusted, trustable members of our community.

A serious issue deserves serious coverage and serious debate. We’re surely not having that right now. Instead, the narrative has become: Men beat women because men are intrinsically evil, and they must be rooted out and destroyed.

It was just a year ago that many in the media were supporting the idea that state legislatures should pass laws banning employers from conducting criminal background checks on job applicants. Once someone had served their time for a crime, they argued, the slate should be wiped clean, because everyone deserves a second chance.

Now, the narrative has pivoted 180 degrees and the media is decreeing that anyone even rumored to have committed domestic violence at any point in their life should be fired immediately. Well, at least athletes and coaches, and Hollywood moguls.

Want domestic violence treated more seriously? Treat it more seriously. Bring pressure to bear on the various state legislatures to pass laws strengthening the punishment for domestic violence. Give judges the tools they need to protect women and children caught in the web of domestic violence. Find the programs that are most successful at rehabilitating the men who commit these crimes.

But for the media to simply decide the process isn’t working and so we’ll take care of it with pitchforks and torches? It may bring about the results many folks want, but the resulting erosion of our judicial process will only weaken all our rights over time.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/31/mob-hounding-osu-domestic-assault-claims-destroying-due-process/,2018-08-31
Rahm Emanuel’s Decline Mirrors The Democratic Party’s Identity Crisis,"The Weekly Standard’s political requiem for Rahm Emanuel captures much of the conventional wisdom about his decision to not seek reelection, primarily in his failures on crime, race relations, and the budget. The critiques are largely true, as far as they go. A closer look, however, reveals broader implications for our national politics.

At the outset, the issues driving Emanuel from office are not mutually exclusive. For example, on the crime issue, Emanuel has belatedly committed to hiring 1,000 more police. But this step has a definite budgetary impact, both in the short term and in terms of pension and health benefits decades into the future. It also will empower the city’s already influential police union at a time policing reform is greatly needed.

Any increase in the number of police and the aggressiveness of policing will likely be directed toward the neighborhoods with the most serious crime problems, which are often minority neighborhoods. Given the historical relationship of the Chicago Police Department with minority neighborhoods, making progress on both crime and race relations is easier said than done. Moreover, this borrowed money is now being spent on policing after Emanuel closed schools and clinics in many of these neighborhoods, exacerbating the city’s often racial politics.

Chicago’s problems are like a Rubik’s Cube, but far more difficult to solve. In addition, while Emanuel failed in a number of ways attributable to his administration, his fate was also affected by the ghosts of the past and the future.

The Weekly Standard correctly notes the spike in murders on Emanuel’s watch, which is a great tragedy. On the other hand, the city’s murder rate per capita is below that of St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, Cleveland, Kansas City, Memphis, and Newark. People tend not to think of St. Louis or Memphis as deadlier cities, because people associate Chicago as much with Al Capone or the 1968 riots as they do with Michael Jordan.

Chicago’s surge in homicides, as in other cities, is subsiding, but not quickly enough to help Emanuel. Moreover, while the murder rate is tragic, the truly scandalous aspect of the tragedy may be the Chicago Police Department’s manipulation of the reporting of murders and other crimes to make them seem less serious.

Underscoring the linkage of the city’s problems, the spike in gun violence may have been due to a decline in law enforcement activity after the release of the video showing the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Chicago paid nearly $642 million for alleged police misconduct from 2004-2015, a period that extends well back into the tenure of former Mayor Richard M. Daley. These sums continue to balloon because they are financed with debt.

The government’s attempt to suppress the McDonald video until after Emanuel’s reelection may be blamed on Rahm. It also represents the final straw for those frustrated with Chicago’s long, poor record on race relations. In 1966, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. told reporters, “I have never seen, even in Mississippi and Alabama, mobs as hateful as I’ve seen here in Chicago.” In 1983, when Harold Washington became Chicago’s first black mayor, the opposition from a mostly white bloc of aldermen in the city council became the stuff of legend and stand-up comedy.

Although conditions have improved, enough de facto segregation remains that racial tensions are never far from the surface. The Weekly Standard correctly notes Emanuel hurt himself by closing schools and mental health clinics in low-income and black communities. His budgetary justification for the school closings has been challenged from the left and right. But while The Weekly Standard focused on the exodus of blacks from the city, the emigration transcends race as Chicagoans flee their government’s fiscal irresponsibility.

Also, regarding the school closings, left and right generally agree in condemning the diversion of tax-increment financing (TIF) — a scheme originally authorized to aid blighted areas — to enrich the city’s traditional political establishment. Daley exploited this slush fund to benefit the cronies who funded his campaigns; Emanuel failed to consider that new thinking may have been required to help solve the Cube. However, such new thinking would have annoyed the oligarchic establishment effectively running the city for decades.

Here, Emanuel’s fall offers a lesson about national politics. When Emanuel entered City Hall, he intended to govern as a neoliberal. He proposed education reforms along the lines championed by the center-left, including charter school expansion, closing underused and underperforming public schools, and longer school days. He hoped to help rationalize the city’s finances by privatizing some city assets and services.

Emanuel’s plans did not survive contact with his opponents. His education agenda angered not only minority communities, but also the powerful teacher’s union. (Much of the revival in teacher union activism nationwide was inspired by CTU victories over Emanuel.) He was only partly successful in fixing some of Daley’s cozy privatization deals. His dual transit and debit card system looked as business-friendly as some of Daley’s deals.

In a one-party city, Emanuel was forced to move left. He capped the number of new charter schools, cut back on TIF giveaways, backed a minimum wage hike, and dropped pension reform. The last was in part due to the teachers, but also in large part to secure a reelection endorsement from the firefighters’ union. Public-sector unionism looms large for both Emanuel and Chicago.

That leftward shift allowed Emanuel to squeak to reelection over Jesus “Chuy” Garcia in a 2015 runoff. Garcia, who will likely succeed Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez in the House next year, represents the mix of “democratic socialism” and identity politics on the rise in the Democrats’ urban strongholds. But Emanuel’s victory was Pyrrhic, burning enough political capital to make another term unlikely.

Emanuel’s fall illustrates the transformation of the Democratic Party in the Obama era. The party shrunk considerably, to a core of holdover urban machine politicians being overtaken by an activist base of identitarians and the far left.

We may not have Rahm Emanuel to kick around anymore. But if he makes a Nixonesque rise from the ashes, the role he would play in Democratic politics will likely find him acquiescent to what his party is becoming.

Why U.S. Democrats Should Be Worried About Sweden's Hard Right Turn,"The incredible strength of a far-right party in Sunday’s elections in Sweden should be a stunning wake up call for U.S. Democrats. Yes, Donald Trump’s election was also stunning, but in a sense what happened in Sweden goes far beyond.

A marginal party with obnoxious fascist roots came in third, with 17.6 percent of the vote, in elections in the country world famous for tolerance, open-mindedness, and liberalism. The larger parties say they will have nothing to do with the nationalist Sweden Democrat Party (not to be confused with the more dominant, liberal Social Democrat Party), whose voters are apparently the Swedish equivalents of “deplorables.”

Of course, in the same breath they say it is fine to ignore almost 18 percent of the population, even though shifting their votes rightward was the only way for voters to communicate to political leaders that they are unhappy with the direction the mainstream parties are taking the country.

If it can happen in Sweden, it can happen in the United States. U.S. Democrats may think Trump’s election is a transitory fluke caused by Electoral College idiosyncrasies, but Sweden offers pause. The Swedes don’t have an Electoral College. The critical question for Democrats at this point is, “What did it take to turn the most tolerant country in the world in the hard right direction?”

First, it wasn’t the economy. Many observers have noted that the Swedish economy is doing just fine right now. Thus, the ruling party should have been a shoo-in. Given that the economic success equals electoral success equation is almost a truism of politics everywhere, something else must be more important to a democratic electorate than even the economy.

What People Care About More than Money? Safety

What do people care about more than their economic security? Their physical security. A perception that “mayhem” is growing fosters a quest for a political power willing to acknowledge the mayhem and fight it. The liberal Swedish Social Democrats were not prepared to do either.

Back in 2016, I was writing on Sweden’s open-door policy towards migrants coming in the great wave of 2015. Knowing something about the societal effects of rendering a country’s young adult sex ratio seriously abnormal (the 2015 influx caused the Swedish 16- to 17-year-old age cohort to become more imbalanced than even China’s, with a calculated 123 males per 100 females), people warned me my comments would be branded as racist in Sweden.

I responded that it didn’t matter if everyone in the country was a native, blonde, blue-eyed Swede—any country with that kind of imbalanced sex ratio was asking for trouble. Regardless, academic peers in Sweden did accuse me of racism when my commentary was published.

As a follow-up, I was asked if my predicted trouble was actually occurring. I started digging into the Swedish crime records, only to find that at the turn of the 21st century the ruling center-left coalition government had decreed that it would collect no information about the origins of crime perpetrators. So even if you wanted to disprove that there was any link between Sweden’s immigration policy and its crime trends, you couldn’t. You couldn’t prove it, either.

The government’s Orwellian choice to make citizens ignorant so its society would not lapse into racism seemed to me, as an outsider, to be political suicide. Even if you couldn’t access any statistics on it, people were living the crime increase in their neighborhoods and homes. They would know what you didn’t want them to, even without precise numbers.

A Moderate Government Could Have Done This

When people literally cannot speak about their fears about their security, both because they would immediately be branded racist and because any information that could either disprove or prove the linkage was forbidden knowledge, you have basically told people their government has no concern for their personal security.

Average people do not take kindly to this conclusion. In reaction, they will seek a political force intolerant enough to want to know the facts and acknowledge reality. They will seek a political force intolerant enough to enforce order. With special regard to immigration, they will also seek a political force intolerant enough to insist on a sufficient level of assimilation to make that order possible.

The Swedish Social Democrats could have been that force. It is entirely possible to hew to principles of tolerance and liberalism yet be willing to face reality by acknowledging unpleasant facts and showing determined intolerance towards mayhem and refusal to assimilate. It is a failure of the imagination to suggest liberal political parties are incapable of such a stance: liberalism deserves better than what the Swedish Social Democrats offered their country.

Consider that in the new political landscape in Sweden, even the press has broken free from the accepted mindset that they used to salute. It was Swedish state TV that recently broke the story that nearly 60 percent of all convicted rapists since 2015 have been foreign-born and that 40 percent had been in Sweden for less than a year.

Finally acknowledging reality, finally allowing people to know the truth, was Social Democrats’ last, desperate measure, however, and it wasn’t enough. It came a day late and a dollar short, as they say.

The Implications for the United States

The question for Americans is whether the U.S. Democratic Party is smarter than its Swedish counterparts. Will the Democrats continue to drive average Americans rightward, as we saw in the 2016 election? Or can they learn from the 2018 Swedish election?

If U.S. Democrats were paying attention, they would begin to acknowledge fears about personal security that Americans have been voicing in recent years. They would acknowledge the crime illegal immigrants perpetrate and have a plan to combat it. They would acknowledge that border security is essential to that plan, whatever form they believe that increased security should take. They would disavow sanctuary cities as undermining Americans’ sense of security, which sense of insecurity tends to steer the country rightward.

They would also start listening to women and girls who feel insecure about their safety in restrooms and locker rooms where they are more than usually vulnerable. They would not house persons with penises in women’s prisons because they will have listened to women prisoners’ concerns.

They would also recognize that many good Americans feel far safer with guns than without and commit to safeguarding Second Amendment rights, while strengthening measures to keep guns out of the hands of those who have practiced domestic violence.

I’m an independent, but if I began hearing Democratic candidates talk like this, my ears would prick up. Unfortunately, I’m not hearing anything of the sort. I fear the Democrats may be as stunned in 2020 as the Swedish Social Democrats were this past Sunday.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/09/12/u-s-democrats-worried-swedens-hard-right-turn/,2018-09-12
My Rape Doesn’t Justify Punishing People Without Due Process,"Warning: sensitive content.

I walked past the same people at the front desk who had given me directions to the room where I had been raped shortly before. I was disheveled, my eyes were red from crying, and my clothes barely fit correctly as I rushed to rearrange them in the elevator to appear as normal as possible.

I was in a building filled with people, and my only thought was to get out as quickly as I could before anyone noticed me. I made eye contact with the girl at the front desk, who tilted her head slightly as I rushed by. I felt an instant wave of shame and fear. I even worried she might call the police, thinking I was a prostitute or perhaps someone on drugs.

I walked down the long sidewalk. It was late evening by then, and I was in more physical pain than I realized from the adrenaline pushing me out of the building. I slowed my walk for a moment, feeling a breeze, and I took in a deep, frustrated and embarrassed breath.

This was not supposed to happen to me. I was careful, I thought. I was a man. I was a gay man, and being assaulted in such a way wasn’t supposed to happen to us. I felt deeply ashamed, and in all the times I had rolled my eyes at characters in movies not immediately calling for help, I felt genuinely sick at my cowardice. But I kept walking. I had parked a few blocks away, and made it to my car safely anonymous.

I don’t remember going home, showering, or looking in the mirror that night. I don’t remember going to bed that night or thinking about what had just happened to me. I only remember looking at my computer screen at the open chat message showing the rapist’s cheerful excitement about my impending departure. I exited out, shut down my computer, and resolved never to look at it again.

The first person I told was also one of the first people I told I was HIV-positive. This person was the only one who asked how it had happened, and I let the story flood out in tears while gasping for air. The whole time I begged my confidante with my voice to understand that I did not want to be someone who had been raped.

My attacker was intoxicated, and possibly on drugs, as I remember his glassy eyes that seemed to look through me completely. Holding me down with his forearm on my neck, he told me he was infecting me with HIV. I still remember the aggressive passion in his voice that told me how much it excited him to say so.

I didn’t have to escape. Once he was finished, he behaved as though we had just enjoyed a fun time together. He sat down on a chair looking at me with pride and amusement. I remember feeling like I chose to leave and therefore hadn’t really been raped.

Maybe I was being too sensitive. Maybe I was being too prudish. Maybe I just didn’t understand what was supposed to happen in this kind of situation. I had met a complete stranger in a hotel room, after all. It was my fault.

I was no stranger to unwanted sexual encounters or situations in which I felt out of control. I had been with men I did not enjoy and had just waited for it all to be over before. This time was just more violent, painful, and extremely paralyzing. It was my fault for freezing. I must have given him reason to believe this was what I wanted, and I couldn’t deny him just because I had a momentary fear of what was happening. I felt like a fraud even suggesting the encounter was what other people describe as “rape.”

I was in denial for a long time. It took more effort to allow myself to accept that label than to accept what happened to me or the lifelong consequences that resulted. Ten years later, I still remember the terrifying feeling when someone said, “You were raped,” and what it meant to who I was as a person.

As might be apparent, I did not report the crime. By the time I found the courage to even verbalize what had happened, before I even accepted what it was, it was too late.

I beat myself up over and over, going through all of the things I did wrong that night that could have put that monster in jail. If I had just walked up to that front desk and asked them to call the police, they could have arrested him, gotten his DNA, and maybe convicted him. I could have gotten in my car and gone to the emergency room and told them, allowing them to do all the things experts know of in a safe place where people would have protected me.

I could have said or done something. But the more time passed, the more I realized my ability to prove what happened had faded into nothing, and I was terrified of the risk of reporting and being viewed with skepticism or outright judgment.

From TV, college classes, awareness campaigns, and so on, I believed the police would assume I was lying or had been doing something illegal, or simply dismiss me altogether. Besides, didn’t I agree to meet him? Didn’t I go to his room and walk in? Could I argue that there was no opportunity for me to fight my way out? Why didn’t I say anything while leaving the building?

While replaying the scene over and over, it felt less and less believable to someone from the outside. The question hanging in front of me that I feared most was, “Why didn’t you do anything to stop him?”

There is a good and valid reason sexual assault advocates so strongly fight questions about why a woman would not report her assault, wait so long, or not do anything to stop it. But there is also the recognition that, once a certain amount of time has passed and certain evidence is lost forever, there is no justice to be had.

There is a good and valid reason sexual assault advocates so strongly fight questions about why a woman would not report her assault.

This is a cold and objective truth that we too often overlook because of how unfair it is. Accusing a person requires proof, and the only time proof is available is immediately after the assault. After that, it becomes harder and harder to prove your story and, as the accuser, it is your responsibility to do so. To protect victims, too many advocates forget the importance of due process for everyone, equally.

There is also a moral and ethical obligation with recognizing what happened to you and the power you wield from your ability to accuse. If I stumbled upon the man who raped me, as I have often thought about, could I accuse him in public? Could I shout his name and the crime he committed against me that has redefined my concept of intimacy, autonomy, and lifelong health?

The answer is no, because I cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the man in front of me would be guilty of the crime I’d accuse him of, and he would be utterly defenseless to my accusation. I do not have the right to name a person, turn his life upside down, and ruin his reputation. It’s not because I am not entitled to justice but because I am simply unable to prove an assumed innocent man is guilty.

Survivors should be listened to. Our stories matter, and I have tried with more energy than I thought possible to share mine for the good of others, awareness, and honest debate. But I draw the line at accusation. My window to accuse closed before I even had the awareness to know it was an option, but that is reality.

It’s not because I am not entitled to justice but because I am simply unable to prove an assumed innocent man is guilty.

Regardless of how unfair and unjust it is to the person who survived, the person accused has an equal right to a fair and just trial. Accusation requires proof, and that proof must be scrutinized and evaluated. The truth is, I do not remember key details of this event, such as the date or what I was wearing, or even exactly what my attacker looked like. I remember his voice, the way he smelled of alcohol, the grip of his hand, but I do not remember his name or even his username. Memory is not perfect, and therefore it cannot be solely used as evidence.

I cannot tell you if a person’s account of his or her assault is valid or not. I cannot tell you to believe all survivors. But I can tell you that there is a difference between sharing your story and naming a person in an accusation. The longer a person waits to do so, the more scrutiny and skepticism is warranted.

Their story can, however, exist as a powerful tool of empathy, experience, and survival without exploiting the natural outrage people feel when discovering a villain they can target. The power of survival is using your voice to help other people survive and hopefully prevent the sense of helplessness you once felt.

But I do not believe we have immunity to accuse without consequence, and as a survivor I advocate due process and the concept of “innocent until proven guilty” more now than ever. Don’t blame a person for not reporting sooner, but don’t damn the accused to compensate for it.

Dems' New Anti-Gun Laws Are Also An Attack On Due Process,"The notion that certain Americans are preemptively guilty of wrongdoing, whether there’s any corroborating evidence to back up an accusation or not, isn’t reserved for conservatives who happen to be in contention for a Supreme Court seat. In the hierarchy of progressive values, due process is a bottom dweller.

Over the past decade, you could see the illiberalism evolving on college campuses, where Democrats subverted basic standards of justice. It was the Obama administration that demanded schools judge cases of alleged sexual assaults under a “clear and convincing evidence” rather than on a “preponderance of evidence,” allowing accusers to appeal “not guilty” findings, and permitting punishment to be meted out before any investigation was even conducted, among other big problems. Democrats are simply shepherding those corrosive standards into the real world.

Another area of American life where we continue to see egregious attacks on the presumption of innocence is gun ownership. You might remember that a couple of years ago Democrats engaged in a much-covered congressional “sit-in” to support legislation that would have stripped Americans who’d been placed on secret government watch lists — hundreds of thousands of people who had never been convicted, much less accused, of any crime — of their constitutional right to bear arms.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in fact, proposed legislation that would not only have restricted American citizens who found themselves on faulty watchlists today, but anyone who had been on any watchlist at any time during the past five years and anyone who had traveled to select Middle Eastern countries. Apparently, Democrats believe limiting the number of refugees from Syria is unconstitutional, but explicitly restricting the constitutional rights of legal immigrants who happen to be from Syria is just fine.

Then again, the entire effort was a frontal attack on about half the Bill of Rights. At the time, even the American Civil Liberties Union, which has increasingly turned away from its guiding principles, argued that policies based on flawed terror lists would undermine civil liberties.

In much the same way they are attempting to sink the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, Democrats relied on theatrics, bombastic rhetoric, and a compliant media, which framed the issue exactly how they had hoped. You can imagine such bills will reappear when they’re back in charge. Until then, though, Democrats have doing some gun grabbing—and I don’t mean it figuratively—on the local level.

California, a state that already features the strictest gun control laws in the country, just passed a bill that raises the allowable age to buy a shotgun or rifle from 18 to 21. The United States might be willing to hand weapons to young men and women who volunteer to protect their country, but Gov. Jerry Brown doesn’t believe those young men and women to be able to protect their own property or families.

An even more outrageous new law bans Californians who’ve been hospitalized more than once in a year for mental health issues from owning a gun.

Federal law already prohibits the sale of a gun to anyone who “has been adjudicated as a mental defective.” Until now, a person had an option to appealing the ban and showing “a preponderance of the evidence” that he would use firearms in “a safe and lawful manner.” Now, California bans one-time patients from owning firearms “for the remainder of his or her life.” This is an excellent way to stigmatize people who suffer from maladies that often have nothing to do with violence or criminality.

Now, I was going to ask the reader to imagine an alternative scenario, where Republicans pushed a bill prohibited those who have been in hospitals—for, say, nervous exhaustion or an addiction–from being able to freely express their opinions in public ever again. If a law-abiding American can be stripped of his Second Amendment rights, then why not the First? But then, these days, I imagine many Democrats would simply answer: “it depends on what the person is going to say.”

Another California law allows police to verbally ask to confiscate a guns, rather than making their case in a written request. Under “red flag laws,” guns can be confiscated from citizens who’ve never been charged, much less, convicted of breaking any law. And it’s getting easier and easier to do it.

Depending on the state, and many have them, all it takes is a family member, neighbor, or coworker to accuse you of a pre-crime. One of Maryland’s many new laws (signed by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan) allows the police to confiscate weapons for up to a year— or until the next person accuses you of a crime you are only yet to commit.

There is risible evidence that any of these new regulations will stop mass shootings or lower gun crime. But as William Rosen, deputy legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, explains, “red flag laws” are needed to “step into that gap.” What gap? You know, the pesky space between the protecting ideals like the presumption of innocence and completely ignoring it when you feel like it.

'Gosnell' Censors Don't Want You To See A Crime Drama About Abortion,"“Gosnell: The Trial of America’s Biggest Serial Killer” tells the story of Kermit Gosnell from the early stages of the police investigation into his abortion facility through the end of his court trial. Gosnell was an American doctor convicted of murdering babies born alive after abortions, of involuntary manslaughter for the death of a mother following an abortion in his facility, and of several felony counts of late-term abortion.

The film debuts across America Oct. 12, 2018, and chronicles the prosecution and police forces who worked to end Gosnell’s macabre abuses of women and children in Philadelphia. The true-crime film is based on a best-selling book written by a husband and wife team, Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinny, with a desire to tell the stories of all of the people hurt by the practices in Gosnell’s facility.

Despite the raging popularity of this genre, and book’s bestseller status, its movie faced significant roadblocks in funding, filming, and distribution, because of ideological opposition to its material—crimes in an abortion facility.

First, the Crowdfunding Difficulties

The film ran into issues with Kickstarter, a crowdfunding website the filmmakers initially planned to use to fund the movie’s development. The website kept taking down their page with complaints about the subject matter.

“Kickstarter tried to censor us—it didn’t work,” said McAleer. Kickstarter objected to phrases the film producers used to describe what Gosnell did, including “thousands of babies stabbed to death.” Kickstarter CEO Yancey Strickler, however, asserted that they would have allowed those words on the campaign.

“The creators replied with a spirited defense of the graphic depiction they wanted to include. We decided to bend our rules and give them [a] green light to launch at their convenience,” Strickler said about the wording of the campaign and his willingness to work with the film project.

Since disagreements with the phrasing and timing were delaying the progress with funding the film, however, the team relocated their efforts to IndieGoGo, another crowdfunding site. There the film raised $2.37 million, setting a record for the most money raised in a short time on the site.

The the Distribution Problems

Even after securing funding and actors willing to deal with the complicated and politically dangerous topics in the movie, its obstacles to production weren’t over. Creating a film is only part of getting it before consumers, and finding a distribution company proved just as difficult as the initial fundraising. Although the film was finished in October 2015 and release initially planned for 2016, it ultimately took another two years to release the film.

“Each one [distributor] would say: ‘Great, important film—just too controversial for us,'” McAleer said in a phone interview. In addition, the judge who had presided over Gosnell’s trial sued them to stop the release, adding additional delays. The lawsuit was settled, allowing the film to continue through the distribution process to its recent release.

What So Many People Don’t Want You to See

Spoilers below.

I knew Gosnell’s story well before viewing it, so I expected the film to be difficult to watch. It was both easier and harder to watch than a movie focusing on the grim subject of death, crime, and unrepentant evil should be. It’s well-written, beautifully filmed, and very well cast.

The movie opens with a woman in Gosnell’s facility taking a cell phone picture of something, later an important part of his trial. It cuts to Detective James Wood and Assistant District Attorney Lexy McGuire right before they are pulled into the case to do a raid on what they think is an illegal prescription drug operation.

The pacing is on point as the police, Drug Enforcement Administration, and FBI quickly realize that they’re not dealing with just a drug situation, and struggle to figure out how, or even whether, to proceed with a case certain to be politically full of systematic issues. How do you take on murder in an abortion facility without taking on abortion itself, and how do you take on an African-American abortion doctor without charges of racism?

Much of the movie depicts the lawyers’ initial legwork building a careful case and the law enforcement officers digging through disturbing and disgusting conditions. All of this is troubling but very watchable, especially for fans of any sort of procedural drama. The juxtaposition of the seriousness of Gosnell’s crimes with his jovial and soft-spoken demeanor is jarring and off-putting, perhaps best represented by him sitting down to play classical music on his piano as the police execute a search warrant on the premises, uncovering files and evidence of wrongdoing.

Far more emotional are the scenes of the grand jury, and later the courtroom. The testimony of Gosnell’s staff — untrained, often teenagers still in high school — who used handmade color-coordinated charts to administer powerful, custom-mixed drugs to patients without any doctor supervision is shocking. The attitude of a Department of Health nurse — who states that she did not investigate the facility because it would interfere with a woman’s right to choose, despite a thick stack of complaints and a large span of years since any onsite inspection had happened — is both depressing and perfectly showcases how politically motivated abortion facility regulations too often are.

The courtroom scenes are difficult, but not because they’re gory or salacious. Rather, the film keeps things clean and on the surface appropriate. No overt images are shown, no blood-covered baby bodies like you might expect in a film like this. The filmmakers do have a website with resources, including some of the more important visuals from the trial itself, like the referenced photograph of Baby Boy A.

But the emotional weight comes from the testimony itself, taken right from the actual case. When another doctor testifies that she has performed more than 30,000 abortions and never resorted to any of the tactics Gosnell used, it doesn’t make his actions more horrible, because they’ve been horrible all along. Rather, it reminds viewers that, even done cleanly and “safely,” an abortion results in a death.

Although the facts of the case have already been well laid out publicly, the movie does a good job of keeping suspense over the verdict high. Gosnell makes you pity the jurors listening to and viewing all of the evidence, but also the prosecution — the law enforcement agents forced to stare evil in its face and wonder if this evil will escape.

The line that sticks most in my mind after viewing this is one from McGuire to the District Attorney Dan Molinari on why she wanted to move forward with the case: “There’s nothing that man did illegally for 30 years that protects women or children. And you don’t have to be a pro-life activist to see that.”

A Reality Worse Than Fiction

It might be tempting to try to dismiss the horror of this case as overblown drama, but the reality is that this is a retelling of actual events, taken from court transcripts and the accounts of people who were there. The paper trail from the raid of the Women’s Medical Society by the DEA, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, The Pennsylvania Department of State, and the Pennsylvania Dangerous Drug Offender Unit lays out the shocking conditions of Gosnell’s facility as they found it.

The reports of the investigators to the grand jury described the state of the facilty as “filthy,” “deplorable,” “disgusting,” “very unsanitary, very outdated, horrendous,” and “by far, the worst” of the places they had seen. According to the report, there was blood on the floor, on the chairs, and on the blankets patients sat on.

As shown in the movie, women in the facility were sedated by unlicensed staff, working from handmade charts, with expired medication. Investigators compared patient care areas to a “bad gas station bathroom.” Proper inspections of the equipment were also lacking, leaving women who might need resuscitation in dangerous situations vulnerable—women like refugee Karnamaya Monger, who died after Gosnell botched her abortion.

In case all of this was not horrifying enough, investigators found the remains of aborted babies stored disrespectfully and unhygienically. Just as the movie showed, in Gosnell’s facility trash bags on the floor, milk jugs, the employee refrigerator, and orange juice containers all contained the remains of dead babies, and a row of jars containing the severed feet cut off of babies occupied a shelf. Gosnell told one of the detectives at this time that 10 to 20 percent of the babies were older than Pennsylvania’s legal age limit of 24 weeks’ gestation—also placing them over viability at the time of their deaths. Monger’s baby was still in the freezer, and 45 babies were removed from Gosnell’s facility, all deceased.

This film isn’t only a movie to see if you’re ardently pro-life. This is a movie for anyone interested in crime, in justice, in health care, and in reform. It’s an exercise in looking at what drives human desperation, but also how evil can hide in plain sight, rubber-stamped by those afraid to disturb the status quo, or worried that any oversight could lessen legal rights.

It’s a story that needs to be told, and in this telling was well-crafted, walking up to the line of where the viewer would need to turn away then pulling back, allowing the full story to be digested. It’s important to assess how these things can happen in plain sight, in an era of legal abortion, when for so long we’ve been told that it’s keeping abortion legal that keeps women safe.

Gosnell’s facility was legal, respected, and terribly unsafe for mothers and babies. If nothing else, this case, this film, and this story should cause people to question who is being served and helped, and who is being hurt by all this.

UPDATE: In a further conversation, McAleer told me more about both the film and he and his wife’s motivations in covering the story.Some of the most important and interesting parts of that interview are below.

On their motivations for making this movie and how they approached it: “We came at this from a journalistic point of view. It’s not a prolife film. It’s a journalistic film. It’s a fresh look at the story from a true crime angle.”

I asked about rumors that the filming process had changed the views of some of cast on abortion, and he told me, “It changed us—myself and Ann. We would have described ourselves before this as neutral on abortion. We now realize what that means. Neutral on abortion means pro-abortion. One of the actresses came up to us at a screening recently and said, ‘This changed me from prochoice to prolife.’ It’s almost just like at the trial. Everyone who was in the trial who was prochoice at the start had their faith in abortion shattered. And they became a lot more—I’m not saying they all became prolife- but they all became very skeptical of the prochoice position.”

He told me as well about his feelings on the prolife movement before beginning the project, “I always thought that those pictures were photoshopped. I didn’t trust prolife pictures that I saw. I think that what the strong point of this film is that it’s based on court room testimony. There’s no photoshopping, there’s no political slogans, there’s no grandstanding, everyone has to tell the truth. And when people hear the truth and research it they’ll be going, ‘Oh, I didn’t know that’. Planned Parenthood has done a great job of sowing mistrust of the prolife community. Of saying ‘Don’t trust those people, they’re lying.’ This will show what these abortion people said under oath in court.”

I asked him about their main goal for this story and film, “Telling the truth, actually. People can do with that truth whatever they want. But it’s important for them to have the facts first.”

I asked about media coverage, and lack thereof, on stories like this, and why he thinks that happens. He responded, “I think most journalists are prochoice. Some of them are abortion zealots and advocates, many of them are casually prochoice. So, they avoid anything that will tell the truth about abortion. You can see that from their failure to cover the trial. I think they want to keep the unpleasant facts hidden because they fear both the law and public opinion.”

Finally, I asked what was most important for people to know before they saw this film: “Before they go in, I want them to know that it is not gory, it’s PG-13, it’s a ‘Law and Order’ episode. Don’t be worried about things you might see—there’s nothing to see. Coming out of it, I’d like them to know that it is heavily, heavily, heavily based on trial transcripts. The crazy bits in it that you think we made up are not made up, they’re true.”

Should Florida Restore Voting Rights For Former Felons?,"Last week, I attended an event in South Florida hosted by the pro-Trump Club 45 Palm Beach County and Turning Point USA, co-hosted by the group’s founder, Charlie Kirk, and communications director, Candace Owens.

A topic of conversation was Florida’s Amendment 4, which would restore voting rights to 1.5 million ex-felons who have completed their sentences, with the exception of convicted murderers and sex offenders. To pass, 60 percent of voters must vote “yes.”

As a Florida resident, I believe the legislation is likely to pass. If it does, though, what does that mean for future America First––and Florida First––legislation?

Here’s the Case For the Amendment

The amendment is on the ballot due to efforts by the non-profit Floridians for a Fair Democracy, which is primarily bankrolled by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). That alone will raise suspicions among those who may be sympathetic to the amendment’s goal, but distrustful of the ACLU––an organization that increasingly ignores the “L” in its name in favor of partisan objectives.

Florida is one of 13 states that restrict voting rights after an ex-felon has completed a prison sentence, and is no longer on probation or parole; nationwide, six million Americans can’t vote as a result of felony convictions. Supporters of Amendment 4 argue that while ex-felons did the crimes, they also did their time, and re-enfranchisement will offer a true second chance.

To get a proposed amendment on the ballot, a petition must be signed by 766,200 voters, and the signatures must come from at least 14 of Florida’s 27 congressional districts. More than one million signatures were collected by Floridians for a Fair Democracy, led by Desmond Meade, who was convicted of drug crimes, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm. Meade, who now holds a law degree, has garnered the attention of TV personality Samantha Bee and entertainer John Legend for his activism.

Critics of Florida’s clemency system have labeled it as racist as Jim Crow laws, not to mention unconstitutional, claiming that ex-felons are “permanently” barred from voting. In addition to their re-entry into the state, local, and national democratic process, advocates of the amendment have also touted the alleged economic benefits the change might have.

The right-leaning Coral Gables, Florida, Washington Economics Group recently estimated that since 2011, Florida has lost $2.7 billion from court costs, job loss, and recidivism due to ex-felons’ inability to vote. Considering that Florida has the fourth-largest state economy in the United States, ranked first in fiscal strength last year (fourth this year) in George Mason University’s annual rankings, and was just named America’s freest state by the Cato Institute, nearly $3 billion is a big deal.

The reasoning goes: if ex-felons have paid their criminal debt to society, why restrict their ability to contribute to society and their own neighborhoods, politically and economically? At Floridians for a Fair Democracy’s Web site, there are numerous stories of ex-felons and those never convicted of crimes who worked to get the amendment on the ballot, including data about the nearly 4,000 Florida military veterans whose voting rights would be restored if the amendment passes.

Elsewhere throughout the country, many states are less restrictive than Florida. In Maine and Vermont, felons never lose their right to vote; in 14 states and the District of Columbia, restoration of the right to vote is automatic upon sentence completion; and in 21 states, felons cannot vote while incarcerated, and for a period of time while on parole or probation. Florida is leading the charge on denying ex-felons their ability to vote.

Here’s the Case Against the Amendment

Why do so many states have such differing policies? And how is it constitutional to prohibit felons from voting after sentence completion? In short: states’ rights.

In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3, in Richardson v. Ramirez, that barring felons from voting did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The court also left the finer details of what to do to the individual states. Richardson reversed the California Supreme Court’s decision, which had previously ruled that felony disenfranchisement was unconstitutional.

Not helping the Amendment 4 proponents’ cause is a misinformed narrative about how Florida currently handles voting rights for ex-felons. A common talking point is that ex-felons are permanently banned from voting in Florida, but that’s not exactly accurate. An ex-felon must wait for five years post-sentence completion before he or she can apply for a review at the state’s Office of Executive Clemency, which has limited resources and can take years.

So could it take a decade to regain voting rights, subject to approval by bureaucrats? Yes, and while it’s certainly not automatic, and may be much longer than an ex-felon wants, it’s not exactly “permanent.” This policy was put into place seven years ago by current Gov. Rick Scott, who overturned a more lenient policy enacted by his predecessor, Charlie Crist. Annually, Scott and his cabinet hear between 25 and 300 clemency cases; about half regain their right to vote in due time. There’s a backlog of 12,000 cases.

The most visible and vocal statewide opponent to Amendment 4 is non-profit Floridians for a Sensible Voting Rights Policy, headed by Richard Harrison, a Tampa-based attorney. Harrison’s group argues that Amendment 4 is too broad in scope. The amendment is bad policy, it argues, because it makes no distinction between one-time offenders and repeat felons, and fails to consider the original crime and charges before any plea deals.

Perhaps the amendment’s most significant Achilles heel isn’t what’s stated in its text, but what isn’t stated. If it fails, I believe it will be because of the belief that ex-felons will overwhelmingly vote Democrat, and also because there is no lifetime voting rights disqualifier for ex-felons who are again convicted of the same, or different, felony crime. Given that there is Supreme Court precedent on the opponents’ side, I believe a lifetime ban could pass constitutional muster.

Amendment 4 Is Heavily Politicized

What, you thought this issue was free of politics?

In the midst of all this, there is also a lingering debate about whether restoring voting rights will reduce recidivism rates, and whether this is a Democrat power grab. In addition to being denied their right to vote, Florida felons cannot legally own a firearm (although this is national policy), and cannot serve on a jury. The amendment only addresses the right to vote; critics and skeptics have asked why there has been only a push to restore voting rights, not to restore ex-convicts’ ability to serve on juries.

Crist took credit for lower recidivism rates from 2007 to 2010, allegedly due to a quicker process to restore voting rights; before 2007, recidivism rates hovered around 33 percent. Once Crist’s policy took effect, two-year rates were 12.4 percent, and three-year recidivism rates were 26.3 percent. Scott, who is challenging incumbent Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson this fall, disputes that rates dropped due to a restoration of rights, citing Florida Clemency Board data, which showed that rates had been consistently decreasing. Scott has also said that strict clemency guidelines have likely made Florida a safer state, and have not adversely affected Florida’s economy and tax revenue.

Advocates of the amendment have trouble explaining on last point: the “nonviolent” selling point. Although the adjective “nonviolent” isn’t in the amendment’s text, it’s often used in its marketing and promotion. What percentage of nonviolent ex-felons committed violent crimes, but were sentenced on lesser charges? The answer in Florida is unclear, but with 1.5 million ex-felons, it’s a reasonable assumption that at least some percentage committed violent crimes before plea deals.

For example, an ex-felon serving a sentence for attempted murder isn’t a murderer, but is still violent, and would be granted his or her voting rights if Amendment 4 passes. An ex-felon who originally conspired to commit armed robbery, but was thwarted by law enforcement might not be any less violent than an actual armed robber. Unfortunately, this line has been blurred by proponents of the amendment.

Will Ex-Felons Only Vote For Democrats?

I suspect most Florida conservatives will vote “no.” Right-leaning independents (called NPAs, or No Party Affiliation) are probably evenly split. Conservatives are a law and order bunch, and many are certain that Florida’s ex-felons would overwhelmingly vote Democrat.

The perception is strong, but the data to back it up is inconsistent and outdated. A 2002 study in The American Sociological Review hypothesized that felons would have voted Democrat 70 percent of the time. The study also estimated that seven out of 400 U.S. Senate races may have flipped from red to blue, between 1970 and 1998, had felons been able to vote nationwide. Whether ex-felons voting could have tipped the 2000 presidential election from George W. Bush to Al Gore is hard to say.

It’s also debatable if the majority of ex-felons would even register to vote.

Ex-felons will know in three weeks if they’ll be eligible to vote beginning in 2019. If the amendment fails, most Republicans will breathe a sigh of relief. But if it passes, Republicans will have a new bloc of voters to whom they can promote America First and Florida First legislation and candidates. No matter the outcome, perhaps all Floridians can agree that the amendment’s fate will be decided in the most democratic way: by the will of the people.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/10/17/florida-restore-voting-rights-former-felons/,2018-10-17
LGBT Media Runs With 'Hate Crime' Stories Despite Red Flags,"The need for a powerful narrative, regardless of the truth behind it, is something we have seen grow more influential on the left. Narratives drive politics, but narrative has become a defining feature of how progressives view themselves and approach the concept of “truth.”

Within the LGBT world, this is even more pronounced. The desire to be viewed as a courageous victim has overtaken aspirations of equality and normalcy. LGBT media particularly appears to be dedicated to this singular narrative above all else.

On October 12, various media outlets reported that Morgan McMichaels, a drag queen on the TV show “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” allegedly broke his hand punching a Nazi after being threatened as a gay man. McMichaels shared an Instagram photo of himself and his cast, and wrote, “I was approached by a man at the store who informed me that he was a Nazi and he wanted to cut my f—-t throat after he took a swing I obliged him and finished the fight…. this f—-t will not be victimized.”

Why Didn’t Reporters Dig Deeper?

Over the next few days, every major LGBT website reported the story. But none of the reports went beyond the initial Instagram post and follow-up, in which McMichaels shows off a newly bedazzled cast while continuing to praise himself for overcoming adversity.

While a few noted that he has not commented further, and no police report has yet been filed, very little due diligence has been done. No witnesses were reported and no footage from onlookers or the store have been mentioned. Beyond the description of “Nazi,” the alleged instigator of the exchange was not described in detail, nor were any details presented of the verbal altercation itself, the extent of the fight, or how it ended.

The single source for this story comes from an individual’s sole claim, and LGBT media seems uninterested in looking into it any further. McMichaels is simply praised for fighting hate, no questions asked.

While more details could emerge to shed light on the incident, it would seem odd to the casual observer that a random gay man in Los Angeles would be confronted by a random Nazi who self-identified as such then proceeded to attack him, unprovoked, in public. On its face, the situation is suspicious, but to continue the narrative to include a public melee so dramatic it caused a broken hand without a single witness or detail is absurd.

Obviously, McMichaels must have visited a hospital to get a cast, but presumably the hospital staff would have asked how his injury was caused. If he had indicated that he had just been assaulted in a public hate crime, the police would have been involved.

The story simply does not make sense. Yet with a combined 200,000-plus likes on Instagram, it is quickly becoming solidified in the overarching narrative of anti-LGBT hate crimes. As Mic editor Evan Ross Katz, pointed out in a celebratory tweet, “Morgan McMichaels wearing an ‘I PUNCH NAZIS’ shirt during a gig, then punching an actual nazi who tried attacking her and THEN having her cast stoned is today’s mood.” If the story is indeed fabricated, it would make sense, and McMichaels might have a motive.

Anecdotal Stories Must Be Verified

In a similar story from October 15, Out.com reported, “Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon has become a powerful role model for young LGBTQ people. But even he faces homophobia.” Rippon stated, “I was walking in New York City and was holding my boyfriend’s hand,” he said.

“Some guy came up to us and said, ‘I hate f*****s’, then ran away. I just said, ‘That’s so sad that somebody would still want to do that.’” He went on to lament that during the Olympics he feared looking at any tweet with an American flag emoji as “…It was always something nasty, and it was always something homophobic.”

Again, without the slightest bit of interest in evaluating the claims presented, LGBT media simply asserted the account was true and representative of what LGBT people routinely face. While New York City is a highly diverse place, it is also one of the most liberal and gay-friendly cities in the country. Surely two men holding hands in public is not an unusual sight there, yet a random homophobe chose to shout that at them? While this certainly could have happened, LGBT media seems uninterested in critically looking at the narrative itself or asking additional questions.

While anecdotal stories are useful and do not require the same level of evidence as an accusation, they must still be reasonably evaluated. Did Rippon receive unkind tweets? Of course he did, he was a highly controversial figure during a major news cycle.

But the assertion that average Americans celebrating their country made him “fearful” acts only to confirm prejudice. The weight of his voice as an LGBT icon means his words have more influence and therefore hold more responsibility. Claiming to be a victim of a hate crime on pure narrative alone creates fear and hatred in the LGBT world when it is possible the event never happened at all.

Linked within the McMichaels story was a similar alleged hate crime that occurred in April 2018 when two drag queens were touring in England. The report claimed a random drunk girl began using anti-gay slurs towards the two men, who began to respond with equal viciousness, as recorded on a nearby phone. While no anti-LGBT slurs are heard, one of the drag queens shouted at the girl, “We’re touring the world being gay while you’re living in Newcastle with your crusty a– eyelashes.”

The article, which claimed the female perpetrator was engaging in “hate,” quoted her as screaming, “You’re a walking STD.” Despite what is clearly a mutual altercation between two equally vicious parties, the article laments, “Still, it’s 2018 and gay people can get slurs shouted at them in public. No matter how great anyone’s response is, it’s scary that it happened at all.”

Does Truth Matter Anymore?

All of this reminds me of a 2013 article in The Advocate, an LGBT magazine, titled “Have We Got Matthew Shepard All Wrong?” by Aaron Hicklin, who was reviewing a controversial book by gay author Stephen Jimenez, titled “The Book of Matt.” The book was a breakthrough in Shepard narrative, revealing through extensive interviews and research that Shepard was likely the victim of a drug-related crime with men he had previously engaged in sex with, rather than the brutal anti-gay hate crime immortalized in his name.

Hicklin says, “All that soul-searching may have felt necessary, especially in light of the legislation the case inspired, but was it helpful in getting at the truth? Or did our need to make a symbol of Shepard blind us to a messy, complex story that is darker and more troubling than the established narrative?” He goes on, “There are valuable reasons for telling certain stories in a certain way at pivotal times, but that doesn’t mean we have to hold on to them once they’ve outlived their usefulness.”

He finishes by providing insight from Dale Carpenter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, which should be a startling and disturbing realization for those of us passionate about equality under the law: “the notorious case of Lawrence v. Texas, in which the arrest of two men for having sex in their own bedroom became a vehicle for affirming the right of gay couples to have consensual sex in private. Except that the two men were not having sex, and were not even a couple. Yet this non-story, carefully edited and taken all the way to the Supreme Court, changed America.”

We cannot trust the media to portray events as they occur but rather as they are useful in a larger social story. While this reflects much of the concern the right has regarding the media as a whole, within the LGBT world it also profoundly affects individuals and their sense of safety and equality. Each story, hastily reported with minimal (if any) fact-checking fuels panic, fear, paranoia, and most importantly, hatred towards people who are otherwise accepting and tolerant.

When every LGBT source repeats the same story without critical evaluation, it creates the perception that these situations happen regularly. Each strengthens the next through repetition, until they all resemble what feels like the truth, if not only evidenced by their sheer number and frequency. Without a critical media, these stories become fictional tales, useful for political gain.

With enough passion and outrage, these fictional stories become the truth of a generation, even if they were never true at all. What is striking is the degree to which LGBT media does not seem to care.

Why The DOJ Shouldn’t Prosecute Russians For Posts About U.S. Politics,"Perhaps you thought we would make it through the midterms without the U.S. Department of Justice taking sides by criminalizing political speech and advocacy from undesirable sources. You would be wrong. On Friday, the department (DOJ) issued a breathless indictment of a Russian national for engaging in a “conspiracy to defraud” the United States by facilitating the posting of political speech on the internet under assumed or anonymous names.

You may be thinking, “Why would I care if the DOJ prosecutes Russians for posting political speech on social media?” Russians make excellent villains, with their “menacing” accents and fetish for invading other countries. The answer dates back to the very origins of free speech itself: If you don’t protect offensive speech by stinky and offensive people, then you don’t have free speech at all.

This is why the American Civil Liberties Union (an organization that formerly supported civil liberties) defends neo-Nazis. This is why that monster Fred Phelps was allowed to protest at funerals for fallen servicemen. So if you’re a Department of Justice interested in taking control of political speech, you don’t start with the popular comic John Oliver. You start with the obscure and unpopular Russian Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could benefit from listening to one of his own speeches about the rule of law. He once accurately stated, “It is important to keep in mind that the rule of law is not just about prosecuting people who violate our laws. It is also about protecting people who offend our sensibilities.”

Let’s Look at the DOJ’s Case Here

Let’s consider the complaint affidavit the DOJ filed in the Eastern District of Virginia. First, this new DOJ villain is not, to my reading, actually charged with a crime. She has been charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. 371, the conspiracy statute. The word “conspiracy” sounds sinister, but it only means an agreement to commit another crime. If you and I engage in a conspiracy to have a picnic, the DOJ has to find a law that prohibits picnics before it can allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. 371.

So what is the law that Khusyaynova allegedly conspired to violate? The DOJ’s theory is that Khusyaynova failed to register as a “foreign agent” with the DOJ before conspiring to engage in political speech. Its argument is that Khusyaynova helped make a “contribution or donation” to Republicans by managing the budgeting and payments for various Russian companies that operated social media pages, “designed to attract U.S. audiences and to address divisive U.S. political and social issues or advocate for the election or electoral defeat of particular candidates.”

The DoJ says Khusyaynova is required by law to register in the United States as a foreign agent and disclose to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) any money spent on political speech.

DOJ uses two preposterous applications of the law to charge this political speech as a crime. First, it argues that 22 U.S.C. 611 and 22 U.S.C. 612 require a resident of Russia who apparently has never set foot in America to register as a foreign agent in the United States if she helps buy political ads in the United States.

As I and others have written before, this law (the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA) is a scofflaw that the DOJ has apparently only used to pursue its non-leftist political opponents and never before used against somebody who never came to America. It specifically requires the “agent’s” actions to take place within the United States, implying the physical presence of the agent, which the DOJ has not alleged in this case.

Second, the DOJ is characterizing all political ads that support any candidate for political office as a contribution subject to regulation and disclosure to the FEC. Yet this theory has been clearly struck down by the Supreme Court, which ruled that buying political ads that are not coordinated with a candidate is protected political speech.

Foreigners Should Have Free Speech, Too

Foreign access to the American marketplace of ideas, particularly during elections, is not only legal under the First Amendment, it’s desirable. We Americans should not be forced to consume only news sources that are on the DOJ’s approved list. It matters not that these foreigners spoke under assumed or fake names.

Consider Simon Pegg, a British-born actor whose real name is Simon Beckingham. Did he commit a crime by speaking out against Donald Trump? Or what about that Brit, Reginald Kenneth Dwight, who meddled in American politics by encouraging the president to change his stance on AIDS research? You probably know him as Sir Elton John.

Foreign agent Mike Myers, known for his character Dr. Evil, committed Russian-like evil by meddling in American politics when he used his character to slam Trump. Foreigners Seth Rogan and Russell Peters also violated the DOJ’s theory of FARA by speaking out against President Trump.

Did any of these sinister foreigners register with the Department of Justice or report to the FEC before saying things that were “designed to attract U.S. audiences and to address divisive U.S. political and social issues or advocate for the election or electoral defeat of particular candidates?” Of course not. These are popular speakers whose speech does not offend the DOJ’s political bias. Thus, they may safely express themselves under the unwritten but widely known left-wing immunity to the DOJ’s prosecution of political speech.

Then the DOJ Ignores Actual Collusion

The choking irony about all of this is that former DOJ No. 4 Bruce Ohr colluded with foreign national Christopher Steele to interfere in the 2016 election while apparently breaking actual non-speech laws. Ohr nevertheless remains gainfully employed by the agency entrusted with enforcing the very laws he appears to have broken. But Ohr aligned with the left, so his actions go unpunished.

Rosenstein, who effectively runs the Department of Justice and undoubtedly signed off on this theory of prosecution, can be quoted to illustrate the principles that this prosecution so obviously violates. Rosenstein says he opposes selective prosecution of speech based upon viewpoint. For example, he told one audience, “We use the term ‘rule of law’ to describe our obligation to follow neutral principles.” On another occasion, he stated: “We govern ourselves in accordance with the rule of law rather [than] according to the whims of an elite few or the dictates of collective will.”

But this Rosenstein statement, most of all, illustrates that wrongheadedness of this kind of prosecution:

In the Robert Bolt play that I mentioned, Thomas More tells his son-in-law, William Roper, that the rule of law is so important that he would never deviate from it, even to kill the Devil. Roper insists that he would cut down every law, if necessary, to destroy the Devil. More replies, ‘Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you — where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?… [I]f you cut them down — and you’re just the man to do it — d’you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?’ More concludes, ‘Yes, I’d give the Devil the benefit of law, for my own safety’s sake.’

Trust the free market of ideas. We have far more to fear from government “protecting” us from dangerous ideas than we do from the ideas themselves. The answer to offensive or false speech is more speech, not criminal prosecution.

Russia may seem like the Devil. But if you put the Department of Justice in control of prosecuting the Devil’s speech, you will have surrendered your own protection when the “whims of an elite few or the dictates of collective will” turn on you.

Rosenstein talks the talk. Now if we could only get him to walk the walk.

Here's What The Media's Not Telling About That Criminal Justice Bill,"Last week, news broke that a bipartisan compromise on criminal justice reform had been tentatively reached, teeing up the First Step Act for passage before Congress’ lame-duck session ends next month. The House-passed version of the bill has been stalled for more than five months, but a behind-the-scenes agreement to add sentencing reform to the prison reform package has given new life to the legislation.

President Trump quickly embraced the news, telling lawmakers to get the bill on his desk. “Did I hear that word ‘bipartisan’? Did I hear that word? That’s a nice word,” Trump quipped at a White House event, surrounded by lawmakers from both parties and his son-in-law-turned-advisor, Jared Kushner, who had been pushing the legislation. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told Trump there may not be enough time for the Senate to take up the bill before the legislative session ends on December 14.

Over the weekend, McConnell’s Republican colleagues, Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul, hit the Sunday circuit to pressure Senate leaders to move the legislation forward before the year-end recess. Advocates for the legislation, such as Justice Action Network, the nation’s largest bipartisan group pushing criminal justice reform, are likewise pushing the Senate majority leader to bring the First Step Act to the floor.

‘Big Government Run Amok’

“Our current criminal justice system is big government run amok,” said Lauren Krisai, a senior policy analyst with the Justice Action Network. Krisai calls the First Step Act a chance to “begin to correct that in a meaningful way,” adding that “with the support of President Trump, the Fraternal Order of Police, faith groups, advocacy groups, and legislators from both sides of the aisle, there’s really no excuse for Leader McConnell to not put this important bill on the floor.”

Not all Republican senators support this legislation. Last week, in an op-ed for USA Today, first-term Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton called the act “a misguided effort to let serious felons out of prison.” Rather than pass it, Cotton suggested Congress first clean out the overreaching federal code and federal regulations which together create as many as 300,000 criminal violations. The junior senator from Arkansas also argued that the criminal code needs harsher sentences for fentanyl traffickers to address the current opioid crisis.

With less than a month until Congress recesses, the fate of the bill likely depends on whether the feel-good criminal justice reform narrative takes hold or whether the “weak on crime” counter establishes a foothold in the public’s consciousness. Unfortunately, while the dueling narratives compete for media space, the substantive details of the proposed changes remain ignored, with the press providing only cursory coverage of the legal changes the compromise bill would adopt.

For instance, The New York Times reported: “the compromise would eliminate the so-called stacking regulation that makes it a federal crime to possess a firearm while committing another crime, like a drug offense; expand the ‘drug safety valve’ allowing judges to sidestep mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders; and shorten mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.”

Are Journalists Even Reporting This Correctly?

The first compromise listed in the Times write-up struck a strange cord: Why would Democrats, who push for more gun control, seek to eliminate a crime related to the possession of a firearm? And why would Republicans, who object to the government infringing on law-abiding citizens’ right to bear arms in the name of combating gun violence, seek to protect criminals from punishment for possessing a gun?

The answer took some time to discover but is simple enough: They don’t. Contrary to the Times’ superficial reporting, the proposed compromise does not eliminate the sentencing enhancement for possession a firearm while committing another offense. Rather, the floated change would add a minor tweak to the governing law to assure that first-time offenders are not treated the same as repeat offenders. Let’s break it down.

The statutory provision at issue, Section 924(c) of the federal code, provides for an additional five years in prison for a defendant who possesses a gun during a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. For the second (and each subsequent offense), 25 additional years of imprisonment is tacked on to the sentence for the underlying crime. These additional terms of imprisonment are mandatory.

As currently interpreted by the Supreme Court, the five-year and 25-year mandatory sentencing enhancements of Section 924(c) are accumulated or “stacked” in the same trial. Thus, if a defendant is convicted of multiple counts of possessing a gun during a crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense, the judge must add five years to the defendant’s sentence for the first count, then 25 years for the second and all future counts of conviction—even though the convictions all stem from the same trial.

The Reform Poster Boy Isn’t What He’s Been Portrayed

Weldon Angelos has become the poster boy for those pushing to change Section 924(c). In 2004, 24-year-old Angelos was sentenced to 55 years in federal prison for possessing a handgun when he sold a few hundred dollars’ worth of marijuana to an undercover informant on three separate occasions.

Under Section 924(c), possession of the gun during the first sale resulted in a mandatory five-year sentence, but the second sale triggered an additional 25-year sentence, as did the third sale. Thus, for possessing a gun while selling about $1,000 worth of marijuana, Angelos received a 55-year prison sentence, although he was later released from prison in 2016, apparently when the federal prosecutor failed to object to Angelos’ motion for a reduced sentence.

The statutory language of the proposed change to Section 924(c)—leaked to The New York Times—is minor, but would have significant consequences to those similarly situated. The relevant provision of the proposed legislation would clarify that second and later convictions would only trigger the 25-year mandatory sentencing enhancement if the first conviction had already become “final.”

A conviction becomes final only after the right to appeal has expired, so under the amendment a defendant, such as Angelos, would receive a five-year mandatory sentence under Section 924(c) for possessing a gun during a drug deal, assuming he had no prior convictions at the time of the trial. That five-year sentence would then be on top of whatever sentence stemmed from the underlying drug offense. But the additional 25 years of imprisonment would not be stacked on top unless the defendant commits another crime.

This proposed change seems imminently reasonable. As Brett L. Tolman, the U.S. attorney for the district of Utah at the time Angelos was sentenced, explained, “the draconian sentence mandated for Angelos seemed disconnected to the purpose of the law.” Now an advocate for criminal justice reform and an attorney in private practice in Utah, Tolman noted that Congress intended Section 924 to punish those with prior convictions more severely, but in practice first-time offenders, such as Angelos, receive sentences far exceeding those needed for retribution or rehabilitation.

While Angelos’ case highlights an apparent injustice with the functioning of Section 924(c), the unreported facts underlying Angelos’ conviction raise another question for Congress and the public to consider: How harshly should criminals who possess guns be sentenced?

Every time there is a mass shooting, gun control activists demand more gun laws, implying that if only the United States had commonsense gun laws, gun violence would not occur. But what of the criminals who possess guns? And possess them illegally?

There’s Much More to the Angelos Story

This is where “the rest of the story” comes in to play. Although the press loves to portray Angelos as a young family man—the father of two small children—and an up-and-coming record producer who inadvertently got caught up in a drug sting, the court records tell a different story.

First, in addition to the three Section 924 gun possession counts that triggered the 55-year sentence, a jury convicted Angelos on 13 other counts, including money-laundering, two counts of possessing a stolen firearm, and one count of possessing a firearm which had its serial number filed off. While Angelos technically qualified as a first-time offender, he would be better described as an offender caught for the first time as an adult.

Angelos had a previous juvenile conviction on a felony firearm charge and a long juvenile arrest record for a number of other offenses. Additionally, according to the appellate court decision, the drug sales that hit Angelos with the 55-year mandatory minimum were sales to a confidential informant who was “a fellow gang member.” Far from dealing drugs on the side, the evidence indicated that Angelos had sold drugs regularly for several years.

A search of Angelos’ apartment also resulted in the seizure of three pounds of marijuana, a Glock 17 9mm handgun, a Ruger P85 9mm handgun, and a Walther PPK .380 handgun, as well as a large cache of cash. A later search of a house Angelos rented uncovered several large duffle bags containing marijuana residue, a bulletproof vest, another handgun, and a Bushmaster XM15-E2S—an assault weapon in the parlance of the gun control crowd. The reality of Angelos’ background is much more troubling than the media and some proponents of this legislation would have you believe.

Yet while much of the media portrays Angelos’ history sympathetically, Tolman harbors no such illusions. “None of the prosecutors involved in the case viewed Angelos’ criminal conduct naively,” Tolman noted. “He was definitely on a dangerous road at the time he was arrested, but a 55-year sentence is crazy.” At the same time, Tolman admits that Angelos’ nearly lifetime sentence likely served as a wakeup call, prompting the young man to turn his life around following his release from prison.

As Tolman sees it, the suggested amendment to Section 924 and the other changes proposed in the compromise floated for the First Step Act strike a necessary balance: “All of the changes proposed address problems with the current sentencing code, while assuring prosecutors retain the tools necessary to obtain tough sentences for dangerous criminals.”

We will soon know whether Congress also sees the First Step Act as striking the appropriate balance between deterrence and punishment and justice. The bigger question, though, may be for Second Amendment advocates and gun control activists to debate: How can we, as a country, enforce the many commonsense gun laws already on the books without resorting to lifetime sentences for criminals?

The Judge Was Right: It’s States’ Job To Outlaw Female Genital Mutilation,"Yesterday a Detroit-based federal judge dismissed criminal charges lodged against eight defendants for their alleged role in the female genital mutilation (FGM) of nine young girls. The presiding judge, Ronald Reagan-appointee Bernard Friedman, concluded that Congress lacked the power to pass 18 U.S.C. § 116, the federal statute that criminalizes FGM at the national level.

The multi-count indictment had charged Dr. Jumana Nagarwala with performing the procedure at a Livonia, Michigan clinic owned by co-defendant Dr. Fakhruddin. Farida Attar and Tahera Shafiq, who assisted Nagarwala in performing the procedure, were also named co-defendants and charged with conspiring to commit FGM and aiding and abetting in the commission of the crime. The girls’ mothers were also charged, including two Minnesota women who allegedly “tricked their 7 -year-old daughters into thinking they were coming to metro Detroit for a girls’ weekend, but instead had their genitals cut.”

It should go without saying that FGM is a horrific procedure and when inflicted on a minor constitutes a grievous form of child abuse. That said, Friedman reached the correct legal conclusion in dismissing the FGM and conspiracy charges. Here’s why.

The federal government is a government of limited and enumerated powers and thus may only criminalize (or regulate) conduct if granted authority to do so in the U.S. Constitution. Abuse or assault are part of the criminal law, and the heart of state power. The federal government could criminalize transporting girls across state lines to obtain FGM, but the federal statute under which the defendants were prosecuted does not do so now, so this is currently a matter for the states. While Michigan was remiss in not having a law against this, it cannot be applied retroactively

The government argued Congress had the power to criminalize FGM based on two distinct theories. First, the government argued that Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, of the federal Constitution, which gives the president “Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur,” provided Congress the authority to criminalize FGM.

The federal prosecutors then pointed to two provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the Senate ratified in 1992: Article 3, which directs signatories to “ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant”; and Article 24, which provides that “[e]very child shall have, without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth, the right to such measures of protection as are required by his status as a minor, on the part of his family, society and the State.” The government then argued that criminalizing FGM was “necessary and proper” to carry out these two treaty obligations.

Friedman rejected the government’s reliance on the 1992 treaty, concluding that criminalizing FGM was unrelated to Article 3’s “equal rights” protection and Article 24’s non-discrimination mandate. He further reasoned that even if the treaty could be read so broadly, “federalism concerns deprive Congress of the power to enact this statute.” As Friedman aptly explained, “The constitutional processes in the United States include the important – indeed, foundational – division of authority between the states and the federal government.”

Here, Friedman pointed to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations report, which, in recommending the Senate ratify the treaty, stated “that this Convention shall be implemented by the Federal Government to the extent that it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the matters covered therein, and otherwise by the state and local governments; to the extent that state and local governments exercise jurisdiction over such matters, the Federal Government shall take measures appropriate to the Federal system to the end that the competent authorities of the state or local governments may take appropriated [sic] measures for the fulfillment of the Convention.”

The Bush administration likewise clarified that “even though the Covenant will apply to state and local authorities, it will be implemented consistent with U.S. concepts of federalism. The proposed understanding serves to emphasize domestically that there is no intent to alter the constitutional balance of authority between the State and Federal governments or to use the provisions of the Covenant to ‘federalize’ matters now within the competence of authorities of the state or local governments . . . .”

Or, as the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said more pointedly in an analogous case, any other ruling would place “Congress only one treaty away from acquiring a general police power.”

Federal prosecutors also argued Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause to criminalize FGM. The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes,” but has been expansively interpreted by the Supreme Court to allow the federal government to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.

Yet, as Friedman detailed in his analysis, that power is not unlimited. Thus, for instance, Congress’ attempts to criminalize the possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school have failed on constitutional grounds. So too did Congress’ attempt to federalize the crime of rape. Similarly, Judge Friedman reasoned in a thorough 28-page opinion, Congress lacked the authority to make FGM a federal crime.

Yesterday’s decision has prompted a public outcry, with the Detroit Free Press reporting that “FGM survivor and social activist Mariya Taher, who heads a campaign out of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to ban FGM worldwide,” called Friedman’s ruling a gut-punch. “This is crazy,” Taher told the Free Press, “stressing she fears the ruling will put more young women in harm’s way.”

Yasmeen Hassan, who serves as executive global director for Equality Now, added that Friedman’s decision “sends a disturbing message to women and girls. ‘It says you are not important.’” Hassan claims the ruling served as “a federal blessing” for FGM, and saw the holding that the federal government cannot regulate FGM as “very bizarre.” But there is nothing bizarre about Friedman’s ruling. Rather, his opinion is right—both legally and ideologically.

As abhorrent as FGM is, the statute as currently written exceeds Congress’ constitutional authority. That is not a federal blessing on parent-coerced mutilation: It is an acceptance of our constitutional framework, wherein the federal government is one of limited and enumerated powers and criminalization of FGM and other forms of child abuse remain the province of state governments, which possess general police powers.

Twenty-seven states currently prohibit FGM, including now Michigan. After news broke of Nagarwala’s arrest, Michigan passed a law prohibiting FGM and subjecting both doctors and parents to up to 15 years imprisonment for it.

While the newly enacted Michigan law cannot be applied retroactively to the defendants in this case, the state’s general child abuse provisions do apply. Additionally, the federal conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding charges lodged against Nagarwala and a co-defendant who assisted in the FGMs remain pending. If convicted, both could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.

Although the public outcry is understandable, it is misplaced. And the misreporting of the story will do more harm to young girls at risk of FGM than Friedman’s constitutionally required ruling. That’s because inaccurate reporting creates the appearance that, in America, FGM is legal. It is not. It is just not a federal crime.

Why Putin’s Game Of Russian Roulette With Ukraine Is A Big Deal,"In a stunning sequence of events, the Russian military opened fire then seized three Ukrainian navy vessels in an unprovoked attack on the Black Sea last Sunday. In the melee, several Ukrainian sailors were wounded and 24 captured. Moscow followed up this flagrant act of war by parading the sailors on Russian television to give clearly coerced confessions of guilt.

This attack is but the latest escalation in the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine that has been churning since 2014. It’s also the first great test for the Trump administration regarding Russia and one that will have lasting consequences on the future of Europe and the world.

Moscow’s Strategy Of Ambiguity

The war in Ukraine began in 2014 after Russian special forces seized Crimea. The tactic Moscow used is what I dubbed, in U.S. Army publications, “the strategy of ambiguity.” Putin directed that his troops remove all symbols and anything else that would identify them as Russian soldiers.

This had the desired effect, as American journalists breathlessly reported of the ridiculously labeled “little green men” from unknown origins taking control of Crimea. President Obama and the rest of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies wrung their hands on what to do. The tactic worked––as President Obama dithered, Russia seized Crimea within a week without firing a shot in anger.

The takeover of Crimea was quickly followed by local referenda to ascertain if Crimea desired to become part of Russia––a vote, of course, that overwhelmingly supported the idea. The deal was sealed just a month after the little green men seized the country, with Putin announcing that Crimea would be annexed by Russia.

His speech was given to the Duma (Russia’s parliament) with much fanfare, but had chilling similarities to another dark time in history. Putin proclaimed that it was his duty and responsibility to protect ethnic Russians wherever they reside. This begs the question: how far geographically does his ethnic-based strategy extend?

Although Putin’s war against Ukraine is going into its fourth year, there has been a disconcerting pattern of aggression from him for more than a decade. The first test was an all-out cyber attack against NATO member Estonia in 2007, attributable to Russia. The attack was launched by Moscow in retaliation for Estonia’s decision to move a Soviet-era war shrine out of the center of its capital, Tallinn, after it became a hotbed of ethnic Russian unrest. The cyber attack punished Estonia for not heeding Moscow’s demands not to move the monument.

The next test came in 2008, when Russia launched a massive invasion of the nation of Georgia, which had most of its small army deployed in Iraq fighting an American war. When the guns fell silent, Moscow formally annexed two large swaths of Georgian territory, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Encouraged by the lack of resolve in the United States and its allies, Moscow followed up in 2014 with the invasion and annexation of Crimea, and with Putin’s now-infamous speech of ethnic expansionism. President Obama faltered in the face of the Russian aggression and failed to do anything substantive to deter further aggression.

Putin’s Quiet War

Buoyed by this appeasement and weakness, Putin took the next bold step of exporting an ethnic Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine. That war has droned on now for four years, leaving behind 10,000 dead and a rebel force largely in Luhansk and Donetsk with more tanks (compliments of Moscow) than the German army has in its inventory. The Ukrainians have done well in blunting the Moscow-led, -planned, and -orchestrated attack on their nation, but at a high cost in lives and treasure.

Putin’s problem is that, at this point, he needs to avoid a direct confrontation with the United States and NATO. He is in a precarious position economically and his military is still two years from completing part of its modernization and overhaul. Moscow has found in the latest rounds of aggression that using a fabricated proxy force in Ukraine as a cover to provide plausible deniability that it’s truly behind the conflict. This is what makes the Russian naval attack on Ukraine significant. It is the first overt and direct confrontation between Moscow and Kiev since 2014.

The stalemate in Eastern Ukraine is costly to Putin financially and politically. When Moscow deployed its special forces and intelligence operatives into Donesk and Luhansk in early 2014, by all accounts, Russia expected a quick victory by the “rebels” who would then ask to be incorporated into greater Russia. This did not happen and Ukraine’s armed forces have been able to prevent Moscow from declaring any sort of victory there.

It seems that the Russian navy attack in the Black Sea is another avenue to bring Ukraine to its knees, by severing its access to the Kerch Straits and the Azov Sea. Putin has slowly strangled Kiev’s lifeline to this vital area over the past months by limiting the number of vessels that could pass through the straits where 25 percent of Ukrainian exports flow to the west and elsewhere.

The Russian attack on the Ukrainian navy this past Sunday is Putin’s pretext to seal off the Kerch Straits from all Ukrainian shipping, and will bring Kiev to its knees economically. The move is a brilliant one for Moscow. By taking this “indirect approach,” Putin will be in a position to break the Ukrainians economically and outflank them militarily by sea east of Crimea.

Appeasement Only Emboldens Expansionist Leaders

The lesson of the past is that appeasement and accommodation only emboldens expansionist leaders. Putin pressed the West for more than a decade and faced tepid responses. If this latest provocation by Putin remains unchallenged, the Ukrainian economy will collapse, and the relative stalemate on its eastern front will result in a Russian breakthrough. The simple fact is that Kiev cannot maintain its forces there with the disintegration of its economy or being entirely cut off from the Sea of Azov.

This need not be an American war; Ukraine can fight and win it with the right policy and tools at its disposal. In the short term, the United States and NATO should increase its supply of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to tip the scales back into balance in the land battle. Additionally, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles should be provided to Kiev to defend against this latest Russian provocation.

Furthermore, all NATO countries, especially Germany, must cease purchasing Russian oil and gas. Europe’s addiction to Moscow’s energy has made them unwilling and unable to take a determined stand against Putin’s expanding torrent of aggression in the region. This explains Angela Merkel’s consistently tepid response to Russian aggression––Merkel needs Russian oil and gas, and any interruption of it would have catastrophic results for Germany’s economy.

Since most of Western Europe spends barely 1 percent of their GDP on defense, they owe it to the United States to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on the North Sea and pay a little extra to import American energy. It is madness to enrich a leader in Russia who spends that revenue to create a military force that threatens European security. Once Europe is weaned off Russian energy, an effective economic embargo can be implemented that will discourage Russia from behaving badly.

We Must Not Tolerate This

It is time to draw the line in the sand and not tolerate this provocation. President Trump is facing his first test from Putin and must come out with an unequivocal statement condemning Moscow for its blatant aggression against Ukraine, then follow it up with concerted action.

Putin is a regional bully who only understands strength. America is being tested, both in its commitment to the European alliance and its resolve to maintain the international order. Failure to act will result in the collapse of Ukraine’s economy and rout of its forces on its eastern front. If this happens, the spark of freedom there will be snuffed out yet again by Russian imperialism.

It is imperative that the United States and the entire NATO membership stand unified against Putin’s “ethnic-Russian” ambitions in Europe and meet any further challenges with concerted action and force. If the United States falters, expect Russia to test NATO’s resolve in the Baltics, especially Estonia and Latvia, both of which have large ethnic Russian populations.

This would be a show-changer for the United States, as these nations are NATO members and, under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, we are obligated to come to their aid if they are attacked. How such a war would look I address extensively in a publicly available document called Project 1721.

But it need not come to this. Putin can be stopped in Ukraine, and if he is stopped there, we will have averted a global war and given Europe another generation of peace.

Charles Blow's Latest Column Reinforces That Russia Collusion Is A Hoax,"The New York Times published an opinion article Sunday by Charles M. Blow titled, “What Would Happen If,” which attempts to argue that the day of reckoning with accusations of Trump-Russia collusion has arrived for President Trump supporters. RealClearPolitics.com assigned it the misleading click-bait title, “It’s Becoming Clear Trump Colluded with Russia.”

I’ve been searching for a coherent and updated Russia collusion piece for some time, because it’s been so clear for so long that the Trump-Russia collusion story is a hoax. What am I missing? Maybe this New York Times article can explain to me how liberals continue to believe the story in spite of the mounting evidence to the contrary. I thirst for evidence contradicting my beliefs, because I find it so hard to believe that honest liberal journalists would knowingly continue to advance a story that appears to have been so thoroughly debunked as a hoax. So I took the bait and clicked.

Blow begins with one of those famous “We know” statements that pundits tend to use when they actually don’t know, but don’t want to argue threshold assumptions. “A crime has been committed by Russia and Trump cheered the crime and used the loot thereof to advance his candidacy,” Blow writes. “That is clear.” I looked for a hyperlink to support this bold statement, to no avail. I’m left to guess what he means. What crime? What loot?

For almost two years now, the Trump-Russia people have deliberately and lazily conflated Russian-initiated advocacy on social media with actual hacking of election machines and tampering with votes (here, here, here, and here, for example). So this “crime” Blow tells us has clearly been committed could be the Russian troll cases (still mere allegations), in which the U.S. government is prosecuting political speech by foreigners (but only when the speech harms Hillary Clinton). I’m pretty sure that when it’s all said and done, the Supreme Court is not going to agree that criticizing Hillary Clinton is a crime.

For a more detailed write-up, click here. Alternatively, the crime to which Blow so un-clearly refers might be the case against the named Russian GRU operatives, which again, are mere allegations and not proven. That case will likely never see the inside of a courtroom and probably ended with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s self-congratulatory press conference. To quote Rosenstein during the press conference: “There is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime. There is no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result.”

I assume “any American citizen” includes candidate Donald Trump. Indeed, the culpability for the Democratic National Committee server hack and the John Podesta email hack have not been established beyond the mere indictment. As far as the DNC server is concerned, intelligence experts have offered plausible alternate theories. Why is this still not clear two years after the hack? Because the DNC’s subcontractor Crowdstrike likely destroyed the original evidence before obtaining a third-party review of its attribution accusing the Russians.

Blow’s next claim is that “The Russians made repeated attempts to contact people in Trump’s orbit and in some cases were able to meet with members of the team, as evidenced by the Trump Tower meeting.” Who are these “Russians” who made repeated attempts to contact people in Trump’s orbit? Is he referring to the George Papadopolous stings in which Joseph Misfud and Stefan Halper pretended to represent Russia while attempting to entice Papadopolous into an audio-recorded sting? Those two characters represented the FBI or the CIA, or both. Not the Russians.

Or is he talking about Oleg Deripaska, who, as The New York Times reported, refused an attempt by Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Bruce Ohr to pull another sting against the Trump campaign?

Then there is Blow’s citation of the Trump Tower meeting. The “Russian” at the meeting was a lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was connected to Fusion GPS. I did a detailed debunking of this example here.

Recall, Fusion GPS is at the center of the hoax framing Trump for Russian collusion. Fusion GPS made the Hillary Clinton “dirt” that Veselnitskaya used as bait for the meeting. This same Russian lawyer met with Fusion GPS before and after the Trump Tower meeting. It’s a clear indication that Blow doesn’t care about the truth that he fails to identify these flaws in the Trump Tower meeting and collusion theory.

Blow also wrote that it’s“clear” that, “since assuming office, Trump has openly attempted to obstruct justice and damage or impede the investigation into what the Russians did …” I’m going to be honest here, I actually don’t know what he’s talking about. Without giving me a date, a link, a tweet, or something that Blow is calling “obstruction,” I’m unable to follow what he’s saying is so “clear” to all of us.

Then, buried near the middle of the article, is the admission that his entire piece is just idle cocktail chatter converted to text: “But what happens if the evidence that the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, uncovers … a direct link between Trump and the Russians?” That’s not reporting. That’s fantasizing. What on earth has The New York Times been doing the last two years with an army of sympathetic investigators in the special counsel?

Blow goes on to ask, “How would Americans who support Trump now respond to evidence that Team Trump put their own personal and financial interests over the national interest?” Perhaps it’s time to ask the converse. In the absence of a “direct link between Trump and the Russians” after two years of looking, how will the NeverTrumper media and Mueller team respond to the president’s innocence? After two years without evidence, it might be time to stop telling people that something that can’t and hasn’t been proven after all this time is “clear.”

Shame on The New York Times for printing this unsupported and irresponsible speculation. This kind of journalism is doing real harm to our democracy. A majority of Democrats think Russia tampered with vote tallies, which is absolutely incorrect. If this kind of misleading journalism is necessary to keep the story going, it makes me more confident than ever that this is all a hoax.

Thomas Sowell Explains The Economics Of Discrimination,"At 88 years old, Thomas Sowell continues to demonstrate why he’s one of the most formidable intellects of the age. In Discrimination and Disparities, released earlier this year, Sowell rebuts common misconceptions regarding socioeconomic differences among individuals, groups, and nations, and demonstrates that disparities are often explained by economics.

For instance, emotionally loaded phrases like “systemic racism” and “exploitation” are frequently used to explain differences between blacks and whites, rich and poor, and even individual nations. But a better understanding of economics refutes these notions.

Sowell begins by noting there are different types of discrimination. Discrimination I he defines as “an ability to discern differences in the qualities of people and things, and choosing accordingly”—in other words, “making fact-based distinctions.” Discrimination II he defines as “treating people negatively, based on arbitrary assumptions or aversions concerning individuals of a particular race or sex, for example”—in other words, what most people mean today when they talk of “discrimination.”

Ideally, Discrimination I—judging each person individually—would be universally practiced. Rarely, however, is the ideal “found among human beings in the real world, even among people who espouse that ideal.” He gives an example:

If you are walking at night down a lonely street, and see up ahead a shadowy figure in an alley, do you judge that person as an individual or do you cross the street and pass on the other side? The shadowy figure in the alley could turn out to be a kindly neighbor, out walking his dog. But, when making such decisions, a mistake on your part could be costly, up to and including costing you your life.

In short, cost is the relevant factor when determining a course of action. The cost of Discrimination I—judging the person as an individual—may be prohibitively high in some cases, as when you approach a shadowy figure in a dark alley. But that does not mean that choosing to cross the street to avoid that shadowy figure is automatically Discrimination II—arbitrarily expressing antipathy toward a group.

As Sowell explains, in the case of crossing the street,

This is still Discrimination I, basing decisions on empirical evidence. But the distinction between the ideal version of Discrimination I—judging each individual as individual—and making decisions based on empirical evidence about the group to which the individual belongs is a consequential difference. We can call the ideal version (basing decisions on evidence about individuals) Discrimination Ia, and the less than ideal version (basing individual decision on group evidence) Discrimination Ib. But both are different from unsubstantiated notions or animosities.

Not All Discrimination Is Equal

In other words, discrimination based on factual generalizations (Discrimination Ib) is not the same as discrimination based on personal aversions to race, sex, etc. (Discrimination II). Indeed, evidence-based generalizations are used routinely, including by employers whose cost of judging everyone individually may be prohibitively expensive:

To take an extreme example of Discrimination Ib, for the sake of illustration, if 40 percent of the people in Group X are alcoholics and 1 percent of the people in Group Y are alcoholics, an employer may well prefer to hire only people from Group Y for work where an alcoholic would be not only ineffective but dangerous. This would mean that a majority of people in Group X—60 percent in this case—would be denied employment, even though they are not alcoholics. What matters, crucially, to the employer is the cost of determining which individual is or is not an alcoholic, when job applicants all show up sober on the day when they are seeking employment.

Critically, cost is not limited to employers:

[Cost] also matters to the customers who buy the employer’s products and to society as a whole. If alcoholics produce a higher proportion of products that turn out to be defective, that is a cost to customers … To the extent that alcoholics are not only less competent but dangerous, the costs of those dangers are paid by either fellow employees who fact those dangers on the job or by customers who buy dangerously defective products, or both.

Consider, says Sowell, a real-world example. A disproportionate number of young, black job applicants have criminal records, meaning that employers may turn them down at a higher rate, even if they have zero animosity toward them (Discrimination 1b).

Although this is less ideal than discerning each person individually (Discrimination Ia), higher rates of rejection cannot automatically be assumed to be “systemic racism” (Discrimination II), when discernment is based not on personal antipathy but on empirical generalization, even though that generalization does not apply to every individual within the group. In fact, employers who run background checks on all employees regardless of race hire more black males than do other companies. Sowell explains:

Where the nature of the work made criminal background checks worth the cost for all employees, it was no longer necessary to use group information to assess whether individual young black job applicants had a criminal background. This made young black job applicants without a criminal background more employable than before.

Moreover, understanding the economics is more than merely an academic exercise, when our understanding can make the difference between policies that hurt and help real people. Indeed, background checks have increased opportunity for black job seekers, yet many elites—including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—have tried to prohibit employers from conducting background checks by suing in the name of “racial discrimination.” If they acquainted themselves with the facts, however, they may realize the folly of their actions and emotionally charged rhetoric.

The High Cost of Bad Policy

Another oft-cited rationale for disparities is “exploitation.” Media and academia, for instance, have characterized stores that charge higher prices in high-crime neighborhoods as “consumer exploitation.” But, Sowell illustrates, businesses operating in high-crime areas often face punitive costs, including not only higher rates of theft, but, where high murder rates are concerned, danger even to their own lives.

Simply delivering products to stores in crime-ridden areas entails steep costs, which are passed on to local consumers. Thus, despite what some academics have suggested, higher prices are caused not by greedy store owners who wish to exploit innocent consumers, but by criminal activity that raises the costs of operating business. Law-abiding citizens in these areas pay the price.

As with forbidding background checks, misunderstanding the economics of this situation has led to counterproductive measures, including price controls. While studies reveal that rates of profit for businesses in high-crime areas are much lower than average, price controls prevent businesses from recouping their costs, meaning fewer businesses operate in these already sparse locations.

While our intelligentsia may spout off against the evils of “racism” and “exploitation” and demand “solutions” like price and rent controls, they pay no price for the costs of their misguided policies. Local residents do, instead.

Because they pay no price for the consequences of their rhetoric, or for the foolish policies that result from it, our media, academia, and political elite are likely to continue promoting unsubstantiated allegations like “racial discrimination” and “exploitation” as reasons for disparities among individuals, groups, and even nations. It is incumbent upon the rest of us, therefore, to learn the facts and refute such baseless accusations, and for that Sowell’s book is essential reading.

Cohen’s Sentencing Memorandum Is A Roadmap For Indicting Trump,"President Donald Trump is in legal and political jeopardy, and he doesn’t seem to know it. The U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) has filed a sentencing memorandum in the case of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and personal advisor. It candidly lays out the federal case against Trump for campaign finance crimes.

The prosecutors say that payments Cohen caused to be made to two women who say they had extramarital affairs with Trump were “in coordination with and at the direction of” Trump. (Trump denies that these alleged affairs occurred, and says he did not know about the payments when they occurred.) The SDNY’s sentencing memo thus implicates Trump in at least three crimes.

First, it is generally unlawful for a corporation to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with an election to federal office. Cohen pleaded guilty to causing such an unlawful contribution by American Media Inc., the owner of the National Enquirer.

According to court documents, Cohen coordinated AMI’s purchase of the “limited life rights” of former Playmate Karen McDougal’s claim to have had an affair with Trump, and did so for the purpose of influencing the presidential election. This last detail—that it was done for the purpose of influencing the election—is what makes this a campaign contribution and not a garden-variety services contract. Also, prosecutors’ claim that Cohen did it at Trump’s direction would, if true, make Trump as guilty as Cohen.

Second, it is unlawful for an individual to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with an election to federal office in excess of certain amounts ($2,700 in 2016). Cohen pleaded guilty to making such a contribution by paying $130,000 for onscreen prostitute Stormy Daniels’ silence. Just like the McDougal payment, the SDNY prosecutors say this payment was for the purpose of influencing the election and done at Trump’s direction. Again, if true, that makes Trump as guilty as Cohen.

Third, regardless of source or amount, presidential campaigns must disclose all contributions in regular filings with the Federal Election Commission. In the sentencing memo, the SDNY’s prosecutors lean heavily on the fact that Cohen structured these payments to foil “one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency.”

Mandatory disclosure laws exist so the American public can assess who is funding political candidacies. Cohen concealed these contributions as services contracts and by using a shell corporation—which, by the way, is further evidence that he knew he was breaking the law. If it was done at Trump’s direction, as alleged by the SDNY’s prosecutors, that’s another crime.

Thus, in the sentencing memorandum for Cohen, federal prosecutors have provided a roadmap for Trump’s indictment. Were he any other person, they certainly would have presented this information to a grand jury for indictment by now. But the Department of Justice’s view is that sitting presidents cannot be indicted because it would undermine the executive branch’s ability to perform its constitutionally assigned role.

This question was last addressed by the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bill Clinton administration. However, it actually extends back to the Nixon administration, which first determined that sitting presidents could not be indicted. Changing that view now would validate all of Trump’s claims of being persecuted by the federal bureaucracy. This doesn’t mean that Trump is safe; given the five-year statute of limitations on campaign finance crimes, it means only that Trump is safe for now.

Trump also has several potential avenues to attack an indictment as described. Obviously, he can try and establish that Cohen didn’t act at Trump’s direction. He could also show that the payments were not for the purpose of influencing the election, but for a different reason (protecting first lady Melania Trump’s feelings, for example).If true, that would mean that, as far as Trump knew, he wasn’t directing campaign contributions. But even a defense like this opens Trump up to additional legal jeopardy if he lies to investigators.

Keep in mind that federal prosecutors have Cohen’s recordings of conversations with Trump, and have granted immunity to the AMI executives who handled the McDougal payment. It is very likely that the SDNY’s prosecutors know more about this than has been revealed so far. Their candidness about Trump’s misconduct in the sentencing memo suggests they are relying on more than just Cohen’s say-so.

So the SDNY’s prosecutors have laid out their case that Trump conspired to conceal from the voters payments to alleged mistresses in violation of campaign finance laws—even if they cannot act on it for now. Congress, on the other hand, can at any time impeach and remove a president for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” And whether something is a high crime or misdemeanor is solely in the discretion of a majority of members of the House of Representatives, subject to agreement by two-thirds of the Senate.

The incoming Democrat-led House will certainly be considering this question. Moreover, at this point, Trump cannot discount the possibility that even more crimes will be revealed in the course of the SDNY’s work or that of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This means that, even aside from criminal jeopardy, Trump’s political fortunes may also turn on the decisions of federal prosecutors.

Criminal Records Show Women Shouldn't Want Men In Their Bathrooms,"In the showers of the U.S. Military Academy, Sgt. Michael McClendon surreptitiously video-recorded young, female future military officers during some of their most vulnerable and intimate moments. Today, as a result of policies implemented by the Obama administration, women who serve are getting victimized similarly.

To the peril of natal females, the Pentagon has granted males access to the very spaces that McClendon once prowled. During this well-intentioned but misguided thought process, American taxpayers have gotten victimized as well. That’s because, despite the hard work of medical professionals to help these men appear female to alleviate their gender dysphoria and the marching orders of the policymakers forcing everyone to accept them as women, the charade is a failure. They are and always will remain male.

Mirroring the policies of the Pentagon, in the girl’s bathrooms and locker rooms of Boyertown Area Senior High School in Pennsylvania, similar guidelines for the transgender population are jeopardizing the health and welfare of young girls. When female student Alexis Lightcap encountered a biological male in the girl’s bathroom at Boyertown, she abruptly left the restroom. The male calls himself female. What happened to Lightcap is not some made-up tale by religious groups to portray trans people as bathroom predators, because the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a nonprofit legal organization, has a video of her quickly exiting the restroom in fear.

While transgender people claim their gender identity, a relatively modern invention from the 1960s, is hard-wired, Lightcap’s primal reaction of feeling threatened by suddenly encountering an unknown male is traceable to the beginning of time. Her response was a protective survival mechanism embedded into her female biology.

The Unreasonable Side Is the Transgender Side

On Lightcap’s behalf, the ADF is suing the Boyertown, Pennsylvania school district where she attended classes. On some transgender military personnel’s behalf, a throng of LGBT legal organizations have filed several lawsuits against the Pentagon and the president because of their restrictions on transgender people serving in the U.S. military. Both types of cases are heading to the Supreme Court.

There’s a common theme at the heart of these legal actions. Lightcap says she doesn’t care if transgender people share a bathroom with her as long as they share her biological sex. The attorneys for the Pentagon argue the same. They don’t care if you’re transgender either, providing that you serve in the military as I did, in your biological sex.

According to the logic of the LGBT legal advocates behind these lawsuits, all filed in carefully chosen jurisdictions on both coasts, why should anyone care if a soldier goes on light duty or becomes non-deployable for 270 days or more? These advocates believe getting cosmetic vaginoplasties to appear as women or undergoing a double mastectomy to look like men justify these long absences from duty. They claim these are lifesaving surgical procedures to protect these troops from suicide. Medical groups such as the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) disagree, believing we need to find more humane methods for treating gender dysphoria.

The problem with this erroneous line of thought about suicidality is that Pentagon regulations have historically barred anyone with suicidal ideation or behavior from military service. Allowing transgender soldiers has left Trump’s military leaders in a quagmire as they struggle to control the 41 percent attempted suicide rate in the trans population while rolling back the unrealistic transgender military regulations implemented during the Obama regime.

It’s Not Medically Necessary to Amputate Healthy Organs

Drawing from equal protection cases, the do-gooder legal argument for transgender surgeries goes as such. If a sick person can get surgical procedures for diseases such as breast cancer, then these same type of radical surgeries have to be made available for transgender people to treat their gender dysphoria, an equally deadly malady in their eyes.

However, black and white thinking regarding equal protection is severely flawed in these circumstances, because, for example, phalloplasty for transgender men is significantly more dangerous than vaginoplasty is for transgender women. However, both types of surgeries would have to get approved by the military from an equal protection standpoint. The Pentagon is rightfully pushing back against this flawed reasoning.

As these legal and cultural battles rage, transgender people are flocking to LGBT-friendly places such as Oregon to get transgender surgeries performed through the state’s generous Medicaid program. This “follow-the-benefits” trend suggests they’ll join the military for the same entitlements. However, regardless of where the hormonal treatments or surgical procedures get rendered, and no matter which government agency pays for them, the poor surgical and physical outcomes for the recipients will be the same.

I Served My Military Career Without Transgender Care

I know this to be true on both fronts because, as one of eight children with blue-collar parents, I joined the Army at 19, serving 18 years before getting medically retired. As an enlisted transgender soldier, I spent my entire military career without any transgender health treatments, surviving without it.

The Trump administration believes this is sound and reasonable military policy. Based on my experience with the dangerous medical treatments for gender dysphoria since retiring, I do too. Military service shouldn’t get awarded to those who succumb to the mental ravages of gender dysphoria and the ideologies of transgenderism. It should instead be a right for only those who can persevere through the struggle.

I left the military riddled with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. While PTSD is the signature mental wound of trauma, anxiety and depression are the hallmark traits of gender dysphoria. This truth is something extensively documented in the February 2018 “Department Of Defense Report And Recommendations On Transgender Military Service By Transgender Persons.”

The data in the news articles I regularly collect on my transgender archives website paints the same picture as that Pentagon report. According to that Department of Defense (DOD) data, between October I, 2015 and October 3, 2017, the 994 active-duty service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria accounted for 30,000 mental health visits.

The Harm From These Off-Label Treatments Is Real

After I left the Army, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) began treating me for gender dysphoria. To protect themselves of liability from the well-known side effects of cross-sex hormone therapy and antiandrogen drugs such as sterilization, blood clots, vein problems, and damage to my vital organs, my VA physicians forced me to a sign what’s known as an “informed consent” document.

I did so willingly because the beginning of the long form alleged improved mental health and alleviation of my gender dysphoria through consuming or injecting off-label cancer and menopause medications. Five years later, however, there’s been no improvement in my mental health, and I still have a gender dysphoria diagnosis. I’m just as plagued with anxiety and depression as I was before the initiation of treatment.

However, the side-effects were real. Formerly healthy, I’ve twice landed in the VA emergency room with leg and vein problems, and I’ve had two psychiatric hospitalizations after a series of estrogen injections severely destabilized my mental health. Even after my hospital stays, I spent a couple of weeks in a psychiatric rehabilitation program that cost the taxpayers nearly $30,000. Do I sound cured or fit for military duty because of transgender health care?

Identity Is Not Biology

A year-long, gut-wrenching investigation by the Associated Press (AP) shows why it’s not fair to treat Lightcap or those who share her views as bigots or label them as transphobic because they refuse to share a bathroom or locker room with males who identify as females. From the fall of 2011 to the spring of 2015, investigative journalists from the AP uncovered close to 17,000 official reports of sexual assaults in schools.

The findings indicated these men retained a male pattern regarding criminality despite the surgery.

These were all documented cases of students assaulting other students. The investigation found these crimes were likely to occur wherever students were unsupervised, notably in bathrooms and locker rooms. In light of this, Lightcap prudently followed her instincts and bolted from the girl’s bathroom after suddenly encountering a biological male inside.

Besides concluding that male-to-female transsexuals are at increased risk for suicide despite undergoing cosmetic genital surgeries, the 2011 “Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden” reported another disturbing fact about men who surgically alter their bodies to appear as women. It found male-to-female transgender people had a significantly increased risk of offending compared to females, but not compared to other males. The findings indicated these men retained a male pattern regarding criminality despite the surgery. The conclusion was the same for violent crime, the study said.

Criminal Patterns that Match Their Biology

The years-long media article based research on my Transgender Archives website supports that study’s conclusion. To date, I’ve identified 67 transgender murderers. Fourteen of those killed multiple people, some are serial killers who murdered numerous women. Of the 67 I’ve found in news articles, the number born male identifying as female is 63. Three others were female at birth. One identifies as non-binary, with his or her birth sex not clear in the news reports

My findings on sex crimes involving transgender people are similar. Of the 75 incidents, I’ve gathered and cataloged 49 involved crimes against a person under 18 years of age. Males who identify as females were responsible for committing 66 of them and biological women were responsible for nine. However, many of the sex offenses involving biological women as the perpetrators involved tricking other women into believing they were men during sexual relations and were often consensual sexual activities.

Based on the evidence from the AP’s research and my own, women and girls such as Lightcap aren’t wrong to demand safe, private female spaces.

Like the statistics for violence, my sex crime data likewise supports the conclusion of the Swedish study, justifying the primal fears natal women such as Lightcap have about sharing intimate spaces with the broad transgender population of males with various transgender identities.

In other research conducted for a bathroom, locker room, and dressing room incident website, I’ve spent hundreds of hours and more than a year scouring search engines for these crimes. It’s arguably the most extensive collection of such data on the internet. Of the nearly 1,000 incidents I’ve collected to date, I was able to identify the biological sex of the person responsible in 952 of the instances.

In these documented incidents reported by the media, adult males were responsible 839 times; male juveniles were responsible 70 times; men dressed in women’s clothing were responsible 25 times; male-born transgender people who identify as women were responsible 7 times; adult females were responsible 25 times; female-born people who identify as males were responsible 1 time, and female juveniles were responsible 12 times. The crimes committed by women or girls rarely involve sexual activity or motivation, but they are hands down the biggest victims of such crimes.

Based on the evidence from the AP’s research and my own, women and girls such as Lightcap aren’t wrong to demand safe, private female spaces, offering protection from male aggression. Because of that, the ADF should get applauded for helping them to accomplish that goal.

Likewise, President Trump also isn’t wrong to demand mentally and physically healthy candidates for military service, personnel who can deploy at a moment’s notice and able to withstand mental or physical challenges. Lawyers for the Pentagon should get similarly applauded for working to achieve that goal.

Beirut Rules: The Murder of a CIA Station Chief and Hezbollah’s War Against America, by Fred Burton and Samuel Katz—Burton and Katz tell the story of the abduction and murder of former CIA Beirut station chief William Francis Buckley, and detail the myriad American foreign policy failures that led to it and paved the way for decades of assassinations, bombings, and abductions.

Readers who view the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, and the U.S. government’s feckless response to it, as an aberration rather than just the latest in a continuous string of horrific attacks on U.S. installations and personnel will quickly learn from this book that the United States and its allies have been outmaneuvered by terrorist factions such as Hamas and Hezbollah, and especially Iran—Hezbollah’s state sponsor—for nearly 50 years.

From the bombing of our embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, to the abduction and assassination of a CIA station chief, to the Khobar towers bombing, to the U.S.S. Cole, to the 9/11 attacks, America has been fighting and losing the war against terrorist organizations for too long. Hopefully, the history detailed in Beirut Rules will lead current and future policy makers to understand that they must change their tactics and confront terrorist organizations and their nation-state sponsors head on, or accept defeat and the senseless American and allied deaths that come with it.

Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou—This is the nearly unbelievable story of Elizabeth Holmes, a wannabe Steve Jobs turned compulsive liar, and her Silicon Valley biotech start up that was supposed to change the world. In fact, it’s so unbelievable that my mother in law texted me after I had recommended it to her, asking, “Is this a true story??”

Holmes raised billions of dollars and the support of the biggest names in technology and medicine, without ever presenting a single piece of working propriety technology. I walked away both in awe of her, and wanting her to be put behind bars.

Carreyrou is the Wall Street Journal reporter who first discovered Holmes’ webs of lies and fought her impressive legal team to untangle it. He switches to telling the story in first person for the later half of the book, allowing the reader to follow along his journey to uncover the insanity and the company’s simultaneous combustion.

Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence by Bill James—The title makes this book sound gruesome, but I assure you that James’ dry sense of humor and matter-of-fact narration makes the reader feel more informed and entertained by abductions and murders than queasy. James is trying to get to the bottom of why we are all so obsessed with crime. Why are the most-watched television shows, most listened-to podcasts, and most talked-about news stories all about crazy, violent, or mysterious crimes? And what role does the media play in this cultural phenomenon?

James has read thousands of crime stories, including multiple books written about the same crime. Popular Crime is his way of distilling all that information, using his scientific approach and razor-sharp empiricism, to explain the cultural significance, and sometimes to offer his non-expert verdict when the jury is out.

Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates—For whatever reason, I’ve gotten into mid-20th century American fiction, and Revolutionary Road tells the haunting story of the unraveling of a 1950s marriage. The suburban couple—a creative man stuffing himself into a gray flannel suit and his failed-actress housewife—make the incredible decision to move to Paris. Then they step back from that liberating edge, to disastrous consequences. I read the book after I saw the 2008 movie, which started Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Engrossing prose, great acting. Recommend experiencing both.

American Pastoral by Philip Roth—Published in 1997 but hearkening to an earlier time, we learn through flashbacks and a not-always-reliable narrator about a star high school athlete (Jewish) who marries a beauty queen (gentile) and lives happily ever after until their daughter joins a radical student group, blows up some people, and goes into hiding. If you’ve never read Roth, this is a good way to start. At least that’s what the Chicago used bookstore proprietor told me.

The Vision of the Soul: Truth, Goodness, and Beauty in the Western Tradition by James Mathew Wilson—Why is western civilization in a state of decay? A recent volume by James Matthew Wilson aims to answer that question and propose a remedy. Wilson is a poet, professor of religion and literature at Villanova University, and the poetry editor at Modern Age magazine, and his book, “The Vision of the Soul,” is an attempt to establish firm philosophical ground for a robust modern conservatism that can serve as an alternative to the ascendant liberal order.

Unlike other recent books with more or less the same purpose, Wilson is at pains to make clear that by “conservatism” he does not mean the conservative movement or conservative politics, much less something as ephemeral as the Republican Party. A crucial part of his thesis is that conservatism is fundamentally a literary movement, not a political one, and that if we’re going to recover a sense of true conservatism in our liberal age, we need to get serious about things like beauty and goodness. For starters, we at least need to get over the notion that conservatism is primarily a set of political principles derived from the writings of John Locke.

For Wilson, the point of conservatism isn’t merely to oppose liberalism or slow the march of scientific rationalism, the point is to apprehend and preserve a vision of the Good. He delves into the Christian Platonist tradition and the writings of Pseudo-Dionysus, among many others, to argue that authentic conservatism must be revived through art, and not just any art but beautiful art that has the power to reveal a higher reality and elevate us to a vision of the divine. Reasserting the importance of the fine arts in particular is crucial, writes Wilson, “not because of its isolation from society or politics, but because it attunes us, awakens and habituates us, to the perception of the ordered whole of reality.”

The point of the fine arts, or any art, should be to manifest beauty, which “reveals not simply our creaturely yearning for God, but our existential participation in him.” If the Enlightenment ushered in a rationalistic era “that knows nothing of the heart’s much less of the intellect’s higher aspirations,” Wilson believes we’re only going to find our way out of it by awakening those higher aspirations through the cultivation and the apprehension of beauty in every part of our lives. His book is dense and can at times be recondite and abstract, but his argument is one every conservative should take to heart.

The Light of Christ: An Introduction to Catholicism by Thomas Joseph White, OP—“We cannot love what we do not know,” said Fr. Thomas Joseph White, OP, in a recent interview. His latest book, The Light of Christ, is an overview of Catholicism intended for a broad audience with common questions. Is faith in divine revelation reasonable? Are faith and science compatible? How should I think about traditional Catholic moral teaching?

Fr. White, a associate professor of systematic theology at the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, D.C., has written two books on Thomistic theology, and he brings a Thomist’s focus on the reasonableness of faith to this new, highly readable volume. He straightforwardly walks the reader through major questions about our knowledge of God, the Trinity, the incarnation and the sacraments, all written in a contemporary but authoritative style.

In composing this introduction to the Catholic faith, Fr. White has done the world a great service, essentially giving us a primer on the theology and thought of St. Thomas Aquinas and John Henry Newman in language that is decidedly contemporary. That is, you don’t have to be a theologian—or a Catholic—to understand and learn a great deal from this book. In his introduction, Fr. White writes, “My goal is to make explicit in a few broad strokes the shape of Catholicism. I hope to outline its inherent intelligibility or form as a mystery that is at once visible and invisible, ancient and contemporary, mystical and reasonable.”

Breaking Rockefeller: The Incredible Story of the Ambitious Rivals Who Toppled an Oil Empire by Peter Doran—My friend Doran has written a fascinating book, which shows how Rockefeller got so rich from the breakup of Standard Oil—perceived, at the time, as having damaged him—that he essentially became untouchable.

Old Masters, New World: America’s Raid on Europe’s Great Pictures by Cynthia Saltzman—Another good book about robber barons, and specifically how their families went around one-upping each other trying to fill their new money American mansions with old European art.

Conceivability: What I Learned Exploring the Frontiers of Fertility by Elizabeth Katkin—The book I found most eye-opening and worth reading this year is one I previously reviewed for The Federalist. Infertility memoirs may sound like inside baseball to many people, but Katkin’s should matter to every thinking American and especially to every conservative. Katkin’s experiences, research, and anecdotes shed light on the global fertility industry, as well as the countless bioethical questions raised by this Wild West of science.

Natasha’s Dance: A Cultural History of Russia and A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution: 1891-1924 by Orlando Figes—The mass hysterics surrounding Russia these days induced me to re-read two of historian Figes’ wonderful books on the country.

The Age of Eisenhower: America and the World in the 1950s by William I. Hitchcock—This is a good history that revisits a more innocent era.

The Moralist: Woodrow Wilson and the World He Made by Patricia O’Toole—Although far too apologetic towards the sins of our worst president, The Moralist is an excellent overview of his puritanical determination and influence.

Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece by Michael Benson and Astounding: John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, and the Golden Age of Science Fiction by Alec Nevala-Lee—If you’re interested in science fiction, both of these books are worth your time.

Bare Minimum Parenting: The Ultimate Guide to Not Quite Ruining Your Child by James Breakwell—Not only is this a very funny book, it’s also a pretty effective critique of contemporary over-parenting.

To Heal the World?: How The Jewish Left Corrupts Judaism and Endangers Israel by Jonathan Neumann—This year, Neumann wrote an important—and long overdue—book detailing the American left’s systematic and deliberate undermining of Jewish tradition and belief.

Hunting Eichman: How a Band of Survivors and a Young Spy Agency Chased Down the World’s Most Notorious Nazi by Neal Bascomb—A fast-moving novelistic history about the daring capture of the notorious Nazi, Hunting Eichman is probably the best thing I’ve read all year

Based on a True Story: Not a Memoir by Norm MacDonald—MacDonald took his assignment of “Former SNL cast member writes another memoir” and created something truly remarkable. The book is a collection of tales from Norm’s past—to the best of his recollection.

While the stories begin with a scream for fact checking, it is ultimately Norm’s ability to enchant with his version of reality that keeps the reader engaged. The stories range from seemingly benign to flirtation with the supernatural, but all succeed in making readers laugh until they fall down. Whether Norm’s oft-mentioned friends and colleagues remember his version of events in the same way is unlikely, but this version is well worth the time for fans of Norm’s comedy.

The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics by Daniel James Brown—This book is a compelling retelling of the United States 1936 Olympic rowing team. The story jumps back and forth between the evolution of the Nazi party during the mid-thirties in Berlin, and the circumstances surrounding the young men who were to row as representatives of the United States.

The book overflows with spirit and purpose, particularly in the harsh revelations of their individual pasts, as they grew up in the midst of the Great Depression. The book serves as a beautiful tribute, not just to the gold medal-winning team of 1936, but to the sport of rowing, and to the spirit of Americans in the face of oppression and conflict. Many moments will have the reader stand up and cheer.

Girl In A Band by Kim Gordon—A tiny bit reminiscent of Patti Smith’s Just Kids in both style and topic, Girl In A Band details the early history of legendary rockers Sonic Youth, Gordon’s own childhood, her turbulent marriage with bandmate Thurston Moore, and Sonic Youth’s breakup.

The book is disjointed and skips around, time-wise, but it focuses in on Gordon’s relationship with her brother, her childhood in Los Angeles in the ’60s (with a brief but fascinating stint in Hong Kong), and the grungy, punk rock-oriented New York of the ’80s. I liked it because I’m a shameless devotee at the altar of Sonic Youth, but also because Gordon writes with candor on her marriage, motherhood (especially in an industry that isn’t exactly friendly to raising a child), her friendship with Kurt Cobain, loneliness, and what it felt like rising to stardom.

Meet Me In The Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011 by Lizzy Goodman—I’ll be frank: I’m not finished with this one, but I am 200 pages in. This is another book with a wholly unconventional format: It’s told in a series of interviews that are woven together to create a sort of stream-of-consciousness read.

It tells the story of the indie rock/rock/alt music scene in the late ’90s and aughts—a time when a lot of people were sort of glum about the future of the New York music scene. The Velvet Underground had already had their heyday, Lou Reed had already been properly venerated, The Ramones had already come and gone. Meet Me In The Bathroom explores the malaise felt by rock musicians who felt like they had missed the moment, been born too late.

It details the rise and fizzle of Jonathan Fire*Eater, the origins of LCD Soundsystem and James Murphy, the rise of The Strokes (which you might guess about, given the name of the book lifted from 2003’s “Room On Fire”), the origins of Karen O and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. It’s riddled with coke and heroin abuse, and it transports the reader to a time when Williamsburg was considered semi-sketchy (ha!) and an era when Alphabet City still had an awful lot of dope coursing through it. But it also details the end of that, and the shifting of eras, and once-obscure bands being signed to major record labels and relegated (or advanced, depending on how you look at it) to stadium arenas.

To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism by Evgeny Morozov—This excellent book makes the case that Silicon Valley’s belief there are pragmatic, data-based solutions to every complex moral, political, and social problem is going to create bigger problems than it could ever potentially solve. The validity of this thesis is becoming increasingly obvious, but Morozov deserves some credit for saying this back in 2013 when everyone still regarded the Obama campaign hoovering Facebook’s entire data set as brilliant electioneering, rather than a horrifying sign of things to come.

Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded by Jason Heller—I’m not sure anyone has written a book on the confluence of science fiction and pop music before Heller’s book, which came out this year. Suffice to say, both science fiction and rock music emerged as cultural forces at the same time in the ’60s and ’70s and even a dedicated music geek such as myself was surprised to learn that one of Bowie’s early songs was inspired by the short story that gave us Soylent Green, and that the title “Purple Haze” isn’t (entirely) a drug reference, it was lifted from one of the many sci-fi novels Hendrix was reading at the time. Illuminating anecdotes such as these abound, and Strange Stars’ biggest flaw is that at just over 200 pages it isn’t long enough.

The Wishbones by Tom Perotta—The Hollywood adaptions of Perotta’s novels are better known than the novels themselves; he provided the source material for Election, Little Children, and the TV show The Leftovers. The Wishbones is the only Perotta novel I’ve read so far, an entertaining romp about a member of a popular wedding band in New Jersey who is hanging on to his rock and roll dreams and refusing to get on with his life.

While far from perfect (it was Perotta’s first book), it’s exactly the kind of purely entertaining novels that speak to male fears that I wish their were more of. Authors like Updike and Roth are revered for a reason, but there’s something to be said for the male equivalent of chick lit. Maybe the crisis of masculinity would be less of a problem if we read more books that sugarcoat some moralistic lessons about manning-up and accepting responsibility, rather than wallowing in literary ego.

Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness: Ten Years of the Claremont Review of Books edited by Charles R. Kesler and John B. Kienker—I spent a good chunk of time in early 2018 plowing through this doorstop compilation of one of America’s most underappreciated publications. Claremont’s work in popularizing the idea that a permanent American administrative state with ideological origins in the late 19th and early 20th century progressive movement is our single biggest impediment to needed political reforms (a.k.a. “Draining the Swamp”) has been tremendously influential. And somehow the assorted authors in Claremont’s orbit seem to address matters of weighty political philosophy in way that is pleasurable enough to make you want to do the heavy intellectual lifting necessary to understand what they’re saying.

Well, that’s a wrap for this year’s reading suggestions. Keep literacy alive, and thanks for reading The Federalist.

New Documents Suggest The Steele Dossier Was A Setup For Trump,"A trove of recently released documents sheds further light on the scope and logistics of the information operation designed to sabotage an American election. Players include the press, political operatives from both parties, and law enforcement and intelligence officials. Their instrument was the Steele dossier, first introduced to the American public two years ago.

A collection of reports compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, the dossier is now engraved in contemporary U.S. history. First marketed as bedrock evidence that Donald Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election, the dossier’s legitimacy took a hit after reports showed the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the work.

The revelation that the dossier was used to secure a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page compromised the integrity of the investigation the FBI had opened on Page and three other Trump associates by the end of July 2016. Nonetheless, that same probe continues today as the special counsel investigation.

The dossier plays a central role in Robert Mueller’s probe. In the unredacted portions of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s memo outlining Mueller’s scope are allegations that Trump adviser Paul Manafort colluded with Russian government officials interfering in the 2016 race. That claim is found in no other known document but the dossier. It is unclear whether further dossier allegations are in the redacted portions of the scope memo.

Further, with Mueller in charge, the dossier-won warrant on Page was renewed a third, and final, time in June 2017. It expired in September, when confidential human source Stefan Halper reportedly broke off regular communications with Page.

The Dossier Model Is Being Replicated

Paradoxically, it is the Mueller investigation that has most thoroughly tested the veracity of the dossier’s claims. After the FBI’s monitoring of Page for nearly a year, with access to his electronic communications prior to the warrant, the special counsel has brought no charges against the former Navy officer alleged in the dossier to be at the center of a criminal conspiracy.

Yet the dossier abides. Even as prominent and early collusion theory promoter journalist Michael Isikoff now questions its probity, many still contend that Steele’s reports have not been “disproven.” After nearly two years since the Steele dossier was published, it remains the cornerstone of the case for collusion. Moreover, the dossier model has given rise to similar operations, joining the press, political operatives, and intelligence officials, not all of them American, targeting Trump policies.

The reported murder of Arab intelligence operative and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was used as a platform by Turkish intelligence, the government of Qatar, and U.S. operatives to advance a campaign through the press, with the Post playing a leading role, against the administration’s pro-Saudi policies.

Democratic officials teamed with the media to thwart Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, also using an FBI investigation as a political tool. “We were very concerned when Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pushed for another FBI investigation of Kavanaugh,” said a congressional investigator on the Republican side familiar with the dossier operation. “We didn’t know who would get it at the bureau and who we can trust over there.”

Cyber-security experts hired by the Senate Intelligence Committee to write a report on how Russian social media accounts helped Trump beat Clinton themselves created fake Russian social media accounts to dirty the GOP Senate candidate in last year’s special Alabama election. As the dossier operation targeted Trump, the bot operation created the impression that Roy Moore was supported by the Kremlin.

Pretext for Two Years of Treason Accusations

The dossier operation has not only damaged institutions like the FBI and DOJ, it has also poisoned the public sphere, perhaps irremediably. As a result, it is now accepted journalistic practice to print, and reprint, any garish fantasy so long as it’s layered with Russian intrigue and Trump team treason. Even as the rest of the country sees an institution that has made itself a laughingstock, the press continues to salute itself for its bravery—or the courage and industry required to take leaks from law enforcement and intelligence officials and Democratic operatives in an effort to topple a president it doesn’t like, elected by neighbors it holds in contempt.

How did it come to this? Former FBI director James Comey ushered in the era of the dossier when he briefed Trump on January 6, 2017 on reports that “the Russians allegedly had tapes involving him and prostitutes at the Presidential Suite at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow from about 2013.”

Last week, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted version of the two-page memo on the dossier with which Comey briefed the president-elect. The “source’s reporting,” reads the memo, referring to Steele, “appears to have been acquired by multiple Western press organizations starting in October.”

As Comey later recorded in a separate memorandum documenting the meeting, he told Trump that “media like CNN had [the reports] and were looking for a news hook.” The briefing provided one.

According to Comey’s recent testimony, James Clapper ordered the briefing. The former director of national intelligence is believed to have then tipped off CNN, which later hired him as a commentator. After the award-winning CNN story posted, BuzzFeed published the document, passed to the news organization by Republican aide David Kramer.

The Frame Game Is Bipartisan

In his testimony, Comey again pushed the fiction that Republicans opposed to Trump first paid for the dossier. Congressional Republicans are right that Comey is trying to muddy the waters—the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded Steele’s work.

None of it would have been possible had the media not linked arms with spies, cops, and lawyers to relay a story first spun by Clinton operatives.

But credit Comey for underscoring, and maybe not accidentally, a larger truth—the operation that sought to defraud the American voter had bipartisan support all along. Court documents released in December show that Steele gave his final report to Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger and House Speaker Paul Ryan’s chief of staff, Jonathan Burks.

How is it possible that so many people knew and said nothing? Everyone knows it’s impossible to sustain a real conspiracy that size. People in the know talk and the press makes it public. But they did talk—all the time. But the conversations, implicit confessions, of FBI agents and other U.S. officials were hidden by colleagues who classified their talk, or deleted it, like FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page’s text messages.

The press didn’t report it because the press is part of the operation, the indispensable part. None of it would have been possible, and it certainly wouldn’t have lasted for two years, had the media not linked arms with spies, cops, and lawyers to relay a story first spun by Clinton operatives.

Starting with a relatively small group consisting of Steele, Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, and senior FBI, DOJ, CIA, and State Department officials, the dossier operation gained momentum and adherents, senior officials across the political spectrum, a large part of the press corps, then the many millions of Americans it wound into a frenzied madness. Thus, much of the dossier operation was improvised.

But the core component appears to be the result of a carefully constructed plan requiring technical and legal know-how. Interviews with current and former U.S. officials provide fresh insight into how Clinton-funded operatives and senior law enforcement figures orchestrated a media campaign and weaponized the dossier to obtain the October 21, 2016 warrant on Page.

Fishing for a FISA Warrant

The claim from the recently released two-page Comey memo that Steele’s “reporting appears to have been acquired by multiple Western press organizations starting in October” is inaccurate. The allegations that were eventually rolled into the Steele dossier first started appearing in the press six months previously. Understanding how the company that produced the dossier operates may clarify matters.

Fusion GPS started briefing the press on dossiers of Trump-Russia material long before BuzzFeed made the aggregate document public.

Fusion GPS calls the two- to three-page handouts that it distributes to its media customers dossiers. The so-called Steele dossier is a collection of 17 Fusion GPS dossiers apparently written over the period of several months in 2016 and published by BuzzFeed in January 2017.

Fusion GPS started briefing the press on dossiers of Trump-Russia material long before BuzzFeed made the aggregate document public. An echo chamber of Trump-Russia stories (New York Magazine, Slate, and two in Politico) that appeared in April shows Fusion GPS was coordinating with the media shortly after it was hired by the Clinton campaign in March.

There is also confusion concerning the dossier’s sources. The Comey memo contends that Steele “collects information from a layered network of identified and unidentified subsources.” Presumably some genuine human sources fed the reporting. The dossier, however, was produced not by an intelligence bureaucracy, but by an opposition research firm whose “research,” according to Simpson’s Senate testimony, “is very document focused.”

The handouts Fusion GPS distributes to journalists are typically sourced to news articles, with footnotes and links, often from foreign or lesser-known media outlets. As another Fusion GPS contractor working on the Trump-Russia project explained, the job was to “produce memos based on information that is in the public record that can be given to the feds or shared with journalists.”

The Making of a Memo

Many of the dossier’s sources are taken from media reports or other documents, without the customary footnotes and links. For instance, it appears that the most notorious Steele memo recycled earlier Trump-Russia reports.

Around the same time Fusion GPS was hired, longtime Clinton foot-soldier Cody Shearer was also probing for ties between Trump and Russia. He, too, was speaking to media figures, like former CIA official Robert Baer. Shearer wrote two reports (“Donald Trump—Background Notes—The Compromised Candidate,” and “FSB Interview”), which are likely sources for the dossier report on which Comey briefed Trump.

Both Shearer memos detail Trump’s alleged sexual proclivities. One claims there is film of a woman urinating on him. The other Shearer report alleges that there is video of Trump caught in a sexual tryst in the presidential suite of the Moscow Ritz-Carlton in 2013. According to Shearer’s FSB source, this is how the Russians compromised Trump.

These are nearly identical to the core findings that Steele seems to have shared with the State Department and FBI in June and early July. The chronology of the BuzzFeed document indicates no other memos existed at that point. It’s not known whether Steele shared reporting with U.S. authorities that was not included in the BuzzFeed version.

Seeding the Media with Collusion Claims

DOJ officials claim that Steele’s reports regarding the Republican candidate’s alleged relationship to an adversarial foreign power were shelved for several months. However, action on the media front in early summer shows this is unlikely.

Shortly after Steele met with an FBI agent in London the first week of July, the press was briefed on his subsequent reporting. On July 26, a Wall Street Journal reporter texted Carter Page to ask for comment on allegations that he had met with Igor Sechin, a Russian energy executive and Putin ally, to discuss “energy deals and the possibility of the U.S. government lifting sanctions.”

The reporter’s queries match allegations made in a July 19 Steele memo that Page met with Sechin, who was sanctioned by the United States in 2014, during a Moscow trip earlier that month to discuss “future bilateral energy cooperation and prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related Western sanctions on Russia.” These claims were entered in the original FISA application and all three renewals.

The FBI terminated its arrangement with Steele after discovering that he had briefed the press for a Mother Jones article published October 31. The House Intelligence Committee’s FISA memo argued that

Steele should have been fired for his “undisclosed contacts” with press outlets in September, before the FISA application was submitted to the court. But the exchange between Page and the WSJ reporter shows the press was being briefed on what is said to be Steele’s reporting by the end of July. Page wrote on Twitter recently that Fusion GPS fed the journalist this material.

Page has denied that he knows Sechin, the president of Rosneft (Russia’s major petroleum company), or the Kremlin official named in the memo. He responded to the Journal reporter that the “sanctions lifting point” was “ridiculous.”

The Advantages of Targeting a Normal Person

The former Trump volunteer brecently filed a defamation lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee and the law firm, Perkins Coie, that hired Fusion GPS on Clinton and the DNC’s behalf. “Until then, I was an unknown name,” Page told The Federalist in a recent phone call. “The advantage of smearing a private figure is that you can make up whatever lies you want. If you’re sketching someone on a blank slate, then it’s easy to draw a fictional characterization.”

According to intelligence officials, the fact that Page was relatively unknown made him an attractive target.

Intelligence sources told The Federalist that Page was likely targeted as a means of accessing the Trump team’s communications.

“It can be tougher to make a FISA case on a prominent, government-connected figure,” said former Army intelligence officer Chris Farrell, now director of investigations at Judicial Watch. “But you can spin a tale about a guy who is on the margins. You can make sweeping generalizations, you don’t have to be too detailed. And they’d use the lack of information on Page to explain that’s precisely why they need the warrant—to learn more about him.”

Intelligence sources told The Federalist that Page was likely targeted as a means of accessing the Trump team’s communications.

“It’s not just that it would be hard to convince a judge to let you target Trump,” said a former senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “There’s an upside to going after a middle or lower-level figure in an organizational structure.”

According to FISA’s two-jump protocol, the FBI can monitor the communications of those in contact with the target and those in contact with them. Law enforcement would look for a target likely to provide the largest aperture into an organization.

“The fact that Page was a peripheral campaign figure meant he was in contact with more people than someone like Trump, whose contacts were likely pretty limited,” said the same source. “Trump’s the top guy, so his contacts within the team are through a funnel, a handful of aides. Targeting Page would give them broader ability to hop. His first order contacts within the campaign team were probably limited, maybe 15 people—who knows? But that would give lots of access to other people on the second hop, maybe 30 or 40 times that.”

Page is the dossier’s protagonist. It is the dossier’s account of his actions that earned the October 21 warrant. A former prosecutor familiar with the case told The Federalist that when he first read the dossier, he recognized immediately that Page was the central figure: “All the other stuff isn’t that important. The other characters appear to be secondary. Page is the leading actor, the centerpiece of the dossier. He’s the one who is alleged to have committed a crime.”

Crossing the Criminal Accusation Threshold

To get a FISA warrant on American citizen, there must be probable cause to believe that the subject has or may be about to commit a crime.

Retired FBI agent Mark Wauck enumerated what is required to get a FISA warrant on a U.S. person. “He must be acting as an agent of a foreign power,” Wauck told The Federalist. “He must be engaged in clandestine intelligence activity, and the clandestine intelligence activity involves or may involve a violation of a criminal statute. No crime alleged, no FISA warrant,”

Title I of the 1978 Foreign Surveillance Act—“Electronic Surveillance within the United States for Foreign Intelligence Purposes”—lays it out. Under the definition of “agent of a foreign power,” there are two categories: “any person other than a United States person,” and “any person.” Since Page is an American citizen, he falls into the second category.

According to Wauck, the relevant parts are two paragraphs in Section 101 (b) (2). To obtain a FISA warrant on a U.S. person, the target either:

(A) knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States; (B) pursuant to the direction of an intelligence service or network of a foreign power, knowingly engages in any other clandestine intelligence activities for or on behalf of such foreign power, which activities involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States.

“So to get a FISA on Page,” says Wauck. “They must allege that his clandestine intelligence activities involve or may involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States. No exceptions, no way around it. So, rest assured that somewhere in the application–possibly redacted–there is an allegation regarding a criminal violation.”

Former DOJ official Andrew McCarthy made a similar observation in a September 2018 National Review column analyzing the FISA application, with special attention to the probable cause section. Why, asks McCarthy, do Page’s crimes appear to be redacted? “Is it because the ‘crime’ allegations come from the Steele dossier and the FBI would rather not acknowledge that?”

The timeline and composition of the dossier suggest this is the case. Thus it’s instructive to see the narrative constructed around Page—both the media legend and the dossier memos that were fed into the FISA application—as an instrument built for a specific goal: To secure a warrant to spy on the Trump team, using Page as a point of entry.

Using Page to Get Trump

First, Page, all but unknown in foreign policy circles, had to be portrayed as a key member of the Trump team. This was the goal of the media campaign targeting Page.

The Wall Street Journal reporter appears to have been one of several journalists briefed during the same period on Page’s alleged Russian-related activities. Articles published during July and early August (The Atlantic, The New Yorker, The Weekly Standard, Washington Post, and Slate) cite Page’s biography and articles as evidence of Trump’s ties to Russia.

An important target audience was the handful of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judges likely to read the application for a warrant on the Trump adviser.

Page’s alleged interactions with Russian officials were represented as part of a larger clandestine network linking the Trump team to the Kremlin.

“By the time it got to the secret court,” said a senior congressional source, “it was supposed to be common knowledge that Page was strangely friendly to Russia.”

Page is first identified in the dossier in an undated memo (Report 095), apparently from the mid-July period, as an intermediary used by Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort to manage the “well-developed conspiracy” between Trump and the Russians.

Among other pieces of evidence cited in the dossier to prove Manafort’s connections to the Kremlin is an August 22 report detailing a “secret” meeting the previous week between Putin and former Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovich, a former Manafort client. In their meeting, according to the dossier, Yanukovich confirmed to Putin that he “authorized the kick-back payments to Manafort, as alleged in western media.”

The memo is likely referring to a New York Times article from the previous week sourced to Ukrainian activists. But the August 15 meeting in Volgograd between Putin and Yanukovich is an invention.

A Russian government website shows Putin was in Volgograd on that date, for a one-day trip. Yanukovich, however, didn’t get to Volgograd until August 18, three days after Putin left. It would have been hard to miss Yanukovich’s arrival, since he pulled into port on a triple-decker yacht.

It appears that Steele or another Fusion employee had mistaken the date in published reports, like this one from Meduza, a Russian opposition publication based in Latvia.

Thus Page’s alleged interactions with Russian officials were represented as part of a larger clandestine network linking the Trump team to the Kremlin. Press coverage of Page’s July trip to Moscow, and his speech there, proved he was somehow engaged in Russia-related affairs—while the dossier purported to unveil the real, nefarious purpose of his trip.

Ticking Off the FISA Boxes

The July 19 Steele memo alleging that Page had a “secret meeting” with Sechin checked off an important box for the FISA application process.

“It’s to find out about the target’s clandestine activities on behalf of foreign powers. It doesn’t make sense if it’s a public meeting in Red Square,” said Wauck. “Next you’d want to show that the people he met with clandestinely were part of the criminal activity.”

The memo ties Page’s potentially criminal actions to Trump himself.

However, there is no crime alleged in the July 19 memo. The substance of Page’s supposed meeting is not criminal. Removing sanctions on Russia in exchange for bilateral energy cooperation would be a matter of policy.

The criminal predicate for the FISA warrant is introduced subsequently, in a memo dated almost exactly three months later, October 18. Report 134 is essentially a revision of the July 19 memo. It discusses the same meeting in early July and appears to be described by the same intimate of Sechin’s who reported the meeting to Steele’s intermediary in July. This time, however, Sechin’s “close associate” gives a significantly different account to Steele’s source—he “elaborated on the reported secret [July] meeting.”

According to the October 18 report, instead of offering bilateral energy cooperation in exchange for convincing Trump to relieve sanctions, Sechin tells Page that he will profit personally. According to the memo, Page was offered “the brokerage of up to a 19% (privatised) stake in Rosneft in return.”

That’s bribery. The scheme would have benefited both men, likely removing sanctions on Sechin and making Page a wealthy man. The brokerage fee would have amounted to at least tens of millions of dollars on a percentage worth more than $10 billion.

The Trump adviser, the report continues, “expressed interest and confirmed that were Trump elected US president, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.” The memo ties Page’s potentially criminal actions to Trump himself. According to Steele’s source, Page was “speaking with the Republican candidate’s authority.”

The Importance of 19 Percent

Newly incoming House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff contended back in March 2017 that the fact Rosneft did eventually sell off a 19 percent stake, to Qatar, proves the veracity of the dossier. However, the number would have been easy to find on the internet. By spring 2016 it was widely reported that Russia, hurting from both sanctions and a drop in energy prices, intended to sell off between 19 and 19.5 percent of Rosneft.

‘It suggests that the scenario may have been directed by the FBI.’

Nevertheless, the 19 percent figure may have won the warrant. “Imagine you’re before a judge,” said Wauck, “and you’re making a case that your suspect was involved in a bribery scheme. If you give a real figure, that’s a lot more persuasive than saying he was handed a suitcase full of cash.”

While the allegations from the July 19 memo regarding the Page-Sechin meeting are included in all four FISA applications, the dossier’s allegations of Page’s crime are apparent in neither the original nor the three renewals. Either the warrants failed for some reason to include sensational allegations of a potential crime in connection with the clandestine intelligence activities of a FISA target, or the allegations are redacted. Perhaps that was to conceal evidence that Steele’s October 18 memo secured the FISA three days later.

The rapid turnaround is not typical, says Judicial Watch’s Farrell. “An act of espionage may not be reportable for years. By its nature, you’re talking about clandestine activity, so you may not find out about it until long after it’s happened. Here the operational activity is identified almost immediately. And then it’s followed by a warrant. It suggests that the scenario may have been directed by the FBI.”

"Hate Crimes Trending Down, But You Wouldn’t Know From LGBT Media","It must be a confusing time for many gay Americans. On the one hand, we read headlines from LGBT advocacy organizations like the Human Rights Campaign saying “New FBI Statistics Show Alarming Increase in Number of Reported Hate Crimes.” On the other we see headlines championing a new wave of LGBT political leaders taking office, such as the Washington Post’s “A banner year for LGBT candidates got even stronger with Kyrsten Sinema’s Senate win.”

President Trump nominated an openly gay and conservative lawyer, Patrick Bumatay, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, just as the HRC’s Chad Griffin declares, “A banner year for the LGBTQ community made clear that the days of attacking LGBTQ people for political gain are over, and the American people will not stand for lawmakers who try to drum up votes by trafficking in hate.”

While the majority, if not all, of legal and social issues facing gay Americans have been settled in our favor, LGBT media seem fixated on the narrowing list of negative experiences still affecting us. In particular, this includes raising alarm over a claimed rise in hate crimes.

In support of a new HRC initiative titled United Against Hate, Griffin tweeted, “New statistics reveal a disturbing increase in reported hate crimes & ongoing epidemic of anti-trans violence. Lawmakers must act with urgency to address this crisis and stand united against those who embolden hate through their words, actions, or silence.”

The report says there has been a 17 percent increase in hate crimes from 2016 to 2017. Citing the 20th anniversary of the murder of Matthew Shepard, the HRC stated, “These latest FBI hate crime statistics show that even decades after his brutal murder, LGBTQ people and other minorities are still facing alarming levels of hate-fueled violence.”

What we see, however, is actually a fairly steady reporting rate with a downward trend over the last decade. The FBI Hate Crimes report began separating “gender identity,” which includes transgender individuals, in 2013. After a drop that year, there has been a rise in incidents since then.

The HRC relies on a common assumption in discussing hate crimes and violence by insisting the reporting only shows a fraction of the real-world incidents. It states, “87 percent of the agencies that participated in the program reported no hate crimes in their jurisdiction, suggesting that agencies still face challenges in identifying and reporting hate crimes.” The organization also argues that while the number of reporting agencies increased in 2017, since hate crime reporting is voluntary, the numbers do not reflect reality.

The difficulty here is, of course, that since the numbers have adjusted only slightly over the years, a lack of reporting does not necessarily indicate unreported crimes. It is important to note that the definition of “hate crime” varies state to state and the categories of this crime can include persons, property, or society.

Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons (57.6 percent) in 2017 in all categories, 44.9 percent involved “intimidation,” while 34.3 percent were “simple assault.” Simple assault is defined as “the attempt to cause serious physical harm to another individual. It also refers to causing the individual to be in fear or apprehension of an imminent battery. The crime does not involve physical contact with the victim.” Property crimes, which involved 39.7 percent of all hate crimes, were largely vandalism or destruction (73.7 percent).

Certainly, these types of crimes are destructive and traumatic for the victims, but proportion matters as well. It is clear that in the vast majority of these cases no person is physically injured.

Also, many incidents of vandalism turn out to be hoaxes. In November it was found that four out of five racist notes reported on Drake University’s campus in Iowa were committed by the student reporting them, and the fifth was considered a copycat.

Some claims of violence are also found to be hoaxes. In Portland, Oregon the family of a gay 22-year-old claimed he was the victim of a hate crime in which he was thrown from a moving train, resulting in severe injury and coma. An investigation, which included speaking with 300 people including passengers who had interacted with him, concluded, “There is nothing to suggest that he was involuntarily removed from the train. There is nothing to suggest criminal intent in this investigation.”

Hate crimes are also subjective. A case in Long Island in which a 21-year-old man stole LGBT flags from a church on multiple occasions is classified as a “hate crime.”

In July, it was found that in Washington DC nearly half of LGBT hate crimes prosecuted by the district end up being dismissed or dropped. Hate crime convictions are much smaller than reports, as well. In Texas in 2017, “[f]rom 2010 through 2015, there were 981 cases reported to police in Texas as potential hate crimes. ProPublica examined the records kept by the Texas Judicial Branch and confirmed just five hate crime convictions.”

The report goes on to say, “Interviews with law enforcement make clear that some number of the reports wind up dismissed because of too little evidence – or evidence that suggests that the alleged crimes didn’t happen at all. Another considerable number are cases that fail to produce an arrest and thus go unsolved.” Most reported hate crimes, per the interviews, never identify a suspect.

It is also important to remember that reports of transgender murders, often cited as a growing epidemic, often reflect murders of transgender individuals but without a biased motivation. It should also be noted that as LGBT breaks down into smaller and smaller categories with more broad definitions of “hate crime,” this will result in increases at smaller levels even if the overall numbers do not reflect a total trend. So will adding categories, as the FBI did in 2013 with gender identity.

The political left and right view this situation differently. From the left’s perspective, the lack of conviction, evidence, and reporting indicates a systematic problem, reflecting prejudice, ignorance, or both. The right views this all as proof the left is exaggerating the problem. The stream of highly publicized incidents that turn out to be hoaxes and the lack of common experience reflecting the claims of an epidemic of violent hate reinforces this view. Those who are targeted with violence or hatred based on their personal characteristics are significantly harmed by any false claims, since this increases the perception that claims of a hate crime are likely to be a hoax.

One major difficulty in understanding hate crime is that it is not common to witness bias crimes or even hatred targeting a specific protected group. While this does not diminish genuine hate crimes, it does affect their relevancy to public discourse.

The truth is that, outside of rare outliers, hate crimes in general, and LGBT hate crimes in particular, are trending downward over time. While the LGBT media focuses on year by year changes, depending on their current political narrative, it must be viewed as a larger picture of society. Our country is generally growing safer over time, with fluctuations year by year.

As a society we must address violence and hatred, but we do not need to perpetuate fear and paranoia in groups when it is not necessary, especially for politics. We LGBT people live in a remarkably safe and accepting society that takes violence and hatred towards us extremely seriously. It is our obligation to ensure that dedication to defeating this hatred is honored with truth and relevance.

We should be careful not to exaggerate and exploit fear and our fellow Americans’ good intentions. Hate crimes are rare, and LGBT hate crimes are trending downward over time. That is a great thing we should be celebrating as a culture. It will continue to get better if we can focus on fighting real hated and violence, rather than perpetuating political narratives.

"Gov. Pardons Cyntoia Brown, Who Killed Her Allegedly Threatening John","Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) of Tennessee has granted clemency to Cyntoia Brown. She has been in prison since she was 16 years old, for murdering a man who allegedly paid to forcibly have sex with her. She had been serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 51 years.

There are two pictures of what happened the day Johnny Allen, 43, died. The prosecutors who secured Brown’s conviction describe a girl with past drug use who was known to steal, and used her juvenile record to describe a troubled young woman.

Their description of the crime was she planned to rob him. She did take firearms from the property, as well as his wallet and pants. He was found face down, in bed, hands laced together under his head, shot in the back of his skull. Brown didn’t rush to volunteer to the police and prosecutors that she had been trafficked.

There’s another side to the story, though. Brown’s life started with alcohol exposure in the womb, causing alcohol-related impairments. As a baby, she spent time in foster care, becoming a runaway by the time she was a teen. She lacked a stable home life, with no mother and father to protect her.

According to Brown, a man named Garion “Cut Throat” McGlothen pimped her out, forcing her into drug use and abusing her. When she was in bed with Allen, she says he showed her guns and she was afraid he would kill her. She also says that she took the things from Allen’s home to give to McGlothen to avoid being punished by him.

No matter which of these series of events seems most plausible to you, what happened next is clear. She didn’t testify at her trial. This means that the judge and the jury never heard her descriptions of her relationship with McGlothen, including that, “He would explain to me that some people were born whores, and that I was one, and I was a slut, and nobody’d want me but him, and the best thing I could do was just learn to be a good whore.” She connected with this man at 15 years old, living with him in hotels and using cocaine.

Nor was it presented at her original trial that her mother’s alcohol use had affected Brown’s mental abilities. When Brown was 24, she had a new lawyer, and the new lawyer connected her with Dr. Richard Adler, a clinical and forensic psychiatrist. He examined Brown and explained what alcohol use like her mother’s does to children, diagnosing her with an alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder related to fetal alcohol syndrome with a functional level of a 13- or 14-year-old.

Despite this, Brown was charged and tried as an adult at 16. As a 24-year-old, she was functioning as a young teenager, yet the courts felt it was appropriate eight years earlier to try and convict her for life as an adult.

Once convicted, she sat in prison for years until her life began attracting media and celebrity attention. Much of the coverage focused on heartstrings memes, with a picture of a very young-looking 16-year-old Cyntoia and the words, “Imagine at the age of 16 being sex-trafficked by a pimp named ‘cut throat.’ After days of being repeatedly drugged and raped by different men you were purchased by a 43 year old child predator who took you to his home to use you for sex. You end up finding enough courage to fight back and shoot and kill him. You’re arrested as a result tried and convicted as an adult and sentenced to life in prison. This is the story of Cyntoia Brown. She will be eligible for parole when she is 69 years old. #FreeCyntoiaBrown.”

Post-Me Too, it’s easy to see why outrage built. Why was Brown in prison when she was the victim of repetitive violence, for killing a man who picked up a child allegedly for sex she was too young to consent to?

Tennessee’s age of consent is 18, and Brown was well under that, meaning whether she willingly was engaging in sexual contact with men or not, they were perpetrating crimes. Treating her like a criminal and ignoring the distasteful reality of adult men soliciting children for sex misses that their behavior wasn’t legal or right. It’s also worth noting here that McGlothen was 24 when she was 16.

This doesn’t mean responding with murder is right, and that’s not what this is about, either. It’s about appropriate sentencing. Compare Brown’s sentence to that of Brock Turner, the infamous Stanford University swimmer who was sentenced to only six months for penetrating an unconscious woman. Turner and his father refused to take responsibility for the seriousness of that crime, with his father writing in defense against a sentence of six months, “That is a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20-plus years of life.”

Contrast that with Brown’s attitude since incarceration. She’s worked on her education, earning a GED, an associate’s degree from Lipscomb University, and will have a bachelor’s degree in 2019. Brown doesn’t deny her guilt, and apologizes for what she did. Nor did she ever act entitled to be released, rather hoping for forgiveness and mercy: “I’m not saying I deserve anything. I’m asking for mercy. I’m telling you that I am a completely different person.”

Nor will Brown be released from prison after weeks or months of time served. She’s been in prison for 15 years. When she is released on August 7, she will have spent nearly as much time in prison as she has spent outside of it.

The time served, as well as the idea of the ability to change and be forgiven, weighed into Haslam’s decision to offer Brown clemency. He said, “This decision comes after careful consideration of what is a tragic and complex case. Cyntoia Brown committed, by her own admission, a horrific crime at the age of 16. Yet, imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms. Brown has taken to rebuild her life. Transformation should be accompanied by hope.”

Should we be sentencing juveniles with adult sentences, especially those with developmental delays? Tennessee has since changed its juvenile sentencing guidelines, inspired in part by Brown’s story. Crime deserves punishment, but the punishment needs to fit the crime, and consider the circumstances around the act. That’s what justice means.

Disagreeing With Conventional D.C. Wisdom Isn’t A Crime,"The New York Times recently reported that president Donald Trump has, on a number of occasions, contemplating withdrawing from NATO. This is an important issue for public debate and, ultimately, for elections. There is, however, no Constitutional amendment codifying a forever-alliance with select European nations. So if Trump decides to try and pull out of the alliance—and to this point, he’s done nothing to move in that direction—it would be well within his purview. Even if Trump’s sole reason for doing so was to placate Russia in hopes of building better relations with that nation, he’s engaged in neither high crime nor misdemeanor.

Some of us believe Trump is misguided to consider exiting the pact, but it’s become a matter of faith among many Democrats and Never Trumpers that the very act of disagreeing with their (often newly acquired) foreign policy positions is a crime against “democracy.” As one-time US Attorney Preet Bharara, a hero to the resistance for the valiant act of being fired, tweeted: “If true: Trump should immediately and publicly state his apparent wish to withdraw from NATO so he can be promptly impeached, convicted, and removed from office.”

Article of impeachment: 1 – The duly elected president of the United States holds opinions at odds with the conventional wisdom of the DC establishment.

As it happens, The New York Times also recently reported that the FBI “began investigating whether President Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests” soon after he fired his subordinate, FBI Director James Comey. In other words, as far as we now know, the nation’s top law enforcement agency purportedly launched a counterintelligence investigation in part, or maybe in whole, because it deemed Trump’s firing of their boss unjustified, and his positions too favorable towards Russia and thus a threat to national security.

For starters, the idea that the president should be embroiled in an investigation prompted by his foreign policy positions is both dangerous and arguably unconstitutional. We’ll soon know if there was any genuine evidence to substantiate such a remarkable move. If not, it would mean that the FBI engaged in an unprecedented attack on a duly elected president. It’s not the FBI’s job to set foreign policy.

After all, we have widely divergent ideas about what “American interests” look like. Which ones is the FBI going to treat as potentially criminal? No one contemplated investigating or impeaching Barack Obama after he was caught on a hot mic assuring Putin’s puppet that he was lying to the American electorate and would have “more flexibility” to acquiesce to Russia’s demands on NATO missile defense in Europe. If pliancy towards illiberal regimes is a red flag, the obsequiousness of Obama administration officials toward the American-killing Islamic regime in Iran (and its terrorist proxies) should have sounded alarms at the FBI.

Moreover, in the real world, Trump has taken the same kind of impulsive and inconsistent positions on Russia as he’s taken on any number of issues. On the policy front, there’s an argument that he’s been at least as tough on Russia than the previous two administrations.

Voters knew these were his positions before they voted. Everyone understood that Trump would be flattering Putin – which isn’t exactly new for American presidents. Everyone knew that Trump was skeptical about the usefulness of NATO. His positions were widely covered. During the presidential campaign, Trump went on a long rant about how antiquated and expensive the alliance had gotten: “NATO was set up at a different time,” Trump said. “NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We’re not a rich country anymore.”

We’re not a rich country anymore, we’re still the richest. That certainly doesn’t mean debating the usefulness and cost of NATO is an attack on “democracy” – a catch-all for conventional bipartisan policies. A 2018 Reuters poll, conducted after Trump got back from haranguing Europeans, found that 49 percent of American voters believe that the United States shouldn’t be required to defend NATO allies from attack if Europeans didn’t contribute more to their defense. Anyway, the public is shocked about the prospects of backing out of NATO (and did I mention, I’m skeptical that we’re ever going to withdraw) then voters can let their displeasure be known through elections, not by deputizing law enforcement agencies.

Of course, Congress—the same Congress that abdicated its responsibility on foreign policy long ago–can impeach and remove the president for any reasons it sees fit. Yet, there should be two debates: One regarding the president’s positions and another about his disposition and legality of his actions. Yet, Trump’s obsessed adversaries can’t help but conflate those things to create an all-encompassing overwrought case that ends up making everything about one man. They have few ethical or constitutional qualms about enlisting every institution to undo the 2016 election. And, in the end, no one is really talking about NATO, are they? They’re just talking about Trump.

Two Democrat Gun Bills To Fight Like The Dickens,"As expected, within the first few days of the new Congress, Democrats announced legislation designed to eventually lead to the confiscation of firearms best suited for defensive purposes: semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, and—if they can get District of Columbia v. Heller overturned, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has advocated— handguns.

Last Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced her latest bill, co-sponsored by 27 other Democrat senators and Bernie Sanders, to ban new “assault weapons,” meaning mostly AR-15s and similar semi-automatic rifles. The bill would also ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Such magazines are designed for defensive purposes and are primarily used in semi-automatic rifles and handguns for that purpose.

Feinstein’s bill would allow existing owners to keep their firearms and magazines. However, no one should be fooled. As mayor of San Francisco, Feinstein banned handguns from that city entirely until her ban was struck down in court. Also, in 1995, talking about her first “assault weapon ban” on CBS “60 Minutes,” she said, “If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t there.”

Feinstein is playing the long game. She knows she doesn’t have the votes for gun confiscation now. However, on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will resume their efforts to “expand” background checks on gun purchases and that is the first of several steps toward fundamentally transforming the background check system into a national gun registry that can be used to enforce gun confiscation, once Democrats have the votes for confiscation.

It’s Not About Crime

Even in a nation where Pollyannas believe facial recognition technology is designed to stop shoplifting, no one should be naïve enough to fall for Democrats’ pretenses that these bills are aimed at reducing crime. According to the FBI, rifles, of which AR-15s and rifles like them are a subset, are used in only two percent of murders, while roughly 30 percent of murders are committed without firearms of any type. More people are murdered with knives, more with bludgeons, and more by being beaten or kicked than with rifles of any type.

Also, studies by the Department of Justice (such as here, here, here, and here) have found that most criminals who use guns steal them, buy them on the black market, or get them with the help of a “straw purchaser,” the term for a fake buyer who passes the background check, buys the gun, and immediately hands it over to the criminal waiting in the parking lot.

There is an exception. Most mass murderers who use guns submit themselves to background checks. However, they pass them. As Northeastern University Professor James Alan Fox, the nation’s leading criminologist in the study of murder, has explained, “Most mass murderers do not have criminal records or a history of psychiatric hospitalization. They would not be disqualified from purchasing their weapons legally.”

Additionally, if Democrats cared about reducing crime, they would support President Trump’s effort to prevent violent criminals from illegally entering our country across our southern border. After all, more people are murdered by illegal aliens than by anyone using any of the firearms Feinstein, other Democrats, and Sanders are proposing to ban.

It’s About Control

Crime statistics are beside the point, however. Governments don’t infringe the right to keep and bear arms to reduce crime. They do it to maintain their power over the ruled.

In the old days, at least, they were honest about it. As David B. Kopel, of the Independence Institute, noted in The Samurai, The Mountie, And The Cowboy, the 16th-century Japanese ruler Hideyoshi decreed, “The people in the various provinces are strictly forbidden to have in their possession any swords, short swords, bows, spears, firearms, or other arms. The possession of unnecessary implements makes difficult the collection of taxes and tends to foment uprisings.”

Similarly, as George Mason University Professor Joyce Lee Malcolm has noted, “After the English Reformation [Catholics] were regarded as potential subversives, and as such were liable to have their arms impounded.” And just before the English civil wars, “Wails of despair were heard from city to city as the royal army confiscated public magazines and disarmed local residents. . . . Forewarned was forearmed, and from 1642 Englishmen learned to hide their firearms and to stockpile weapons.”

Closer to home, in 1775, English soldiers tried to confiscate colonists’ weapons in Concord not to reduce crime, but because the English had declared Massachusetts to be in rebellion. Similarly, in 1835, the war for Texas’ independence from Mexico began when the Mexican army, fearing rebellion against the dictator Santa Anna, demanded that the people of Gonzales, Texas, surrender their cannon, to which the Texians and Tejanos replied as did Spartan King Leonidas to Xerxes’ similar demand before the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.

Trying To Ban Semi-Automatic Rifles and Handguns For 85 Years

The late Jeff Cooper, a former Marine, the founder of the Gunsite Training Academy, and the originating force behind the modern defensive handgun technique wrote in The Art of The Rifle that “a citizenry armed with rifles simply cannot be tyrannized.”

Democrats have known as much for a long time. In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Firearms Act (NFA) which, among other things, required the registration, with the federal government, of any “machinegun,” defined to include only fully-automatic firearms, most of which are rifles.

However, as originally envisioned, the NFA would have banned “machineguns” altogether and defined such guns as any fully-automatic or semi-automatic firearm that could fire more than 12 shots without reloading. Such a definition would have included any fully-automatic or semi-automatic firearm (rifle, pistol, or even shotgun) that could use a detachable ammunition magazine, because a firearm that can use any detachable magazine can use one of any size. The NFA would also have required the registration of handguns, presumably those not banned as “machineguns.”

Fortunately, the Department of Justice opposed a ban on the grounds that it would have violated the Second Amendment. The idea that banning fully-automatic firearms is constitutional would have to wait until 2008, when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia would fabricate a rationale to that effect in District of Columbia v. Heller.

Also, the NFA’s definition of “machinegun” was changed to correctly exclude semi-automatics and the handgun registration requirement was dropped. Similarly, the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, also signed by FDR, would have required the registration of handguns and licensing of handgun owners, but the version passed by Congress omitted those two restrictions.

If You Can’t Register Handguns, Just Ban Them

Until a few years ago, even though it should be obvious that laws are designed to control people, not inanimate objects, disarmament activists used the term “gun control” to describe laws that infringe the right to keep and bear arms.

Hence, the massive set of restrictions President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1968 was called the Gun Control Act. Johnson complained that it didn’t require the registration of all guns and the licensing of all gun owners, but in 1974 the activists, convinced that the time was ripe for even more severe infringements than Johnson had envisioned, formed two groups: the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH), the name of which indicated its goal, and the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH).

Making clear what it meant by “control,” NCCH called for “a ban on the manufacture, sale, and importation of all handguns and handgun ammunition.” Realizing it had forgotten about people who already owned handguns, in 1976 it called for a law “to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.” It also explained how it envisioned its goal being achieved:

The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns being produced and sold in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.

However, disarmament activists had a rough time in the 1970s and 1980s. Congress and the states refused to ban handguns. Handgun ban referenda were defeated in California and Massachusetts. Congress repealed the Gun Control Act’s requirement that buyers of handgun ammunition sign ledgers documenting their purchases. And Florida became the 11th state to adopt a fair system for issuing handgun carry permits.

So, in 1988, a former NCBH staffer formed his own group, calling it the New Right Watch, to indicate that he was watching the “right-wingers” who had been responsible for President Ronald Reagan’s 49-state victory in 1984. He had also worked for Amnesty International, which has long been involved in international civilian disarmament efforts at the United Nations. (After the collapse of the Soviet Union, broken-hearted leftists in the West who had campaigned for nuclear disarmament by the United States, Britain, and France, but not by the communists, needed another cause, turning first to “land mines,” then to to civilian disarmament and global warming.)

If You Can’t Ban Handguns, How About Rifles?

Immediately after setting up shop, the New Right Watch proposed that disarmament activists give up on handguns for the moment and switch to a new issue. It said:

Assault weapons [will] strengthen the handgun restriction lobby for the following reasons: It will be a new topic in what has become to the press and public an ‘old’ debate. . . . Handgun restriction consistently remains a non-issue with the vast majority of legislators, the press, and public. . . . Efforts to restrict assault weapons are more likely to succeed than those to restrict handguns.” (Emphasis in the original.)

Democrats’ all-out war to ban semi-automatic rifles, calling them “assault weapons” to make them sound scary, began the following year and has since been promoted by even more fake news than has been thrown at President Trump.

Firearm Registration In The Making

The Gun Control Act requires firearm dealers to maintain records of all firearm sales, including the identity of the purchaser and the make, model, and serial number of firearms purchased. However, the government is not entitled to those records unless for purposes of a specific criminal investigation.

That presented a problem for disarmament-minded Democrats soon after California banned “assault weapons” in 1989 and New Jersey banned “assault firearms” in 1990. Both states’ laws allowed existing owners to keep their guns, if they registered them within an amnesty period. However, only two percent of California’s owners and a similar percentage of New Jersey’s complied with the registration requirements. Since the guns had not been registered to start with, the state governments could not be sure where to look for them.

It dawned on them that they might be able to incrementally morph NICS into a national gun registry.

In 1993 and 1994, the Democrat Congress imposed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Brady bill, imposing a waiting period to “slow down” handgun purchases from dealers, and Feinstein’s “assault weapon ban,” which, fortunately, was written so incompetently that hundreds of thousands of rifles that she thought she had banned were manufactured and sold in a slightly modified form to comply with the law during the 10 years it was in effect. (Feinstein has since had someone rewrite her legislation to correct her initial deficiency.)

At first glance, the Brady bill might seem an outlier here, but it is instead central to the story. An amendment to the bill before final passage called for its waiting period to expire after five years and be replaced by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) with which we are stuck (until such time, if ever, we can get it abolished). Since 1998, a NICS check has been required on anyone who purchases any firearm from any federally licensed firearm dealer.

Disarmament activists, being slow on the up-take, initially opposed NICS, because they were fixated on the idea of a waiting period to “slow down” handgun sales. Most NICS checks are completed in a few minutes. Eventually, however, it dawned on them that they might be able to incrementally morph NICS into a national gun registry, the prerequisite the NCCH had envisioned for confiscation.

After two years of relative safety from Democrats’ disarmament agenda, the threat is back and it is serious.

Toward that end, they began proposing to extend the check requirement to people who buy firearms at gun shows, from people who are not firearm dealers. Then they proposed to extend the requirement to anyone who buys a firearm from a person who is not a dealer, regardless of where the purchase takes place.

Checks, in and of themselves, do not achieve registration, of course. So, in 2009, one of the most aggressive disarmament supporters in Congress, the late-Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), introduced legislation to allow the FBI to retain records of people who pass NICS checks. If checks were required on all purchasers, and all purchasers’ records were retained by the FBI, all that would remain for the system to become a national registry would be for the records to contain the make, model, and serial number of the firearm bought, the data currently kept by firearm dealers.

A bill like Feinstein’s and the one to “expand” background checks could easily pass the House of Representatives. Whether either would pass the Senate or be signed into law by President Trump would likely depend upon the circumstances. After two years of relative safety from Democrats’ disarmament agenda, the threat is back and it is more serious than it has been in a very long time.

Real Goal Of Connecticut's Proposed Ammo Tax Is Less Gun Ownership,"The latest Democratic lurch to the left combines two of their greatest dreams: raising taxes and punishing gun owners. Connecticut Democrats want to impose a punitive 50 percent tax on ammunition sales.

This proposed law will not keep criminals from obtaining ammunition. What it will do is penalize gun owners who engage in sport shooting, or who practice with their firearms. But shooting, whether in simple target practice or as part of more intensive training, is an important part of being a responsible gun owner. Taxing ammunition will only make gun owners poorer and less prepared, without preventing a single crime

Jillian Gilchrest, one of the sponsors of the Connecticut law, asked, “I’m hearing pushback about the need to protect one’s home…but how much ammunition does someone really need to do that?” The answer, of course, is however much ammunition is needed to achieve and maintain shooting proficiency. That Gilchrest’s legislation includes exemptions for military and law enforcement reveals that she is, at some level, aware of this need for training.

The Realities of Gun Ownership and Shooting Practice

Becoming and remaining proficient with a firearm requires regular practice, and that uses a lot of ammunition. I shoot through at least one 50-round box in a quick trip to the range, and may expend hundreds of rounds during an afternoon shooting with friends. Competitive shooters can use much more.

This is why many gun owners stockpile ammunition and buy it in bulk. If I see a good deal on 10mm practice ammo, I will stock up and save, rather than buying one box each time I take my Glock 20 to the range. Responsible gun ownership requires training with your gun, but Democrats want to make it much more expensive and onerous.

Making effective self-defense harder will not reduce crime. Rather, the right to self-defense is one of the best anti-crime measures available, and violent crime plummeted as gun rights were expanded nationwide.

But Democrats have not abandoned their gun control goals, and Connecticut’s latest folly is not an isolated case. Seattle has already imposed extra taxes on firearms and ammunition. And there are many other ways left-wing locales make life harder for gun owners. Chicago spent years trying to regulate shooting ranges out of existence, for example.

The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of a New York City law that prohibits lawful gun owners from “transporting that gun (even in a locked container, separate from its ammunition) anywhere except for one of the seven shooting ranges within the city.” There is no point to this existing law, except to make it more difficult for people to exercise their Second Amendment rights.

Making Life Harder For Law-Abiding Citizens

This harassment of gun owners exemplifies much of the gun control agenda, which is about making life difficult for the law-abiding, rather than preventing and punishing crime. Presumably this nastiness is satisfying for the many Democrats who despise any guns not in the hands of government agents.

However, there is an agenda beyond harassment. Intelligent gun control advocates know that most of the measures they are pushing would do little or nothing to reduce gun crimes. Restricting magazine capacity or banning so-called assault rifles is pointless if the goal of doing so is to “end gun violence,” but they are useful tactics as part of a larger campaign, especially when paired with the sort of harassing laws proposed in Connecticut.

Combining progressively tighter restrictions on firearms with a multitude of laws complicating the right to keep and bear arms makes for a potent incremental strategy of discouraging gun ownership. The rights guaranteed in the Second Amendment are legally undermined and their exercise is discouraged by a bevy of burdensome regulations.

Because the Supreme Court will not let them ban guns entirely, Democrats are imposing costs and legal risks on gun ownership in order to make it too difficult for many to own a gun. The right to keep and bear arms is vitiated if only the rich, the connected, or the exceptionally determined can navigate through a thicket of expenses and regulations to exercise it.

Imposing Undue Burdens

Democrats intend this hassle. The leaders of a political party that shrieks over every restriction on invented constitutional rights are well aware of when they are imposing undue burdens on rights that are listed in the Constitution. Many of them just do not care to abide by the Constitution, which they consider an outdated relic to be twisted or discarded as they see fit. They consider the Second Amendment an embarrassing artifact, rather than an authoritative restraint on their power.

Their end goal is to severely restrict (or even prohibit) private gun ownership, and to enforce this through confiscation. And they have become bolder in saying so. Before he became infamous for supporting infanticide and wearing blackface, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, was pushing for a ban on nearly all semi-automatic firearms, with no exemption for those already legally owned. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California has even suggested that the government might nuke citizens for resisting gun confiscation.

This extremism illuminates why gun control proposals are rarely targeted at reducing violent crime, but instead seek to punish law-abiding citizens and pave the way for draconian restrictions of Second Amendment rights. The proposed Connecticut law is a classic example of this; it has no legitimate crime-fighting goals, but only burdens responsible gun owners.

It is a foundational dictum of American law that the power to tax is the power to destroy. That is the point of the Democrats’ plans to tax arms and ammunition.

Russia Hysteria Proves Foreign Policy Establishment Is A Dumpster Fire,"Chuck Todd got his MSNBC pals together on “Meet the Press Daily” to have a serious, objective, and intellectual discussion of foreign policy and politics. Just kidding.

The Senate Intelligence Committee had just announced it found “no direct evidence” of collusion between President Trump and Russia. Democrats dispute this, without giving much reason why, which is a story in itself.

But Todd and his panel largely ignored that. They were laser-focused on former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort’s legal troubles, which is supposedly the next bombshell in the Russia investigation. Earlier this week, a federal judge found that Manafort lied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, breaking his plea agreement with Mueller’s team.

One of the things Manafort allegedly lied about was his interactions with his longtime business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national, while Manafort was Trump campaign chairman. That Manafort worked with Kilimnik for years is not news. Several years before his work on the Trump campaign, Manafort, along with many other D.C. types including connected Democrats, did a lot of work for Ukraine’s then Russia-backed government.

But Manafort’s meeting with Kilimnik is supposed to be nefarious. Manafort met Kilimnik on August 2, 2016, just weeks before Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign after it emerged that Manafort had long before received undisclosed money from Ukraine’s pro-Russia government. During the meeting with Kilimnik, Mueller’s team alleges that Manafort discussed a plan for peace in Ukraine with Kilimnik, which CNN said “could have had ramifications on U.S. sanctions against Russia.”

Now Manafort faces decades in prison for crimes including and stemming from not paying his taxes and not registering as a lobbyist for a foreign government, which occurred years before he joined the Trump campaign. But back to Todd’s panel.

Todd focused on the “importance of this meeting” with Kilimnik that occurred in a cigar bar. After painting the meeting as without-question nefarious with the help of “Former Senior FBI Official” Chuck Rosenberg, Todd pivoted to paint Trump as a Russian stooge:

Chuck Todd: You know, the other part of this [cigar bar meeting between Manafort and Kilimnik] was how President Trump as a candidate in that same period… August 2nd is the meeting… Here is Donald Trump on July 31st, obviously two days earlier on a Sunday show, being asked about Ukraine. Take a listen.

Then, a clip rolls of Trump’s interview with George Stephanopoulos on July 31, 2016:

Trump: That whole part of the world is a mess under Obama, with all the strength that you’re talking about, and all of the power of NATO and all of this, in the meantime he’s going away [Vladimir Putin] takes Crimea… George Stephanopoulos: But you said you might recognize that. Trump: I’m going to take a look at it, but you know the people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia from what they were and you have to look at that also.

The flashback ends, and back at the MSNBC studio Todd asks the Washington Post’s Robert Costa, “Who would it be in telling Donald Trump, at the middle of July, that giving him that Kremlin talking point, that most of those people speak Russian? Was it Mike Flynn, was it Paul Manafort?”

Costa says it could have been either one. Then Chuck asks Evelyn Farkas—a “Former Pentagon Russia Expert” in the Obama administration—where Trump could have gotten such a talking point, because “nobody else was saying that… nobody in the foreign policy community was saying this?” Here, Todd is implying that Trump, unwitting or not, only could have gotten such a talking point from Russia.

Farkas answers: “If I remember correctly I was in Miami, and I was woken from my vacation revelry, because what he said was outrageous. The idea that he’s basically spouting the Russian line, the Russian propaganda about Crimea, saying ‘Well these people were Russian speakers and they wanted to be part of Russia.’ That’s irrelevant.”

Then Todd adds: “There are Spanish speakers in states in this country, does that mean they want to be part of Mexico?” Finally, Todd asks, “Was there any mainstream American foreign policy person pushing this” other than Manafort and Flynn?

Farkas says no, but adds that “Thankfully President Obama and all the western leaders and the United Nations as a whole said this will not stand.”

Our Foreign Policy Establishment Gets Nothing

From listening to Farkas, you would think Crimea was back in Ukrainian hands. Obama and foreign countries slapped sanctions on Russia, for goodness sakes! The real problem is that Farkas and Todd—and most of our country’s foreign policy establishment—don’t understand realpolitik.

Crimea had been part of Russia since 1783, when tsarist forces won it from the Ottoman Turks, until 1954. In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev gifted Crimea from Soviet Russia to Soviet Ukraine—which, at the time, was essentially the same thing. The transfer was likely meant to reduce ethnic differences between the two Soviet entities, as Crimea’s Russian population could be added to Ukraine’s already sizeable Russian minority. So yes, Trump was factually correct, and it shouldn’t be Russian propaganda to point out Crimea’s Russian population.

Likewise, it isn’t being a Russia apologist to point out that Putin’s motivations at the time were largely driven by realpolitik, not an ethnically driven land grab. Russia has an important naval base in Crimea, which allows it to project power in the Black Sea, which is highly strategically important for Russia. Russia had leased the base from Ukraine until 2042, but the fall of Ukraine’s pro-Russia government in 2014—which Washington had at least something to do with—caused concern about Russia’s continued use of the base. So Putin snapped up Crimea that same year.

That doesn’t excuse Putin’s actions. But knowing the motivations of your opponent, and what he truly seeks, is an essential element to a successful foreign policy.

Don’t forget that when Trump was talking to Stephanopoulos, there was savage fighting in Ukraine, between forces loyal to the Ukraine government in the west and ethnic Russian forces being aided by Russia in the east. Although Trump would eventually send more help to the Ukrainians than Obama did, at the time Trump and many others were worried about America getting sucked into a war with Russia.

Right or wrong, Trump, the consummate deal maker, was surely eyeing ways to end the fighting in Ukraine without escalation—which is and was in America’s interest. As such, in Trump’s mind, it would be foolish to take the Crimea issue off the table.

Trump didn’t have to hear this from a campaign staffer who was somehow secretly connected to the Russians. This is common sense to average Americans, and certainly common sense to Trump. Basically everybody aside from the likes of the people on the MSNBC panel get this.

Likewise, it doesn’t justify Putin’s actions, or delegitimize agreed-upon international boundaries, to point out that the whole Ukraine issue is highly complicated, and America needs to tread lightly. America should have some very real concerns about propping up a corrupt and incompetent government in Kiev. It isn’t pro-Putin to point that out. Fundamentally, does America want to increase the risk of nuclear armed war with Russia over Crimea, or a chunk of eastern Ukraine?

You can’t deviate in any way from their approved mantras or they’ll get mad and call you a traitor. It almost sounds like a religion.

That’s why, at the very least, we should all be able to have a reasonable debate about these issues. But the public discourse is so poisoned by the likes of Todd, Farkas, and their MSNBC panel that a reasonable debate has long ago become impossible. The MSNBC foreign policy gurus think Trump is crazy, but they quite literally don’t know what they are talking about. They think that smart, nuanced foreign policy must be a sign of collusion. You can’t deviate in any way from their approved mantras or they’ll get mad and call you a traitor. It almost sounds like a religion.

By their standards, many of our foreign policy elite—and many Democrats—are colluding with China. And have been for decades. See how this works, and where this gets us?

That’s why our foreign policy establishment is the worst. They have bad ideas about just about everything, and are utterly unwilling to engage about their ideas in a civil manner. That often makes their ideas the only game in town, so that the problem is bipartisan. Sen. Mitch McConnell can’t find enough Senate votes for conservative causes, but he easily found 68 Senate votes to keep us in Afghanistan and Syria. But it’s a bad idea to stay in Syria. And we’ve been in Afghanistan for 18 years, and the situation on the ground isn’t getting any better.

To borrow from an old saying, five people picked at random out of a small-town USA phonebook would do better at foreign policy than that MSNBC panel, or much of our foreign policy establishment. Maybe we start to have a foreign policy that reflects what the people in the phonebook want?

Why Do People Hope Hate Crimes Occurred Even With No Evidence?,"The era of high-profile hate crimes and accusations brings a truly bizarre and disheartening reality. Many people want to see hate and vile action. It is easy to observe, and reflects the deep divides in our society.

The phenomenon happens once an allegation has been made. When evidence is sparse or nonexistent, some people want to believe the worst truly happened. It isn’t that people want new crimes to occur (although some sick people perhaps do desire this). When a hate crime or serious physical or sexual assault is alleged, certain people rally around the alleged victim, explicitly or implicitly revealing their hope that the story is true.

To crystalize this, two examples are instructive: Justice Brett Kavanaugh and “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. In each case, one or more parties made an accusation that had no evidence or corroboration. It was simply a battle of “he said/she said.” Because someone must be lying, we already have one wrong action––the lie, be it the allegation or defense. But rather than hope only that someone had the gall to lie, many genuinely hope the lie is coming from the accused rather than the accuser.

This means people truly want to believe that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted, rather than believe she lied about it. They genuinely hope Smollett was beaten and accosted with racial and homophobic slurs, rather than believe he lied.

Of course, people generally hope no one would lie because that is wrong, but why would people hope a second and worse wrong has also taken place? Why would people hope that Kavanaugh lied and sexually assaulted Ford, instead of just her lying? With Smollett, the choice is between one lie or one real violent assault.

The answer is obvious but unsavory: there is political advantage to the other side being wrong. Partisans and ideologues want to claim the moral high ground for their side, and if the other side can be shown to commit terrible actions, that is desirable. This means that, when evidence is not available, some would rather someone on their own side had been raped, beaten, and accosted so they can proclaim their victimhood and the other side’s brutality in the media rather than believe or admit that someone on their side told a lie.

Underlying this phenomenon is that the truth of the matter is not relevant at this stage, because it isn’t yet known. The desire to believe a despicable crime did happen comes before the evidence is shown and the truth revealed. Perhaps Ford told the absolute truth, and perhaps Smollett is entirely honest. The fact remains there is no corroboration for either claim, and many people viscerally hope the worst truly did happen.

At least among the progressives who hold this view, it’s an irony that they long to see the worst in people. With one breath, they proclaim people to be capable of great evil and malice, and with the next breath ask for more power and control in the government.

All people are corruptible and capable of bad action, so when vile actions are alleged, it is reasonable to believe they actually occurred. In the absence of evidence, it is also reasonable to believe the accusation is a lie. But it is truly odd that anyone hopes, once a lie has been told, that abuse also happened.

Perhaps people believe that since the alleged action is in the past, there is no harm in hoping it is true. After all, it is not a desire for future abuse, which would be unconscionable. But it still means they would rather the person live with the shame, embarrassment, pain, and anguish of victimhood rather than simply be a liar.

We will never see a day where the masses express good faith skepticism in politically charged accusations. For now, when the truth is unknown and evidence is lacking, many people would rather rally to their political side than risk losing the moral high ground by believing or revealing that a lie was told.

Vox Writer: Media Not Responsible For Pushing Smollett Hate Crime Hoax,"After new evidence surfaced on Saturday that actor Jussie Smollett arranged his own alleged assault in Chicago, CNN’s “Reliable Sources” discussed whether the media was responsible for helping push his story. Liz Plank, correspondent at Vox Media, disputed that it was not journalists, but celebrities, who ran with the attackers’ “This is MAGA country” quote.

“The people who were repeating that quote were not news outlets, were not media outlets. It was repeated by, sure, people who maybe had good intentions of wanting to spread the story, and people who had empathy for what they thought was a real story,” she said. “But we can’t confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.”

In fact, many news outlets, including CNN, TMZ, USA Today, NBC News, The New York Times, and others, reported that Smollett’s alleged attackers shouted “This is MAGA country.” Media outlets repeated the phrase in their headlines and reports, as a fact and not as an alleged claim by Smollett.

Many journalists, including Plank herself, also rushed to “spread the story” on Twitter.

Here are the three #JussieSmollett tweets that I can find that @feministabulous RT'd in the early days of the reporting on the incident: pic.twitter.com/PnwVFBh5xj — Jeryl Bier (@JerylBier) February 17, 2019

Here’s one she has since deleted. pic.twitter.com/2i6Nir55fH — Currently between fraudulent suspensions (@jtLOL) February 17, 2019

Plank also argued with panelist Kmele Foster, a partner at Freethink Media, about whether racism, homophobia, and hate crimes are rising in the United States.

“What we do know is that racism is alive and well in this country. Homophobia is alive and well in this country. 2017 set a record for the number of hate crimes,” Plank said, citing an FBI report that hate crimes rose 17 percent from 2016 to 2017.

“When we talk about hate crimes, we talk about there being 15 percent increases in these things–a hate crime is not the sort of thing that we can simply look at and say ‘It is absolutely a hate crime.’ There’s some supposition about that,” Foster said. “There is a great ambiguity about what makes something a hate crime. There are subjective determinations there.”

Foster called out the numbers and the supposed increase Plank claimed because hate crimes are not accurately measured, just as Robby Soave at Reason has pointed out about the FBI’s report:

The numbers just aren’t that useful, given that not all police agencies participate or give accurate totals. As I noted in a previous post, Baltimore County—which represents 830,000 people—reported just one hate crime in 2016. This year, Baltimore County reported 10 hate crimes. Did incidents of hate increase tenfold in a single year? Probably not; it’s likelier that the police simply submitted more reliable data this year.

Last week in an interview on “Good Morning America,” Robin Roberts let Smollett share his narrative, now contradicted by police reporting, without any questions about the suspicious or doubtful pieces of his story. When the topic was broached on CNN, Plank did not criticize Roberts, but instead argued that, “We must cover these issues as trends and as patterns and not fall into the trap that because one story is not real, that the problem is not real.”

It’s alarming to hear Plank not just excuse media failures, but to advocate for a media that reports on so-called trends based on suppositions and perception, not evidence-established facts.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/18/vox-writer-media-not-responsible-pushing-smolletts-hate-crime-hoax/,2019-02-18
15 Hate Crime Hoaxes That Might Make You Suspect There’s A Trend,"In season 4, episode 17 of the hit television show “Friends,” roommates Joey and Chandler discover that a glitch in their cable has resulted in free and continuous pornography. The plumber who happens to be in the apartment warns them never to turn it off or they might lose the free porn forever.

Chandler and Joey heed the warning, leaving it on constantly. They soon find their reality warped by over-exposure to the porn fantasy world.

“I was just at the bank, and there was a really hot teller. And she didn’t ask me to go back into the vault and do it,” Chandler exclaims.

“Same kind of thing happened to me,” Joey says, echoing Chandler’s shock. “A woman delivered my pizza and then just left after I gave her the money.” Chandler asks whether she wanted to come inside or see the bedroom. “No!” Joey says, in shock and outrage.

Then it dawns on both of them: they’ve been watching too much porn and it’s warped their view of reality. The episode brilliantly employs humor to warn of the dangers of excessively indulging in titillating fantasy.

Cut to 2019, and an era in which the American left daily imbibes a different kind of fantasy porn to titillate the insatiable thirst for outrage. Enter Jussie Smollett, an actor who knows his audience. He is not the first actor to turn to a type of porn to revive his career. So he scripts two characters to help him act out a scene of outrage porn for the liberal media in which he pretends to be victimized by two Donald Trump supporters.

The script checks all the right victim boxes for a good outrage fantasy. Watch this montage of outrage as the mainstream media hilariously buy into it. Over and over, they ironically ask, “Who could believe that something like this could happen in 2019?” Who could believe it? So addicted are they to the narcotic of outrage, that the mere fantasy of the attack is all they need to believe it true.

You might remember a few other hoaxes over recent years. Smollett’s hoax reminds one of the failing talk show host, Morton Downey Jr. In the late 1980s, he attempted to revive public attention by falsely claiming to have been attacked by neo-Nazis.

Maybe you remember the Duke University lacrosse team being falsely accused of attacking an African-American exotic dancer. Or, more recently, you might remember a gay man falsely accusing Whole Foods of decorating his cake with the slur, “fag.”

We should also remember a recent video of a child being separated from his mother at the border that turned out to be a hoax. The Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation battle likewise had its share of hoaxes.

Such hoaxes are becoming common, even epidemic. There are hundreds of them, and several worthy authors (here, here, here, and here, for example) have done yeomen’s work compiling these lists from which I now draw. Here is a small sample of confirmed hoaxes in just the last few years.

November 2016

A pro-gay Indiana church was vandalized with slurs, including one reading, “Heil Trump.” It was actually the church’s own organ player who did it as a hoax.

Firefighters battled arson at a church attended by African Americans. On the wall of the church, the presumed arsonist wrote, “Vote Trump,” in an apparent reference to the upcoming election. It was a sick hoax perpetrated by one of the parishioners.

In Lafayette, Kentucky, a woman falsely claimed to have had her hijab stolen by white men wearing Trump hats.

December 2016

A Plainview, New York man was charged with perpetrating another vandalism hoax in which he painted several swastikas around the campus of Nassau Community College.

A Muslim woman made up another hijab-stealing hate crime hoax, claiming three men screaming “Donald Trump” attacked her.

April 2017: An arson case in Charlotte, North Carolina first appeared to be a hate crime when the perpetrator left a note reading, “Our newly elected president Donald Trump is our nation builder for White America. You all know that, we want our country back on the right track. We need to get rid of Muslims, Indians and all immigrants.” It was a hoax.

May 2017: A racist note left on the windshield of an African-American St. Olaf student touched off campus-wide protests and got the college to cancel classes. It was a hoax perpetrated as “strategy to draw attention to concerns about the campus climate.”

November 2017: A Kansas man defaced his own car with racist slogans. Police soon concluded this to be another vandalism hoax.

December 2017: The U.S. Justice Department announced the conviction of Juan Thompson, a reporter for The Intercept, for making hoax bomb threats to Jewish community centers.

September 2018: A Long Island, New York woman falsely claimed to have been accosted by mysterious Trump supporters screaming “Trump 2016” and to have received a threatening note and gotten her tire slashed.

October 2018: Vandalism at a Brooklyn synagogue originally believed to the work of an anti-Semitic vandal turned out to be the work of a black man with career experience as an “anti-hate” worker for City Hall.

Outrage porn is not a victimless crime. Indeed, these hoaxes inspire very real violence as the mob feels compelled to take action against vilified Trump supporters. The hoaxes exacerbate tensions among Americans and sometimes destroy lives.

But they also sell newspapers and garner clicks. A new outrage story seems to appear before the last one can be debunked. So long as Americans uncritically consume outrage porn, our collective reality warps. Stoking the rising outrage of the mob may be good for business, but it’s dangerous for our country.

"No, Female ISIS Members Should Not Get Tickets Back To Civilization","Superficially, the father of the ISIS bride interviewed by the BBC might seem like any other father grieving for his daughter. In a typical softball BBC interview, breaking down in tears he said the British state should ensure that this woman safely comes back to British land.

Not only that, he said, the government shouldn’t prosecute or jail her, because she’s arguably a youthful teen who made a mistake, and everyone makes mistakes. The mask slipped momentarily when he was asked whether he ever took part in an Islamist demonstration against Americans and British. The answer is anybody’s guess.

Apparently, that might have pushed this girl to join the Islamic State, a murderous death cult raping, pillaging, and enslaving in a land that once stretched almost from Tehran to Tartous. This woman, who left her privileged London lifestyle with full knowledge of the people she was joining, in the age of internet and mass media where no stories of ISIS atrocities are censored, declared war on her own countrymen and is now sitting at a camp in the Middle East, demanding to come back. The word treason is thrown around a lot, but if there’s one example where it fits, it is declaring war against your own country.

This is by no means the only sympathetic portrayal of ISIS brides that has flooded Western media recently. These women left the West to marry and commit jihad, and not just in the United Kingdom (UK). CNN wrote a sympathetic portrayal of one British female ISIS supporter who is pregnant and wants to return to the country she spurned to give birth.

American ISIS bride who called for terror attacks at Memorial Day parades begs US to let her go back to Alabama https://t.co/4N0Bd3Ab8o — Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) February 18, 2019

A Canadian woman said she was clueless about the ISIS atrocities but has no regrets because, even though she wants to come home, she still believes in Sharia and wants it established. When asked about ISIS’s mass murder and enslavement of the Yazidis, she defiantly commented there might have been “a few” executions.

A German woman was featured in a Guardian tearjerker, saying she “just wants to go home.” Another British woman misses “fish and chips” and free health care, a German now has two children of her own and worries about an “uncertain future,” and a Moroccan married to a British/Australian jihadist “bonded over television shows.”

CNN’s Gayle Lemmon argued in a dewy essay about an American ISIS widow that the “West should not take it out on children.” To top it all up, there’s news about U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar urging more leniency for those who voluntarily joined ISIS, because America should be “more compassionate.”

If I were to channel my sincerest feelings about this recent bout of sympathy for ISIS brides, it wouldn’t be in the queen’s English, nor would it be deemed publishable.

I predicted this would happen. In an essay a couple of years back, I wrote that we should imagine a girl, disillusioned with her life, goes to join a death cult. She knows full well the utmost debauchery and deviancy that is a part of not just that group’s lifestyle but its entire ideology, and decides to join it nevertheless.

Over the course of the next four years, she and her fellow female devotees to the cause would marry leaders of the cause, immerse themselves in its ideology, and engage in acts of depravity themselves. Some of them turned their own friends and families in for noncompliance, some fed their prisoners to guard dogs, and the most brutal of them all made a lampshade with the skin of babies. When Irma Grese and Maria Mandl were hanged for their crimes as Nazi guards, they didn’t show much emotion. In fact, Jenny-Wanda Barkmann, the notorious officer of a prison camp, declared, ‘Life is full of pleasures, but pleasures are usually short.’

Nazi mass murderers like Irma Grese didn’t have sympathetic op-eds written about them in newspapers and websites. It would have been repulsive then, and even when the actors are changed, it remains repulsive now.

In his seminal work “The Open Society and Its Enemies,” Karl Popper once wrote that “unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance.” Put simply, in a society that treats unlimited tolerance as a virtue, provides no punitive deterrence, and only attempts rehabilitation, intolerant forces will take advantage of the situation, and erode the society from within.

There’s a section of liberals and libertarians to whom social cohesion and community mean nothing. Individualism is the be-all and end-all to them, and tolerance for crimes and rehabilitation is considered a prime virtue of their liberal society. A typical difficulty for this worldview are the Islamists and Marxists within any Western society. One cannot co-exist with a bunch of people whose ultimate aim is to destroy your existence.

According to conservative intelligence estimates, there are currently around 60,000 Islamists in Europe, almost three World War II-era army divisions. Add those currently in Australia, America, and Canada, and the number increases even more.

Every man with half a brain can understand that none of these people would exist without some tacit understanding with family and friends, a support network. Consider the radicalized parents of the pregnant ISIS bride who wants to now come back to the UK. It is highly unlikely that her family, friends, local community center, mosque, or Islamic charity were not aware of something brewing with her before she left, and now as she seeks to return. These are open secrets and taboos that people are too polite or afraid to talk about.

Adding white wine instead of red to a Coq-au-Vin is a mistake. Swiping left instead of right in a dating app is a mistake. Joining a mass-murdering religious cult enslaving, raping, and conquering infidel land to spread Sharia, with full knowledge, record, news, and online evidence and without any intoxication, coercion, duress, or insanity is anything but.

No civilized society and social contract can survive unless violent crimes are punished with extreme prejudice, and human rights are protected, which includes punishing violations of them. In just one single village, 7,000 Yazidi women were enslaved and raped, and their menfolk and children killed. Only their bones remain. Anyone voluntarily joining a group that committed such ultraviolence in the name of religion breaks her bonds with civilized society and humanity itself. They cannot just waltz back, nor should they be allowed to.

It is abhorrent for their fellow citizens, who are decent and contributing to society; it is unjust to the Syrians and Kurds and Yazidis, upon whom the darkest crimes of humanity were unleashed and who rightfully seek justice and retribution; it is treasonous to the land beneath their feet; and it denigrates the minorities who are law-abiding, hardworking, and have made the West their home. Not everyone deserves another chance. Nor should they get one, if one intends to see Western civilization preserved. ​

The Epidemic Of Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes In Brooklyn Is No Hoax,"As much of the country was transfixed by a hoaxed hate crime in Chicago over the past month, a very real wave of hate crimes in Brooklyn has been taking place. In New York City overall there have been 36 hate crimes against Jews so far this year, according to The New York Times, compared to only 21 last year. In the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn alone, ultra-orthodox Jews have been violently attacked at least 15 times since October of last year.

In most of these cases there is no apparent motive beyond anti-Semitism. No robbery occurs, and often the attackers — generally black men — and their victims are complete strangers. State and local government, as well as the New York City Police Department, have stepped up measures to protect the community, but the incidents have continued apace.

The spate of anti-Semitic attacks raises some significant questions. First and foremost, why is this happening and how can it be stopped? But also, why have the news media and the nation’s politicians been so quiet about an epidemic of hate crime in our country’s largest city? Why isn’t this a big story?

To get at an answer to the first question, we have to peer back through some troubling Brooklyn history. In 1991, the Crown Heights riots exploded in the Brooklyn neighborhood shared mainly by black and ultra-orthodox New Yorkers. Tensions between the two groups had existed for years. Then, a Jewish driver killed a black child. The crash was clearly shown to be an accident, not intentional or negligent, but deadly violence was the result nonetheless. In the years since, tensions have calmed, but never truly disappeared.

The roots of the disputes are murky. The ultra-orthodox are a strange set of neighbors in New York City. It is an insular community, in which a strict form of Jewish law, including dress codes and famously hats, is enforced. Anyone who attempts to leave the community, or live outside of its silo, is cut off from friends and family.

This is not the kind of attitude one typically looks for in neighbors. Its one thing for the Amish to promulgate this kind of lifestyle in rural Pennsylvania, but the ultra-orthodox are smack in the middle of the most populous borough of New York City. Existing in such an exclusive way in that environment is sure to cause tension, but just as surely is not grounds to be physically attacked.

For its part, the black community in New York City has struggled with accusations of anti-Semitism dating back at least to the riots. Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam has a foothold in the community, and with that comes some pretty awful messages about Jews. Even non-adherents to the Nation of Islam in the black community have a complicated relationship to Farrakhan and his message.

Recently Women’s March leader Tamika Mallory put this in some perspective when she refused to denounce Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, citing the good works he has done in black communities. To a lot of Jews, this is like saying you won’t denounce the Klan’s racism because they do a Christmas toy drive. Jewish organizations have attempted to do outreach into the black community, but frankly, the black community has its own work to do, especially in terms of condemning anti-Semites like Farrakhan.

The question of why this onslaught of anti Jewish violence is happening so quietly is not as important as stopping the violence, but it’s still important. Any fair-minded observer would agree that if 15 black people had been victims of racially motivated beatings in relatively white Bensonhurst since October, it would be a big national story. In fact, just one such alleged incident in Chicago got more coverage on its own than the attacks in Brooklyn have.

To some degree this is explained by the fact that the ultra-orthodox keep their own counsel, and do not engage in a lot of public relations outreach. But it’s more than that. It is very clear that news outlets are much more comfortable not only reporting, but also extrapolating on white violence against blacks than they are black violence against Jews.

Some of this reticence may be understandable. It can be reasonable for journalists to consider race in how they cover a story. Given the unfair stereotypes about black men regarding crime and violence, it makes sense to try to avoid feeding that stereotype. But the answer cannot simply be to bury the story because it is uncomfortable. Rather, the facts and context can be reported and explored in a nuanced manner that makes clear no broad generalizations about anyone are being asserted.

Likewise, politicians both locally and nationally need to speak up about this violence against Jews. In the wake of the alleged Smollett attacks, the tweets poured like wine from Democratic presidential candidates, yet none seem very interested in these repeated attacks on Jews in Brooklyn. That should change.

Shining a spotlight on white racists, such as the abhorrent participants in Charlottesville, is easy. It comports with a comfortable narrative about how vestiges of white supremacy still exist and must be confronted. Talking about black men committing violent hate crimes against Jews is far more complicated and difficult, yet it has to happen.

If these attacks continue, and the press continues to shield the city and country from it, people are going to die, just as they did in 1991. Now is the time when we need strong leadership from local officials and a news media willing to be upfront about what is going on. If that doesn’t happen, there is every reason to believe Brooklyn’s ultra-orthodox Jewish and black communities could be headed back into the bad old days.

5 Ways To Ask For A Raise Instead Of Faking A Hate Crime,"Unsatisfied with the pay associated with a life as a mid-level actor on a fledgling TV show, “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett knew it was time to ask for a raise. So he did what most people would do: he paid a couple of his buddies to pretend to assault him as an act of bigotry-fueled violence.

One can only assume that the staged attack was designed to make Jussie the poster child for horrific, racist, homophobic violence in a troubled world and he would become an enormous, bankable star as a result.

It didn’t quite work out that way. The pesky Chicago Police investigated the supposed assault instead of simply taking his word for it. Because Smollett and his friends appear to be the dumbest criminals of all time, they were found out nearly immediately (he paid his attackers with a personal check, for starters). Subsequently, Jussie did not receive that raise he so desperately wanted. In fact, he was dismissed from the final two episodes of “Empire.”

While he awaits trial for a Class 4 felony charge for filing a false police report, perhaps he could take this unemployed opportunity to think of better ways to procure a raise in the future. There are some bold, creative choices with a much stronger chance of working than faking a hate crime. So, for everyone thinking of asking for a raise and wondering what would be better than faking an assault, here are some thoughts.

1. Become an Indispensable Employee

Certainly, this is less exciting than hatching a plan to make you the most sympathetic face in America, but this old, boring method seems to work for some reason. Show up early, stay late, ask for extra tasks when yours are complete, and be a model employee for everyone else.

It involves actually working hard and possibly making personal sacrifices, so if that’s not for you, try some of these other ideas.

2. Bring Your Boss a Basket of Mini Muffins

Mini muffins are delicious, especially chocolate chip. No self-respecting employer would dare turn down a salary increase when faced with tiny, speckled pastries. If that “working hard” tactic doesn’t pan out, this one is nearly a sure thing.

3. Ask Your Parents to Tell Your Employer How Special You Are

No one has a better, more positive opinion of your unique qualities and potential than your own parents. They’re basically your built-in public relations team, and it’s high time to put them to use. When you’re ready to get that big raise, bring mom and dad in to meet the boss and make sure they get plenty of alone time to talk up just how incredible you are. Make sure mom preps her phone with plenty of pictures of you achieving things.

4. Repeatedly and Loudly Discuss How You Can’t Afford the Guacamole Upcharge

Sometimes the best way to get the point across about tight purse strings is to put it all out there. Times are tough for you, and it’s important for those writing your checks to know that you are making real, daily sacrifices that should not be taken lightly.

5. Hatch a Plan to Make Yourself Look Like a Hero

Perhaps, instead of planning to put a noose around your neck like Jussie apparently did, stage a daring cat rescue, or plant yourself in places where you might be seen as a person doing some good. Think volunteering or helping elderly people cross the street safely. While you’re “pretending” to do those good deeds, your boss might just hear about it. Also, some people might actually benefit from your fake help.

If you truly feel that the only way to get your employer’s attention and get that money you deserve is to concoct a hate crime against yourself, I have but one suggestion: Don’t write a check to your fake attackers. Pay cash.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/25/5-ways-ask-raise-instead-faking-hate-crime/,2019-02-25
"In A Truly Libertarian World, Robert Kraft Buying Sex Wouldn’t Be A Crime","Friday morning, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft found himself caught up in a prostitution sting spearheaded by Florida’s Jupiter Police Department.

The details are still unfolding as to whether this was a consensual arrangement between two adults, or something more insidious involving sex trafficking. If it was the latter, one must wonder whether Kraft knew what he was getting into. But if this was run-of-the-mill prostitution, and he wanted to enter into relations with another consenting adult, and she with him, that should be none of our business.

One of the pillars of libertarianism is self-ownership––the idea that we have full autonomy over what we do with our bodies. Some gray area exists that divides the ideology on abortion, but sex is pretty standard: we are free to have sex with who we want, provided they are consenting and of reasonable age, and it should be none of the government’s business. So why would sex become the government’s business when money becomes a factor?

One argument is that prostitution exploits women and elevates sex traffickers, so we ban it to turn people off to the idea of prostitution by threatening consequences, using the following script: The public thinks X is scary, authorities ban X, supply goes down as there’s no legal way to obtain X.

But what is the natural response when you take something away from someone? Demand for X goes up, X increases in value, a black market forms, cartels rise to power, organized crime grows, and the frequency of crime increases. Plus, it’s not like harsh police tactics don’t harm the people who consensually trade sex.

Prostitution, like marijuana, is not absolved from the laws of the market because of its implied immorality. Besides, the solutions touted by the state of Florida are wholly absurd and won’t change demand in the slightest. USA Today reports that:

A first offense carries a jail sentence of up to 60 days, and a second offense carries a sentence of up to one year. Under Florida statutes, Kraft would also be required to perform 100 hours of community service and ‘pay for and attend an educational program about the negative effects of prostitution and human trafficking, such as a sexual violence prevention education program, including such programs offered by faith-based providers, if such programs exist in the judicial circuit in which the offender is sentenced.’

But what person who consensually exchanges money for sex would legitimately have his mind changed by state-mandated, moralistic programs like these? Just because the state wants people to behave in a certain way doesn’t mean they will. Wouldn’t it make more sense to attempt to get this industry out of the dark?

All of this said, is sex trafficking the same as prostitution? Absolutely not. Sex trafficking deprives a victim of her autonomy and makes her a slave to her keeper. It is the antithesis of a voluntary contract, and sex traffickers should feel the full extent of the law over forcing their victims into compromising situations.

What this all boils down to is whether criminalizing those involved in prostitution is constitutional. I don’t believe it is, based on my ideological principles, even though it is something I do not morally agree with and would never participate in.

Whether or not Kraft was a willing participant in voluntary prostitution or a knowing party in a sex trafficking ring is still unclear, but what is clear is that what consenting adults do with their bodies should not only be none of our business, and stand apart from the cancerous organized crime that is sex trafficking.

How Forcing Cohen To Divulge Communications Damages Rule Of Law,"The New York Times promised that today Michael Cohen, the president’s former attorney, “will describe in what was called ‘granular detail’ the plan to pay Ms. Daniels, which he will say was initiated by Mr. Trump, the person familiar with the testimony plans said.”

This, the Times rapturously promised, would provide, “evidence of potential criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president.” As shown below, this cooked-up pretext to invade the president’s attorney-client privilege is a stain of shame on the rule of law and tramples on a 500-year-old rule that protects our common law tradition.

Let’s start at the beginning with a British judge serving under Queen Elizabeth, who wrote, “Thomas Hawtry, gentleman, was served with a subpoena to testify his knowledge touching the cause in variance; and made oath that he hath been, and yet is a solicitor in this suit, and hath received several fees of the defendant: which being informed to the Master of the Rolls, it is ordered that said Thomas Hawtry shall not be compelled to be deposed” (Berd v. Lovelace Anno 19 Eliz. 1576-77).

Cut to 2018 when the left sacrificed this sacred principle of Western civilization in the name of getting Trump. The New York Times titillated Trump-haters with the public airing of a recording of a discussion between Donald Trump and Cohen concerning the payment of two women who were essentially blackmailing then-candidate Trump. The FBI seized the recording during a raid of Cohen’s office. The New York Times did not say where it obtained the recording.

Subsequent to the release of the recording, the president chose not to assert attorney-client privilege. Those familiar with attorney-client confidentiality understand that the public release deprived him of any meaningful opportunity to make that choice. Nobody can un-hear the recordings.

It’s bad that an attorney maintained secret audio tapes of conversations with his client. Such information has a way of ending up in the wrong hands, and secretly making these tapes impairs the spirit of the attorney-client relationship. But it’s really bad that the American Civil Liberties Union posted an article cheerleading the raid. The government doesn’t need a cheerleader, and certainly not from the ACLU.

The ACLU’s legal director wrote, “While all the facts are not yet known publicly, all indications thus far are that the search was conducted pursuant to the rule of law, and with sign-offs from Trump appointees.” Yes, the ACLU has cautioned us against questioning the propriety of a raid on a private lawyer’s office because, it assumes, all the paperwork it has yet to see is in order.

He also wrote, “The attorney-client privilege has always included a ‘crime-fraud exception,’ which provides that if you are using the attorney-client relationship to perpetrate a crime, there is no privilege.” What crime? Cole doesn’t say. The ACLU lawyer said the breach of an attorney’s office was justified based upon the “crime-fraud exception” without knowing what crime was being investigated.

On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to two “violations” of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Specifically, the plea agreement cited the limit on individual contributions to any presidential candidate to $2,700 per election. In cooperation with “Corporation 1,” Cohen admitted to helping purchase two negative stories (the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal stories) about sex with Trump. According to the plea agreement, the purpose of the purchases was to keep the stories under wraps until after the election.

Cohen helped broker the purchase of the stories for $130,000 and $125,000 respectively, using personal funds for the $130,000 payment. After the election, Cohen sought reimbursement from Trump for at least one of these payments and an additional $50,000 “fee.”

In the first campaign finance-related count, he’s accused of exceeding the $2,700 limit. In the second campaign finance count, he admitted to “Causing an Unlawful Corporate Contribution,” by obtaining $25,000 of funding to purchase one of the stories from Corporation 1.

So Trump haters argue that attorney-client privilege doesn’t apply under the “Crime Fraud” exception because Trump authorized payments to Daniels to keep her quiet. Is that illegal? Well, they argue, he failed to properly disclose the payment to the Federal Elections Commission. Is Trump guilty of failing to disclose the payment to the FEC? No.

Trump disclosed the reimbursement to Cohen for the Daniels and/or McDougal payments in an FEC filing, writing, “In the interest of transparency, while not required to be disclosed as ‘reportable liabilities’ on Part 8, in 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump’s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017. The category of value would be $100,001-$250,000 and the interest rate would be zero.”

According to the FEC, the candidate should report the reimbursement of non-travel advances within 60 days. Cohen made the payments in October 2016, which would have fixed the deadline to report the payments after the 2016 election.

Is Trump guilty of violating a law by exceeding limits on campaign finance donations when he paid Daniels? Again, no. Political candidates are allowed to make unlimited expenditures on behalf of their own campaigns. Thus, if Trump paid Daniels with his own money (by reimbursing Cohen), it could not have violated any campaign limit. The plea agreement between Cohen and the government totally fails to address this exception in spite of acknowledging that Cohen was reimbursed by Trump.

Subsequent to Cohen’s plea of guilty and sentencing, the case should have been over. The New York Times then sought a copy of the search warrant used to justify searching Cohen’s office. This warrant is of critical public interest because we need to know whether a legitimate application of the “crime fraud” doctrine was indeed invoked.

An attorney’s office was raided and communication with his client was leaked. We need to be reassured that it was done pursuant to a legitimate application of the crime fraud exception. Otherwise, this precedent hangs like a sword of Damocles over all legitimate attorney-client communication between unpopular clients and their attorneys.

On October 25, 2018, the government opposed the New York Times’ request, claiming, “At present, disclosure of the Materials would jeopardize an ongoing law enforcement investigation in concrete ways. In addition, disclosure would infringe on the privacy interests of numerous third parties.”

Having an attorney publicly testify against his client is the sort of thing you might see in the Moscow trials under Joseph Stalin or Maoist China. It’s an extreme and public breach of the shared public interest in protecting attorney-client privilege. Shame on the left. Shame on the ACLU. And shame on the media for rejoicing on the destruction of yet another constitutional principle sacrificed on the altar of getting Trump.

7 Arguments For Legalizing Marijuana That No One Should Believe,"The move to legalize marijuana is gaining steam in the United States. Although we are still far from full legalization, public opinion has been shifting. An October 2018 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 62 percent of Americans support marijuana legalization.

In the midst of the rush to legalize, defenders of pot legalization have made a variety of arguments. These arguments are often taken for granted and repeated as if they described settled facts. As it turns out, many fall apart under close examination.

Whatever you think about marijuana legalization, it’s important to avoid making bad arguments. There may be good reasons to legalize marijuana. But if there are, the following arguments shouldn’t be considered to be among them.

1. ‘Marijuana Is Harmless’

This is perhaps the worst argument in favor of legalization. It is a well-established fact that marijuana use carries significant negative health effects, particularly to mental health. For instance, a 2017 review of research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that “there is substantial evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses, with the highest risk among the most frequent users.”

Along those lines, the authors of one study boldly concluded that “evidence from epidemiologic studies provides strong enough evidence to warrant a public health message that cannabis use can increase the risk of psychotic disorders.” Other studies have found a strong link between marijuana use and mood disorders and suicidal ideation, addiction, altered brain activity, decreased executive function, damage to the brain (particularly white matter), and negative effects on learning, memory, and attention, among other things. Need I say more?

The science is very clear: marijuana is not harmless. It is a performance-degrading drug that can significantly damage one’s mental health.

“But what about medical marijuana!?” Well, the term “medical marijuana” is misleading because it is not actually the marijuana plant that has medicinal properties, but cannabinoids (namely CBD and THC) found within the plant. Some research shows these cannabinoids can help with pain management, nausea and vomiting, and multiple sclerosis spasticity.

We shouldn’t oppose research and development of cannabinoid-based prescription medicines, provided they go through the same rigorous regulatory process by which other medicines are approved. Indeed, several already exist: dronabinol, nabilone, and epidiolex are all cannabinoid medicines at various stages of FDA approval. While medical marijuana of this kind is unobjectionable and ought to be supported, the raw marijuana plant is not medicine.

We also need to weigh the alleged benefits of marijuana against its negative health effects. Given the strong scientific consensus in favor of adverse health effects, is it really all worth it? And should we really start legalizing marijuana before these effects are known in detail and among the broader public?

2. ‘Marijuana Legalization Is Pro-Liberty’

Many libertarians and a growing number of conservatives argue that legalization is the “pro-freedom” position. Actually, the exact opposite is true. Marijuana use attacks, degrades, and impairs the very thing that allows us to act freely: our brains.

We can’t make free choices if we aren’t in control of ourselves. Someone who is under the influence of an intoxicating drug such as marijuana is subject to coercive forces that interfere with his decision-making. And let’s not forget the long-term effects of marijuana, which permanently inhibits the ability of the brain to properly function.

Human freedom is the product of order, both in ourselves and in society in general. This realization gave rise to the system of ordered liberty and natural law upon which our government is based.

This order is reflected in the human ability to make rational decisions. Choices that are not under the control of reason are not free, but random and chaotic. Since intoxicating drugs interfere with our ability to reason properly, they are the very antithesis of liberty.

The idea that marijuana can be justified by an appeal to freedom or liberty is self-defeating in the same way that drinking seawater to remedy thirst is counterproductive. It is a perversion of liberty that turns liberty against itself. So if you consider yourself a champion of freedom and liberty, then you should oppose marijuana legalization.

3. ‘Marijuana Legalization Will Increase Tax Revenue’

Any tax revenue generated by legalization will be outweighed by its social costs, which are several times greater than its alleged benefits. A recent study conducted by the Centennial Institute looked at Colorado’s legalization regime and found that for every $1 of tax revenue generated by marijuana taxes, Coloradans paid $4.50 to mitigate marijuana-related social costs stemming from the health-care and education systems, accidental poisonings, impaired driving, and increased court costs, among other things.

Along similar lines, a study looking at the projected costs of legalization in Rhode Island found that even by conservative estimates, legalization would incur costs that are at least 25 percent greater than expected revenue. If making money is the goal, then legalization is self-defeating because it will cost more tax dollars than it generates. So if you consider yourself to be a fiscal conservative, then perhaps you should actually be against legalization.

Don’t believe me? Just look at alcohol. Its annual social costs are estimated to be around $250 billion, which is 15 times greater than the amount collected through local, state, and federal taxes. Not exactly a moneymaker, now is it?

Alcohol also causes more crime than all other drugs combined, due largely to its legality and widespread availability. The reason isn’t exactly rocket science: if you make something legal, then you remove barriers to procuring it, which allows more people to obtain it. And the more people who obtain it, the bigger the breeding ground for its negative effects.

So why on earth would marijuana be any different? As a legal drug, alcohol already does enough damage to society. Why we would want to make the problem worse and legalize another intoxicating, mind-altering substance?

4. ‘Alcohol Prohibition Failed, and So Is Weed Prohibition’

The idea that alcohol prohibition was an abysmal failure is a historical myth that never seems to die. Prohibition actually reduced per capita alcohol consumption by around 30–50 percent. Cirrhosis death rates (a good measure of heavy drinking), admissions to state mental hospitals for alcohol psychosis, and arrests for drunk and disorderly conduct also declined dramatically.

As Duke University economist Philip Cook explains: “the Prohibition period was associated with a substantial reduction in per capita alcohol consumption… Mortality rates from alcohol-related diseases were also lower, indicating that the prevalence of chronic heavy drinking was way down during the 1920s.”

Ah, but Prohibition significantly increased crime, right? Wrong. Violent crime remained largely constant during Prohibition. The homicide rate experienced larger increases during the pre-Prohibition period between 1900 and 1910 than during all of Prohibition. Societal and demographic changes occasioned by World War I and increased urbanization during the Roaring Twenties largely accounted for slowly rising crime rates.

What’s more, the number of jurisdictions whose crime rates were being counted also grew during this time, which generated the appearance of rising crime rates. Thus, as sociologist Douglas Eckberg points out, “apparent increases in rates of homicide in the United States between 1900 and 1933 may be illusory.” In fact, there is evidence that Prohibition had a net negative effect on the homicide rate, owing largely to decreased alcohol consumption.

So why did Prohibition end up failing? Historians generally agree that lack of attention to enforcement—and not its impracticality—constituted its downfall.

5. ‘Legalization Will Help Solve Mass Incarceration’

The war on drugs is often blamed for the explosion in prison populations within the past few decades. But this is not supported by the data. As Fordham law professor John Pfaff points out, “a majority of prison growth has come from locking up violent offenders, and a large majority of those admitted to prison never serve time for a drug charge, at least not as their ‘primary’ charge.”

With respect to marijuana in particular, incarceration for mere possession alone is exceedingly rare. Most inmates who are incarcerated for marijuana-related offenses find themselves there because of higher-level offenses, such as trafficking.

According to a comprehensive survey of state and federal inmates, only 3.6 percent of the nationwide prison population were incarcerated for simple drug possession. Out of those 3.6 percent, half had committed a non-drug crime (e.g., burglary or assault) along with possession. Once those are excluded, the number of inmates incarcerated for simple drug possession drops to 1.8 percent of all inmates.

Then out of those 1.8 percent, half had plea-bargained down from more serious crimes. Once further adjustments are made for the type of drug, the researchers found that, at any time in the United States, only 800-2,300 inmates were incarcerated for marijuana possession alone. That makes up a grand total of 0.1-0.2 percent of the entire prison population.

So even if we released every single low-level marijuana offender from prison, it would hardly change the total prison population.

6. ‘Legalization Is Necessary to Stop Police Overreach’

Stories of police departments needlessly confiscating property and SWAT officers conducting no-knock raids over small amounts of weed are often invoked as reasons to legalize. But the connection here is at best tenuous. The alleged problems with police militarization and civil asset forfeiture are not unique to drug enforcement alone. These much broader issues can be addressed without having to legalize marijuana. Criminal justice reform and public health should go hand-in-hand. There’s no reason to sacrifice one for the other.

The silliness of this pro-legalization argument can easily be seen if we apply it to other areas. Have a problem with officers using excessive force during arrests? Solution: stop arresting people! Police surveillance a bit too intrusive? Solution: stop all monitoring! Clearly, the solution to bad enforcement isn’t no enforcement. We should be mindful of the price we would pay in social costs if it weren’t for drug enforcement.

Prohibition comes in various shapes and sizes. During national alcohol prohibition, individuals were allowed to keep small amounts of alcohol in their own homes for personal consumption. It was the sale and distribution that was illegal. So defending prohibition does not mean that you must automatically defend a specific regime of enforcement.

It’s worth mentioning that for the most part, police departments do not zealously search out drug users to bust. Rather, they tend to stumble upon them unintentionally. Most drug arrests happen when an individual is stopped and searched for other crimes. The image of SWAT officers barging into a home for a small baggie of weed is not representative of how the vast majority of police departments approach drug enforcement.

7. ‘Marijuana Legalization Will Solve the Opioid Crisis’

If anything, legalizing marijuana may make the opioid crisis even worse. As it turns out, marijuana use increases the risk of other substance use disorders. Rather than serving as a substitute for opioids, research suggests that marijuana functions as a companion drug that people take alongside others.

A 2018 study in the American Journal of Psychiatry comprising more than 33,000 people found that “cannabis use appears to increase rather than decrease the risk of developing nonmedical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder.” A 2018 study in Pain Medicine found that “concurrent use of cannabis and opioids by patients with chronic pain appears to indicate higher risk for opioid misuse.” A 2017 study of patients who used marijuana for lower-back pain found that “patients using cannabis for pain relief are more likely to meet criteria for substance abuse disorders and to be nonadherent with their prescribed opioids.”

Marijuana interferes with pain management, such that those who use marijuana for pain develop higher tolerances and thresholds. It is not surprising, then, that many turn to other substances. A 2018 study published in Patient Safety in Surgery found that “marijuana use, especially chronic use, may affect pain response to injury by requiring greater use of opioid analgesia.” Another study, published in The Lancet, found that “people who used cannabis had greater pain and lower self-efficacy in managing pain, and there was no evidence that cannabis use reduced pain severity or interference or exerted an opioid-sparing effect.”

Legalization advocates sometimes cite correlational data indicating that opioid deaths have decreased in states with medical marijuana programs. However, as the editors of the journal Addiction point out, this is like reasoning that because ice cream sales are positively correlated with the number of drownings, that higher ice cream sales cause more drownings. They note that “better‐controlled studies have shown that the relationship between medical cannabis laws and opioid overdose deaths persists when controlling, as best they can using state‐level data, for differences between states that do and do not have medical cannabis laws.”

There you have it: seven bad arguments for marijuana legalization. Let’s have this debate on more accurate terms, shall we?

The Democratic Party Has Normalized Anti-Semitism,"This week, the Democratic Party was unable to pass a watered-down, platitudinous resolution condemning anti-Semitism, due to “fierce backlash” from presidential candidates, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), and the now-powerful progressive base. Rather than censuring Rep. Ilhan Omar, the intellectually frivolous, Hamas-supporting freshman representative from Minnesota, she was rewarded and inoculated from party criticism.

More consequently, the Democrats deemed Protocols of Zion-style attacks a legitimate form of debate. That’s because Omar, despite what you hear, has repeatedly attacked Jews, not only Israel supporters, and certainly not only specific Israeli policies.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who would finally bring an “All Lives Matter” resolution to the floor, told reporters she didn’t believe the congresswoman’s comments were “intentionally anti-Semitic.” No educated human believes Omar inadvertently accused “Benjamin”-grubbing Rootless Cosmopolitans of hypnotizing the world for their evil. These are long-standing, conspiratorial attacks on the Jewish people, used by anti-Semites on right and left, and popular throughout the Islamic world.

Even the Democratic Party activist groups that typically cover for the Israel-haters, like the Anti- Defamation League, have condemned Omar. Yet it was the lie that coursed through the Democratic Party’s defense of Omar.

Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren claimed that “branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has had a chilling effect on our public discourse and makes it harder to achieve a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians.” Either Warren believes that accusing Jews and their supporters of dual loyalty and sedition is a legitimate criticism of Israel, or she is deliberately mischaracterizing Omar’s comments to gain favor with the growing faction of anti-Semites in her party.

“We must not,” the socialist Bernie Sanders argued, “equate anti-Semitism and legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel” because such a thing would be “stifling” debate. Does anyone believe that if left-of-center Kahol Lavan were running Israel, Omar would be less inclined to smear the bipartisan squishes at AIPAC?

Omar has mentioned Benjamin Netanyahu (who, incidentally, is in every way more of a genuine liberal than either Sanders or Omar) once in her Twitter feed, and then only to use this very talking point to defend her comments. As a political matter, no major party in Israel is going allow an independent Palestinian state run by theocrats and terrorists to exist, so Omar and her allies will never be appeased.

Of course, no one argues that Omar’s speech should be curtailed or stifled. The same can’t be said of her defenders, however, who not only falsely claim criticism of her tropes is “chilling speech,” but also decided to transform this 38-year-old firebrand into a helpless, childlike victim.

“We all have a responsibility to speak out against anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, and all forms of hatred and bigotry, especially as we see a spike in hate crimes in America,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, who, like many Democrats, tried to dilute criticism of anti-Semitism in a torrent of phobias. “But like some of my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, I am concerned that the spotlight being put on Congresswoman Omar may put her at risk.”

We shouldn’t exaggerate the prevalence of hate crimes in America, which is low, but it’s certainly worth pointing out that Jews are the target of 60 percent of those crimes—a far larger percentage than anyone else. In New York City, there have been at least 36 hate crimes against Jews so far this year so far. Shouldn’t Harris be more concerned about Omar’s rhetoric?

As Gad Saad noted yesterday, Omar’s brand of Israel criticism “is almost ALWAYS a cover of existential and definitional Jew-hatred.” This anti-Israel sentiment—opposition to the idea of a national Jewish state—is the most consequential form of anti-Semitism that exists in the world today. It has done more to undermine Jewish safety than all the dog whistles and white nationalist marches combined. Yet, many Democrats have now seemingly joined Corbynites and leftists around the world perpetuating this radicalism.

The normalization of Omarism is a long time coming. Omar’s defenders have been praising and participating in the Women’s March, led by Louis Farrakhan acolytes who believe Jewish people bear a special collective responsibility “as exploiters of black and brown people,” since Trump was elected. But it goes even further back.

When leaving the CBC meeting, “members formed a circle around Omar and Marcia Fudge literally stuck her arm out to prevent reporters from asking her questions. Then a few members hugged Omar, including Al Lawson.” It is unsurprising that Omar, who has great trouble answering simple questions, has the CBC running interference for her hatred. At least seven members of the CBC—a group seemingly immune from criticism—have coordinated and worked with Farrakhan, the anti-Semite preacher who believes “satanic” Jews are “termites” who “deserve to die.” Liberals keep telling me Farrakhan is just a conservative boogeyman, and yet his contingent is growing as Omar and allies like Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez join the ranks.

Democrats’ allies in media quickly came to Omar’s rescue, as well. The Washington Post ran three articles after Omar’s initial comments this week. All three defended her. “Want to combat hate? Stop the hazing of Ilhan Omar and start listening” wrote Wajahat Ali and Rabia Chaudry. Not only shouldn’t Jews censure Omar, the authors argued, they should shut up and listen to her wisdom. In the progressive worldview, Jews, who are successful and predominately white, should put up with a little bigotry for the common good.

As Rep James Clyburn (D-SC), who once also shared a stage with Farrakhan, noted, Omar should be given a free pass because she fled Somalia. “There are people who tell me, ‘Well, my parents are Holocaust survivors.’ ‘My parents did this.’ It’s more personal with her,” he explained. It’s personal to hate Jews when you fled Somalia? The number of people defending Omar on the risible grounds that Muslims should be immune from criticism isn’t surprising when you realize that identity politics demands strict adherence to the hierarchy of victimhood.

When New York Times reporters Sheryl Gay Stolberg (whose article in the aftermath of Omar’s dual loyalty remarks asked if Jewish people had too much power in Washington) and Glenn Thrush (who may or may not be taking diction from the Democratic National Committee) authored a piece about the resolution fight, they spent a large chunk of their space letting everyone know that President Donald Trump—whose daughter converted to Judaism and who moved the American embassy to Jerusalem and who stopped coddling the world’s most dangerous anti-Jewish terror-state—had also used anti-Semitic tropes.

While it’s not worth again debunking the fact that Trump never said neo-Nazis were “very fine people” or pointing out that most of the Jews at the Republican Jewish Coalition laughed at his jokes, it is worth mentioning that Democrats have embraced the worst kind of “whataboutism.”

NBC’s News’ Chuck Todd, in his “I’m obsessed with” segment, offered a jaw-droppingly misleading lecture accusing both parties of having an anti-Semitism problem by comparing elected officials like Omar and Tlaib — who have been embraced by their party, take part in policy making, and now widely defended on the mainstream left — to a fringe Nazi murderer who shot up a Pittsburgh synagogue, whom not a single Republican supports and has nothing to do with the GOP. The very fact that Todd was forced to shoehorn these comparisons is revealing.

In truth, Pelosi’s first watered-down resolution would have passed with most Republicans voting for it, and a number of Democrats defecting. This would have been embarrassing. So she promised to dilute it, and even that wasn’t enough for Democrats. Now, leadership is poised to pass some pointless resolution condemning all hatred.

Omar, an intellectual lightweight, is certainly a problem for America. But the fact that Democrats apparently believe what she says is fine is an absolute disaster.

"The Last Godfather Is Dead, And So Is The Myth And Magic Of The Mafia","“Michael Corleone says hello.” That line from an iconic scene in “The Godfather 2” is uttered just before an attempted hit on the character Frank Pantageli. The garroting in a bar is broken up by a beat cop who just happens to walk in.

The incident is not entirely fiction. In August 1961, Carmine “the Snake” Persico tried to take out Larry Gallo in a very similar incident the scene was based upon. Ten years later, Persico became the boss of the Colombo crime family, and he stayed the boss until last week, when he died in federal prison.

With Persico’s passing, the last major “godfather” of one of New York’s five mafia families to serve during La Cosa Nostra’s heyday is gone. Although he spent the majority of his leadership in prison, from the early 1970s to the late 1980s the Snake controlled a criminal empire unfathomable in today’s New York City or America. A

long with the Bannano, Genovese, Luchesse, and Gambino families, the Colombo “borgata” in the late 20th century ran crime operations that rivaled corporations like General Motors in profit. Outside of New York, they controlled mafia families throughout the country. In the United States, there has never been a criminal enterprise quite like the Italian Mafia.

In 1986 a U.S. attorney general for the Southern District of New York named Rudolph Giuliani decimated mafia power in the Commission Case. Three heads of families were taken down, Persico among them. But like any wild animal, the mob had some death throes.

In 1991, Vitterio “Little Vic” Orena allegedly tried to snatch power from Persico. (Some mob experts believe Orena was actually loyal to Persico but was framed by another Colombo Capo named Greg “The Grim Reaper” Scarpa.) The second Colombo war, a major mob war in New York, was incited, and 12 mobsters and an innocent civilian died. It is the last time that a New York mafia family would “go to the mattresses.”

Today, it is difficult to fathom just how powerful economically, politically, and culturally the Italian Mafia was for much of the 20th century in the United States. It controlled vast industries in New York, like concrete and trucking. It had elected officials in its pocket, and it peopled some of America’s most popular movies and books. With the possible exception of pizza and pasta, it is the most iconic element of the Italian experience in America.

By the time Charles “Lucky” Luciano and Salvatore “Little Caesar” Maranzano created the five families commission in New York, mobsters were already becoming a staple of American culture and entertainment. Prohibition had given mafia leaders like Al Capone a ticket to vast riches, but unlike Jewish and Irish mobs, the commission, with its strict rules, created an infrastructure that allowed Italians to dominate organized crime by midcentury.

The Golden Age of the mob, indelibly memorialized by Mario Puzo in “The Godfather” and the films that followed, was a period of astounding growth, aided by the creation of Las Vegas as a gambling mecca and a growing control over almost every aspect of economic life in New York City. Mafia leaders were celebrities often unmolested by local law enforcement or an FBI that barely even admitted it existed. “This thing of ours,” as mafia members called it, was generally only bothered by occasional wars between the families. Those wars were further fodder for journalists and novelists to create its legend.

After the Godfather movies came out in the early 1970s, some of its biggest fans were actual mobsters. They reveled in the classy and honorable depiction of their lifestyles. But in reality, the mafia was always a disgraceful organization, bilking billions from the United States and most often extorting their fellow Italian Americans. It was a charade the mafia itself tried to encourage.

In 1971, Joseph “Joe” Colombo (worst mafia nickname ever) was murdered in broad daylight at Columbus Circle during an Italian American pride rally he organized. It was his death that led to Persico becoming boss. Colombo understood public relations. While running a nefarious crime outfit he pretended to be an oppressed and honest Italian American businessman unfairly targeted because of racism. It was an utter joke, but one that some Italian Americans and members of the media bought.

By the 1980s, mafia power in America was already starting to unravel. Successful law enforcement efforts such as Joe Pistone’s “Donnie Brasco” operation in the Luchesse family were successfully nabbing mobsters and in some cases turning them into witnesses, in defiance of their sworn “omerta,” or silence. This culminated in the Commission Case of 1986, in which Giuliani employed the relatively new and untested Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). RICO finally allowed prosecution of mob bosses who could not be physically attached to crimes.

But it wasn’t just the mafia that was changing. Italian American neighborhoods, the natural habitat of La Cosa Nostra, were slowly dissipating as well. Today, as a result of urban flight and intermarriage with non-Italians, there are essentially no Italian American neighborhoods in New York City. Manhattan’s Little Italy (where Larry Gallo’s brother Joey was gunned down in 1972) is a block or so of mediocre and hokey Italian restaurants. Brooklyn’s Bensonhurst, once of the hub of the mob, still has a few traditional Italian delis, bakeries, and ravioli shops, but is slowly being overtaken by Chinese and other immigrants.

Persico’s death punctuates with a bold period not just the 20th century phenomenon of the Italian Mafia, but in some ways the phenomenon of the vibrant Italian American communities of the last century. Today people in their early 40s are the last ones who can really remember visiting their Nonnas in “the old neighborhood.”

The five families still exist, and we still know who their bosses are, but they learned the lesson of camera-hungry godfathers like John “the Dapper Don” Gotti and Nicademo “Little Nicky” Scarfo. They stay off TV and try to keep a low profile. Notwithstanding, that, or the broader desire for the mob to lay low, killings still happen. Just yesterday, reputed Gambino boss Frank Cali was murdered outside his Staten Island home.

It is difficult to know what the lasting legacy of the mafia will be in American culture. TV shows like “The Sopranos “and, later, “Boardwalk Empire” are receding into the past. The number of mafia movies also seems to be shrinking, notwithstanding Martin Scorsese’s upcoming film, “The Irishman.”

Books and TV documentaries on the mob still draw audiences, but also seem to be abating. Put simply, the mafia seems to be losing its magic. This may well be for the best. Like Western criminal gunslingers along the lines of Jesse James before it, the mob doesn’t really deserve a rich legacy. It was, after all, a terrible and criminal institution that caused enormous pain and suffering in our nation.

For Italian Americans, and really any Americans in major northeast cities, the mafia is complicated. Its faults were (and to some extent still are) grievous, but it was also an avenue for Italian American culture more broadly to be introduced to America. It is a part of our history, a bloody and shameful one in many ways, but also one that casts a long shadow over the 20th century.

The Snake is dead, and so is the vast power of the Italian Mafia. No history of the United States is complete without it, but its declining influence over New York City and America can only be considered a blessing.

‘Golden State’ Depicts A World When Telling The Truth Becomes A Crime,"Facts: The novel Golden State was published in January 2019 by Mulholland Books. It is 336 pages in length. Its dimensions are 6.5 x 1.2 x 9.6 inches. Speculations: After reading Golden State, Ben H. Winters’ provocative dystopian police procedural set in a world where lying is a criminal offense, one might become wary of departing from established, verifiable truths or fear making exaggerated assertions.

Golden State goes off-kilter right from the opening sentence: “This is a novel. All of the words in it are true.” Instantly we know that the clocks are striking 13 and that we’re in an Orwellian-adjacent world in a sunny, California-type setting.

Golden State unfolds as a kind of 1984/Fahrenheit 451 mashup, set in the eponymously named place, a just-the-facts, double-stamped, triple-checked world where every meeting and conversation is recorded and stored—the duty of every citizen starting at age 17. Telling a lie is a serious offense punished with prison time (or worse, exile) as a high crime against the “Objectively So.”

Intent is taken into account. Joking hyperbole and white lies are shrugged off, exaggerated advertising claims relegated to the “court of small infelicities,” while outright bald-faced lies are punished forcefully. Dishonesty is not so much a moral sin as a crime against reality, a treason of sorts.

A Dangerous State of Mind

The first scene unfolds with feverish dream logic. Laszlo Ratesic’s breakfast of “chicken and waffles” (an enduring feature of all versions of Los Angeles) is interrupted by an overwhelming sense of “dishonesty in the atmosphere.”

Like the good Speculator Service cop he is, Laszlo puts down his fork and sniffs out the lie among the other patrons, mentally inspecting even the waitress’s words to make sure she is truly enthusiastic about the three-egg omelet with jalapeno, before honing in on a conversation about the illicit use of drugs. But Laszlo is more concerned with the “forceful and purposeful distortion of the truth” committed by a teenager lying to shield his brother.

Laszlo is a 19-year veteran of the Speculative Service, blessed with an innate sensory gift that allows him to sniff out dishonesty, “solely empowered, and uniquely qualified, to detect and destroy the stuff of lies.” To risk a forbidden metaphor, he lives in the shadow of his late brother, Charlie, who was even more talented. Laszlo fears he can’t live up to Charlie’s memory—or what Laszlo thinks it is.

Returning to the station, Laszlo is abruptly paired with an eager young partner, Aysa Paige, and the new team is summoned to a seemingly humdrum case of a construction worker accidentally falling off a roof. Or was it an accident?

Getting deeper into the death investigation, the team digs up disturbing anomalies, to the point they must “speculate,” or go beyond known reality, a dangerous state of mind reserved only for Speculators.

For in the timeless, time-stamped world of Golden State, people don’t imagine. There are no novels, no Netflix, no poetry. Dreams are suppressed with drugs. People get home from work and kick back with selected clips from the ubiquitous real-life video streams, like “Old Men Walking Dogs.” Imagination—a kind of lie—doesn’t even have to be officially outlawed when such fancies are never given root.

Old churches still stand, or rather, buildings of “heavy gray stone with elaborate stained-glass windows.” People greet each other by exchanging nuggets of truth, including the “truth” that neatly sums up the story’s dark underside: “The past is a dangerous country.” There’s a sense that things are going well, and will continue to, so long as the motivated citizenry keep strengthening their shared and confirmed reality, day after day, laying down truth upon truth, fact upon fact.

But things start to unravel when Laszlo finds an actual fictional novel in the dead man’s possession, a forbidden relic from that blacked-out past. He begins to ponder if a world with only one kind of truth in it is the biggest lie of all.

Laszlo’s Subversive World-Building

Winters packs in detective-story tropes (doughnut-loving cops, slow-walking police bureaucracy, the semi-retired old-timer with secret knowledge) only to subvert them. The character of Laszlo, a sour soul redeemed by self-effacement, is particularly well-rounded. His eager young partner Aysa is less successfully drawn.

Winters has a knack for world-building, subliminally conjuring up an alternative Los Angeles from Laszlo’s chicken-and-waffles breakfast. An old sign on a high hill spells out, in nine huge letters, a word utterly unfamiliar to the populace; junk-food fan Laszlo eternally fails to catch a hot dog truck. One of those details is background color, the other a plot point, and both help ground his Golden State into a simulacrum of reality.

Much as I admired Golden State, I cannot tell a lie: it has some problems. The plot gets shaky around the three-quarter mark. The central mystery is disappointingly fuzzy. Some developments may not bear close scrutiny, and the evildoing is kept too far in the background, the machinations indistinct. Perhaps the less one reads about the origins of the novel, the better (hint: It involves Donald Trump).

But unlike some recent speculative fiction with a message, the characters aren’t stand-ins for real-life conservative villains. Any ideological lecture contained within sailed blessedly over this reader’s head. It also wraps up nicely, opening at the end into another dimension, of sorts.

Still, many avenues of the Golden State are left unexplored. At the risk of speculation, the book could mark the launch of another enthralling series, like one of Winters’ other genre combos, his award-winning trilogy The Last Policeman. As it is, Golden State succeeds as a police procedural, a conspiracy thriller, and a philosophical statement on the attainability of absolute truth.

And that’s no lie.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/15/when-telling-the-truth-becomes-a-crime/,2019-03-15
Prosecutors Drop Charges Against Jussie Smollett,"Chicago prosecutors dropped all charges against disgraced actor Jussie Smollett on Tuesday, simultaneously insisting the move did not “exonerate him” and came as part of an agreement he would complete community service.

After Smollett claimed to be the victim of a hate crime in January, evidence steadily emerged to demonstrate the alleged attack had been staged by the “Empire” star. Smollett was charged in February with 16 counts of disorderly conduct related to filing a false report, all of which were dropped by Cook County prosecutors on Tuesday.

“We stand behind the investigation, we stand behind the decision to charge him and we stand behind the charges in the case. The mere fact that it was disposed of in an alternative manner does not mean that there were any problems or infirmities in the case or the evidence,” Joe Magats, the first assistant state’s attorney, told Julie Bosman of the New York Times, further claiming, “We didn’t exonerate him.”

“The charges against Smollett were dropped in return for his agreement to do community service, [Magats] said, and for forfeiting his bond to the city of Chicago,” Bosman reported. For her part, Smollett’s attorney Elizabeth Brown Holmes insisted no deal had been struck with prosecutors.

Magats said the charges were dropped in part because Smollett is not thought to be a threat to public safety, not because there were problems with the evidence. “Here’s the thing—we work to prioritize violent crime and the drivers of violent crime. Public safety is our number one priority. I don’t see Jussie Smollett as a threat to public safety,” he reportedly explained.

Smollett immediately took a victory lap. A spokeswoman for his lawyers referred to the actor as “a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgment.” (Of course, the actual rush to judgement was actually in the opposite direction.) In a press conference at the Chicago courthouse, Smollett himself claimed he had been “truthful and consistent on every level from day one.”

Even in dismissing the charges, prosectors clearly did not agree, as evidenced by Magats’s defense of the evidence. One detective who worked on the case called the turn of events a “punch in the gut.”

“Central Detective Cmdr. Edward Wodnicki, whose detectives led the investigation into Smollett, said prosecutors gave no heads up to police that the charges would be dropped. He also expressed concern that it left it looking as if police mishandled the investigation,” the Chicago Tribune reported. According to Wodnicki, detectives found “overwhelming” evidence against Smollett.

“It’s absolutely a punch in the gut,” he told the Tribune. “We worked very, very closely throughout our three-week investigation to get to the point where we arrested the offender. So for the state’s attorney’s office at this point to dismiss the charges … without discussing this with us at all is just shocking.” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the dropped charges constituted a “whitewash of justice.”

While Smollett maintains his innocence, Nigerian brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo have already admitted they accepted payment to help stage the attack.

Just last week, the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police requested the Justice Department probe whether “County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx asked Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to let the FBI investigate Smollett’s allegations. … after the former chief of staff to former first lady Michelle Obama informed Foxx that Smollett’s family had concerns about the probe.” Foxx ultimately recused herself from the case, and Magats took over.

Cory Booker Peddles False Gun Law ‘Loopholes’ During CNN Town Hall,"During Wednesday night’s CNN town hall event, 2020 presidential hopeful Cory Booker indulged in a favorite pastime of Democratic politicians: spewing false and inaccurate information on gun laws.

When answering an audience member’s question on his plan to address gun misuse, Booker immediately turned to attacking the National Rifle Association and laws that are not actually found anywhere in federal law. Let’s look at the each of the gun “loopholes” Booker is so passionate about abolishing.

https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/1111098164529037313

“[The NRA] is defending loopholes, like that loophole if a man is convicted of beating his wife, he can find a loophole to go out and buy a gun and murder her,” Booker said. “They are defending, not their membership, but the loopholes, like the loophole that says someone on the terrorist no-fly list in our country can still go to a gun show and buy weapons. That somebody that’s convicted of a violent crime can still find a loophole to buy a violent weapon.”

The claim that a wife-beater or someone convicted of a violent crime can purchase or possess a firearm is categorically false. The 1968 Gun Control Act prohibits anyone convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing a firearm.

Every dealer with a Federal Firearms License must perform background checks through the FBI’s National Instant Background Check System (NICS) every time they sell a firearm to a consumer. It doesn’t matter if this sale takes place online, at a gun show, or in a parking lot. So anyone with a domestic violence conviction on his or her record should be prevented from buying a gun.

Where the system often fails is not in the lack of background checks, but in a bureaucratic failure to enforce the existing background check. States sometimes fail to submit or update their records with NICS, allowing for lapses in the background check system.

For private sales within the same state, including a gift, trade, loan, or reselling an old gun, the seller does not have to perform a background check. Some states with universal background check systems do require background checks on private sales.

To accurately address the second “loophole” Booker mentioned, it’s best to evaluate the “terrorist no-fly list” and the “gun show” loophole individually. First, there is no such thing as a “gun show loophole.” See above about FFL dealers, who even at gun shows must run background checks with the NICS.

Secondly, while it is true that inclusion on the FBI’s terrorist watch list would not prevent an individual from purchasing a gun, it doesn’t mean we are letting terrorists buy weapons, like Booker is implying.

First of all, there is no such thing as the “terrorist no-fly list” that Booker describes. What we do have is the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, which manages multiple watch lists, and does so in mostly secrecy. The largest one, Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, reportedly adds 20,000 people to its list every year, and totals are now suspected to be higher than 1.5 million people. Also, inclusion in that database does not mean an individual cannot fly. If being one of the million names on TIDE makes you a terrorist, then that’s a lot of known terrorists freely walking around.

We also know the FBI maintains a “No Fly List” and a “Selectee List,” but there is not much public information on how one gets placed on them, or how he or she can get removed. This is partially what makes them unconstitutional. The supposed standard for getting put on a list is “reasonable suspicion,” which could pretty much mean anything, from having facial hair to the color of your skin. And when an American is placed on one of these arbitrary lists, it’s done discreetly. An individual isn’t notified that he or she has been added, or given a reason why.

These are the types of due-process violations and discrimination battles that civil rights organizations like the ACLU have been fighting for decades. As more Democrats attempt to equate “No Fly” lists with “known terrorists,” it’s a battle that gun rights advocates are having to fight too. Creating such a law would mean allowing the government to strip the constitutional rights of anyone who is not even charged or alleged to have committed a crime (let alone terrorism), but simply suspected of being a criminal.

Booker is not the first, and certainly won’t be the last, Democratic presidential candidate to spread these myths about firearms and gun laws. Maybe Booker is a strategic campaigning genius, but it sure seems dicey to me to build a platform on abolishing laws that don’t exist.

Dropping Jussie Smollett Charges Says It’s Okay To Lie If You’re Woke,"As far as the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office is concerned, lying about a hate crime is not such a big deal. By deciding to drop charges against former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollet for having faked a hate crime in an apparent deal in which his records would be sealed and no apology required for the costs he had inflicted on the city, the authorities effectively gave him a pass for all he had done.

Yet rather than ending the controversy, the deal—which Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel rightly declared was “not on the level”—created a brand-new furor. The outcome was at least in part the result of political squabbles between the police and the prosecutors. It was also clearly a product of Smollett’s privileged status in which his legal representative and support from influential friends made it possible for him to avoid being held accountable.

While some are attributing this miscarriage of justice solely to Smollett’s wealth and status as yet another example of the “varsity blues”-type scandal (the one in which rich people bought their children places in elite colleges), there is another dynamic at play here that also needs to be confronted.

Are Minority People Oppressed if Wealthy and Powerful?

This is also a product of a belief that those who hold the status of oppressed minorities have a different kind of privilege. They are to be considered victims even if they are wealthy or have power. Thus even if the stories they tell about being victimized by members of groups that are not minorities are untrue, they are to be held harmless for lying because their false narratives speak to a supposedly greater truth about white privilege and racism.

Much like intersectional theory, that holds that the struggle for civil rights in the United States for African-Americans is linked to all efforts by those who considered themselves oppressed, whether or not the analogy is justified, the problem is conflating causes and intentions that give advocates a belief that they can do no wrong. Even, as in the case of Smollett, where lies do great damage to the cause of equality and cast doubt on genuine hate crimes, there is a sense that accountability isn’t necessary.

The Smollett case may be about wealth and privilege, but the end result would be unimaginable without the identity politics that created an audience for the actor’s lies and political forces that were ready to sweep it under the carpet once it became inconvenient. That disconnect between the truth and the rhetoric of some who purport to advocate for civil rights has produced a conversation about race that is both fundamentally dishonest and feeding divisions that can only contribute to more hate.

The entire country’s attention had focused on what we were initially told was an atrocity in which Smollett — a gay, black man — had been taunted by white supporters of President Donald Trump. He was supposedly beaten, doused with chemicals, and had a noose put around his neck.

Smollett was, albeit briefly, a symbol of all that is wrong with Trump’s America. It was a place where hooded thugs wearing “Make America Great Again” hats could victimize someone for his race and sexual orientation. Smollett’s celebrity and relative wealth was, we were told, no defense against hate.

‘America in 2019’ Was Not as Simple as It Seemed

But within days of the chattering classes embracing the story as a metaphor for, in CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin’s words, “America in 2019,” the story fell apart. Once the Chicago Police Department investigated the alleged attack, they quickly discovered that the two men who supposedly beat Smollett were of African heritage, that they actually knew him, and that one had appeared as an extra on his show “Empire.”

After being questioned, they admitted that Smollett had hired them to help stage a hoax whose purpose was to give the actor some publicity because he was unhappy with his “Empire” salary. The case was brought before a grand jury, and Smollett was charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct. From being the new poster child for victims of Trump-era hate crimes against black and gay people, Smollett had become a symbol of something else: a rich, entitled person who believed he could profit from faking a crime.

But two months after the controversy began, the prosecution of Smollett was dropped. His hoax had led to enormous costs, as the police were forced to expand massive amounts of time and manpower on investigating a crime that hadn’t happened, but prosecutors were prepared to treat it as an unimportant, victimless crime.

The decision seemed at least in part to stem from ongoing tensions between the State’s Attorney’s Office and the Chicago Police Department. State’s Attorney Kim Foxx was forced to recuse herself from the case, because thanks to the efforts of a lawyer who had been Michelle Obama’s chief of staff, she had been in contact with a relative of Smollett early in the investigation.

But her deputy Joe Magats seemed to do her bidding by deciding to simply let Smollett off the hook with no apology, a few hours of community service, and the forfeit of a $10,000 bond (a drop in the bucket when compared to the enormous costs the investigation had prompted). Smollett even had the chutzpah to make a public statement that he had been “truthful and consistent on every level since Day 1,” even though Magats had conceded that there were no problems with the police investigation that led the grand jury to find he had consistently lied.

Magat’s disgraceful decision earned him and Foxx’s office a scathing denunciation from Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. That Smollett had benefitted from a whitewash was not in doubt.

This can be considered just another example of the corruption that is endemic in Chicago and the anodyne observation that rich people fare better in the criminal justice system than the poor in any locality. But it’s just as obvious that Smollett benefitted from the identity politics that drives much of the conversation about race in this country.

Smollett Knew the Country Would Believe Him

Smollett may have been a sloppy criminal, since the police easily discovered his deception. But he was not wrong to think that the country would believe his bizarre story without hesitation because the media is hungry for stories that will “prove” that their anger and disgust with Trump and his supporters is justified. Smollett understood that, in this hyper-partisan and divisive moment in our history, many Americans are all too ready to view politics through a racial lens that will not merely bring attention to discrimination and hate but also discredit everyone with whom they disagree.

Hoaxes like this or the ones that falsely accused the Duke Lacrosse team and a University of Virginia fraternity of racist and sexual violence may discourage victims of genuine hate crimes from coming forward. Whether or not that is true, what is at stake here is that, by essentially clearing someone who manufactured a hate crime, the Chicago prosecutors have validated the notion that so long as the purpose of a lie about race is to bring attention to hate against blacks and gays, it is not something for which anyone truly needs to apologize.

Once the struggle against racism and violence gets mixed up with notions about race in which truth is subordinated to political theories, cases like Smollett’s are inevitable. Allowing him to not only walk free but also to continue brazenly spreading lies is a disgrace. But it also contributes to a dishonest conversation about race that makes it impossible to draw a distinction between political disagreements and the necessary struggle to extinguish hate against all who are subjected to discrimination.

Wealth and privilege that is essentially colorblind helped Smollett stay out of the jail cell where he belongs. But the identity politics that is at the heart of much of our national discussion about race is what made this dispiriting tale possible in the first place.

"Jussie Smollett Cries Wolf, People Believe Hate Crimes Less","Two of history’s most famous storytellers can provide insight into a modern political controversy.

One is Aesop, the ancient Greek author of fables, including “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” In that fable, a young, bored shepherd amuses himself by pretending a wolf is chasing his sheep. When the shepherd yells, “Wolf, wolf,” nearby villagers run from their homes to help. When no wolf can be found, the shepherd laughs at the villagers’ credulity. When a real wolf threatens his sheep, however, the villagers refuse to be fooled again, despite the shepherd’s sincere pleas.

Now move from the hills of Greece to the streets of Chicago, where a young actor, Jussie Smollett, claimed to be a victim of racism. Smollett asserted that two men wearing “Make America Great Again” caps attacked him and tied a noose around his neck while yelling racist and anti-gay slurs on Jan. 29. California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Rev. Al Sharpton were among those decrying the apparent attack, with both senators demanding federal laws against lynching.

When Chicago police found that Smollett fabricated the incident, they arrested him Feb. 21 and charged him with felony disorderly conduct. On March 7, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony charges. However, powerful people used their influence not only to get all charges dropped but also to get all records pertaining to the case sealed.

The “attack” on Smollett ostensibly reflects the increased bigotry that President Donald Trump supposedly inspires. Yet those perpetuating such hoaxes risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism by sacrificing truth on the altar of political expediency.

Smollett Added to a Chorus Crying ‘Wolf!’

Smollett’s hoax merely attracted the most national attention among numerous similar fabrications. One week before the presidential election, an arsonist painted the words “Vote Trump” on the walls of the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, a black church in Greenville, Miss., before destroying it. The arsonist? Andrew McClinton, a black congregant with a prior criminal record.

Immediately after the election, a swastika and the words, “Heil Trump” and “Fag Church” were found on the walls of St. David’s Episcopal Church in Brown County, Indiana. The graffiti was “among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win,” wrote the Washington Post. Yet six months later, police arrested organist George Nathaniel Stang for vandalizing his own church.

“I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag,” wrote Stang, who added that he wanted to “mobilize a movement.”

In December 2016, Yasmin Seweid asserted that three intoxicated white men yelling “Donald Trump” called her a terrorist and tried to remove her hijab forcibly while riding a New York subway. Seweid also claimed no other passengers tried to help her. But Seweid admitted to fabricating the incident, and was arraigned two weeks later for filing a false criminal report, a misdemeanor in New York State.

Hate Hoaxes Are Rife on Campuses, Too

In 2017, students at St. Olaf’s College, Drake University, Kansas State University, and the Air Force Academy Preparatory School found threatening messages with anti-black insults on campus. The messages appeared in notes on car windshields or under dormitory doors, on whiteboards, and as painted graffiti on a car.

The Air Force Academy’s superintendent, Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, asked students, faculty members, and staffers gathered at a meeting to use their cell phones to record his message, in which he briefly referenced the riots at Charlottesville, Va. and Ferguson, Mo.: “If you can’t treat someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.” The Air Force posted Silveria’s entire five-minute speech on its Twitter account.

At Kansas State, black students led similar meetings to discuss possible racism on campus. The FBI even began a civil rights investigation.

Larger rallies took place at St. Olaf’s and Drake. Students at St. Olaf’s, a Lutheran college in Minnesota, staged protests, presented their demands by interrupting a forum, and forced classes to be cancelled for one day. At Drake, about 3,500 attended a rally supporting two minority students who received racist notes in their dorms.

“Why do you only show up in times of crisis?” Maleigha Williams, president of Drake’s Coalition of Black Students, asked the crowd. “Why do you only come when someone asks you to?”

Ensuing investigations, however, determined that the incidents at all three colleges were staged. Students from Drake, Kansas State, and the Air Force Academy Preparatory School—the reported targets of the messages—admitted writing them.

In September 2018, Adwoa Lewis from Baldwin, N.Y. claimed that as she was driving home, four white teenagers told her she “didn’t belong here” and yelled “Trump 2016.” When Lewis awoke the next morning, she found one of her tires slashed and a note on her windshield telling her to “go home.” But police discovered that the confrontation never happened, and Lewis admitted writing the note.

Fears of Saying the Truth Abound

Those examples reflect a larger problem that another famous author, Hans Christian Andersen, addressed in his story, “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” Two swindlers, posing as weavers, persuaded an emperor to purchase garments made from materials that would be invisible to anybody who was stupid or unfit for office. Naturally, the weavers produced nothing. But the emperor, his courtiers, and his subjects believed the weavers’ lies for fear of finding themselves stupid or unfit.

‘Simply put, Klansmen armed with nooses are not lurking on Chicago street corners.’

In today’s United States, the lie is the idea that Trump promotes a resurgence of the kind of bigotry that enabled Jim Crow to flourish and 30,000 members of the Ku Klux Klan to demonstrate their power in 1925 by marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. The fear is the dread of being considered “racist,” and the swindlers are such notables as Harris, Booker, Sharpton, and the rest of the “democratic socialists” in the academy, the media, the entertainment industry, and the Democratic Party, all of whom refuse to confront the hoaxers forthrightly.

“There is very little brutally violent racism in the modern USA,” wrote Wilfred Reilly, an assistant political science professor at Kentucky State University, a historically black college, for USA Today. “There are less than 7,000 real hate crimes reported in a typical year. Inter-racial crime is quite rare. 84 percent of white murder victims and 93 percent of Black murder victims are killed by criminals of their own race, and the person most likely to kill you is your ex-wife or husband. When violent inter-racial crimes do occur, whites are at least as likely to be the targets as are minorities.”

“Simply put, Klansmen armed with nooses are not lurking on Chicago street corners.”

Hate Hoaxes Desensitize People to Real Racism

Yet facts cannot serve a manipulative narrative.

“In college campus hate hoax cases … the individuals responsible almost invariably say that they staged incidents to call attention to real incidents of racist violence on campus,” Reilly wrote. “Certainly, the media giants that leap to publicize hate crime stories later revealed to be fakes, and the organizations that line up to defend their ‘victims’ — the Southern Poverty Law Center, Black Lives Matter, CAIR — think that they are providing a public service by fighting bigotry.”

They not only risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism. They declare the civil rights movement to be a monumental failure.

James S. Robbins, a columnist for USA Today, believes Smollett exploited that mindset.

“Why did Smollett believe that his alleged plan to manufacture outrage would succeed?” Robbins wrote. “Most probably because it was designed to fit a specific, well-established victimhood narrative. In this case, it was the young, gay, black celebrity versus the beastly, MAGA-preaching white racist homophobes. There is no ambiguity in that almost cartoonish scenario.

“The props and Trump-implicating rhetoric were necessary to establish the supposed hate motive. Otherwise Smollett might have been viewed as just another Chicago crime victim. And it was important to tie the faux attack to the idea prevalent on the left that the advent of the Trump era has unleashed an unprecedented wave of violence against ‘the other’” (emphasis added).

By perpetuating that lie, “democratic socialists” do more than cynically promote their agenda. They not only risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism. They declare the civil rights movement to be a monumental failure. They essentially assert that such men and women as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Medgar Evers, James Meredith, Ralph Abernathy, and the Freedom Riders fought—and, in some cases, died—in vain.

Those who perpetrate and enable false racial crimes must remember the advice an old villager gave the young shepherd at the end of Aesop’s fable: “Nobody believes a liar…even when he is telling the truth!”

What We Should Expect From The Release Of The Mueller Report,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report is expected to be made public early this week. The big special counsel news already occurred last month when Attorney General William Barr announced Mueller ended his investigation without a single American — much less a single American tied to President Donald Trump — being indicted for collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election.

The news followed years of media coverage claiming Trump was an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin and had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. That conspiracy theory led first to widespread spying on the Trump campaign using overseas intelligence assets and a variety of electronic surveillance.

Following Trump’s election, weaponized leaks from intelligence officials ramped up. Eventually it led to a no-holds-barred and no-expense-spared special counsel investigation of Trump and his campaign affiliates. The lack of indictments for the ostensible reason for the investigation was profoundly deflating — and embarrassing — for the Resistance and its media leaders.

Relatively few people will read the nearly 400-page special counsel report. Many will cherry-pick information to support their current opposition to the president. Here’s what is reasonable to expect from it.

Part 1: No Indictments For Russia Collusion

The report is divided into two parts. The first part is about Russia’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 elections. Mueller already indicted a bunch of mostly Russians as part of his investigation, although it is unlikely they’ll ever be tried or convicted of their alleged crimes. But Mueller did not find that anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to steal the election. As Barr put it in his summary of Mueller’s conclusions, “The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.”

Whether you’re a diehard Mueller fan or a skeptic, few would suggest Mueller would have declined to indict anyone for Russia collusion if he had the goods on them. He already announced there were no more indictments coming out of his investigation. He did his best to squeeze anyone who might even possibly have information on collusion with Russia — including a sea of somewhat sketchy Americans who were in the Trump orbit — and came up empty.

Given how much attention has been paid to and blame has been given to Russian meddling, Americans may reasonably wonder why there weren’t many more Russians indicted for election antics, or even simply more meddling ascribed to Russians. Not that Facebook memes, Twitter trolls, and email hacks are nothing, but Americans may have expected much more expense and effort expended by Russians given how much the media blamed them for Clinton’s loss.

Either way: the collusion theory that was used to undermine the administration of the duly elected president and justify breaking every norm against him resulted in not a single indictment against an American for colluding with Russia.

Part 2: No Indictments for Obstruction

The second part of the report is about “obstruction of justice.” While the Mueller probe was sold to the American public using the Trump-Russia Collusion Conspiracy Theory, it was always actually about obstruction. That was partly because FBI investigators knew at the time of the special counsel’s launch that — in the words of disgraced chief investigator Peter Strzok — “there’s no big there there.”

When Comey leaked his memos to spur the launch of a special counsel, there was nothing meaningful about Russia collusion in them but he had written them — and later testified about them — so as to suggest that Trump’s frustration with FBI game-playing was really an attempt to obstruct law enforcement.

Recently, some of the involved actors at the Department of Justice and FBI leaked to friendly media that unelected bureaucrats started the probe out of revenge for Comey’s firing, to oppose Trump’s foreign policy, and because Trump had signaled to the American public that the FBI was playing games about whether he was under investigation. It perhaps needs to be said that it is the president, not unelected bureaucrats, who sets foreign policy, makes hiring and firing decisions, and oversees the Department of Justice.

It didn’t take recent leaks to know this was an obstruction investigation. That news leaked — even though we’re always told that the special counsel’s team never leaked — by June 14, 2017. Four friendly reporters at the Washington Post, including Devlin Barrett, Adam Entous, and Ellen Nakashima, received that leak and wrote it up in typical “bombshell” fashion:

The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said. The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump’s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said. Trump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation. Officials say that changed shortly after Comey’s firing.

Even though the leaks were frequently about obstruction, the focus remained on Russia for a few reasons — and not just because intelligence officials kept selectively leaking information about Russia to make it appear that there was a grand Trump-Russia conspiracy. Supporters of the president found the “obstruction” theories ridiculous. Opponents of the president kind of did, too.

They were promised by a sea of elites that Trump was a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. They weren’t going to settle for the idea that Donald Trump, of all people, could be brought down by highlighting his angry tweets or other complaints about being accused of being a Russian agent.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s May 17, 2017, memo appointing Mueller special counsel said nothing of obstruction. It charged Mueller with investigating “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” and “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.”

A highly redacted subsequent memo changed the mandate. If obstruction is part of that August 2, 2017, mandate, it was hidden from the American people. Even congressional committees seeking to perform oversight of the Department of Justice were kept in the dark about the mandate and whether it was appropriate or inappropriate.

Spinning and Hyping Obstruction

Barr is a highly respected attorney who served as President George H. W. Bush’s attorney general in the early 1990s. Now in his sixties, he’s back for another tour. His summary of conclusions from the special counsel report suggested a bit of frustration with the approach Mueller took.

While a private citizen, Barr wrote a memo about Mueller’s alleged obstruction theory and sent it to the Department of Justice. He wrote his memo based on public reporting that Mueller was attempting to go after Trump for constitutional and lawful firing decisions. Barr rightly thought that was a horrible idea that would damage both the Department of Justice and the presidency. (Read my article on the memo from December for more information.)

Barr also reportedly believes it’s improper for law enforcement officials to smear someone when announcing he is not being indicted for a crime. The inspector general’s report on the FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton supported Rosenstein’s criticism of Comey for smearing Clinton when Comey announced he was letting her go.

Barr spoke volumes in his summary when he noted that “The Special Counsel states that ‘while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.'” This line was Comey-like. Indeed, Mueller and Comey’s “long friendship” was described by the Washington Post in May 2017 as “brothers in arms.”

Nearly everyone in the media ignored this rather dramatic conflict of interest. Comey and Mueller frequently worked together when Comey was deputy attorney general and Mueller was FBI director. Carl Cannon wrote about some of their shared failures and misjudgments, including the notoriously botched anthrax case and their conniving during the Bush administration.

Americans are innocent until proven guilty. While it is the task of the special counsel to decide whether a crime occurred or whether to indict someone for a crime, it is not his job to “exonerate” someone. The language was a bit cute.

Barr, who seems to be one of the few adults in the District of Columbia, followed up Mueller’s little quote about exoneration by writing, “The Special Counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.”

He and Rosenstein went through the report, consulted with department officials, applied the principles of federal prosecution that guide decisions about whether to charge someone with a crime, and “concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

They went out of their way to say this wasn’t because he was a president, and it wasn’t even just because there was no actual collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election, but because Mueller had failed to show the things that would be necessarily proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish a crime had been conducted. Those things they’d have to prove are that Trump tweeted and engaged in other actions with “corrupt intent,” and that the obstruction had a sufficient connection to a “pending or contemplating proceeding.”

Critics of the president hope to move past those problems and focus on the nearly 400 pages cataloging the worst-case construction on President Trump’s angry tweets and other attempts to win the day against the now-debunked Russia conspiracy theory that was undermining his administration daily.

The never-leaky special counsel team leaked to both the New York Times and Washington Post that they were incensed that Barr had gotten to “set the narrative” by summarizing the report’s conclusions instead of letting them set the impeachment-for-obstruction narrative. “Limited information Barr has shared about Russia investigation frustrated some on Mueller’s team,” was the Post’s headline. The New York Times went with, “Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr revealed.”

While Mueller refused to indict Trump and Barr already noted that most of the alleged obstruction actions have been the subject of public reporting — including everything from tweets to failed attempts to get White House Counsel Don McGahn to order Mueller’s firing — seeing them all listed one after another is something, again, one might expect of Mueller’s close friend and ally Comey.

The special counsel was imagined as an “insurance policy” to help undermine the administration of the Department of Justice and possibly impeachment. This report will seek to accomplish that goal, even with no indictments. Expect the media to spin and hype whatever they can out of the report, as per usual.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/what-we-should-expect-from-the-release-of-the-mueller-report/,2019-04-15
This Hate Crime Helps Show How To Know Real Ones From Hoaxes,"In national conversations about hate crimes, members of the media tend to rely on emotional rhetoric rather than rational evaluation of the facts. Despite aggravated assault making up 19.5 percent of hate crimes in 2017, the idea of random acts of hate-motivated violence inspires most of the fear and activism against hate crimes nationwide. Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons in 2017 in all categories, 79 percent were nonviolent.

To the public imagination, though, the concept of hate crimes conjures images of innocent people being targeted and brutally attacked merely for who they are. Despite many highly publicized incidents turning out to be hoaxes, hate crimes still drive a great deal of media attention. We have become accustomed to making arguments decrying the potential for true victims to be further victimized by lack of public trust in media and that real hate crimes do still happen. Here is an example of one of those true cases.

In July 2018, around 3:30 a.m., 24-year-old Brandon M. Wiley told the police that a 39-year-old gay man propositioned him and grabbed him in a sexual manner. In response, he beat the man, then later posted bloody pictures of himself on social media bragging about the assault.

The victim of the assault was found by police after a security guard witnessed the assault and suffered “multiple serious facial injuries, including a broken nose and fractured orbital sockets.” In April 2019, Wiley pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and police confirmed with video and witnesses that the victim had not molested him. Hate crime charges have been added, and Wiley is scheduled for sentencing in June.

What Makes This Hate Crime Plausible?

Multiple factors of this story illustrate the anatomy of a true hate crime. The first, and most important factor, was a neutral third party. A security guard just happened to pass by when the assault happened and was able to see specific details. Witnesses are one of the most important pieces of evidence as they allow more than one perspective to the crime. Hoax hate crimes often lack eyewitnesses or, if one is present, such witnesses have a bias towards the victim and may not be an objective source of truth.

In addition to eyewitnesses, the most affecting source of evidence comes from video or audio recordings of the event. In this case, security cameras caught the entire interaction between the two individuals. This allowed the police a straightforward view into the factual events. Security footage may not reveal verbal evidence, but in this case the attacker claimed the victim first assaulted him by grabbing his crotch. This was quickly disproven by the video evidence.

Police found the victim lying on the ground where the assault occurred, and he was taken to the hospital. Immediately going to the hospital is a powerful indicator of legitimate injury also, as it does not allow for staging or exaggeration of events.

Again, the victim had multiple witnesses to his injuries and was evaluated by medical professionals rather than taking a bloody selfie and posting it on social media or waiting until later to go to the hospital. The police were informed by a third party, in this case the security guard, and allowed the facts to be objectively recorded without outside influence. The first person to interact with the victim post-attack was the police officer, which significantly strengthens the case.

One of the most revealing aspects of this case is the pride the attacker took in his actions. He posted pictures of himself immediately afterwards, positioning himself as the victim and bragging about severely beating the man. He clearly intended for the public to know his motivations and felt justified in his actions.

A widely overlooked aspect in the narrative about a hateful population intentionally targeting minorities for violence is that we rarely see attackers bragging about their actions. It would seem reasonable that if people truly despise LGBT people to such an extent that they feel compelled to physically attack them in public, there would be more public celebration of such attacks.

Perpetrator Motives and Victim Reaction

A Texas study of hate crimes found that most reported hate crimes never identify a suspect and many are dismissed due to little or no evidence. It seems that the media assumes perpetrators of hate crimes simply wish to attack individuals of hated groups for the satisfaction alone rather than as a (perceived) political or social message.

In this case, the victim did admit to the police to propositioning the attacker. While a wildly inappropriate response, it is at least a reason that explains the attack. Too often we are simply asked to believe random citizens roam the streets looking for members of marginalized groups to assault for the sheer joy of the act.

Another unique property of this crime is that it took several months to collect sufficient evidence to properly prosecute the attacker with local reports updating the case. Too often, hate crimes receive a large, public announcement and rarely involve resolution or follow-up. This case was reported locally and in several LGBT news sources, but never achieved nationwide attention or outrage. This allowed the police and prosecution to gather evidence and build a case.

One overlooked quality of this case that significantly distinguishes it from most reported hate crimes is that the victim is not publicly named. Typically, an alleged victim immediately turns to social media or the press and tells his or her story before any investigation can be conducted.

In this case, even though he was viciously beaten over a minor infraction, he chose not to take this route. He was attacked, went to the hospital, gave an honest police report, and allowed justice to be properly served as he healed and rebuilt his life. While he deserves public sympathy for the attack, he did not seek fame or money. This says a great deal about the legitimacy of the incident.

Would Extra Laws Really Deter Hate Crimes? Not Likely

This was a hate crime because the attacker reacted to the proposition with extreme violence and bragged about attacking the victim, a gay man. The gay man took a chance in a moment of weakness late at night in a bar, and did not deserve to be viciously beaten. But an important question is: what law would have prevented this attack?

Although a terrible situation and unfortunate experience of engaging with the wrong person in the wrong scenario, the assault on its own was already illegal. Although a hate crime charge increases sentencing, is this going to influence Wiley’s future choices or his views on gay men or his own sexuality, which inspired the assault to begin with? Will the hate crime charges prevent a similar irrational young man from doing the same?

One of the unfortunate rhetorical media reactions, especially in LGBT advocacy, is the outrage that the violent incident occurred in the first place. They insist the same could happen to all LGBT people nationwide, and that the incident is evidence of a larger pattern. But this situation is far more of an outlier than a pattern. In fact, it’s the bold honesty of the attacker about his motivations that makes this story stand out as shocking and disturbing. Our collective agreement that this is morally wrong should be evidence enough that no one supports violence against LGBT people.

It is equally as important to recognize legitimate hate crimes as it is to report on the abuse of public sympathy and compassion with high-profile hoaxes. We should recognize that, despite the unfair imbalance of hoaxes to legitimate crimes, the police take reports seriously and do everything in their power to get justice for victims.

Unfortunately, it takes a real hate crime with a satisfying resolution for us to appreciate just how safe and protected LGBT individuals are in our society. The police and our justice system should be thanked for this.

The U.S. Justice System Is Not Riddled With Corrupt Police & Prosecutors,"I enjoy a good true crime story, so you might say that I live in the best of times. Behold the podcast revolution, which offers any number of true crime tales, “Serial” being the one that “broke through” and has created many imitators. And behold Netflix, whose “look at all the innocent people locked up in jail!” series—“Making a Murderer,” “The Staircase,” and “An Innocent Man”—have created a healthy skepticism about the fairness of our criminal justice system.

But for years there have been plenty of true crime shows that favor the prosecution. “Forensic Files,” for example, with its inimitable narrator Peter Thomas, offered 22 minutes of scientific instruction on how the good guys captured the bad guys. (Some turns out to be junk science these days, by the way.)

“Cold Justice” looks specifically at unsolved cases with the hope that one week of made-for-TV investigation can present enough evidence to the district attorney for an arrest. And, of course, fictional versions of these kinds of shows have sprung up aplenty. “CSI” was essentially a fictional combination of “Forensic Files” and Sherlock Holmes.

So what we have are contrasting looks inside the nebulous, scandalous, and at times wondrous world that is the American criminal justice system. If you only listened to one side, the side that paints the American judicial system as thoroughly broken and fraught with injustice, you will leave feeling utterly hopeless. If you only listened to the other, you will leave incredibly frustrated that the wheels of justice move as slowly as they do, with rare moments of celebration when an actual criminal is proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Maybe most people listen to only one or the other. I happen to watch “Cold Justice” and listen to the “Wrongful Conviction” podcast. “Cold Justice” is a flawed program, both as a television product and because of it assumes that a team of two to three experts can crack a case that no one else could for years on end. Also because it focuses on “cold” cases, it has an unusually high burden of difficulty.

The “Wrongful Conviction” podcast exists to demonstrate that it really isn’t that hard to put innocent people in jail and far too many of our prosecutors and DAs convict the wrong people to satisfy the demands of justice from a scared public and antsy voters.

If you watch “Cold Justice,” you appreciate the unique burdens on those who are actually trying to solve crimes. They often lack the expertise, funding, and time to conduct thorough investigations. There is often insufficient evidence at the crime scene to pass the burden of proof, especially if the criminals have watched a few episodes of “CSI” and remembered not to leave fingerprints behind.

Witnesses can give contradictory statements. Suspects have a “right to remain silent” and the right to have a lawyer present, even at the state’s expense. The burden is, as it should be, on the investigator to re-create all of the circumstances surrounding the crime so that there is no “reasonable doubt” as to who committed the crime.

If you listen to “Wrongful Conviction,” you realize how wrong that process can go. Investigators get tunnel vision and narrow in on one suspect, ignoring important clues and evidence. They coax confessions out of innocent people who will say just about anything to get out of the interrogation. They do not formally arrest a suspect so they don’t have to read them their Miranda rights, or they take the time to ingratiate themselves with a suspect, earning their trust before turning the tables. It is undeniable that a certain, unknowable number of investigators, prosecutors, and DAs shortchange the process and commit willful acts of injustice.

So which one is the most accurate account of what is taking place right now in the world of criminal justice? Well, surely, no one show or series of shows can tell the whole story. Each podcast or show has a particular point of view, a narrow focus that really doesn’t balance out the good with the bad.

But watching both shows can provide insight, such as: You do not have to talk to the police. People really do confess to crimes they did not commit. The words “I want a lawyer” are among the most powerful four words in the English language in America. And many crimes go unsolved.

We should expect, in a sinful world, that dealing directly with sin would be a complete mess. That we get justice from time to time is probably a miracle. Conservatives, who tend to be “law and order” types, should listen to those who have been wrongfully convicted, and should possess a healthy skepticism of the police state we are becoming. And more education say, in civics classes, on the rights we possess to remain silent and have an attorney present might serve the innocent well.

In the meantime, I am not convinced that it is open season on the innocent in America. Yes, civil asset forfeiture is criminal and there are more than enough cases of injustice to go around. But the burden of proof remains with the prosecution and, given all of the unsolved crime in our nation, that burden remains high.

So while I am glad to learn about injustices done by investigators and prosecutors and I do hope for reforms, I am also aware that there are many more investigators and prosecutors who follow the law and do not seek a conviction without good evidence first. Perhaps the overall lesson is, listen to both sides. Criminal justice is complex and broken, and no narrative can possibly tell the whole story.

Almost Everything You Know About Alcohol Prohibition Is Wrong,"It’s generally accepted that alcohol prohibition in the United States was an abysmal failure. Alcohol consumption remained relatively unchanged, the black market thrived, and the homicide rate skyrocketed, all of which eventually lead to the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. According to many, the lesson to be learned from this experiment is that government initiatives to ban certain things—whether it be marijuana, pornography, gambling, or guns—are always doomed to failure.

This, however, is flat-out wrong. The actual data tell us a very different story. Yes, alcohol prohibition did fail, but not for the reasons that many think. Accordingly, the failure of alcohol prohibition cannot be used to justify legalizing other goods or services.

Now, before you jump to assumptions and accuse me of being a puritan, I’m not advocating that we return to alcohol prohibition. My point is simply that we cannot use the failure of alcohol prohibition to argue against other kinds of prohibition. There are many good and convincing arguments against, say, gun prohibition, but comparing it to the failure of alcohol prohibition is not one of them. We should not use bad arguments for good conclusions.

For drug prohibition especially, alcohol prohibition may actually teach us a lesson in the opposite direction. Alcohol prohibition may have failed politically, but in terms of reducing overall consumption, it was a qualified success. Thus, on an issue like marijuana legalization, there are good historical reasons to think that keeping marijuana illegal would in fact be effective at reducing both overall distribution and consumption.

Prohibition Did Reduce Alcohol Use and Abuse

As Duke University economist Philip Cook explains in his carefully researched book “Paying the Tab,” the evidence shows that Prohibition had a clear effect in reducing overall alcohol consumption. Deaths from cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism (which are proxies for alcohol consumption) fell dramatically. Life insurance companies reported declines in alcohol-related deaths. According to Harvard criminologist Mark Moore, the best estimates are that consumption fell by around 30-50 percent. Moore also notes that hospitalizations for alcohol psychosis and arrests for drunk and disorderly conduct also declined.

Alcohol prohibition in the United States was not a single event. National prohibition was the culmination of a number of smaller alcohol control measures enacted during the 1910s, starting with state prohibitions and followed by wartime restrictions enacted during World War I. These measures all had the effect of facilitating a downward trend in consumption.

Although consumption did start to rise towards the later years of Prohibition, per capita ethanol consumption rates remained lower than what they were at during the 1911-1914 baseline period used by most scholars. Consumption levels during Prohibition never exceeded pre-Prohibition levels—indeed, that did not occur until the 1970s, which is perhaps a testament to its lasting effects.

So why do many people falsely think that Prohibition had no effect on drinking rates (or that it even increased them)? The answer is that while overall consumption fell, rates varied between regions and social classes. Prohibition was most effective in reducing consumption among working class and low-income individuals (who tend the most susceptible to alcohol-related harms). Prohibition made it more difficult and expensive for these individuals to obtain alcohol through illegal channels, so many decided to forego it. But for those in the upper class who were able to absorb the costs, Prohibition’s effects were less pronounced.

Thus, to journalists who reported on the proliferation of speakeasies, it seemed as if “everyone” continued drinking. But they were only observing the behavior of a segment of the population: namely, those who were able to afford illegal alcohol. They did not pay attention to the noticeable change in drinking habits among those whom alcohol harms the most, and for whom Prohibition is the most likely to benefit. These individuals could not easily obtain illegal alcohol, so their drinking levels plummeted.

Now obviously Prohibition did not completely eliminate alcohol consumption. It did, however, have a fairly significant effect on reducing it. Thus, it seems that with respect to alcohol consumption, prohibition was not a failure. In fact, it was a success.

Yet some would still consider this a failure: the mere fact that consumption continued (even if it was significantly decreased) shows that prohibition doesn’t work. But this is a ridiculous standard. By that same line of reasoning, laws against murder, rape, and theft do not “work” because murders, rape, and theft still happen despite being illegal. If perfection is our benchmark for success, then nothing would ever be successful. Prohibition does not need to be perfect, it just needs to be effective.

Prohibition Did Not Increase Crime

Many associate the Prohibition era with a sharp rise in crime. Images of shootouts, turf wars, and assassinations immediately come to mind.

But actually, there’s little evidence for a rampant crime wave. First, the homicide rate experienced larger increases during the pre-Prohibition period between 1900 and 1910 than during all of Prohibition, which is not what we would expect if Prohibition were a catalyst of crime. That said, the apparent increase in homicide during the entire period of 1900 to 1933 may be entirely illusory. According to sociologist Douglas Lee Eckberg, rising homicide rates are likely the result of bad data collection: the number of jurisdictions whose homicides were being counted increased, which gave the appearance of a spike in homicide.

Building on Eckberg’s findings, economist Emily Owens found that “murder rates did not increase when alcohol markets were criminalized,” and that “observed crime trends during the early 20th century are primarily explained by demographic changes.” Other factors, such as societal changes occasioned by World War I, immigration, and increased urbanization during the Roaring Twenties, largely accounted for the change in crime rates. In fact, Owens found that the “passage of legislation banning the commercial sale of alcohol had a net negative effect on the homicide rate,” meaning that alcohol prohibition may have reduced the homicide rate!

These findings were corroborated by Rowan University economist Brandon Livingston, who found that “alcohol prohibition decreased homicides for two years after enactment, but had no effect after two years.” There may have undoubtedly been some crimes that were made possible only because of Prohibition, but the evidence suggests that prohibition had no overall effect on crime. Indeed, it may have even reduced it.

The Black Market Doesn’t Mean Prohibition Failed

Yes, there was a black market for alcohol during Prohibition. Whenever there is any kind of Prohibition, there is bound to be a black market. But the mere presence of a black market does not mean that Prohibition is a failure (unless we think of success in terms of absolute perfection, which I’ve argued is silly).

Prohibition is a deterrent to behavior. If you threaten sellers with legal penalties for selling a product, they will, of course, be less willing to sell it. This in turn makes it more difficult to obtain the product. The more difficult it is to obtain it, the more expensive it becomes. The more expensive it becomes, the less willing people are to obtain and use it. In essence, Prohibition drives up the cost of a given product, which in turn reduces demand.

Highly motivated individuals may not be deterred by this, but the barriers put in place by Prohibition do have a real effect at reducing overall proliferation of a given product, especially among those who are not highly motivated.

National alcohol prohibition increased the price of illegal alcohol by a factor of two or more. While it was still possible to obtain alcohol through illegal channels, individuals were overall less motivated to do so because it cost them substantially more. It is should come as no surprise, then, that overall consumption went down. Many judged that it just simply wasn’t worth it.

So while the black market did “flourish,” alcohol was still less available than it would be if it were legal. The existence of underground black markets did not mean that Prohibition was a failure, any more than the continued existence of thieves means that laws against theft are failures.

So Why Did Prohibition Fail?

Prohibition ultimately failed for political reasons. Although it did have an enforcement problem, this wasn’t due to its impracticality. The Volstead Act contained a “joint enforcement” provision that required states to work together with the federal government to enforce prohibition. However, many “wet” states simply refused to enforce the law, while others repealed laws that were designed to facilitate enforcement.

Until Herbert Hoover took office in 1929, the federal government did little to allocate manpower and funds to enforce Prohibition. The result was that Prohibition enforcement efforts were chronically undermanned and underfunded. This lack of attention to enforcement—and not its impracticality—constituted the Achilles’ heel of prohibition. Had the Volstead Act been written differently, this problem could have been avoided.

The final blow came when the Great Depression changed voters’ priorities. In the midst of economic hardship, it was argued that repeal would generate tax revenues which could then be used to support struggling families. This same argument is used today to justify marijuana legalization. In the case of alcohol prohibition, however, initial tax collections after repeal fell very short of projections, which should make us think twice when applying this same argument to marijuana.

Even after repeal, the “dry” cause retained a great deal of support. In the late 1930s, more than 40 percent of Americans supported prohibition, and an equal number indicated that they abstained from alcohol completely. That number remained relatively unchanged even until 1960, when 38 percent of Americans described themselves as abstainers. Moreover, even after national prohibition was repealed, many states retained state-level prohibitions for some time. It wasn’t until 1966 that Mississippi became the final state to legalize the sale of alcohol.

What can we learn from all of this? Well, the chief lesson is that we should stop comparing alcohol prohibition to other kinds of prohibition. Yes, it did fail, but the reasons for its failure cannot be extrapolated to other forms of prohibition. Instead, each issue should be evaluated on its own merits. Prohibiting guns or drugs may be very bad policies. But if they are, they’re not bad because they can’t work. On the contrary, history tells us that prohibition can and has worked. We should rely on better arguments.

Violence Against Women Act Would Abuse Women To Destroy Gun Rights,"When politicians pass laws to please their bases, we often forget the costs inherent in these acts. “In every age it has been the tyrant who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism, or religion, or both,” Eugene V. Debs, prominent labor activist, remarked in a 1918 speech.

Debs invoked the profound irony through which humans often lose their liberties to thunderous applause. We’re currently facing another potential loss of due process rights for poor Americans if politicians get their way.

Both the government-insulating 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, and, more recently, the supposedly anti-terrorism 2001 PATRIOT Act stripped Americans of fundamental rights under the guise of a sympathetic cause. Now it’s happening again, as the modified version of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is on its way to a Senate vote.

The History of the Act

Originally passed in 1994, the VAWA funded the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, and included several other measures aimed at curbing domestic violence. The act contains a sunset provision and was reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013, never expiring until the government shutdown of 2018-19. The act hadn’t changed much since 1994, except for adding protections for same-sex couples and victims who were unlawful immigrants. Now, though, it’s a different story.

Not everyone is happy with this latest version. The National Rifle Association (NRA) opposes the reauthorization, and has recently taken a considerable amount of heat for doing so. Critics are painting them as heartless for their opposition to a law that ostensibly protects victims. Of course, the NRA being on the receiving end of progressive rage is nothing new, but this time the pro-gun organization is quite right. The new bill contains sweeping changes that would eliminate the fundamental rights of many Americans, disregarding due process.

Three changes stand out as particularly alarming: The elimination of a hearing requirement before civil rights are suspended as a result of a restraining order, the new definition of “intimate partner,” and an expansion into misdemeanor crimes of “stalking.”

Many states will grant a restraining order with little evidence. There are sometimes good reasons for this. Sometimes it might be clear enough that someone is in danger for the state to intervene before anyone is hurt, but revoking someone’s civil rights is a serious—and dangerous—solution, one not to be used lightly.

Restraining Orders Don’t Allow for Due Process

The VAWA previously struck a balance here by only removing the gun rights of a person subject to a restraining order if the person was actually notified of a hearing, and had an opportunity to participate in it. This means before a person’s rights were taken, he or she was able to present his or her side of the story—a crucial hallmark of due process. The new version all but eliminates the hearing requirement, expressly contemplating ex parte restraining orders (where the subject person never appears) as automatically removing someone’s rights.

The restraining order problem is compounded by the new definition of “intimate partner,” as the law only to handles situations involving “intimate partners.” The previous definition was pretty logical. It included one’s spouse, former spouse, the parent of one’s child, and cohabiting partners. The new, nearly 200-word definition includes “dating partners” and “former dating partners”—definitions so vague one might wonder if it includes the dog walker.

This is what lawmakers are calling “closing the boyfriend loophole.” This isn’t actually a loophole. The law was intended to address situations where the victim and abuser are in close proximity, where the risk of a repeated attack is high, and thus the severe measures made more sense to protect the purported victim.

This change seriously expands the reach of the provision, far beyond the scope of its original intention. With these two changes, someone’s ex could get a restraining order, and the ex would know nothing about it until receiving notice that his or her rights have been stripped. This result is unacceptable.

Stalker Expansion Could Also Spell Trouble

The “stalking” expansion is another modification that seems good at first, but fails a closer reading. Previously, the VAWA prevented anyone who had ever been convicted of crimes of domestic violence from buying or owning a gun, but this now includes misdemeanor crimes of “stalking.” Now, one might agree that there are reasons to keep guns out of the hands of convicted “stalkers,” but there’s a lot more to this change than first meets the eye.

“Stalking” is loosely defined in the law. It includes any crime that “would reasonably be expected to cause emotional distress” to a “domestic partner.” Of course, I probably wouldn’t want to go camping with a convicted “stalker” of any definition, but a misdemeanor conviction under these grounds is a massive departure from crimes of “domestic violence.”

The fact that these are misdemeanor charges is more than a technical distinction. People facing misdemeanor charges are often given less serious treatment, both by disinterested public defenders and fast-and-loose prosecutors more interested in pursuing a conviction than they are the truth. This is especially concerning given the fact that many people facing misdemeanor charges are financially disadvantaged, often unable to afford a good defense. They’re left susceptible to the efforts of slick prosecutors who coerce guilty pleas, even when the state lacked a strong case against them to begin with.

When we think of an appropriate punishment for a misdemeanor offense, we think of jail time under a year and fines—not a permanent deprivation of fundamental rights. That’s a serious punishment. This means that someone convicted of a misdemeanor charge of “stalking” (which, as defined, could include excessive phone calls) at 18, could spend the rest of his or her life volunteering for a battered women’s shelter, helping old ladies cross the street, and feeding unwanted kittens—without ever restoring his or her civil rights. Should that really be part of a misdemeanor conviction?

Expansive Changes Should Concern Everyone

Whether you agree with the provisions or not, the fact is that these are significant changes touching many Americans, many of whom may have been convicted years ago and since reformed. Don’t be fooled by attempts to frame gun rights supporters as anti-victim. What these changes do instead is create a new class of victims—poor Americans, who are significantly more likely to face criminal accusation and prosecution without competent legal counsel.

Telling people that they have no right to defend themselves for the rest of their lives sends the message that their lives are worthless. There were reasons to pass the VAWA, and there are still reasons to maintain it. But we must remember what Debs pointed out over a century ago: we can’t let ideologically motivated politicians sneak serious due process violations into popular laws just because the label sounds compelling.

Donald Trump’s Biggest Crime Was Winning The 2016 Election,"Donald Trump’s biggest crime was winning the 2016 election. For our political and media elite in the Beltway, that was the catastrophic, unforgivable crime, from which all the other (imaginary) crimes they now pursue him for originated.

How dare he win that election? Didn’t he know the election belonged to Hillary Clinton, who’d been building up to this very moment for three decades, courting every relevant constituency, remembering every useful politician’s birthday, and being as banal as possible to check everyone’s “lesser political evil” box?

How dare he win the election on his very first try? If you scratch the surface, jealousy is one of the driving emotions among Washington’s elite against Trump and his electoral success. He achieved what many career politicians would die and sell their souls multiple times for. And Trump did it seemingly casually, almost effortlessly. How dare he? He must have stolen the election!

How dare he win that election with a shoestring budget and a ramshackle campaign apparatus? How dare he win without an army of consultants, strategists, advisers, pollsters, and fancy data interpreters? Didn’t he understand that our elections are an excellent jobs program for thousands of political operatives and media types?

How dare he win the old-fashioned way: you know, by having a simple, direct message; recognizing heartland voters’ economic woes; and campaigning in that retail-politics way of his? Didn’t he know that 21st-century elections are now won with Big Data, microtargeting of voters, and media-hyped candidates?

How dare he lie and exaggerate in that crude, undisciplined way of his? Doesn’t he know that Washington likes their liars to be polished prevaricators who know how to couch their fabrications in think-tankese?

To add insult to injury, how dare he win by just saying what he (and millions of ordinary voters) thinks? That’s just not done. Didn’t he appreciate that Presidential Campaign-Speak is an art unto itself—something that has been focus-grouped, poll-tested, script-driven, platitude-filled, that’ll give no offense whatsoever to any identity group in America, and bores listeners to tears. How dare Trump riff offhand and entertain voters? The gall of the man!

How dare he say obvious, common-sense things like spending blood and treasure on Middle Eastern quagmires isn’t okay anymore, that America can’t afford to be the world’s security underwriter anymore, that our global trade deals have shafted American workers for too long? Who does he think he is?

Doesn’t he know that on the issues of the day, he needs to consult our over-credentialed, corrupt, and inefficient elites before he says anything? And doesn’t he know that the solution to every issue in our politics is counter-intuitive now: Up is down, war is peace, more illegal immigration is good, and having a wall on our southern border is bad.

How dare he care about ordinary American workers in the Rust Belt? Doesn’t he know that we live in a global economy now, and those Americans are toast? Dang Trump for forcing us to pretend we care about those white working-class voters Democrats had snookered for so long. Thanks to Orange Man, we now have to cater to the very people we despise and who cling bitterly to their God, guns, and religion.

And for God’s sake, doesn’t he know that caring about one’s nation and its citizens is passé? It’s all global now! Pretend-caring in a vague, generalized, feel-good way about global citizens while getting richer off their cheap labor is the fashion now.

For all his flaws, Trump is the best thing to have happened to our ossified, corrupt national politics. He ripped the mask off our political and media establishments. His election victory exposed the empty-souled hypocrites in the establishments of both parties and the national media who shill for them. He is the much-needed human defibrillator to the American political system.

What our ruling elites used to have (and lost) after the 2016 election was a powerful sense of control over our politics. Like millions of voters who are outside the hardcore Democratic base, I’ve been enjoying the primal scream emanating from the ruling and media elite. I may not like or agree with everything Trump does, but the spectacle of jittery, grasping-at-anything-and-everything elites has been enjoyable to watch.

With his unpredictable, heterodox ways of policy-making and communicating to the masses, Trump has, in some ways, neutered the media elite. What we have been seeing for the last two-and-a-half years is nothing but revenge on steroids: For the crime of winning the 2016 election, the elites have pinned all manner of crimes on Trump, hoping something will stick.

Skyrocketing Attacks On NYC Jews Ignored Because Of Race,"Imagine that members of a religious minority were being frequently physically assaulted in America’s largest city at alarming rates. Imagine if members of that minority were being cold-cocked or spit on randomly for doing nothing more than being who they are and dressing how they dress. Imagine what a powerful and important story this would be to our country, how mobilized the media and government would be to stop it. But what if I told you that this is happening in New York City right now, and nobody seems to care very much? How can this be? I’ll explain it.

Orthodox Jews in New York City, specifically in Brooklyn, have experienced alarming rates of physical assault over the past year. The New York Police Department says that hate crimes in the city are up 67 percent this year. Of those, a whopping 80 percent have been anti-Semitic hate crimes. Just this week an Orthodox Jew just walking down the street was attacked from behind, punched in the head by an attacker who then ran away. In another incident this week, an Orthodox Jew was attacked by a group of men, one of whom shouted “You (expletive) Jew.”

This is an all too familiar story in Brooklyn these days, and there is a reason it isn’t being treated as a crisis by our media or government. That reason is that many if not most of the assailants are black or Hispanic men. In an article in The New York Times last October that was careful to point out, although without much evidence, that people of all descriptions are committing acts of anti-Semitism, Ginia Bellafante writes (emphasis mine), “In fact, it is the varied backgrounds of people who commit hate crimes in the city that make combating and talking about anti-Semitism in New York much harder.”

We should be clear about what this means. It means that if these assaults were being committed by white men in hoods or MAGA hats, it would not be “hard to talk about.” It would be a clear-cut case of bigotry that needs to be fought with every tool in our arsenal. Instead, journalists are wringing their hands about intersectionality, and careful not to indulge the narrative that these physical attacks are coming from blacks and Hispanics in bordering neighborhoods, even though that narrative is absolutely true.

I know this because I have done it myself. Back in February I wrote about these attacks and I wrote some things that I now regret and want to apologize to the Orthodox community for. I wrote that Orthodox Jews are a “strange set of neighbors,” and their insular ways lead to tension in communities. In retrospect, and through some Orthodox Jews who reached out to me, I see that this was not acceptable, that in fact, I was in some way blaming these Jews for their own assaults.

Just as bad, I was making excuses for these attackers, trying to a find a far more nuanced take than I ever would if the assailants were white men. Even as someone who writes often about race double standards in the media, I fell straight into the trap. I found it “hard to talk about” without placing some blame on both sides.

There is nothing wrong with taking historical racial prejudice into account when writing about racial tension. A conscientious journalist should have worries about painting groups with too broad a brush or promoting stereotypes, but this must be balanced with telling the truth and giving a story the attention it needs and deserves.

In this, both the media and the city government are failing badly, and this is part of why. I asked city councilman and candidate for public advocate Joe Borelli if he thought the city and Mayor Bill de Blasio were doing enough. He was succinct, “It seems like the outrage ended when they couldn’t tie these hate crimes to Trump.”

At a time when we hear anti-Semitic remarks from a U.S. congresswoman and blatant anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan still holds sway among black Americans, we need to focus on and address the roots of anti-Jewish bias and crime in New York City. It can’t be “too hard to talk about.” We have to talk about it, directly and bluntly.

Only Hacks Would Call Reason Writer Robby Soave A White Supremacist,"The question at issue for a May 15 hearing of the House Oversight Committee was white supremacy and hate crimes in the United States, and how to deal with them. Witnesses were called who had expertise in the field, either through firsthand experience, or through research.

Among them were Reason writer Robby Soave. For providing the benefit of his extensive research into white supremacy, and the alt-right, he was called a “hate crime denier” by Andy Campbell in Huffington Post.

https://twitter.com/AndyBCampbell/status/1128797509604859904?s=20

Soave brought a perspective that was not available from any of the other witnesses called. That he was invited to share the information he’d gleaned from interviews with racists speaks highly of the committee as interested in seeing as broad a picture of the problem of white supremacy as possible.

Soave responded on Twitter to Campbell’s inaccurate hit job, showing, accurately, that Campbell had attributed quotes Soave had provided from Richard Spencer as Soave’s own views. Sharing the words of a white supremacist with a congressional committee that directly asked you to do so is not white supremacist, nor white supremacist-adjacent. It is bearing witness.

This @HuffPost write-up of my testimony before Congress yesterday doesn't even exist in the same universe as what actually happened. @AndyBCampbell claims I ""denied hate and white supremacy pose a threat at all,"" but even quotes me doing the opposite. https://t.co/5DblzHtxFJ pic.twitter.com/ZsGiB1mNVc — Robby Soave (@robbysoave) May 16, 2019

After Campbell published his article about the hearing, he took to Twitter, misclassifying Soave as “a lying dingus” and a “bad faith actor,” and falsely claiming that Suoave argued that “hate crime isn’t a problem.” Soave said nothing like that at all, and Campbell’s evidence is a quote Soave provided from Spencer, which does not at all represent Soave’s own views.

Soave published an article detailing his experience. “In my remarks,” he writes, “I tried to get across the point that the alt-right is a small fringe group, and that white nationalists are responsible for a relatively small number of murders relative to the overall violent crime rate.”

He backs this up with statistics going back to 1995, showing that while there is wider reporting of hate crimes across the country now than in the 1990s, the numbers are substantially lower than when fewer municipalities were reporting. In Soave’s view, that does not diminish the horribleness of hate crimes, but puts it into a wider context, which is why he was invited to speak.

While Campbell took to misrepresenting Soave’s role at the hearing, calling him names on Twitter, and printing parsed quotes that misrepresent his views, Soave published the entirety of his prepared remarks. Campbell was looking for a villain, and instead of digging into the facts, he cast Soave as a white supremacist, which could not be further from the truth.

Soave, author of “Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump,” was the last of a series of witnesses to deliver prepared remarks at this hearing. Those who came before had direct experience with white supremacist hate crimes and quantifying that data. Soave closed his remarks in noting that his “goal in bringing a degree of nuance to these facts and figures is not to minimize the real harm extremists have caused, but to discourage the kind of alarmism that can prompt overreaction on the part of authorities. Law enforcement should receive the resources they need to combat violence, threats, and property defacement, whether or not these crimes are motivated by hate, or impugn a specific group.”

In fact, Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, who was killed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, noted that many crimes that could be classified and reported as hate crimes are not, because crimes are easier to prosecute without the added burden of a hate-crime designation. Proving intent of hate is a higher burden of guilt, and when guilt can be proven without it, it is more expedient to do so in order to convict a criminal.

What gets lost in Campbell’s unsubstantiated abuse of Soave is that while hate crimes, white supremacist, and domestic terrorist violence exists in the United States, the biggest component of these vile ideologies is online. Additionally, there are data problems with reporting hate crimes, as it is not a mandatory requirement for any municipality or the FBI. Given these two realities, the inability to obtain accurate reporting, and the localizing of radical individuals online, making the story about another writer’s expert testimony is a waste of words.

Many of the proposed solutions to the problem of white supremacy and hate speech had to do with limited speech online. The Anti-Defamation League’s George Selim said, “Not only do white supremacist extremists spread this propaganda through fliers and banners and events, but on the internet, on social media as well… where they are proselytizing and conspiring and are less scrutinized than many instances by the public eye. Today’s propaganda is tomorrow’s hate and violence in our communities. More can, and must, be done to counter this threat and prevent it from getting worse.”

He went on to say that government and law enforcement must “work with the tech sector to enact common sense solutions to prevent the abuse on their platforms by white supremacists and their adherents.” What does that mean? It is essential that phrases such as “a common sense approach” be fully explained when applied to something as fundamental as free speech, and limitations thereof.

Campbell’s attacks on Soave ignored the real issues presented by this important hearing. So many people at this hearing had the best intentions for the furtherance of peace and civil rights in our country, and this kind of malignant misinterpretation only hurts the cause.

Soave is not a white supremacist, and Campbell’s insistence that he is does more to prove that much of the problem resides in how hate is defined, and how liberally and inaccurately the word is tossed around, than how widespread it actually is.

"No, Three Recent Murders Weren’t Because The Victims Were Trans","All life is precious, and no human being has greater value than any other. When an innocent person is murdered, we all suffer from the loss of life, potential, and the love shared by that individual. It is especially cruel when the death is random or the consequence of the selfish, criminal actions of others who do not value life and freedom.

It is also cruel when a tragedy is exploited for political gain and individuals are used to advance a narrative that overshadows the lives they lived. Unfortunately, even when the intentions are just, the exploitation is nevertheless wrong.

Ashlee Marie Preston, a prominent transgender activist, illustrated how compassion and advocacy can often create unnecessary fear and outrage by tweeting, “3 black trans women have been murdered within a couple of days of one another. When we whisper, no one hears us. When we yell; we’re gaslighted, demonized, and told we’re being intense. This is a crisis. All across America; my sisters are being erased. Will you stand up for us?”

Echoing the sentiment, Human Rights Campaign declared, “It is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, and that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia and transphobia conspire to deprive them of necessities to live and thrive. This epidemic of violence that disproportionately targets transgender people of color — particularly Black transgender women — must cease.”

A spokesperson for the LGBT advocacy organization Anti-Violence Project argued, “Without safety and access to the workforce, healthcare, housing, and other critical areas of public life, Black trans women continue to be made disposable and denied the most the basic necessities needed to live a full life.” The organization released a report in 2017 on anti-LGBT violence and concluded, “For the last five years, NCAVP has documented a consistent and steadily rising number of reports of homicides of transgender women of color, which continued into 2017.”

In a tweet identifying a transgender woman who was recently found murdered in Philadelphia, the LGBT legal advocacy organization Lambda Legal demanded, “Stop killing black trans women.”

Discussing this recent murder, the above linked Philadelphia paper cited a survey stating, “The National Center for Transgender Equality released a survey of 28,000 transgender people in 2015, in which nearly one in 10 respondents said they were physically attacked in the last year because of being transgender. Transgender women of color were four times as likely as other transgender people to have been attacked at gunpoint.”

Discussing the LGBT community’s concerns over the safety of holding a public memorial, one transgender person said, “I’m scared that someone might follow me home from a rally, that someone might follow me home from work. I’m in fear.”

There is, however, one significant issue concerning the three transgender people cited in the above outcries that illustrates a serious narrative flaw: none of them were murdered for being transgender.

Claire Legato, a 21-year-old transgender person, was shot on April 15 of this year and died from those injuries on May 14 in Cleveland, Ohio. Muhlaysia Booker, a 23-year-old transgender person, was shot and killed on May 18 of this year in Dallas, Texas. Michelle “Tamika” Washington, also known as Michelle Simone on social media, a 40-year-old transgender person, was shot and killed on May 19 of this year in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A

ll three are the subjects of ongoing criminal investigations, with two suspects under arrest. Muhlaysia Booker was previously involved in a viral video assault that occurred in mid-April.

According to police, Legato was at home with Legato’s mother and a man named John Booth. Legato’s mother was in an escalated argument with Booth, accusing him of stealing her tax refund check. During the altercation, Claire confronted Booth then left the house. Booth followed Claire and shot Claire in the head. Booth, 61, is charged with assault in connection with the shooting.

There is no indication the violence occurred due to Claire’s transgender identity or the relationship Claire and Claire’s mother had to Booth. Almost surely both knew of Claire’s transition. Claire, aged 21, was clearly in an incredibly unsafe environment that appears to have included domestic violence. A dispute over money and Booth’s willingness to use deadly force with a gun during an altercation tells us the danger Claire was living in. The shooting happened around 4 a.m.

Tamika Washington, according to police, was shot multiple times around 5 a.m. and died nearly a half hour later in the hospital. Washington’s alleged killer, Troy Bailey, 28, has been arrested and police believe the murder was the result of an attempted robbery, as neither individual knew each other. According to Philadelphia Gay News, Bailey has been charged with “murder, possession of a firearm with an altered manufacturer’s number and violations for carrying a firearm as a former convict and without a license, among other crime.” Washington was a well-known transgender person and LGBT activist.

Muhlaysia Booker is a unique case, having also been assaulted in a widely shared video showing a group of men viciously beating Booker. Booker accidentally backed into another car on the road and the driver drove Booker off the road in an attempt to prevent Booker from fleeing. According to the victim, the other driver pointed a gun at Booker and demanded Booker pay for the damage to his car before he would allow Booker to leave. A crowd gathered around the altercation, and an unidentified person offered Edward Dominic Thomas, 29, $200 to beat Booker.

The video of the incident shows the beating in progress as a large crowd shouts and cheers while surrounding them as multiple men violently attack Booker. Although Out Magazine indicated the video shows homophobic and misogynistic slurs being hurled from bystanders and Booker reported the attackers used homophobic slurs, this is not indicated clearly by the video or confirmed by police.

Thomas was arrested on April 15, 2019, and has a prior history of family assault, burglary, and the illegal carrying of a weapon. During an interview with police, he admitted to the assault but claimed not to have engaged in any derogatory language towards the victim. No other witnesses’ statements have been released or other arrests associated with the attack as of this writing.

The attack appears to be a highly escalated case of road rage and mob violence. There is no other evidence to indicate the attackers knew Booker, that Booker was transgender, or that the assault was motivated by Booker’s gender identity. At a rally after the first assault, Booker told the crowd, “This time I can stand before you,” alluding to the fact that when violence against black transgender people receives any kind of attention, it’s usually because that person has been killed: “In other scenarios, we are at a memorial.”

On May 19, several weeks later, around 6:40 a.m., Booker was found dead of gunshot wounds on a street. The police are currently investigating but have found no evidence to address if the murder was retaliatory or bias-motivated. There are no current suspects or witnesses to the crime.

All three of these tragedies appear to be either random violence or domestic violence, and this is indeed a vital concern for our society. A person should not fear being severely beaten over a minor car accident in broad daylight as a crowd cheers, nor should a person be the victim of a robbery walking along a street. A person should certainly feel safe in their own home with his or her family.

But these are dangers everyone faces in high-crime areas or even simply due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is why conservatives advocate so strongly for gun rights and ownership as a powerful tool of personal protection. But to assume these tragedies are somehow connected by transgender identity or race is not only unsupported by the evidence, but also intentionally incites fear and paranoia in the name of innocent victims.

There is no evidence of targeted violence against transgender people of color or otherwise, and there is no evidence of a specific threat of LGBT individuals publicly gathering in a group or traveling alone on their daily business. To claim a specific pattern of violence due solely to shared characteristics of the murder victims is misleading and unethical. Worst of all, it causes members of those minority groups to feel their own sense of freedom and security must be restricted for no reason at all.

No new law, task force, or awareness campaign is going to be able to address these crimes if focused on the completely irrelevant personal and physical characteristics of the victims in this narrow case. To protect transgender women, or anyone else living in our vast country filled with diversity and various dangers and threats, we must embrace personal protection and personal responsibility in our daily actions.

Nothing good happens after 3 a.m., never engage with an angry person waving a gun at you, and always, always, be able to defend yourself and your family if a threat appears. This is good advice for everyone.

LGBT people don’t need special protections. We just need to be aware of the dangers around us.

Why His Support For The 1994 Crime Bill Won’t Hurt Joe Biden — Yet,"Yesterday, President Trump took to Twitter to deride Joe Biden for his work on the 1994 Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. Trump insinuated that Biden’s support of the bill, which imposed steep sentencing guidelines and some of Biden’s presidential opponents have criticized, would keep black voters from supporting him.

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1133139717069910017

It’s hard to understand the president’s exact political motivation here. Maybe he thinks the crime bill is a serious stumbling block for Biden in the primary and wants to elevate it as an issue, playing political adviser to Biden’s opponents, as it were. Maybe he thinks he can force Biden to double down on his support of the crime bill, and alienate the social justice wing of the party in a general election. Maybe he’s just stirring the pot.

Whatever he’s doing, the crime bill is not going to take Biden down. Not yet, anyway.

The reason Biden is safe on this front is generational. Basically, if you are more than 40 years old, you might think the bill was draconian, but you can remember how bad the crime crisis was in 1994. If you are younger than 40, and have no such recollection, it may very well seem like a needless and reactionary measure. Most of the electorate is older than 40. They have a context for Biden’s choice that makes it seem, even if one disagrees with it, entirely understandable.

Pollster Frank Luntz weighed in on this question in response to me on Twitter today.

In 1994, violent crime had hit a 30-year high. A tougher approach was demanded by leaders across the board, regardless of political affiliation. 👉🏻 https://t.co/WFZ3ANMohR https://t.co/zO225BLhhH — Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) May 28, 2019

And he’s right. In 1993, for example, there were more than 2,400 murders in New York City. Last year there were 289. It is impossible to explain to a 30-year-old what 1993 New York City was like — don’t get me wrong, I still loved it, and moved there — but it was often legitimately frightening. This was a pattern seen all across the country. And the voters were demanding solutions.

There is widespread disagreement about how effective the crime bill and New York City’s “broken windows” policing methods were in the staggering crime rate drop that followed their enforcement. I won’t litigate that here, except to say that whatever role they played, violent crime dropped dramatically. The important point is that whether they worked or not, people understand why they were adopted, and they had broad public and political support across demographic boundaries.

This will be Biden’s play: “It was a crisis,” “The public demanded action,” “It had broad support, including among black politicians.” For the vast majority of voters of all ages, this makes sense and makes his support of the bill into something of a nothingburger. In terms of the Democratic primary, this line of attack seems unlikely to leave much of a mark. But the general election is a different story.

If, as may have been Trump’s hope, Biden has to double down on his defense of the bill, it will anger parts of the far-left Democratic base. I think Trump is either wrong, or trying to be edgy about whom those voters are. It’s not black voters that the crime bill is likely to influence, it is white progressives, who make up the vast majority of far-left New Progressives. But this can still work in Trump’s favor. Frankly, it’s reminiscent of what happened to Hillary Clinton, who could not bring along enough Sanders voters to beat Trump.

Trump’s tweet is his most powerful direct intervention into the Democratic primary to date. It is a reality show challenge. How will each contestant deal with it? Will a desperate single-digit long shot take up the president’s critique and call Biden unfit? Or will one of them try to appeal to the center by getting Biden’s back? Bernie Sanders also voted for the bill as a member of Congress, so how does that affect the game?

One of the more telling moments of the 2016 election was when Bill Clinton, apparently against his advisors’ wishes, engaged a young Sanders supporter in a diner in New Mexico who criticized his administration. At one point, Bubba said, “If you never have to make a decision, then you can go back to the past and cherry pick everything[for a narrative] that is blatantly false.” It was an awkward moment for the Hillary Clinton campaign that wished to divorce itself to some degree from Bill’s legacy.

But what if that was a mistake by Hillary’s team? What if it was the same mistake Al Gore made? What if lots and lots of people, including Democrats who aren’t on CNN or Twitter, still believe Clinton was a good president? Then Biden might be making a very shrewd choice to defend the 1990s Democratic Party in the primary.

But for some progressives it might be a bridge too far. And that is why Trump wants this to be an issue.

Mueller Just Proved His Entire Operation Was A Lawless Political Hit Job,"If there were any doubts about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s political intentions, his unprecedented press conference on Wednesday should put them all to rest. As he made abundantly clear during his doddering reading of a prepared statement that repeatedly contradicted itself, Mueller had no interest in the equal application of the rule of law. He gave the game, and his nakedly political intentions, away repeatedly throughout his statement.

“It is important that the office’s written work speak for itself,” Mueller said, referring to his office’s 448-page report. Mueller’s report was released to the public by Attorney General William Barr nearly six weeks ago. The entire report, minus limited redactions required by law, has been publicly available, pored through, and dissected. Its contents have been discussed ad nauseum in print and on television. The report has been speaking for itself since April 18, when it was released.

If it’s important for the work to speak for itself, then why did Mueller schedule a press conference in which he would speak for it weeks after it was released? The statement, given the venue in which it was provided, is self-refuting.

Let’s start with the Mueller team’s unique take on the nature of a prosecutor’s job. The standard American view of justice, affirmed and enforced by the U.S. Constitution, is that all are presumed innocent absent conviction by a jury of a specific charge of criminal wrongdoing. That is, the natural legal state of an individual in this country is innocence. It is not a state or a nature bestowed by cops or attorneys. Innocence is not granted by unelected bureaucrats or federal prosecutors.

At one point in his remarks, Mueller seemed to agree. Referring to indictments against various Russian individuals and institutions for allegedly hacking American servers during the 2016 election, Mueller said that the indictments “contain allegations and we are not commenting on the guilt or innocence of any specific defendant.”

“Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.”

Had he stopped there, he would have been correct. But then he crafted a brand new standard.

“The order appointing the special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. We conducted that investigation and kept the office of the acting attorney general apprised of our work,” Mueller said. “After that investigation, if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”

According to Mueller and his team, charged Russians are presumed innocent. An American president, however, is presumed guilty unless and until Mueller’s team determines he is innocent. Such a standard is an obscene abomination against the rule of law, one that would never be committed by independent attorneys who place a fidelity to their oaths and impartial enforcement of the law ahead of their political motivations.

The contradictions and double standards didn’t stop there, though.

“It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge,” Mueller said, after all but stating that Trump committed a crime for which Mueller never charged him. Just as Mueller’s own words and actions at the Wednesday press conference prove that he didn’t want his team’s report to speak for itself, the report itself proves that Mueller and his team don’t believe it’s unfair to accuse somebody of something a court cannot resolve.

If they actually believed that, then the 240-page volume II of their report on their obstruction investigation of the president would never have been authored. After all, according to Mueller’s own statement, such an operation would be patently unfair. And if it’s unfair to air dirty laundry against a target who was never charged, surely it’s doubly unfair to do so in writing and on camera during a press conference whose mere existence refutes the very claims of its host.

Mueller revealed himself as little more than a clone of James Comey—the smarmy, scheming politician who replaced Mueller as the head of the FBI. Recall that it was Comey who assumed for himself powers that did not belong to him by law when he declared at a 2016 press conference no “reasonable prosecutor” would charge Hillary Clinton with criminal wrongdoing in her mishandling of classified information and unsanctioned use of a secret, private email server to evade public records laws. Just as Mueller did in his report and Wednesday press conference, Comey followed up his declaration that Hillary would not be charged with statement after statement after statement of all the awful things Hillary Clinton did.

“There is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information,” Comey said of Clinton. He excoriated her for repeatedly sending and receiving top secret information on her unsecured server which had never been authorized to process classified information. He even said it was possible, due to her “extreme” carelessness, that hostile foreign actors had penetrated her system and obtained highly classified information about U.S. national security programs.

Regardless of how you feel about Clinton, Comey’s display at that press conference was an embarrassment. He did an extreme disservice to the nation and the rule of law by unilaterally declaring himself the primary arbiter of prosecutorial decisions in the federal government when that authority belongs solely to the Department of Justice. And he did an extreme disservice to Clinton herself by dragging her through the mud in such a manner that clearing her name would be impossible.

In fact, DOJ guidelines expressly prohibit the actions of both Comey and Mueller in naming and shaming individuals who were never formally charged with any wrongdoing.

“As a series of cases makes clear, there is ordinarily ‘no legitimate governmental interest served’ by the government’s public allegation of wrongdoing by an uncharged party, and this is true ‘regardless of what criminal charges may . . . b[e] contemplated by the Assistant United States Attorney against the [third-party] for the future,'” states DOJ’s formal policy manual on the duties of federal prosecutors and principles of federal prosecutions.

Nationwide bar rules governing all practicing attorneys in the United States also explicitly prohibit Mueller’s display during Wednesday’s press conference.

“The prosecutor in a criminal case shall … refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused,” states Rule 3.8(f) of the American Bar Association’s rules of professional conduct.

Multiple federal agents and prosecutors reached out to The Federalist after Mueller’s press conference to express dismay at the former FBI director’s behavior.

“I’d have been crucified under this rule for a ‘not innocent’ comment about an uncharged party,” a former federal prosecutor told The Federalist. “I literally cannot fathom holding a press conference to say that an uncharged person was not innocent.”

“I wish these former FBI directors would learn their lessons: keep your mouths shut unless you’re referring a case for prosecution,” Jeff Danik, a retired FBI supervisor, said during a phone interview with The Federalist on Wednesday.

Mueller’s performance made it clear for all to see that what he ran for the last two years wasn’t an independent investigation pursuant to the rule of law so much as an inquisition motivated by political animus. Mueller and his team refused to charge prominent Democrats for crimes he charged against Republicans. Paul Manafort was charged with unregistered lobbying for foreign governments, while Mueller left alone long-time Democrat donor Tony Podesta and former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig.

George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn were charged with making false statements to federal investigators, while Clinton campaign cronies Glenn Simpson and Christopher Steele’s false statements to Congress and the FBI were ignored. Trump’s nonexistent Russian connections were plumbed while a dubious Clinton campaign-funded dossier sourced directly to Russian officials was used as a prosecutorial roadmap rather than rock-solid evidence of actual campaign collusion with the Kremlin.

Mueller claimed his report spoke for itself, then put together a completely unnecessary press conference more than a month after his report’s public release, in which he not just spoke for the report, but expounded on the new legal standards he created to govern its conclusions.

These are the actions not of an impartial and independent investigator, but of a scheming political operative. None of this is any surprise to anyone who has followed Mueller’s tenure in government. As FBI director, Mueller repeatedly misused and abused the authority granted to him by Congress.

Mueller and Comey utterly bungled the federal investigation into the 2001 Anthrax attacks, resulting in a $5.8 million judgment against the government after the two men falsely accused an innocent man of being behind the attacks.

Even after the court judgment against him, Mueller was defiant.

“I do not apologize for any aspect of the investigation,” Mueller said afterward. He then doubled down and said it would be wrong to say there were any mistakes in how he handled the investigation.

Then there was Mueller’s handling as FBI director of a case in which FBI agents framed innocent men of murders the FBI knew had been committed by their own informants. One of the innocent men died in prison awaiting justice for a crime he never committed.

Then, as special counsel to investigate Russian collusion during the 2016 campaign, Mueller promptly hired partisan Democrats to run his investigation. He tapped as investigators FBI personnel who openly discussed their hatred of Trump and his voters, as well as their plans to keep him out of office.

There’s no longer any doubt about who Robert Mueller is or why he conducted himself the way he did. As abominable as his press conference was, we should in many ways be thankful that Mueller so willingly displayed for all to see his disdain for basic rules of prosecutorial conduct, his total lack of self-awareness, and his naked desire to stick it to Trump.

Why Ending The Death Penalty Only Benefits The Worst Criminals,"When she was just 12, Lisa Marie Velasquez and her younger siblings watched in horror as her pregnant mother was murdered by an ex-boyfriend. Twelve years later, Lisa was repeatedly bludgeoned with a hammer and brutally dismembered, then her remains stuffed into trash bags. A week later, Bronx police discovered two bags of Lisa’s body parts in Crotona Park. Four days after that, three more bags containing Lisa’s remains were found in Barretto Point Park in Hunts Point.

When Bronx County District Attorney Darcel Clark announced indictments for the man and woman charged with the crime, she characterized Velasquez’s murder and torture as “the ultimate degradation of a human being.” The desecration was so unspeakable that Jacqueline Perez, Lisa’s aunt, was unable to identify her niece. Horrified by the sheer enormity of the atrocity, she declared, “I want the same thing to happen to them that happened to my niece!”

Perez’s raw plea for justice was fueled by righteous anger. Her shattered heart demanded accountability in the face of a monstrous injustice. She called for an unmistakable punitive response to those responsible for such a barbaric act. It was an appeal to a fundamental principle of justice in civil society. A justice rooted in “proportionality”—that punishment should be dispensed in direct relation to the level of injury caused to others.

The Importance of Proportional Punishment

Applying proportionality in evaluating and punishing unlawful conduct is at the heart of any ethical administration of justice. It reinforces our obligation to pronounce moral judgment on criminal behavior and to implement a code of penalties appropriate to the crime. The most challenging and severe application of this principle is the imposition of the death penalty.

Robert James Bidinotto was a criminologist and investigative crime reporter in the infamous Willie Horton case. As he puts it, “To abandon proportionality in sentencing is to abandon the quest for justice itself. And to deny the death penalty for premeditated murder is to deny the very principle of fitting punishments to offenses. . . . Proportionate punishment is the moral keystone of any system of justice.”

In “Why The Death Penalty is Still Necessary,” professors Edward Feser and Joseph M. Bassette agree:

We reserve the death penalty in the United States for the most heinous murders and the most brutal and conscienceless murderers. . . . To sentence killers like those to less than death would fail to do justice because the penalty . . . would be grossly disproportionate to the heinousness of the crime.

However, many, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, have a different view. Newsom has said, “The death penalty is a failed policy that wastes money and is fundamentally immoral.” Recently, Newsom put his personal beliefs into action by granting reprieves for 737 death row inmates. Newsom’s unilateral action disregarded the direct will of Californians, who in 2016 voted to retain the death penalty via Proposition 62 and to expedite executions by streamlining the costly death penalty appeals process through Proposition 66.

Sadly, in today’s charged political climate, it has become fashionable to toss around the term “immoral” to shut down meaningful debate on important issues like the death penalty. Walls are apparently now immoral. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is immoral. Incorrect pronouns are immoral. Tuition is immoral. Masculinity is immoral. School mascots are immoral. Whiteness is immoral. Are you sensing a trend?

Morality has become usurped, cheapened, and diluted by outrage mobs. Regardless of the strength or truth of any countervailing arguments, these mobs don’t hesitate to arbitrarily label anything “immoral” if it’s contrary to their ideas or ruffles their high-minded feathers. The result is a self-righteous, cynical, partisan game that reduces everything to derision and denunciation.

Proportional justice must be anchored in the principle of retribution to counteract this brand of toxic thinking. Only on this firm foundation can we avoid the irrational, mindless reprisals and revenge in reaction to crime and its adjudication.

Contrary to death penalty opponents, retribution is not that same as revenge. It is not vindictive or some blind retaliation of “an eye for an eye.” It is a measured and rational moral response to capital offenses, free from any personal animosity.

The Origins of Retributive Justice

At its root, the word retribution derives from the Latin for “recompense, repayment” or to “hand back.” Originally, “that which is given in return for past good or evil.” In more modern usage it has become “evil given for evil deeds.” This definition finds its roots in virtually all religions and cultures, including the Judeo-Christian heritage that undergirds America’s founding.

Retribution “casts back” upon criminals the harm, injury, pain, and suffering they have caused. In the case of the death penalty, if we can agree that human life is our highest moral value, then murder is the greatest moral affront to civilized society. Feser and Bessette again explain:

Perhaps most importantly, in its supreme gravity it [the death penalty] promotes belief in and respect for the majesty of the moral order and for the system of human law that both derives from and supports that moral order.

Yet, even in the face of this, many still consider the death penalty “unconstitutional” and regard its application as “cruel and unusual” punishment.

In 2015, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia reminded Americans that the death penalty is firmly rooted in the U.S. Constitution. In Glossip v. Gross, he cited the Fifth Amendment’s provision that “no person shall be held to answer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,” nor “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”

Scalia noted, “Not once in the history of the American Republic has this court ever suggested the death penalty is categorically impermissible.” He argued it was “impossible to hold unconstitutional that which the Constitution explicitly contemplates.”

As for the notion of cruel and unusual punishment, Scalia continued, “Historically, the Eighth Amendment was understood to bar only those punishments that added ‘terror, pain, or disgrace’ (Baze v. Rees) to an otherwise permissible capital sentence.” He stated that he “would not presume to tell parents whose life has been forever altered by the brutal murder of a child that life imprisonment is punishment enough.”

Life in Prison Is Sometimes Not Enough

Scalia’s sentiments have been echoed by countless grieving relatives who have earnestly pleaded to know why life imprisonment is considered the worst fate for heinous criminals. This impassioned question was underscored loudly in the Willie Horton case.

After serving only ten years, Horton made a mockery of his original sentence of “life without the possibility of parole.” After being transferred to a minimum-security prison, Horton soon became eligible for work release. It was on an unsupervised weekend furlough that he committed armed robbery and assault, subsequently torturing and raping a Maryland couple for 12 hours.

Unfortunately for untold victims and their families, the Horton episode is not an isolated case. Life sentences seldom mean “for life,” or anything even close to it. Last year, Herman Bell was released from prison after serving 44 years. Along with two other members of the Black Liberation Army, Bell had been convicted of coldly planning and carrying out the assassination of two police officers in 1971.

Even more recently, Weather Underground terrorist Judith Clark won parole after only serving 38 years of a 75 years-to-life sentence for her participation in a 1981 bungled armored car heist that killed two police officers and a Brinks security guard. William Smith Jr., the dissenting vote against Clark’s release, wrote: “Release at this time would deprecate the seriousness of the offenses and undermine respect for the law. In time . . . media coverage will lessen. What will not diminish is the loss felt by the loved ones . . . the sounds of their weeping will remain.”

“What kind of justice is this?” ask victims’ loved ones. Friends and family of the victims not only remain lifetime victims themselves, but must stand by as murderers can fill their lives while incarcerated with entertainment, sports, formal education, vocational training, psychological and spiritual counseling, libraries, gardening, and a whole host of fulfilling activities.

Yet those murderers have killed may experience none of this, of course. Why should murderers get what their victims never can again? When do the families of victims get to resume their lives, put their grief aside, and attempt to recover from a loss that is unrecoverable? Who has the true life sentence?

We Must Uphold Life as Our Highest Moral Value

In a time of mass shootings, terror-driven beheadings, the slaughter of innocent children, and the senseless moral depravity of gang violence and human trafficking, the death penalty has an even greater role to play in the defense of human life. In a nation claiming to value both life and the rule of law, it becomes a moral necessity.

Human life is our highest moral value. It is precisely because we cherish human life that the state must sometimes end the lives of those who have wantonly ended it. In our commitment to justice, we must make the hard, sober, moral declaration that there are some crimes that cannot be forgiven, or repaid through imprisonment of whatever length. There are certain acts for which the only appropriate punishment is the ultimate penalty—the forfeiture of one’s life.

We take no pleasure in the solemn duty of carrying out capital punishment, nor should we make apologies for a civil society requiring retributive justice. But by punishing criminals appropriately and proportionally, as befits their crimes, we can honor the Lisa Marie Velasquezes of the world. As Elizabethan dramatist John Webster once wrote, “Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out.”

The Netherlands Shouldn’t Have Allowed Noa Pothoven To Kill Herself,"It’s the kind of thing you want to be a hoax. To a certain extent, it was. In a horrible game of “broken telephone,” it was widely reported that the Netherlands had allowed the assisted suicide of a physically healthy, 17-year-old girl suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In fact, Noa Pothoven did not die at the hands of her doctor, but at her own. She made her intentions clear to doctors, friends, family, and Instagram. Then she refused to take any food or water, and intentionally let go of her life.

Euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, and although Noa had expressed interest in receiving it, she was denied. Undeterred, however, she continued to seek to end her short life. Doctors did not intervene in her decision. Parents did not attempt to have her receive treatment and be force-fed. So Pothoven died in her home.

There are not enough adjectives to adequately describe how heartbreaking this is. Pothoven was a minor. Once doctors knew her intention to end her life, they had an obligation to save it. She documented some of her struggles on Instagram and had even written a book. Despite her mental state, and the trauma she had experienced, this was a young woman of amazing promise. Now we will never see how wonderfully that promise could have been fulfilled.

Doctors Should Preserve Life, Not End It

Pothoven was the victim of multiple rapes from different occasions. She badly desired to end her own life as a result of the pain and suffering caused by these heinous crimes.

In the Netherlands, the number of teens who take their own lives is on the rise. While fewer crimes are being committed overall in the Netherlands, there is an increase in sex crimes. Doctors are supposed to be in the business of saving a life, not destroying it. If all those who are raped or sexually victimized can opt for death, and doctors uphold their wishes, there will be femicide of horrendous proportions.

Life is a gift. It is fragile and beautiful, no matter how painful it can be at times. Lately, however, human beings seem ever more bent on destroying it.

Sadly, there will always be people who choose death over life if they believe the pain of living is too great. This will be the case no matter the state of culture. It is, however, disturbing and upsetting to find wealthy nations like the Netherlands that advocate for death and allow for physician-assisted suicide.

Western Society Must Place a Higher Value on Life

Suicide, whether at one’s own hands or with the assistance of another, is considered a viable and logical option in far too many nations now. There are circumstances in these cultures where opting for death is considered the acceptable, rational solution. When young people are immersed in that type of a life-denying culture, the jump some take from placing the highest value on life to devaluing it is shorter than in a culture that holds up life as sacred.

People took advantage of Pothoven in childhood. They made her feel that life was not worth living. She went on to write a book, and still came up with the idea that it wasn’t worth carrying on. Noa struggled with eating disorders and depression, and was constantly told by the culture she grew up in that the decision to end one’s own life was an ethical, personal choice.

Yet the taking of human life should not be treated cavalierly, even in the slightest. There is something worthwhile in believing life to be a sacred gift and evidence of a great love that should not be willingly destroyed.

The Netherlands does not have capital punishment. It is a culture that does not believe in state-sanctioned murder even for the most violent offenders, and one can make the argument that that is a civilized perspective to hold. So there is a bizarre dissonance in the fact that the Netherlands believes that not intervening in the stated, intentional suicide of a totally innocent person is okay.

We Are a Culture of Death

What happened to Pothoven cannot definitionally be called euthanasia because it was essentially a slow-motion suicide, performed with the passive acquiescence of her caregivers. So many questions have been raised about these circumstances. There is now a growing debate over whether watching a person kill herself is euthanasia, or if this kind of suicide, without medical intervention, would be allowable in the United States.

Countless news outlets around the world picked up the story incorrectly and ran with it, not reaching out to Dutch journalists, until Politico Europe reporter Naomi O’Leary set the record straight. That this happened is concerning, but not the fundamental issue. People have also wanted to know who Pothoven’s rapists are, and what kind of punishment they have received for their crimes. Those are all valid questions, but they are not the crux of the matter.

The substance of this case, and why it captured the imaginations of so many, is that we are living in a culture of death. What happened to Pothoven is exactly what those who advocate for life feared when euthanasia became acceptable, legal practice. They rightly feared that not only would those who have terminal illnesses be allowed to end their lives with full government and cultural support, but that those who suffer from mental illness, debilitating depression, or PTSD would have medical and legal rights to suicide as well.

What do we think of life when a healthy young girl believes, in her suffering, that best way forward is not going forward at all? What does it say about our value of life when a decision like Noa’s gets approval through the non-interference of doctors, parents, and government? Is there any life that’s worth living?

Life Is Worth Cherishing, Not Throwing Away

At 17 we think we know what life is really like. As we grow up, we realize that life wasn’t what we expected it to be at all. The emotional intensity of youth changes into something more like acceptance or even a sense of peace with the trauma we’ve suffered.

Enduring adolescence is difficult enough without government legitimizing suicide. Pothoven had sought suicide before, and she not the only youth to do so. But, unlike the rest of us, she will never have the chance to rejoice in the reality that lives can be made whole again. Hope, peace, and beauty always have the chance to arise out of our past sorrows.

Life is full of obstacles. But for every person who suffers abuse and deems her mistreatment a reasonable reason to end things, there will be many who find lesser reasons to toss in the towel. But we only get one life to live. We must place the highest possible value on life because it is a positive factor. It perpetuates itself, leading to more life.

There is no value to death. Death is not a step in the human journey, it is the ceasing of the journey. There is nothing to weigh when comparing death against life. Life is existence, consciousness, understanding, and humanity. Death is the absence of all those things. It cannot be to each of us to make the choice when we die; suicide is never an acceptable alternative to life.

If Pothoven had taken her own life behind closed doors, it would have been tragic enough. But it is more heartbreaking that what took place was, at least on a level of non-interference, acceptable in the eyes of those who ought to claim to be her protectors.

As humanity becomes more affluent, as we solve more of our problems, we are turning a cold eye on ourselves. We have come to think we are a flaw, aberration or splinter that must be plucked out. We are not. We don’t need our self-loathing or our pity, we need our own love.

"Thomas Sowell Talks About Discrimination, Race, And Social Justice","A newly updated version of Thomas Sowell’s book, “Discrimination and Disparities,” came out this spring. The author and famed economist sat down with writer David Hogberg to talk about it and his life’s work.

David Hogberg: I want to read to you something that a currently very popular actress by the name of Brie Larson said at a recent awards show. She stated that, “USC Annenberg’s Inclusiveness Initiative released findings that 67 percent of the top critics reviewing the 100 highest grossing movies in 2017 were white males. Less than a quarter were white women and less than 10 percent were unrepresented men. Only 2.5 percent of those top critics were women of color. Now you’re probably thinking right now that … doesn’t represent the country I live in. And that’s true. This is a huge disconnect from the U.S. population breakdown of 30 percent white men, 30 percent white women, 20 percent men of color, and 20 percent women of color. So, why does that matter? … If you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color, there is an insanely low chance a woman of color will be able to see your movie and review your movie … We need to be conscious of our bias and do our part to make sure that everyone is in the room.”

That’s an example of the main fallacy that you expose in your book, correct?

Thomas Sowell: It’s one of the many fallacies. My God! We could play the same game with basketball and get even greater skewed representation. Blacks are the vast majority of basketball players in the NBA. That quote is downright silly.

What’s become so frustrating to me over the years is people who assume that if people or events are not evenly represented, then that’s some deviation from the norm. But you can read through reams of what scholars have written and find that nowhere is this norm to be found. You can read people like Gradell and others who have studied internationally various cultural events, and they say again and again that nowhere do they find a distribution of people who is representative of the population of the larger society.

So [people like Larson] are taking something that no one can find and making it a norm, the deviations from which should cause the government to intervene to correct this supposedly rare thing.

Hogberg: What is the “Invincible Fallacy”?

Sowell: It’s what been illustrated by the example you mentioned. It’s the belief that people would be, in the normal course of events, proportionally represented in various endeavors in the way they are represented in the general population. And if that doesn’t happen it must be some kind of negative factor like either genetics or discrimination that is causing the deviation.

What’s frustrating is that I can come up with 100 examples to the contrary, but the people who believe in the fallacy do not have to produce even one example—not one speck of evidence from anywhere in the world over thousands of years of human history that what they are asserting is the norm has ever, in fact, happened.

For example, there is a book called “Why Nations Fail” that asks, why are there such economic disparities among nations? It compared the U.S. to Egypt and asked, why has Egypt failed? The authors wrote as though what happens in the U.S. is the norm. When, if anything, what happens in Egypt is closer to a norm. In any case, they are assuming that there is this natural tendency among nations that has somehow been thwarted in Egypt and therefore we must do something about that.

Hogberg: If you were to make a list of the causes of disparities with the most important causes being at the top of the list and the least important toward the bottom, where would discrimination be?

Sowell: I wouldn’t even attempt to rank them since there are so many causes. Just one that I mention in the first chapter of the book is being the first-born child in a family. First-born children tend to have higher IQs than their siblings. They are generally more successful in all sorts of endeavors, they tend to have higher incomes—you can run through the list. There are so many reasons for disparities that to single out one reason a priori is almost madness.

Hogberg: So what impact does discrimination have?

Sowell: It can have some negative effect. But that is the whole point. When you say A has a certain effect on B, it does not mean that every time you see B you can infer A. One example wholly away from economics or politics is that some children are years late, later than most children, in beginning to talk. Some of them have very severe mental retardation. Because there are many reasons that some children begin talking late does not mean that we can say that mental retardation has nothing to do with it. But there are other children who talked late and grew up to be intelligent and in some cases geniuses like Albert Einstein.

I didn’t write a book that says discrimination has no effect. There’d be no point in my writing a whole chapter on discrimination in the book if discrimination had no effect. I did write this book to say that disparities arise from all kinds of factors.

Hogberg: Is it possible for people to face severe discrimination and still prosper?

Sowell: Yes. The Jews are a classic example. So are the overseas Chinese. Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. You could run through a long list of them.

Hogberg: How important is geography in affecting outcomes?

Sowell: Huge. Just one of the reasons it is important is the enormous difference in the cost of land transport versus water transport. One example I note in the book is that in the days of the Roman Empire you could ship cargo the length of the Mediterranean Sea, more than 2,000 miles, at a cost less than the cost of carting that same cargo 75 miles inland. So, if you lived 75 miles inland, you had nothing like the prosperity that you had on the coast.

And while modern transportation has eased some of that cost, it has by no means eliminated it. So even now, if you are born up in the mountains and someone else is born in the river valley, then the odds are huge against you of ever being as prosperous as that person born near the river.

Hogberg: Before I move on from our discussion of the Invincible Fallacy, I want to briefly talk about genetic determinism. Today, the idea that difference between races is due solely to genetics is pretty much limited to the political fringes in the U.S. But 100 years ago it was huge among the intelligentsia, correct?

Sowell: Absolutely. For example, John Maynard Keynes set up the first eugenics society at Cambridge. And there were many others—Madison Grant, Woodrow Wilson, Harold Laski, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells. In fact, just recently I was looking back over R.H. Tawney’s 1931 book “Equality.” He’s this great egalitarian who says in passing that there is proof of the genetic inferiority of certain peoples.

Hogberg: Now, regarding the practice of discrimination, in your book you note that even if, say, employers are racist and they want to discriminate in their hiring practices, there are often powerful forces that may prevent them from doing so. Can you explain?

Sowell: It depends on the context. If, for example, it is an industry operating in a labor market in which there is a chronic surplus of qualified job applicants, then it costs the employer nothing to turn away qualified applicants from groups he doesn’t like and instead hire people from groups he does like that are still qualified.

But you seldom have that in a free market because wages adjust over time. You may have temporary surpluses or shortages, but those things tend to self-correct. It is when you have something like the minimum wage law, where you raise the wage rate above where it would be in a free market. Therefore, you increase the amount of workers available to the industry but you reduce the quantity of workers that employers demand because labor is now more expensive. And so you create a chronic surplus of labor.

I go into detail about the minimum wage in the book. And what is fascinating to me is to look back to 1948, when, for all practical purposes, the minimum wage law didn’t apply because inflation had made all wages above what was specified in the law. At that time not only was unemployment as a whole a fraction of what it is today, there was no difference between the unemployment rate of black teenagers and white teenagers. Today that seems almost impossible to believe.

It’s only later on, when politicians started increasing the minimum wage to keep up with inflation and so on, that’s when the total unemployment of teenagers in general became some multiple of what it was in 1948. And that’s when a gap opened up between the unemployment rate of black teenagers and white teenagers.

So, the increase in unemployment among black teenagers was not due to racism, which was at least as great in 1948 as it is today. Rather, the cost of discrimination to the discriminator had changed. You lowered the cost of discrimination. As you would expect, you lower the cost and more is demanded.

Hogberg: There were even costs to discrimination in South Africa, correct?

Sowell: Even in South Africa. That was the classic case. And I use that example in the book instead of getting bogged down in these questions about how much racism exists and so forth. I deliberately picked the country where there is no question at all about the racism of the people in control of the country. Which is to say that the whites had openly proclaimed white supremacy. And yet in South Africa, there were occupations where the black workers outnumbered the white workers even though it was illegal to hire any black workers in that occupation. And this was not due to the white employers having different social views. Rather, the cost to them of not hiring blacks was just too high.

If I may, just the other day I came across an article about how employers setting up new factories in the United States have been deliberately locating those factories away from concentrations of black populations because they find it costlier to hire blacks than to hire whites with the same qualifications. The reason is that the way civil rights laws are interpreted, it is so easy to start a discrimination lawsuit which can go on for years and cost millions of dollars regardless of the outcome.

It makes no sense from a business standpoint to hire a black worker if a white worker can be hired with the same qualifications who can’t start a lawsuit. So what this suggests is that when you give some people special rights, those special rights have special costs, not only to other people but to the people with special rights.

Hogberg: Related to discrimination, you have a section where you note that Harlem, which was predominately white in the early 20th century, was less hostile toward blacks when it came to providing housing that blacks could afford than San Francisco is today. Please explain.

Sowell: The landlords of Harlem weren’t less hostile toward blacks, they were more hostile. The realtors and building owners were assuring the white tenants that they were not going to let any blacks move into Harlem and, thus, there was no reason for their tenants to leave. Well, as it turned out that was a bad prediction. And my point is the reason it failed was the cost to the discriminators.

Now, if every single realtor in Harlem had stood firm on not letting blacks into Harlem, then Harlem might not be black today. But even racists, who prefer one race to another by definition, tend to prefer themselves most of all. So if a landlord has a building where he is having trouble finding tenants at the prices he wants to charge, but he can find blacks willing to pay those prices, then he is not going to pass up that money. Most people would not. And once that process starts, it becomes costlier and costlier for the holdouts among landlords and realtors to continue holding out.

Now, in San Francisco, they have restricted the supply of housing by restricting the building of housing. And there is no cost—people who already own houses or apartment buildings can easily vote to restrict the building of more housing. That causes the price of existing housing to go up. So, by 2005, the number of blacks living in San Francisco was less than half of what it had been in 1970 even though the total population of the city had increased. And that’s because more and more blacks were priced out of the housing market and forced economically to leave San Francisco.

So I doubt there was anywhere near the amount of hostility toward blacks in San Francisco in the late 20th century as there was toward blacks in Harlem one hundred years earlier. But where the cost of discrimination was low, people discriminated and where it was high they had to give it up.

Hogberg: Let’s talk about crime. You write, “Statistics cited in support of claims that the police target blacks usually go no farther than showing that the proportion of black people arrested greatly exceeds the roughly 13 percent of the American population who are black.” Why is that charge misleading?

Sowell: It’s misleading because what is relevant is not the percentage of people in a population but the percentage of people who are doing a given thing, in this case committing crimes. As long as there has been data collected, the homicide rate among blacks has been some multiple of the homicide rate among whites. Among blacks and whites, murderers tend to kill people among their own race. It’s the one area where segregation still reigns. And so, therefore, the relevant comparisons are the number of black homicide victims as compared to white victims and the number of blacks arrested for homicide as compared to whites.

The media have this thing where they do not mention the race of people who commit a crime but they do mention the race of people who are punished for committing a crime. Well, just from that one inconsistency you can generate a whole range of outrageous rhetoric about how the cops are targeting blacks.

There have been studies, for example, of people who are speeding on the highway, and they show that blacks speed more than whites. Therefore, it is not at all surprising if the cops pull over more black motorists than white motorists. So the whole argument that cops are discriminating against blacks falls apart when you put facts into the equation. Unfortunately, there are lots of people who have great incentive to avoid putting facts into the equation.

Hogberg: In other books you talk about what you call the “cracker culture” among blacks. What is that, and how much does that have to do with the higher crime rates in black areas in the U.S.?

Sowell: It’s many things. It’s a culture that is far more violent. It is far less oriented around education or entrepreneurship. It puts far less emphasis on human capital. Andrew Carnegie once went down to Birmingham and saw iron ore and coal located very close to each other. He wondered why someone hadn’t thought to build a steel mill there. The transportation costs of bringing the coal and iron ore together would be relatively cheap.

But, of course, the people in Alabama were not the same as Andrew Carnegie. And even years later when they did develop a steel industry in the South, the more complicated things that had to been done with steel were still being done in Pittsburgh and Gary, Indiana and other places in the North because they did not have the same skills in the South.

Now, the white population in the American South has had a higher violent crime rate than the white population of the rest of the country. Nor is this unusual. The murder rates in Eastern Europe have for centuries been some multiple of the murder rates in Western Europe. Like so many things that should theoretically be equal, they’re not, and they never have been.

Now, of course, over 90 percent of blacks in the U.S. came out of the South at some point in history. And so it’s not surprising that they bring many of the same cultural attitudes of Southern Whites to the North, East and wherever else they settle.

There is a whole history behind these things. But whatever the history, these groups were culturally different whether they were black or white or whatever.

Hogberg: You have a section on merit versus productivity, and you discuss the difficulties in judging merit in the sense of moral worth. Can you talk about that?

Sowell: Merit is the extent to which outcomes are due to the virtues of the particular individual compared to those circumstances the individual was born into or encountered in the larger world. I find it hard to believe that anyone specifically thinks that he can separate those things out in order to tell who is meritorious. Perhaps a mass murderer would have turned out to be a humanitarian under some other conditions, but we don’t know what those other conditions would be, and we certainly don’t know how to change him from a mass murderer into a humanitarian. And so we have to deal with things as they are.

What we can judge is productivity. We do know that someone will, say, produce a certain amount of a product per hour, while someone else will produce a lot more and someone else will produce a lot less. One of the problems of the political left is that they come up with things that they want to do, but pay very little attention to the key question of can you actually do those things? For example, wealth redistribution.

Those on the political left have no question in their minds that they can determine which rich people are unworthy and thus it is justifiable to confiscate wealth from them, and which poor people are worthy and should be given that wealth. One of the key problems for such schemes is that the source of wealth is human capital—the skills and knowledge about how to generate wealth.

Human capital is inside people’s heads and it can’t be confiscated. You can confiscate money and wealth and all the tangible things that you want to, but those things wear out over time. And unless you have someone there who can generate some more, you are worse off than before.

There are countries that have gone through that process and I mention some of them in the book. Some group in a country is prospering wonderfully and then a political leader says, well they have too much, we’ll take it from them. In some cases, they expel that group and in other cases, those people flee to a different country because they are tired of people taking their wealth.

Hogberg: Let me pose a related question. In Washington, D.C., there is the Trump International Hotel, owned by Donald Trump. People who stay there are certainly lining Donald Trump’s pockets. Now, Trump is certainly not a paragon of virtue. He has not been faithful to his wives for example, and he has at one time or another associated himself with vile people like Roy Cohn. What would you say to people who say it is immoral to book a room at Trump International Hotel?

Sowell: Is it immoral to buy a Volkswagen because Hitler was one of those promoting the Volkswagen? I mean, the Trump Hotel notion is silly beyond words. Perhaps there should be a moral surcharge based on the background of Hilton or some other hotel founder before we book a room at any of them? Again, that is asking people to do something we are not equipped to do.

Hogberg: Toward the end of the book you talk about what we can learn by examining the causes of disparities among different groups, and you write, “We can learn how dangerous it is, to a whole society, to incessantly depict outcome differences as evidence or proof of malevolent actions that need to be counter-attacked or avenged.” Why is that dangerous?

Sowell: I think we’ve seen a good illustration of why it is dangerous based on what has happened in the U.S. and Britain since the 1960s. Back then, one of the big preoccupations was with countering the fact that some people had more than other people. What the political left sets out to do is one thing; what they’ve actually done is quite another.

The left has polarized whole societies. They have set the sexes against each other, the races against each other, the classes against each other. They have delegitimized moral principles, they have delegitimized law and order, and the consequences can be seen almost daily. For example, the homicide rate among black males fell by 18 percent in the 1940s and by 22 percent in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it rose by dozens of percentage points—I don’t recall the exact number. [The homicide rate among black males per 100,000 population rose about 83 percent from 1960 to 1970—Ed.]

Steven Pinker’s book on violence internationally shows that this trend in homicide rates is something that happened across the Western world at the same time. There were declines in homicide rates until 1960, and then in the 1960s homicide rates did a U-turn. They shot up to levels that hadn’t been seen since the 19th century. It was quite a coincidence. Indeed, there were many such “coincidences” of trends that were getting better and then suddenly turned around and started getting worse in the 1960s.

Now the academics who study the history of that era aren’t likely to see it since they are often too busy celebrating the 1960s. Thus, the bad ideas and their consequence are not the sorts of things academics are going to put into their books.

Hogberg: What changed in the 1960s that caused all of that?

Sowell: It is what I call the “Social Justice” vision. That is, if there are disparities, it proves that somebody was wronged by somebody else. It’s one of those things that you don’t need one speck of evidence for. It sounds so good that many people will easily buy into it.

And many people around the world have paid with their lives for that vision. Especially in communist countries where communists came to power to supposedly correct such disparities. And once the communists are in power they create problems that make the problems that came before seem like nothing.

But that’s true of the left in general. They judge their actions by the wonderful things they are trying to do and are often oblivious to the actual harm they visibly doing to society.

Hogberg: Related to that, did you follow the controversy surrounding the actor Jussie Smollett? And what impact do hate-crime hoaxes have on fomenting racial hatred?

Sowell: I’ve tried not to, but it is hard to escape. The impact certainly isn’t good. What’s amazing is how impervious some people are to evidence that the charges are hoaxes. I think back to the Duke-Lacrosse case, where people were just hell-bent on believing that this terrible crime had been committed. And counter evidence didn’t stop the prosecution or the public. Some people, activists especially, are primed to believe certain things and when they see an opportunity they run with it, facts be damned.

Hogberg: We have an epidemic of hate crime hoaxes in the nation, going back at least ten years. Do you think that has a lot to do with the social justice vision?

Sowell: Yes. Especially given that these claims are so readily believed and rewarded. You can turn in the grievances for benefits just like they were airline miles.

Hogberg: And what makes it even worse is that Smollett got off with a slap on the wrist, apparently because he is connected to someone close to former President Obama.

Sowell: Yes. And that’s one of the deadly costs of all this stuff. You eventually erode the faith people have in the law. And once people no longer have faith in the law, you cannot hire enough police officers to maintain law. When the lawbreakers are a small group, the cops can keep that under control. But once the idea that the law is just a racket becomes pervasive then society is in a very dangerous situation.

Hogberg: You write that our society has a taboo “against discussing anything that might be considered negative in the individual behavior or social culture of lagging groups” and that is “counterproductive.” Why is that taboo counter-productive?

Sowell: It is counterproductive because human beings of every conceivable background are so imperfect that to exempt anybody from criticism is not a benefit but a curse. Think of the proverbial mother who dotes on her child and makes excuses for everything he does wrong. That child is going to have some hard time in our society. The reason is that not everybody is going to be making up excuses for him. And he could even end up behind bars for a long time because he didn’t realize that people other than his mother wouldn’t make excuses for him.

Hogberg: Finally, you’ve now released a revised edition of “Discrimination and Disparities,” a book that challenges this widely held notion that most if not all disparities are due to discrimination such as racism and sexism. And yet, outside of conservative media, this book doesn’t seem to be getting any attention. Why is that?

Sowell: I think back to a time when my books were reviewed not only by The New York Times but also the New York Review of Books. These days that doesn’t happen. I can’t say definitively, but I think people find that their best strategy is to pretend my books don’t exist if they can’t answer the arguments in them. And it’s not just with my writing but also other writers who challenge the prevailing vision. Their books are not going to get reviewed because the reviewers who believe in the prevailing vision don’t have a very effective answer to that challenge.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/an-interview-with-thomas-sowell-on-discrimination-race-and-social-justice/,2019-06-13
"No, Mike Pence Shouldn’t Go To Prison For Not Flying Rainbow Flags","This week, news broke that U.S. embassies would not fly rainbow-colored flags during “LGBT Pride Month.” Estimates indicate that up to 20 Americans waited with bated breath to hear what Hollywood celebrities had to say in response. Sarah Silverman, a comedian freshly relieved of her canceled-after-one-season Hulu comedy series, gathered her thoughts together and typed out a measured, even-keeled tweet to Vice President Mike Pence.

Dear @VP you are a hate mongering, fear based weasel & your biggest irony is that if there was hell, you’d 100% be going there. I hope you go 2 prison 4 crimes against humanity re: the lgbt community, women’s rights & the babies u rip from the arms of parents seeking our help https://t.co/MDD9p9UuFm — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) June 11, 2019

Yes. According to supposed funny person Sarah Silverman, because the vice president approves the White House’s decision not to fly rainbow flags over American embassies, he should go to jail. The charge? Well, obviously “crimes against humanity.”

First off, a refresher on the actual term involved here. It’s doubtful that Silverman is very concerned with a traditional concept like “the law,” but what the heck, let’s dive in anyway.

“Crimes against humanity” is an international law concept that a) has no relevant force in U.S. law, b) has never been officially codified by the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, or at any other similar convention, and c) typically implies utterly atrocious actions—such as genocide.

For example, the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal, established to oversee the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi officials after World War II, has defined “crimes against humanity” as:

murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population . . . or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.

Complicating things further, the nearly dozen international agreements that have delineated “crimes against humanity” all disagree on the definition. All of this discussion is, of course, absurd in the first place. In no rational world does restricting U.S. embassy flagpoles to American flags equate to the wanton extermination or enslavement of entire peoples.

Nothing in the administration’s decision to deny the flying of the rainbow flag even approaches the level of “discrimination” or “repression.” Why? Every other flag or every other nation has to follow the same rules.

If an employee at a U.S. embassy in Bermuda has a deep and abiding love for the Olympics, he doesn’t get to hoist up the Olympic flag to show his love. A U.S. embassy official in Qatar doesn’t have the right to raise the Canadian maple leaf during the NBA finals to signal her undying Toronto Raptors fandom. American embassies are for American flags. Period.

There’s also bizarre hypocrisy at the end Silverman’s tweet where she angrily denounces Pence for ripping babies “from the arms of parents” (apparently referring to the crisis at the border). This call-out is coming from someone who has described unborn babies as “goo,” praised women who “shout their abortions,” has said that pro-life laws make her want to “eat an aborted fetus,” and joked about getting—and this is her spelling—a “quikie aborsh” in the event that Roe v. Wade was overturned. It’s beyond tone deaf to castigate Pence for “ripping babies away from families” while you’re in favor of abortion-on-demand.

If we’re going to discuss crimes against humanity, at the top of the list should undoubtedly be the more than 60,000,000 unborn children murdered in the United States since 1973. Yes, perhaps Silverman should tone down her “babies u rip” outrage.

The same leftist celebrities who applaud the burning of American flags, disparage Republican presidents overseas, and mock patriotic citizens, are so unhinged with anger towards the Trump administration that they scream “crimes against humanity!” at the drop of a hat. Only Hollywood elites are so woefully out-of-touch.

Why ‘Law And Order: Hate Crimes Unit’ Is The Show America Needs,"The highly anticipated Netflix original “Law and Order: Hate Crimes Unit” mini-season has finally dropped, and there is a lot to talk about.

The fidelity to the look and feel of the original franchise is impressive. Several scenes take place in the same Lower East Side location used in thousands of “Law and Order” episodes, making it feel like home. The choice of Sarah Silverman and Kumail Kanjiani as officers Brownstein and Patel to lead the show tells audiences immediately: This isn’t your father’s “Law and Order.”

Episode three of the five-episode mini-season, “Take Off, Eh?” is the most compelling and controversial. It is almost as if it was conceived of first and then minted as the series’ keystone. In it we find an embattled Canadian professor at Hudson University, loosely based on Jordan Peterson, accused of the murder of a transgender activist.

As the plot plays out, we find that the activist actually died of an accidental overdose, but is the character, Fordham Jeterson, aptly played by Rick Moranis, guilty of driving this poor trans activist to xir own death? As Brownstein puts it after ordering a hot dog at a typical New York stand, and having Patel decline an offer for her to buy him one because they give him gas, “Is it a pronoun? Or is it a gun?”

Episode one, “Swastikas and Corned Beef,” is a nice introduction to the characters, and it expresses the vital need we all have for the stories this series tells. In the wee hours of the morning, the night after Saint Patrick’s Day, some Irish hooligans in MAGA hats appear to spray-paint a swastika on the famous “Katzenberg Deli.”

As it turns out, the video did show them in the vicinity, but did not show the act of racist vandalism. By the end we learn that Yankel Katzenberg manufactured the anti-Semitic incident to drum up business. But thankfully one of the Irish thugs was arrested as a result of the investigation for having failed to appear at jury duty, and did 25 days at Rikers. Justice prevailed.

The only real disappointment in the series is episode two, “Is He Too White?” It is revanchist melancholia purporting to suggest that racism is possible against white people. It opens with a white guy, played by a seemingly bored Giovanni Ribisi, being doused with acid as he uploads a blog post on the free Wi-Fi at Starbucks. The attack was a result of a post he put up that suggested the United States is possibly, but maybe not, the greatest threat to the world. He even went so far as to say Sharia law might be bad.

His attackers are not convicted. One hopes this is a condemnation of a system that would regularly allow such a thing. But that isn’t made clear. Patel’s quip that ends the episode — “Take that, American greatness” — is hopeful, but far from the conclusive statement one would wish for. The show should have done better. It was not the expression of allyship the current moment demands.

The final two episode installment, “That’s Not Funny,” is perhaps the best and deepest look at fat shaming that American entertainment has yet produced. Throughout the series, Manhattan District Attorney Tad Jefferson White, menacingly played by David Spade, represents the racist patriarchy scoffing at the real violence hate speech causes. Well, now his chickens come home to roost.

After losing a case and getting drunk in a midscale, midtown Irish bar where lawyers drink martinis, White tweets out that the female judge in the case is “a cow who should lay off the fried chicken and chocolate cake.” Obviously, the closeted gay White wakes up hung over the next morning with Brownstein and Patel at his door.

Was his tweet a crime? Is this the only time he has engaged in dangerous fat shaming? Are his ratio and the 20 notifications every ten minutes that make his Twitter account unusable really sufficient punishment? As always, “Law and Order” is dealing with the issues Americans face daily.

This groundbreaking new show is as much a delight as an indictment of the horrors of Trump’s America. One feels after watching it like one has really done something, really helped the world be better. We can only look forward to what trespasses and transgressions will be exposed in season two.

"Crime, Policing, And Where The 2020 Candidates Stand On Criminal Justice Reform","SUBSCRIBE TO THE FEDERALIST RADIO HOUR HERE.

Rafael Mangual is a fellow and deputy director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute, and he joins this episode of the Federalist Radio Hour to discuss criminal justice reform, broken window policing, and 2020 democratic platforms on crime. Mangual makes the case that VP Joe Biden should be proud of his role in shaping the 1994 crime bill, and that perhaps Sen. Kamala Harris harsh record as a prosecutor comes from the things her constituency wanted enforced.

“Black men may be six times more likely than white men to end up in prison, that’s true. But the homicide victimization rate for black men was also six times higher than that of whites,” he said. “There is a reason that 16 of the 19 members of the Congressional Black Caucus supported the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986…they were tired of their communities being the center of these blood baths.”

The Media Needs To Stop Hiding The Truth About Illegal Immigrant Crime,"A man in a Texan prison, already charged with murdering an 81-year-old woman, was charged in May with murdering 11 more elderly women ranging in age from 76 to 94. The accused serial killer, Billy Chemirmir, worked in home health care and allegedly posed as a maintenance worker to gain access to his victims’ homes.

Chemirmir is accused of smothering his victims with a pillow, then stealing their jewelry and other valuables. Dallas police are now reevaluating 750 other cases in which elderly people died alone, to determine if Chemirmir may have been involved.

This awful story should have been big national news. It wasn’t. Chemirmir is a Kenyan citizen living illegally in the United States and hadn’t been deported despite two prior jail stints for driving while intoxicated convictions, plus another for assaulting a girlfriend.

Because Chemirmir used pillows, not guns, to kill his victims, his crimes presented no opportunity for gun-control advocates to manipulate the story. To be blunt, his race (black), legal status (illegal), and murder weapon (pillows) were all factors that ensured that this story wouldn’t receive the attention it would have if these factors were otherwise.

CNN, USA Today, MSNBC, NPR, The Daily Beast, BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, and many other news outlets ignored the story. NBC News referred to Chemirmir as a “Texas man” and made no mention of his illegal status. The Washington Post didn’t mention his immigration status until around the 20th paragraph of their article on it.

CBS reported on the story a year ago but didn’t mention that he was illegally present, and hasn’t covered it since. ABC News failed to identify Chemirmir as an illegal alien, and only briefly mentioned as an aside near the end of their story that he “also has an immigration hold against him.”

Elites often repeat the talking point that immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans. In truth, however, most states don’t keep comparative crime statistics. Regardless of the statistical breakdown, media outlets purposely ignore stories that upend their preferred immigrants-as-choirboys narrative.

The same news outlets that ignored the Chermirmir story also ignored the tragic case of Ariana Funes-Diaz, a 14-year-old girl who was stripped naked, beaten with a baseball bat, then stabbed to death with a machete. Her assailants, a pair of teenage MS-13 gang members who had recently entered the country from El Salvador, threw her body in a creek.

One of Funes-Diaz’s accused murderers crossed into the United States in December 2015 with his family, who claimed asylum but didn’t show for their hearing. An immigration judge ordered his removal in March 2017. The other assailant was taken into custody as an unaccompanied minor in August 2016 but was later released to a family member.

A year ago, the pair were arrested on murder, armed robbery, and other charges in a separate case, but were never deported because Prince George is a sanctuary county that refuses to cooperate with federal officials in enforcing U.S. immigration laws. Just as with the Chemirmir case, most national media outlets ignored the story.

The Washington Post’s coverage initially minimized the immigration angle then later blamed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for scapegoating local officials. The Post quoted Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrant’s Rights Project, who said that ICE’s news release about the case was part of “the Trump administration’s efforts to essentially bully jurisdictions into becoming instruments of immigration enforcement.”

Given the horrific nature of this crime, that it was apparently committed by teens who shouldn’t have been in the country, and that the reporter reached out to the ACLU but not conservative organizations like the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) or The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) says a lot about the distorted lens through which the Post and other news outlets view immigration. They’re eager to cover stories about immigrants who became class valedictorians, but only begrudgingly cover immigrant serial killers, gang members, or other undesirables, if they cover them at all.

The media tiptoes around or outright ignores these stories primarily because they don’t fit their “immigrants-commit-fewer-crimes than Americans” narrative. Google also appears to keep immigrant crime out of the headlines. Googling “horrific crimes committed by illegal immigrants” or other similar search terms, and you’ll notice that most of the top results are bogus studies asserting that immigrants almost never commit serious crimes.

Yet readers don’t want editors to function as censors who withhold stories because they don’t advance their politics. A recent Knight Foundation and Gallup Poll found that 94 percent of Republicans and 75 percent of independents said they trust the media less now than they did a decade ago. As trust in the media has eroded, so too has the media’s trust in its readers. Readers have sensed that lack of respect and are increasingly retreating toward media that reflect their preexisting viewpoints.

Consumers of conservative-themed news outlets will know all about the Billy Chemirmirs of the world, just as devotees of liberal outlets can recite by heart every offensive statement Rep. Steve King has made. Each side becomes well-versed in their team’s talking points but rarely receives information that challenges their thinking.

The mainstream media should play a constructive role in bridging this polarization by simply presenting the news with equal treatment of facts that favor the left and the right, not censoring or sanitizing stories that may be offensive to some or inconvenient to others. Report the news and leave deciphering the narratives to us.

CA Bill To Put Men In Women's Prisons If They Say They're Transgender,"While it should be obvious that women’s prisons are for convicted criminals who are female, California Senate Bill 132, sponsored by state Sen. Scott Weiner (D–San Francisco), requires men who say they are women to be housed in women’s prisons.

The State Senate passed the bill in May, and it passed the state Assembly with very little opposition on June 25. The bill demands that the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ask prisoners their preferred pronouns and gender identity at intake, then house them accordingly. This means that a man need only say at intake that he is a woman to gain access to women’s prison. In passing this bill, California has turned its back on incarcerated women.

In describing the bill, the Legislative Council’s Digest states:

The bill would require staff and contractors to consistently use the gender pronoun and honorific an individual has specified in verbal and written communications with or regarding that individual that involve the use of a pronoun or honorific. The bill would require the department, for a person who has a gender identity that differs from their sex assigned at birth, to only conduct a search of that person by an officer of the gender identity of the person’s preference, and to house the person in a correctional facility designated for men or women consistent with the incarcerated individual’s gender identity, except as specified.

While the hearing before the California Assembly featured many groups in support of the bill, from queer-owned law firms and social workers to transgender prisoners, only two people spoke in opposition to the measure. This does not speak to how much opposition there is against a bill like this, but to how many people are willing to speak publicly against housing criminal transgender males with women.

The opposition spoke to the consistent and perpetual problem of male-on-female violence. They brought up the fact that many within the prison system are “bad actors” who will claim womanhood to gain access to women.

Lawsuits for Misgendering?

Because the legislation mandates that prison guards and officials use an inmate’s preferred pronouns unfailingly, there may be an expense associated with lawsuits of trans individuals suing guards and officials for “misgendering.” While men who wish to be women may opt to be housed in women’s prisons, no woman in her right mind—whether she lives as a man or not—would opt to be imprisoned with men.

There are no exceptions to make sure that men who have committed violent or sexual crimes against women are not placed in prison with women. The opposition advised that other nations that have undertaken this change in policy be looked at to see what lessons can be learned.

Bill supporters stated that trans women are women and ought to be housed with women. They are rightfully concerned that trans women are in danger in men’s prisons, but they hardly care about the risks of housing women with criminal men. When asked why it wouldn’t be better to have separate facilities for trans prisoners, those in support claimed that new facilities for transgender individuals would make transgender people “seem like aliens.”

Placing convicted rapists with women in prison is fine, bill supporters testified, because rapes already happen in women’s prisons—at the hands of prison guards. Apparently increasing rape risks to incarcerated women is just not that big of a deal so long as transgender men are validated in their delusion that they are women.

Impossible to Track Real Threats

Once transgender inmates are housed and classified by gender identity as opposed to biological sex, crimes they commit in prison are cataloged with the stats of the opposite sex. This will make it impossible to track how many male-to-female transgender inmates abuse their male-bodied privilege and assault, harass, or attack female prisoners. In practical terms, this would both skew the violent crime stats and make it that much harder for women inmates to differentiate their male attackers from the rest of the prison population.

Even so, there have been reports of male to female transgender inmates attacking women in women’s prison. Since living as a transgender person does not require an inmate to undergo body modification surgery (often euphemistically called gender-affirming surgery), men who are prone to commit violent and penetrative sex crimes against women will still have the necessary tools to do it.

Women are rightfully uneasy about being incarcerated with men, especially since so many women suffer violence at men’s hands. Are we supposed to believe that male offenders are super peaceful and kind and have no interest in harming women, despite the prevalence of violent crimes committed by men against women?

Other Countries Have Gone Down This Dangerous Road

Female prisoners in New Zealand have objected to housing male-bodied persons in women’s prisons. Upon her release from prison in Christchurch, a female inmate raised concerns about the placement of trans women in women’s prisons, citing the vulnerability of the women housed there. Prison staff called the complaint of sexual assault hearsay.

Canada made this change on a federal level in 2018. The first transgender inmate was moved from a men’s to women’s prison in 2017: Fallon Aubee is serving a life sentence for a contract killing, and came out as transgender after being brought into custody. Aubee fought for a decade for the switch, which opened the door to housing additional violent criminals with women.

Housed in a woman’s jail in British Columbia, Hayden Patterson will soon be extradited to the United States to be tried for a murder charge. Patterson asked to be placed in a woman’s prison but balked when told Patterson must consistently demonstrate female gender expression to remain in the women’s facility. Patterson was worried that not shaving would violate this condition.

In the U.K., convicted pedophile and rapist Karen White, a male-to-female transgender inmate, was housed in a women’s prison. After the extent of White’s crimes were made public, White was moved to a men’s prison, where White is undergoing surgery in order to move back to women’s prison. Already, rapists and child molesters have been housed with women.

In the United States, the Trump administration rolled back policies allowing male-bodied persons to be housed in women’s prisons. While transgender rights activists called this a violation of human rights, the move was made after female prisoners in Texas filed a lawsuit, saying that it was unlawful to imprison men with women.

Violent men who believe they are women and have committed violent crimes against women are dangerous. Transgender men who killed their girlfriends, such as Sora (née Jordan) Kuykendall, who after she broke up with him murdered his teen girlfriend, whom he had physically abused for years, should not be behind bars with women.

Statistically, men commit the majority of crimes against women. The World Health Organization estimates that 35 percent of women internationally have experienced sexual violence, most of it at the hands of intimate partners, and 38 percent of the murders of women are committed by male intimate partners. Women in prison who have perpetrated crimes have, in many cases, also been the victims of crimes. As they serve their debt to society, they should not be further victimized.

Dan Abrams is the chief legal affairs anchor for ABC News and host of “Live PD.” On this episode of the Federalist Radio Hour, host Ben Domenech and Abrams discuss how Americans learn more about our justice system from media coverage of high profile legal cases than coverage of politics.

“There is very little policy coverage. It’s all about the horserace,” Abrams said. “It is so hard to cover policy and it is so easy to cover politics, and I would argue that covering the criminal justice system is somewhere in between.”

They also discuss the future of cable news, our obsession with popular crime, and Abrams’ new book, “Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense: The Courtroom Battle to Save His Legacy.”

Here’s What Republicans Should Ask Robert Mueller When He Testifies,"When Democrats heard last week that Robert Mueller would testify before the House judiciary and oversight committees on July 17, they were as giddy as a 72-year-old Jerry Nadler waiting to question Hope Hicks. But unless committee Republicans botch the hearing—something entirely possible—the left’s strategy of placing Mueller center stage in their continued attempts to underdo the results of the 2016 presidential election will backfire bigly.

Why? For the simple reason that Mueller’s 400-plus page report presented the worst the special counsel could muster against Trump, so any new revelations will play to the president’s advantage.

So, what should Republicans do to make the most of Mueller’s appearance, both politically and from an oversight perspective? Two things: (1) Leave the political grandstanding to the Democrats and (2) Ask the right questions.

While it might be tempting for Republicans on the Hill to speechify on the left’s continuing witch hunt or condemn the Democrats for wasting the committee’s time on a political stunt, the members on the right side of the aisle would be better served by approaching the hearings seriously. Republican committee members should let Trump score political points via Twitter and resist the urge to pose the “Sir, are you incompetent, or a political hack?” questions they may feel the special counsel deserves. Instead, conservatives should use their limited time to hit five key themes.

Mueller Found No Russia Collusion

Foremost, Republicans should ensure Mueller repeats the conclusion of the special counsel report—that there was no collusion—and while stressing the nearly limitless resources available to his team. While the right may believe everyone already knows there was no collusion, the Democratic debate opener on Wednesday night had both the hosts and participants continuing to push the narrative, proving the populace needs to hear the truth from Mueller’s mouth.

Isn’t it true, sir, that your team included 19 lawyers and approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, and forensic accountants assisting in the investigation? Isn’t it true that over the course of nearly two years, your office issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, nearly 500 search warrants, more than 230 orders for the production of communications records, and obtained nearly 50 orders authorizing the use of pen registers?

Isn’t it true sir, that you made 13 evidence requests to foreign governments, interviewed at least 500 witnesses, and spent more than $30 million? Isn’t it true that your team reviewed approximately 1.4 million documents? Isn’t it true sir, that the special counsel office did not charge anyone connected with the Trump campaign with crimes related to collusion with Russia?

And isn’t it true sir that your nearly two-year investigation, run by 19 lawyers, about 40 FBI and other agents, that issued thousands of subpoenas and court orders, and reviewed 1.4 million documents, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, “did not establish that the [Trump] Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities?”

This final question quotes directly from Mueller’s report. Conservatives would be well-served to incorporate the former special counsel’s actual language in their questions, as opposed to directing Mueller to provide a dramatic reading of the report. That was the Democrats’ approach when drilling Hicks last week on all things Trump-related. Having Mueller (or any witness) read from the report merely highlights the redundancy of the testimony and the congressional waste of time at play. Leave that specter to the Democrats.

There Was No Obstruction of Justice

After putting to bed the collusion case, Republicans must counter the Democrats’ likely focus—Part 2 of the special counsel’s report, which ruminates on possible obstruction of justice. Here, conservative committee members should not get bogged down in the details because the law is complex and the facts are complicated.

Rather, Republicans should use their limited time to focus on six points: (1) there was no underlying crime to obstruct; (2) Trump knew there was no underlying crime, yet the press, with the aid of leakers, pushed the collusion story, affecting Trump’s governance; (3) the theories of obstruction are easily refuted; (4) Mueller failed to follow the special counsel regulations that required him to make a charging or declination decision; (5) the special counsel’s theory of criminal liability is debatable; and (6) Mueller inverted the standard governing prosecutorial decisions from a presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilty. These points the general populace can follow, without understanding the legal intricacies or the detailed and conflicting factual basis for Mueller’s theory.

First, as Mueller’s report made clear, there was no collusion and thus no crime to obstruct. And Trump knew this. These big-picture facts far outweigh the minutia Democrats will rely upon to create the impression that the president sought to obstruct justice. A controlled questioning of Mueller will convey this point to the public and a reasonable populace will “get” that it’s nonsensical to think that Trump would obstruct justice when there was no crime to hide.

Mr. Mueller, you were asked many questions about some of the facts in Part 2 of your report, but I would like to zoom out and ask you a few big-picture questions. Isn’t it true evidence indicated that “the President believed that the purpose of the Russia investigation was to delegitimize his presidency?” Isn’t it also true that “evidence indicates that the President believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealing with Russia?”

Sir, you also agreed in your earlier testimony, didn’t you, that the evidence “did not establish that the [Trump] Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities? So, an obstruction case would argue that the president attempted to obstruct justice when there was no underlying crime? And when the president knew there was no underlying crime?

At the same time, though, Republicans should not allow Democrats to present, unanswered, facts that create the false impression that Trump obstructed justice. But, again, the key is to dismantle the ten supposed instances of obstruction without engaging in a detailed regurgitating of Mueller’s findings.

Some additional quick questions will serve this purpose: The president was angry about media leaks that falsely portrayed his dealings with Russia, wasn’t he? And isn’t it true that the president told former FBI director James “Comey that the ‘cloud’ of ‘this Russia business’ was making it difficult to run the country?”

Isn’t it true that Comey refused to publicly state what he was telling Trump privately—that the president was not under investigation? Isn’t it true that Trump was angry at Comey for failing to lift the “cloud” of “this Russian business” by telling the American people that he was not under investigation?

And isn’t it true that as the head of the executive branch, Trump had the power to fire the FBI director at will? Isn’t it also true that the president had the power to fire Jeff Sessions at will?

While there may be additional “facts” to push back on the obstruction narrative, the Republicans on the committees should resist the urge to re-litigate the matter. Instead, conservatives should confront Mueller with the special counsel regulations to expose Mueller’s failure to abide by controlling law, while highlighting (through the language used in the questioning) the harsh criticism Attorney General William Barr leveled at Mueller for abdication of his prosecutorial role.

Conservatives should confront Mueller with the special counsel regulations to expose Mueller’s failure to abide by controlling law.

Are you familiar with the regulations governing the special counsel? And 28 C.F.R. CFR § 600.8(c), expressly provides “at the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel,” doesn’t it? And when the word “shall” is used in a statute or regulation, it is a command, isn’t it? It means “must?”

Yet, in Part 2 of the special counsel report, you did not make a “prosecution” decision, did you? And you did not make a “declination decision” did you? Would you agree, that the very prosecutorial function, and the power to convene grand juries, serves only one purpose, to determine, yes or no, whether the alleged conduct was criminal or non-criminal? Would you agree that a prosecutor’s function is not to collect information and throw it out to the public?

After you failed to provide the attorney general a prosecution or declination decision, your boss, in consultation with Rod Rosenstein, rendered a decision, though, didn’t he? And that decision was that “the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense?” And you understand that Rosenstein agreed with that decision, yes? Rosenstein appointed you special counsel, didn’t he?

Related questions should focus on the timing of Mueller’s decision not to decide the obstruction charge, and how long that investigation continued after Mueller determined there was no underlying offense. As Barr noted during congressional testimony, “the other thing that was confusing to me was that the investigation carried out for a while as additional episodes were looked into, episodes involving the president. So my question is or was ‘Why were those investigated if at the end of the day you weren’t going to reach a decision on them?’” Barr added that once Mueller “felt that he should not go down the path of making a traditional prosecutive decision, . . . that was the time to pull up.”

Mr. Mueller, when did you first realize it was unlikely that you would find evidence of collusion? When did you concluded there was no evidence of collusion? How long did you continue to investigation possible obstruction after you concluded there was insufficient evidence of collusion to recommend charges? When did you decide you would not make a prosecution or declination decision on obstruction?

Would you agree that a prosecutor’s function is not to collect information and throw it out to the public?

Yet, after you decide not to render a decision on obstruction, you continued to the special counsel investigation, correct? Are you aware sir, that Attorney General Barr stated that once you decided not to make a “prosecutive decision” “that was the time to pull up?” But you didn’t, did you?

And if the timing was such that Mueller had concluded there was no collusion prior to the 2018 mid-terms: Did it occur to you that, by not releasing the no-collusion conclusion, you played a role in affecting the 2018 midterm elections?

Next, Republicans should force Mueller to admit that there is a disagreement about the controlling obstruction of justice law. Here, they should ensure they do not lose the public in the weeds, or create the appearance that Trump escaped prosecution on a technicality. A few simple questions making this point is best.

Not everyone in the Justice Department agreed with your theory of criminal liability for obstruction of justice, did they?

Sir, not everyone in the Justice Department agreed with your theory of criminal liability for obstruction of justice, did they? Your theory is based on your interpretation of the statute and case law, isn’t it? And reasonable people could take issue with your analysis, couldn’t they? And in fact, the attorney general disagreed with your interpretation of the law, correct?

Finally, congressional Republicans should highlight how Mueller inverted the standard governing prosecutorial decisions. While the accused is entitled to a presumption of innocence, Mueller portended to be searching for evidence to prove Trump innocent.

Again, a series of simple questions will suffice to make this point: Isn’t it true, that in the American justice system, an accused is presumed innocent? And all Americans are entitled to the presumption of innocence, aren’t they? A prosecutor’s job is to determine whether evidence is sufficient to charge the accused with a crime, correct? A prosecutor is not charged with exonerating the accused, is he? A prosecutor is not charged with “conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred,” is he?

These points the general populace can follow, without understanding the legal intricacies or the detailed and conflicting factual basis for Mueller’s 200-pages of speculation on obstruction of justice.

Mueller Failed to Investigate Whether Russia Fed Steele Info to Affect the Election

After questioning Mueller on the points he did address in his report, the republicans should highlight what he did not address: “Not once in the 448-page tome does Mueller mention an investigation into whether Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election by feeding dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation.”

Shortly after Barr released the special counsel’s final report, I detailed the significance of this omission, explaining that Mueller maintained in his report that he was authorized to investigate “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” yet “the report is silent of efforts to investigate Russia role in feeding Steele misinformation.”

We know it was misinformation because Mueller found no evidence of collusion. That means either the Russians fed Steele false intel that the former MI6 spy then relayed to the FBI and DOJ, or Steele lied about his Russian sources or intel. But since Mueller did not refer Steele for prosecution for lying to the FBI, it seems safe to assume the special counsel team discovered Russia had played Steele.

Either the Russians fed Steele false intel that the former MI6 spy then relayed to the FBI and DOJ, or Steele lied about his Russian sources or intel.

This point should be another main focus for Republicans when Mueller heads to the hill next month. Again, controlled questioning is key.

Isn’t it true, sir, that, as you stated in the special counsel report, you were authorized to investigate “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election”? Isn’t it true that you concluded Russia sought to “interfere in the 2016 presidential election” through a social media campaign and computer-intrusion operations?

But your report never discusses whether Russia attempted to interfere in our election by feeding Christopher Steele false intel, does it? The memorandum Steele provided to the FBI and DOJ identified a variety of Russia and Vladimir Putin-connected sources for his “intel,” didn’t they?

Steele identified Source A as “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure,” correct? And Source B was supposedly “a former top-level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin?” Source C was identified by Steele as a “Senior Russian Financial Officer,” correct? And Source G was claimed to be “a Senior Kremlin official,” correct?

There were several other purported Russian sources, weren’t there? Your team would have looked at these claims to determine whether anyone connected to the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, right? But you conclude there was insufficient evidence of collusion, correct?

Feeding false intel about a presidential candidate to his opponent would qualify as interfering in an election, wouldn’t it?

Would you agree, then, that if Russia invented these so-called facts and fed them to Steele believing the information would make its way to U.S. intelligence sources, that would be a significant effort to interfere in our election? And if Steele lied about his Russian sources to the FBI, that would subject Steele to criminal liability, right?

Did you ever refer a criminal case against Steele? And your 400-plus page report does not mention any investigation into whether Russia interfered with our election by peddling this false information to Steele, does it? And feeding false intel about a presidential candidate to his opponent would qualify as interfering in an election, wouldn’t it? Such information could be more damaging than Russia’s social media efforts, couldn’t it?

Yet, you discussed Russia’s efforts to interfere in the election via social media in the report but you did not mention even once the possibility that Russia interfered in our election by peddling false intel to Steele, did you?

Republicans then need to stop. They should resist the temptation to force Mueller to explain the reason he ignored Russia’s much greater interference in our election. The point is clear and all Mueller will do if asked “why” he ignored the many Putin-connected plebes feeding Steele false intel is obfuscate. Conservatives shouldn’t give him the chance.

Mueller Omitted or Misrepresented Information in the Special Counsel Report

Next, Republicans on the House committees should highlight the misrepresentations in the Mueller report and the inexplicably missing information. Jeff Carlson identified several discrepancies in his article for The Epoch Times.

For example, the special counsel’s report selectively edited the transcript of a telephone message left by John Dowd, the personal attorney for the president, and the attorney for former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to create the impression Dowd was attempting to influence Flynn’s testimony.

The Mueller report excepted the message to read:

I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms. … [I]t wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with … the government. … [I]f … there’s information that implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue, … so, you know, . . . we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can …. [R]emember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains …

But Mueller’s team parsed Dowd’s message in the most damaging way possible to Trump. The fuller statement read:

I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms. If you have, and it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh, I understand that you can’t join the joint defense; so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don’t know some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the president, but for the country. So … uh … you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of … protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information. So, uhm, and if it’s the former, then, you know, remember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.

Mueller should be asked about this omission. Sir, in your special counsel report, you quote from a telephone message in which Dowd stated that “if there’s information that implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue, so, you know, we need some kinds of heads up.” But isn’t it true that your report omitted the full content of Dowd’s message? Isn’t it true Dowd said they needed to address the national security issue “not only for the president, but for the country?”

Isn’t it also true that in his phone message Dowd requested a heads up, only if Flynn’s attorneys could “without you having to give up any confidential information?” The special counsel report didn’t include those details, though, did it?

Republicans questioning Mueller should follow a similar tack with the other inconsistencies and omission identified by the press. (Hopefully their staff has discovered more). Other ripe areas include the special counsel’s discussion of communications between former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Giorgi Rtskhiladze. Mueller’s report branded Rtskhiladze a “Russian businessman,” but as a letter his lawyer sent to Barr stressed, Rtskhiladze was born in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia and has been a permanent resident of the United States for 23 years and a U.S. citizen since 2017.

In addition to this “mistake,” the Mueller report selectively edited texts between Rtskhiladze and Cohen, creating the impression that Rtskhiladze had buried tapes showing Trump misconduct. But as the full text exchanges made clear, and as Rtskhiladze told Mueller’s team, he did not know if any tapes even existed, nor who supposedly possessed any such tapes. Mueller should be forced to acknowledge these discrepancies for the record.

John Solomon at The Hill also exposed another Mueller misrepresentation. “In a key finding of the Mueller report,” Solomon explained, “Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, who worked for Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, is tied to Russian intelligence. But hundreds of pages of government documents—which special counsel Robert Mueller possessed since 2018—describe Kilimnik as a ‘sensitive’ intelligence source for the U.S. State Department who informed on Ukrainian and Russian matters.”

At The Federalist, Ben Weingarten noted several similar omissions from the special counsel’s report, starting with Carter Page: “In discussing Page’s background,” Weingarten wrote, “the Mueller report notes his contacts with Russian agents, who supposedly tried to recruit him as an asset, beginning in 2013. The report notes that those agents were charged by U.S. authorities in 2015. What the Mueller report omits is that Page effectively served as an FBI asset in helping the bureau make the case against at least one of the agents.”

Weingarten also showed Mueller’s manipulative discussion of Felix Sater’s connections to Russia:

The Mueller report describes Felix Sater as a ‘New York-based real estate advisor’ who worked with and lobbied disgraced former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen extensively in an effort to execute the Trump Tower Moscow project, touting its political benefits and the ability to garner support from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Not mentioned is Sater’s colorful background: The Soviet Union-born Sater spun a stock swindling conviction into a lengthy career as a major CIA, DIA, and FBI asset, participating in numerous critical operations.

While Mueller will likely refuse to answer specific questions concerning whether Kilimnik served as a “sensitive intelligence source,” Sater as a CIA, DIA, and FBI assets, and Page as an FBI informant, he can still be questioned on whether he would have included that information.

Throughout your report, sir, you highlight various individuals’ connections to Russia. Did your report also indicate whether any of those individuals had previously served as intelligence sources or informants for America or her allies? To your knowledge, did any of the individuals identified in your report as being connected to Russia also serve as intelligence sources, asset or informants for the United States?

If an individual connected to Russia had also served as an intelligence source, assets, or informant for our country, wouldn’t that negate the sinister implication their connections to Russia might otherwise suggest? Yet those facts were not included in your report, were they?

There is no mention of dossier-author Steele, or Stefan Halper, the spy who made contact with both Page and campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos.

There are yet more omissions and misrepresentations, as Weingarten explained. The special counsel’s report similarly skipped “critical information about Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.” Veselnitskaya was the Russian attorney involved in “the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower ‘bombshell’ turned dud meeting.”

While detailing that meeting, however, Mueller failed to “mention that Veselnitskaya (i) worked with Fusion GPS on behalf of Russian clients, and (ii) met with Simpson the morning of the Trump Tower meeting, as well as the night before and after it . . . Also unclear, and undisclosed, is why the Justice Department granted Veselnitskaya special entry to the United States multiple times in 2015 and 2016.”

Weingarten also highlighted the special counsel’s references to contacts between Roger Stone and Trump campaign advisor Michael Caputo “with a Russian citizen named Henry Oknyansky. Oknyansky and an associate supposedly came to Stone by way of Caputo seeking to sell ‘derogatory information’ on Hillary Clinton. Stone rebuffed them. Left unstated: Oknyansky, according to federal court filings and 14 visa waivers, has been an FBI informant for nearly two decades.”

Then there is the dearth of discussion of information—presumably highly relevant to investigating the supposed Russia collusion—that originated from Western intelligence sources, or individuals connected to Western intelligence agencies. There is no mention of dossier-author Steele (see above), or Stefan Halper, the spy who made contact with both Page and campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos.

Mueller’s report was also sparse in its coverage of Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, even though it was Mifsud’s supposed tip to Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails that purportedly launched the investigation into the Trump campaign. The special counsel’s report noted that Mifsud told FBI agents during a February 2017 interview that “he and Papadopoulos had discussed cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their conversation.”

Mueller’s team had no problem indicting other presumably unreachable Russians for interfering in our election. Why not Mifsud?

But according to Mueller, Mifsud “falsely claimed he did not meet with Papadopoulos after his initial introductory meeting” with a woman posing as Putin’s niece. Although the Mueller report noted that “emails, text messages and other documentation showed Mifsud and Papadopoulos did meet at least two other times, as Papadopoulos claimed,” the special counsel did not charge Mifsud for lying to agents, as they had Papadopoulos. And Mueller’s team had no problem indicting other presumably unreachable Russians for interfering in our election. Why not Mifsud?

There is also a conflict in the Mueller report concerning Papadopoulos’ meeting with Australian diplomat Alexander Downer. As Carlson detailed, “the Mueller report notes that ‘on May 6, 2016, 10 days after that meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.’”

But “publicly available information has always shown that Papadopoulos met with Downer on May 10th—and both Downer and the Australian government appear to stand by this date.” This conflict could be a press mistake, sloppiness on the part of the Mueller team, or suggest something more. Republicans should confirm the accuracy of the May 6, 2016 meeting date during Muller’s upcoming hearing.

Another area of concern? Mueller’s reliance on “the testimony of George Nader, who is mentioned more than 100 times in the Mueller report.” Carlson explained in The Epoch Times that Nader’s role involved arranging “a meeting between Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian national who heads Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, and Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, during the transition period following the 2016 presidential election.”

While the FBI succeeded in arresting Nader when he returned to the states, the failure to charge him earlier could have instead allowed a child predator to go free.

Then came Nader’s June 3, 2019 arrest on child pornography charges. As details emerged, it appeared that the FBI knew Nader had child pornography on his cell phones at the time he was cooperating with the special counsel team. Yet he was not indicted until after he had already left the country.

While the FBI succeeded in arresting Nader when he returned to the states, the failure to charge him earlier could have instead allowed a child predator to go free. Mueller should be quizzed on his knowledge of Nader’s offense and efforts agents took to ensure he did not flee the country.

After drilling Mueller on these misrepresentations and omissions, House Republicans should query him on what other aspects of his investigation he omitted from the report and the basis for his decision. In the report, Mueller acknowledged that “not all of the intelligence and counterintelligence information derived from the special counsel investigation was included in the report.” While that is understandable—the report by nature is a summary—it appears that Mueller’s demarcation line focused on the effect the evidence would have on Trump: harmful information was included, while exculpatory evidence was buried.

Sir, you note that not all information derived from your investigation was included in the report. Was there additional evidence indicating that Trump colluded with Russia? Which members of your team were involved in making the determination of whether to include the information in the report? And what standard did they use?

That last question is a gotcha because Mueller already stated that the report contains only the “information necessary to account for the Special Counsel’s prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation’s main factual results.” Once Mueller repeats this standard, House conservatives should pounce: Isn’t it true, sir, that Part 2 of the report ran more than 200 pages? And isn’t it true that you did not reach a “prosecution” or “declination” decision in Part 2?

Bias Colored Mueller’s Report and Raises Concerns About Conduct

Finally, Republicans should ask Mueller about a variety of issues that suggest an anti-Trump bias colored the special counsel investigation, compilation of the report, and his conduct after releasing his report.

A good starting point will be to quiz Mueller on his team’s bias. Is it true that Andrew Weissmann served as your one of your top prosecutors? Was he your number two man? Were you aware when you selected Weissmann to lead your team that he had sent an email to former acting attorney general Sally Yates praising her insubordination to the president? (If Mueller bristles as the insubordination characterization, all the better to expose his own bias.)

Did you know he told Yates “I am so proud”? Yet you still choose him to lead an investigation into the president of the United States? And did Weissmann select the other team members? Did he have a role in selecting Peter Strzok and Lisa Page?

Were you aware when you selected Weissmann to lead your team that he had sent an email to former acting attorney general Sally Yates praising her insubordination to the president?

Sir, are you aware that Weissmann had pursued a theory of criminal liability that the Supreme Court later reversed in a 9-0 decision? And are you aware that that decision only came after Weissmann secured the criminal conviction of Arthur Anderson on that flawed legal theory? Arthur Anderson went out of business and tens-of-thousands of employees lost their jobs as a result, didn’t they?

Were you involved in that case, by the way? Had you agreed with Weissmann’s flawed legal theory? And did Weissmann agree with your theory of obstruction set forth in the special counsel’s report, the theory that the attorney general has concluded is flawed?

After highlighting the bias held at the top, the committee Republicans should determine if Weissmann (or someone else) was to blame for the special counsel’s failure to identify grand jury materials in the final report.

In his congressional testimony, Attorney General William Barr stated that he had asked Mueller’s office on multiple occasions to identify grand jury information in the final report so Barr could quickly review and redact the necessary portions of the report and promptly release it in full to the public. But the special counsel’s office ignored Barr’s directive, delaying the release of the full report.

Barr explained that he released the bottom-line results of the report because the time needed to redact grand jury and other material would necessarily create “a gap between the receipt of the report and getting the full report out publicly.” Barr also testified that offered to allow Mueller to review the draft before he its release; Mueller demurred.

But then after Barr released the bottom-line results of the probe, Mueller sent the attorney general a “snitty” letter—likely written by a staffer—asking Barr to release the executive summary from the special counsel report. Barr refused. Soon after, the press began reporting on claims that members of the special counsel team disagreed with Barr’s synopsis of the report and claimed it was misleading. Barr later released Mueller’s letter, which acknowledged that Barr had accurately summarized the report, but that the press’ reporting was misleading.

This sequence of facts suggests that the special counsel’s office sought to delay release of the findings until they had time to build an anti-Trump narrative.

This sequence of facts suggests that the special counsel’s office sought to delay release of the findings until they had time to build an anti-Trump narrative, but that the plan failed when Barr issued the bottom-line conclusion of no collusion and no charges on obstruction. Mueller must explain these circumstances.

Sir, isn’t it true that Barr asked the special counsel’s office multiple times to identify grand jury material in the final report? Isn’t it true Barr made that request at least a month before you submitted the final report? Whom did you charge to identify grand jury materials? Did that individual inform you that he or she would not identify the grand jury materials, as Barr had directed?

Did you tell Barr before submitted the final report that you hadn’t identified the grand jury materials? Is it true that Barr offered to allow you to review his release of a summary of the conclusions, but that you did not accept that offer? So, you didn’t review the bottom-line summary Barr wrote before he released it, even though he offered you the chance?

But afterward, you wrote a letter to Barr complaining that Barr’s summary was being misrepresented, correct? Yet you agree, don’t you, that Barr’s letter was accurate? Was that letter your idea? Why didn’t you just call Barr? Did you leak to the press information about your disagreement with Barr? Do you know who leaked that information to the press? How many members of your team knew about the letter to Barr and your request to release the executive summaries? Who were those individuals?

Finally, since we are talking about the grand jury materials: It is illegal to release grand jury material publicly, correct? What about to Congress? Would it be illegal for you to provide that grand jury information to Congress? So the president and attorney general cannot release an unredacted copy of your report to Congress without breaking the law, correct?

There are many other questions deserving of answers, especially concerning the misconduct by DOJ and FBI agents (and others), as well as the true impetus for launching an investigation into the Trump campaign. But Mueller’s report did not touch on those issues and he is unlikely to have investigated (or fully investigated) those questions.

Republicans should leave those issues to Barr and focus instead on the questions Mueller can and should answer. Even if he refuses, Republicans can still expose the public to the many facts Mueller and the media have buried—just by asking the right questions.

Biden: ‘Sometimes Even George Wallace Is Right’,"How many Republican candidates could survive a 2020 political race if they had once said, “sometimes even George Wallace is right about some things?” I’d venture to say none.

In his email newsletter, CNN’s Chris Cillizza ranks the five big campaign stories to keep an eye on. Coming in at No. 1 this week is whether presidential hopeful Joe Biden can turn over a “new leaf.” The former vice president, Cillizza explained, “sought to put a rough few weeks, which began with what was interpreted as praise for segregationist senators, behind him.”

Were Biden’s comments about the relative civility of segregationists interpreted as praise of segregationists—as in, still up for debate—or was it just unadorned praise? Whatever the case, reporters now have a catalog of historical evidence showing Biden extolling segregationists, defending segregationists, eulogizing segregationists, working with segregationists on shared interests, being mentored by segregationists, and sucking up to segregationists to secure coveted committee seats as a freshman senator—appointments that he was given over more experienced colleagues.

What more do journalists need to see to make a declarative statement about Biden’s history? I mean, other than finding an “R” next to his name.

What about Biden telling a witness “sometimes even George Wallace is right” during a Senate committee hearing in 1981?

No, Biden wasn’t arguing that Wallace — the notorious four-term Democrat governor of Alabama and three-time segregationist presidential candidate who, in 1963, had famously said, “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever” — was a good guy, as he did of his “closest friend,” Strom Thurmond. By the time Biden was bringing up Wallace, in fact, the Alabama governor had asked for forgiveness. Biden was arguing that Wallace’s argument about criminal justice, rehabilitation, and the death penalty—positions that are now abhorrent to progressives—had been prophetic.

“Let us take the death penalty,” Biden explained. “Everybody wants the death penalty now. We are going to hang everybody. Do you know why they want the death penalty? Because stupid sociologists and guys like people who sit up here in my job for years kept telling them: ‘We know how to rehabilitate.’ They do not have the slightest idea how to rehabilitate. Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the point that you sentence someone based upon the amount of time it will take to rehabilitate them.

“So the American people,” he went on, “because they are basically good, like most people in my opinion are, went along and said: ‘We’ll buy that.’ And they bought it for 20 years. And it does not work. It flat out does not work. So, what are the liberals, but Joe Biden and a few others like me, saying? And I get killed by my liberal constituency for saying it. I say: ‘Hey, let’s forget about rehabilitation. We do not know how to do it.’ Say it. Boom. Tell them. Because if you don’t, you know what is going to happen.”

(None of the above, incidentally, had anything to do with the topic of the Senate hearing Biden was charged with running, which was the constitutionality of busing.)

Casting himself as a rebellious Democrat, Biden argued that Americans were going to get so frustrated with the “liberal sociologists and politicians” that they would turn to Thurmond’s view of “hang them all,” not because Americans were bad people, but because urban liberal policies had failed them.

So maybe Biden wasn’t always wrong.

Then again, the future vice president also argued that our criminal justice problems only existed because the American people were “not very innovative.” This assertion was made with United States on the cusp of a technological and economic revolution that benefited every strata of society and changed the world of information and commerce forever. So there’s also that.

Does Biden believe rehabilitation is overrated? Who are we kidding? Biden believes whatever he needs to believe to win—then and now. He will drop decades-long positions if they offer the slightest threat to his campaign, without any intellectual or moral explanation.

We know this because, despite his insistence at the time, there was nothing particularly courageous about being a law-and-order senator from Delaware in 1981. In that year, 66 percent of Americans supported the death penalty. By the time Biden was pushing the 1994 crime bill, that number had climbed to 80 percent. Biden was adopting popular positions in a nation sick of rampant criminality.

Things have changed, though, and Biden has already apologized for his part in passing the 1994 crime bill. “It was a big mistake that was made,” he explained. “We were told by the experts that ‘Crack, you never go back,’ that the two were somehow fundamentally different. It’s not. But it’s trapped an entire generation.”

You’ll notice that here Biden drops his customary habit of taking personal credit for policy achievements, even ones that he was only tangentially involved in during the Obama administration, and instead lays the blame on the collective. Policies that Biden sponsored, helped write, and campaigned on for decades, are now — well, mistakes were made.

Joe “lock those SOBs up” Biden contends that he was part of a group fooled by pointy-headed experts and “Crack is Wack” slogans. You might notice this was the very same rationalization he used in his Wallace-was-right lecture to make the contradictory point about crime in 1981. Experts misled us.

That’s all debatable. Maybe Biden was just doing what he had to do in 1970s Washington. Maybe Biden was right about busing and crime, and needed some unsavory allies to stop bad policy. Maybe he buddied up with James O. Eastland and J. William Fulbright for the long-term good, and maybe it was worth it. Maybe Wallace had a point. Maybe it’s all just ancient history.

But that brings us back to the central argument of the Biden campaign: if his experience in Washington is the most compelling reason for his candidacy, why does he spend so much time apologizing and walking back positions, policy choices, and statements? These are not all inconsequential, long-forgotten fights, either. We’re talking about some of the biggest debates of the past 50 years. War. Abortion. Integration of schools. Crime.

Does Biden deserve a pass simply because he said these things a long time ago? If not, perhaps someone at the next debate can ask him if he still believes Wallace was right.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/09/biden-sometimes-even-george-wallace-is-right/,2019-07-09
Sweden’s ‘Feminist Foreign Policy’ Has Upped Violence Against Women,"How do you judge a political idea? In the real world, it is quite a simple process. You see the people professing that idea, and then you test it against reality.

The Soviet Union was a declared Marxist paradise, and then it crumpled and imploded, with millions of Russians burning their party membership cards in roadside bins, and millions more Soviets of different nationalities and ethnicities dragging down and toppling the statues of Joseph Stalin in the early 1990s while thousands of Marxist sympathizers in the West clawed the last straw of “not real socialism,” an excuse we are apparently not tired of hearing and which somehow remains hugely popular in the intelligentsia, media, and academia.

Given their metrics, Sweden must be heading towards the claim of “not real feminism” soon. Sweden is the world’s first officially self-declared “feminist” government, a position now being chased by Canada and France, and almost all the U.S. Democratic presidential candidates, and bizarrely, by Theresa May of the United Kingdom.

This is important, as Sweden was the leading country in “resistance” against the election of Donald Trump (who was roundly mocked for correctly pointing out that something is rotten in the state of Sweden). It considers itself a frontline bastion against the rise of the Euro-right. Everyone remembers the infamous Swedish photoshoot of all-female government officials signing Green legislation mocking Trump, days after all of them wore hijabs to meet Iranian leaders. Swedish social science and gender studies professors led universities in an academic boycott of the United States in 2017.

However, a recent report indicates that bombing and gang wars in Sweden have reached a national emergency level: “It is the kind of news we usually associate with war zones, but this bombing took place in Linköping, a peaceful university town in southern Sweden. Remarkably, it was not the only explosion in the country that day; another, seemingly unrelated, a blast was reported in a parking lot in the city of Gothenburg earlier in the morning. Three explosions have been reported in Malmö since Tuesday morning. As of this writing, no arrests have been made.”

Overall, 50 explosions were recorded in only the last three months, incredible for a country with a population as small as Sweden. The report further states, “In the past four years, fatalities include a 63-year-old man who unknowingly picked up a hand grenade lying in the street; an 8-year-old boy who was asleep when a hand grenade was thrown into the apartment where he was staying; and a 4-year-old girl killed in a car bombing.”

Superficially, there are no such things as a feminist foreign policy, other than quotas for women in cushy jobs (not manual labor, never), and esoteric academic gibberish in fringe corners of the social sciences, and money-laundering disciplines. But practically, there are a lot of changes, which almost all lean hard left. As I wrote in 2017,

But that’s nothing compared to what feminist Sweden has unleashed on its own population. Uncharted migration has correlated with a record number of rapes, and crimes against women, which the Swedish media and government have tried to jointly cover up. Swedish police have been gagged by the government, told not to talk about mass sexual assault by certain minority groups, which has resulted in individual police officers venting in private. I could go on, but the most thorough breakdown of Sweden’s social structure seems to have occurred under their feminist government. The burdens of growing social security costs, ossifying academic orthodoxy, increasing Soviet-style nanny-state control, and the resultant far right backlash, is all described in detail by James Traub in Foreign Policy.

Sweden is unfortunately turning out to be a case study for when feminism is actually used as a theory of governance. I asked Paulina Neuding, the European editor of Quillette, about the crime scene of Sweden after its feminist turn, and the reality of what is known as the rape crisis of Sweden, and if it has subsided since 2015. Apparently not, and it is a new normal.

“Swedish authorities present annual reports on both reported and self-reported sexual offenses. Both sets of figures indicate a steady rise in sex crime,” Neuding said. Yet it is showcased in a completely different way in the international media, as a victory of feminism.

“The problem lies in the official interpretation and presentation of the statistics,” says Neuding. “They are not officially seen as a reflection of an actual rise in crime, but rather of: a wide definition of rape (because we’re feminists); and women’s willingness to report (because we’re feminists). It’s a brilliant analysis. The higher the rape numbers, the better.”

With that interpretation, of course, soft-censorship comes along: “We know from older studies from The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention that immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are strongly over-represented in sex crime. But the link between immigration from these very regions and the rise in reported sex crime has not been properly studied in recent years for political reasons. The Council published a study a few weeks ago on the topic, but it was not taken seriously due to obvious method flaws.”

To those who watched the series “Chernobyl,” the phrase “not studied for political reasons” sounds ominous. But this is also the inevitable logical end-point. Consider any ideological and “progressive” government, whether feminist or socialist, anywhere in the world, with either a state-controlled or an ideologically submissive media, and you would see the same result. Saving the narrative with a dubious interpretation of statistics becomes more important than showcasing reality.

The current Swedish government (as opposed to average Swedish people, who are as much a victim of this as Russians under the Soviets) is no different and offers a valuable case study for those who are unquestioningly promoting a “feminist future” in the West. It is time to ask them what they actually mean, and how they justify what is happening in Sweden. If nothing else, let them say for everyone to hear that Sweden is “not real feminism.”

Let’s Reform The Way Hate Crimes Are Reported And Tracked,"On the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, USA Today published a report titled, “Anti-LGBT hate crimes are rising, the FBI says. But it gets worse,” arguing that current FBI hate crime statistics do not accurately represent the reality. FBI hate crime numbers indicate roughly 7,500 annual incidents, while the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) reports more than 200,000 annual hate crimes.

Commenting on the discrepancy, Robin Maril, associate legal director for the Human Rights Campaign argued, “If someone comes forward to report a hate crime, they could also be officially outing themselves as LGBTQ. In a smaller or rural community, that outing could result in an eviction or loss of a job.” Maril continued, “The level of discourse that we are getting from the Trump administration and leadership only hurts our community, only hurts trans people…It gives a sense of impunity and a license to harm folks.”

Arguing that the FBI statistics are flawed due to low reporting rates by law enforcement officials throughout the country, Maril said, “There are entire cities that don’t report any hate crimes. Cities like Miami might report zero hate crimes, but a hate crime does occur in Miami at least once a year.”

Roy L. Austin, a Justice Department official under the Obama administration, agreed: “The data is embarrassingly bad for a country that supposedly takes public safety so seriously. One would think that we would do a better job of collecting crime data. And none of our crime data is worse than our hate crime data.” There are about 18,000 police agencies in the country and, as of 2017, 16,149 were participating in the FBI hate crime reporting program—or nearly 90 percent.

Methods of Studying Hate Crimes

The Department of Justice administers two separate hate crime collection methods. The FBI runs the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the Bureau of Justice runs the NCVS. The UCR relies on police agency reporting and the NCVS relies on self-reporting surveys.

One major discrepancy is that, between 2003 and 2015, an annual average of 14,380 individuals reported to the NCVS that police had confirmed their attack was a hate crime, while during the same period the UCR only reported 8,370 incidents. To provide perspective, the NCVS estimates an annual average of 252,630 hate crimes with 41 percent reported to police (104,600), with 14 percent (14,380) stating they were confirmed by police.

The NCVS survey describes itself as a “self-report survey in which interviewed persons are asked about the number and characteristics of victimizations experienced during the prior 6 months.” Once a household is selected, the residents of the household remain in the survey for three years and are interviewed every six months, in person or over the phone, for a total of seven interviews.

The Interviewing Manual for the Census Bureau states that all areas of the United States, with a few exceptions, are eligible and that “the households to be interviewed for the NCVS are selected by scientific sampling methods from specific sampling areas across the United States.” In 2015, the most recent survey, 95,760 households and 163,880 individuals age 12 and older were interviewed.

The survey requires three types of evidence for a crime to be considered a hate crime. The victim must provide at least one type of evidence. The offender must have used hate language, left behind a hate symbol, or police investigators must have confirmed the incident was a hate crime. There appears to be no further validation beyond the self-reporting of the individual.

Between 2011 and 2015, 98.7 percent of victims provided “hate language” as evidence of the crime, with 90 percent reporting the incident involved violence or sexual assault. Although not included in the official statistics, the report states that 83 percent provided additional evidence defined as “their feelings, instincts, or perception lead them to suspect this incident was a hate crime or crime of prejudice or bigotry, even though there was not enough evidence to know for sure.”

Characteristics of Victims

Reasons given for not reporting to the police (53 percent of incidents) included 41 percent stating the issue was resolved by another authority such as a school official and one in five simply stated they did not feel their victimization was important enough to report. The most commonly cited reason typically offered in most media reports is that the victim was afraid of the police or felt they would not take them seriously, which accounted for 23 percent in this survey.

Despite Maril’s concern that people in rural areas would be more afraid to report, the survey found only 6.9 percent were from rural areas. The majority of incidents were said to have occurred in urban and suburban areas, primarily in the western U.S. (45.8 percent), with the South representing 18 percent of incidents.

Characteristics provided by victims indicated that the vast majority of offenders were single males, white or black, over the age of 30 and 44 percent of them knew their attacker. The self-described victims are majority white males between the ages of 35 and 64 with either incomes below the poverty line or in the middle-class range.

The focus on LGBT hate crimes in the USA Today article represented 22 percent of of the total victims surveyed which was slightly less than those who reported being attacked for their association with a minority individual. This would indicate an annual average of 44,000 LGBT hate crime victims in comparison to the current 2017 FBI statistic of less than 1,200.

Austin illustrated why these discrepancies matter: “The single most important thing is to link any federal funding on crime prevention on providing accurate and regular numbers.”

What Can We Do About Hate Crime Reporting?

The survey brings up important issues on the way we handle hate crimes and the expected legal and social goal. It is troubling that the Department of Justice relies so heavily on self-reporting, with no independent verification for such important data collection. The overwhelming majority of those claiming to be victims provided only their personal perception of their attacker’s motivations.

The reliance on how the victim felt over what actual evidence is available should not be determining federal resources or law. Case in point, the nearly doubling of “confirmed by police to be a hate crime” in the NCVS report reflects the victim merely saying so to the interviewing agent. In contrast, the UCR cases are vetted and transmitted by police agencies directly to the FBI. It is telling that public criticism is on the flawed reporting by the police.

Another concern is in the definition of “hate crime.” Considering that nearly 20 percent of those interviewed were minors and only needed to report “hate language” being used, it seems this information is poorly substantiated. Hate crime laws are supposed to deter those who would choose to target and violently attack a person over his or her real or perceived sexuality, religion, ethnicity or other immutable characteristics. It was not intended to punish the use of mean words or the perception of malicious intention in an altercation.

Moreover, media shouting that 200,000 people each year are victims of violent hate crimes that the police won’t report to the FBI is reckless and irresponsible. It perpetuates fear and validates petty grievances.

What this survey tells us is that our political leaders need to re-evaluate state and federal hate crime guidelines, requiring a timely report to the police to be considered in legal proceedings. The Hate Crime Statistics Act must be clarified to collect and report only on confirmed incidents of hate crimes rather than socially governed abstract and subjective standards designed to validate the accuser’s feelings rather than scientifically reporting on the confirmed evidence.

Government agencies should be held to a higher standard of reporting on these numbers, as the media simply repeats the major talking points, but rarely investigates the details, leading to wildly misleading headlines and public perception. As illustrated by transgender activist Naomi Green, referring to media reports on anti-LGBT violence, “It’s very traumatizing. … You’re constantly feeling on edge and looking over your shoulder.”

LGBT people are being taught to be afraid, report to interviewers that we are afraid, and then see headlines reporting that a majority of us are afraid. The cycle must end.

The First Amendment Shouldn’t Be An Empty Promise To American Jews,"The First Amendment’s promise of freedom of religion is an empty one if all Americans, including American Jews, don’t feel safe in their houses of worship or welcome in their communities. With FBI data showing that 58 percent of religiously-motivated hate crimes targeted American Jews in 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been making an increased effort to support and engage with the Jewish community, including by convening a summit on domestic anti-Semitism this week.

The day-long event included speakers from the Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, and Education, including the secretaries of Treasury and Education. Panels addressed how to combat anti-Semitism while respecting the First Amendment, anti-Semitism on college campuses, the prosecution of hate crimes, and federal efforts to combat anti-Semitism.

In his introductory remarks, Attorney General William Barr compared various forms of anti-Semitism to different forms of cancer, observing that the body politic needs a strong immune system that rejects both anti-Semitism and racial hatred. Speakers throughout the day acknowledged the patient is sick. However, Barr told American Jews that he sees rising anti-Semitism, not only in the widely discussed attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway, but also on the streets of Crown Heights, in desecrated cemeteries, and in zoning decisions intended to exclude growing Jewish communities.

Barr told the audience, those experiences “form the daily background of concerns about safety and security that many Jews feel. I want to assure you that the Department of Justice and [the] whole federal government stands with you and will not tolerate these attacks.”

Much-needed Solidarity

That solidarity is appreciated during a week that’s seen the introduction of Congress’ first-ever resolution in support of boycotting Israel. The boycott movement arose repeatedly as one powerful example of excluding and marginalizing Jews—92 percent of American Jews support Israel—as speakers addressed how contemporary anti-Semitism manifests on college campuses, as well as in our cities and towns.

During a panel about anti-Semitism and free speech, Jason Isaacson, chief policy and political affairs officer for the American Jewish Committee, said that this “discussion shouldn’t be framed as choosing between protecting Jews and the First Amendment. The best antidote to bad speech is good speech.” He also urged Americans to criticize their own political allies and insist that anti-Semitism is unacceptable, calling this “a battle for ideas” and a “fight for the soul of our nation.”

This conversation also considered whether boycotts qualify as free speech. Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Antonin Scalia Law School commented, “Too often, those who wish to discriminate on the basis of Israeli nationality try to take for themselves the language of human rights and say they’re not discriminating, they’re boycotting.” However, “Germany, Canada, and courts in France and Spain have concluded that treating Israelis as a fixed class and refusing to do business with them is discrimination.”

As for life on campus, the boycott movement has become central. William Jacobson, a professor at Cornell Law School, dated that change to 2012-13.

Jonathan Tobin, editor in chief of the Jewish News Syndicate, observed that “progressive spaces have become ground zero for anti-Semitism. The growing popularity of anti-Zionism has created a hostile atmosphere on campuses, where Jews feel marginalized and threatened.” That marginalization is led by professors, especially those who teach Middle Eastern studies. On campuses today, traditional, negative Jewish stereotypes are being projected onto Israel.

Jacobson described Jewish students’ feeling “ganged up on,” as well as intersectionality’s transformation from a precise word to a broad buzzword “provid[ing] the intellectual framework for people who wouldn’t consider themselves anti-Semitic to isolate Jewish students. It’s a toxic mixture of racial and identity politics where anti-Semitism is the unifying feature for groups with little in common.”

Alyza Lewin, President of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, described “a well funded strategy to deny Zionists a place in society” and asked, “if you isolate and dehumanize Zionists and claim they represent society’s greatest evil, you’re branding Jews with a virtual Jewish star, and then what comes next?

As for what can be done, Lewin wants administrators to condemn anti-Semitic speech and actions just as they would if something racist happens. Lewin also suggests helping administrators to identify what is anti-Semitic. Jacobson recommends equal treatment and enforcement of a campus’ existing rules, rather than having administrators regulate speech. Tobin suggests that adults model speaking up so that Jewish students feel courageous enough to do the same.

Federal Agencies Doing Their Part

While Congress and state legislatures have been taking steps to oppose the boycott movement, federal agencies are clearly also making an effort to push back against various forms of anti-Semitism with the tools at their disposal. Calvin Shivers, deputy assistant director in the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, described hate crimes as his division’s top priority, based on the impact these crimes have on the community. The Civil Rights Division is aggressively pursuing cases against individuals involved in attacks on houses of worship, as well as attacks that threaten or harm individual Jews. The Department of Justice is also keeping an eye out for discrimination against houses of worship in zoning and landmarking.

Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism Elan Carr described this as “the time to save our future from what’s on the horizon,” noting that one of the great assets in this fight is that every federal player that can apply pressure to this problem is doing so. In fact, there was a White House meeting last week to discuss making this an administration-wide effort and a determination “not to contain this scourge, but to roll it back, to excise it.”

Carr said the administration will apply every legal force it can and will fight this fight because what’s at stake is the future of our country, and our kids deserve a better future. And to that, I say, Amen.

3 Arguments For Overlooking Illegal Immigration That Don't Hold Water,"The United States is the greatest country in the world in no small part because we are a nation of laws. Law is not designed to bend to individuals’ personal preferences; instead it is written, as best is possible, to have one meaning and the same application to all who encounter it. Any other approach is antithetical to what makes this country the envy of the free world and the enemy of the rest.

Unfortunately, today we see, in the context of immigration law, the desire by some to bend the law to their political preferences. More on that in a moment. First, let me present the unfortunately required identity statement that may permit me the privilege to opine on immigration.

I’m the son of legal immigrants. My father was a refugee whose family fled to America in Germany after World War II. So I have some personal understanding and appreciation for those seeking out the goodwill of the American people in the face of persecution.

By the way, my father was not in a concentration camp, but other relatives were. And, clearly, the United States does not operate concentration camps. Those words have meaning too.

Breaking the Laws Without Punishment Creates Chaos

Now back to the substance: Objectors to the administration’s plan to deport those who (1) came here seeking asylum (many never having serious asylum claims in the first place), (2) received a negative determination after undergoing full legal process, (3) were ordered to leave the country, and (4) patently ignored that lawful order from the government of the country whose grace they seek seriously undermine the basic notion of law on which this nation admirably operates.

Many objectors cannot openly state their slow-motion call for revolution because they’re elected officials who’ve sworn to uphold the Constitution — the same oath legal immigrants, including those receiving asylum, take upon being granted the distinct honor and unparalleled privilege of U.S. citizenship. Clearly, these objectors want to change the law. But to what?

Notwithstanding their vociferous claims to the contrary, it becomes increasingly difficult to decipher the scant difference between their position and one for open borders, which they dare not publicly embrace. Their verbal gymnastics demonstrate that the public significantly favors controlled immigration over the folly of the alternative.

Ultimately, objectors sing a seductive and destructive song for nullification. Such efforts alone don’t represent the four horsemen of an impending legal apocalypse, but they certainly breed even further contempt for the rule of law, seriously corroding our country’s moral foundation.

Federal lawmakers criticizing the president for faithfully executing the law argue he is heartlessly intimidating the immigrant community by enforcing immigration-court orders of removal. Let’s examine some of the arguments against removing those already adjudicated as being in the U.S. unlawfully.

1. Sometimes Family Separation Is a Consequence of Crime

Removing those lawfully ordered deported will sometimes result in (the seemingly tautological occurrence of) family members, including children, without deportation orders remaining in the United States without that deported family member. So, the remaining family will be altered, broken, even shattered.

Agreed. Of course, this exact outcome occurs every time an American citizen with a family is incarcerated for ordinary crimes. We, of course, don’t incarcerate the family members, nor do we ignore the crimes because of the collateral effects of law enforcement. Have we reached the point of treating illegal immigrants better than American citizens who commit crimes?

Commentators repeatedly bemoan the horror of separating families, and many want solely to address those immigration criminals who also committed violent crimes. No one can dispute that we can easily construct a hierarchy of wrongdoers to pursue. If our government officials charged with enforcing the law, however, cannot confidently say that illegal immigrants will be deported solely based on the fact that they either broke the law by illegally crossing into the country or by remaining here after ordered to depart upon failing (often transparently insufficient) asylum claims, those officials aren’t fulfilling their responsibilities.

The United States is the greatest country in world history. People from around the planet will always want to come here to get a better life, and if they do so illegally or remain after denied asylum, they must leave or be removed. Anything less is lawlessness.

2. Paying Taxes Doesn’t Exempt People from the Law

Many of those who will be deported pay taxes and offer value to their communities.

Agreed, although this can be misleading. The implication of the claim is often that illegal immigrants and those with denied asylum claims on average pay more in taxes than they receive in services from the government. False. On average, they earn modest incomes. Therefore, taxes removed simply don’t exceed the ubiquitous benefits these people actually receive.

Moreover, when illegal immigrants feign legal status to obtain employment, they inevitably violate a host of additional federal laws. Advocates of the “otherwise-legal” status for illegal immigrants routinely elide this.

But the broader point is far more important. Providing for the community through taxes or otherwise does exempt a person from the law. Imagine the implications if that were the case. Notorious gangster John Gotti lavished his community with riches, funded through his ill-gotten booty. That, of course, didn’t offset his wrongdoing. By the way, after he was convicted, he was separated from his family.

3. We Need More Law Enforcement, not Less

Deportation enforcement will drive immigrants underground rather than cooperating with law enforcement.

The irony is palpable given that local officials, such as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, as a matter of policy, won’t cooperate with federal law enforcement regarding violations of immigration law. How can city leaders expect their residents to cooperate with local law enforcement if those leaders constantly reinforce the idea that the virtue of complying with law enforcement is entirely subjective?

That absurdity notwithstanding, basic economics teaches us that anytime we prohibit bad behavior, those engaging in that wrongful activity will be less likely to interact with police on other issues. That is true when drug dealers are robbed, pimps are assaulted, and thieves cheat each other. None of these people wants to expose their criminality to law enforcement. Thus, at least some of these wrongdoers will forgo having their legitimate rights enforced.

The solution regarding this concern is not avoiding the enforcement of immigration laws but ensuring better enforcement. If the problem of illegal immigrants weren’t so prevalent, then the concern about their unwillingness to interact with the police would subside.

Ignoring Laws Leads to Anarchy

This debate over illegal immigration is ultimately an argument over whether we intend to be a nation of laws at all. Are we willing to act through the democratic process together to create a single set of rules that bind us all to create a more ordered and safe society, a more perfect union?

Once enacted, those laws must bind all equally, regardless of who supported their enactment, for the system to persist. That’s what distinguishes enacted law from, say, the laws of physics. The latter laws require no buy-in for legitimacy or effectiveness. They exist regardless of preference, sometimes to the chagrin of skateboarders and the like.

But the laws of mankind require a significant level of compliance to be effective. If we move in the direction where the losing side disregards lawful enactments, then we actually have no law. The result, of course, is anarchy. That might, on first blush, seem freeing, but it is actually quite constricting of rights.

Only those few with the biggest clubs can exercise their will in such a regime. The rest will be subjugated, suffering from far greater diminution of freedom than having to comply with some laws that don’t comport with their personal policy preferences. Thus, as Winston Churchill famously observed, democracy remains the best, highly flawed system of government available.

Yet certain federal lawmakers still prioritize preening for cameras over setting forth serious policies addressing the perverse incentives that have led us to the crisis we face today. This is no small concern, and it occurs in a broader context in which too many pundits fashion claims seeking to make the law a monster. If that pursuit proves successful, this democratic experiment we call these United States will ultimately fail.

Cory Booker Labels Joe Biden The ‘Architect Of Mass Incarceration’,"U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker (D-N.J.) went after rival 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden Wednesday, labeling the former vice president as the “architect of mass incarceration.”

“For a guy who helped to be an architect of mass incarceration, this is an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country,” Booker told reporters on the sidelines of the 110th annual NAACP convention, as reported by the Washington Examiner.

Booker was referring to Biden’s recent proposal on criminal justice reform released Tuesday that seeks to distance the former Delaware senator from his role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, which he sponsored as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many have since blamed that bill for contributing to the exceptionally high incarceration rates in the United States, particularly among minorities.

Biden pushed back on Booker’s comments Wednesday afternoon, arguing in an official campaign statement that most incarcerated people are serving time for state and local crimes, not federal crimes. The Biden campaign also went on offense, arguing that Booker cracked down hard on crime as mayor of Newark, New Jersey.

“At his inauguration as Mayor of Newark in 2006, Booker promised a zero tolerance policy for minor infractions,” the statement reads, “which is exactly the kind of policy that enmeshed many undeserving people in a criminal justice system that cast a huge shadow over their subsequent lives.”

The plan Biden revealed this week is a sharp reversal from what the tough-on-crime, Delaware Democrat so heavily pushed for in the ’90s. His proposal calls for the elimination of the death penalty, the decriminalization of marijuana, and the ending of incarceration over drug use.

Booker, however, who has made criminal justice reform the centerpiece of his campaign, has pushed back against Biden’s change of platform, saying it’s too little too late.

“We have 5% of the global population but 25% of the world’s prison population,” Booker said to reporters, according to the Examiner. “For him not to have a more comprehensive, bold plan to deal with this is unacceptable to me, especially because he is partly responsible for the crisis that we have.”

Booker’s plan includes an offer of clemency on his first day in office to more than 17,000 people incarcerated for nonviolent drug crimes and would cut mandatory minimum sentences for such crimes in half. Under Booker’s proposal, detailed in a March bill titled the “First Step Act,” the longest mandatory minimum sentence for a nonviolent drug crime would be 10 years instead of 20 years, as the law currently stands.

Many people, including the media and other Democrats, have scrutinized Biden’s record on race issues throughout the campaign. That scrutiny ramped up in June when the candidate shot himself in the foot by touting his relationships with segregationist senators as examples of his “civility.” While Biden worked to backtrack his comments, a closer examination of Biden’s history in the senate revealed Biden to be more than civil, but rather an ally to segregationists in the Senate.

At last month’s first set of Democratic debates in Miami, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) went after Biden for his opposition to busing, a policy used to integrate schools.

President Trump Calls Out Swedish Prime Minister For Jailing A$AP Rocky,"President Trump called out the Swedish prime minister on July 25 for what Trump believes to be wrongful treatment of the African American U.S. citizen and rapper A$AP Rocky.

“Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan Löfven for being unable to act,” Trump tweeted. “Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States. I watched the tapes of A$Ap Rocky, and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. Treat Americans fairly!”

In a second tweet, Trump said, “Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn’t seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem!”

Sweden’s population is very homogeneous, with 90.9% being “non-foreign,” which led Trump essentially to virtue signal to the Swedish PM about race relations in his country.

Trump also alleged in his tweet that Sweden has a crime problem. While the data indicates Sweden faces high levels of crime, many of the deaths recorded in Sweden’s crime statistics are actually suicides, accidents, or natural deaths. Sweden’s murder and manslaughter rate is very low. However, its crime problem is particularly high in fraud, property crime, and sexual assault. The sexual assault rate has skyrocketed by 70% since 2013, yet the problem Swedish police chose to tackle is whether or not A$AP Rocky assaulted a man who was clearly harassing him.

A$AP Rocky and two members of his “crew” are now in Swedish prison after allegedly beating up a man on the streets of Stockholm. According to TMZ, all three of them turned themselves in to the Swedish police.

A witness recorded the entire ordeal. The man that is prosecuting Rocky instigated the conflict by hitting Rocky’s bodyguard with headphones. The man was clearly harassing Rocky and his crew.

In the video, Rocky said, “We don’t want to fight y’all. We don’t want to go to jail.”

Rocky then turned to the camera and said, “Just for the camera, we don’t want no problem with these boys. They keep following us.”

At the end of the video, a witness told Rocky and his crew that the men harassing them had slapped her and her girlfriend’s backside.

Rocky and his crew eventually reacted, throwing the man harassing him to the ground. The man sustained many injuries, but the content is graphic. You can see the damages here.

Rocky and his crew are in jail awaiting a trial. If convicted, they could face up to two years in prison.

"Don’t Strengthen The Death Penalty, Abolish It","The U.S. government will officially resume executions of federal death row inmates this December. This comes after Attorney General William Barr directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to adopt an addendum to the Federal Execution Protocol that allows it to move forward with capital punishment in order to bring “justice to victims of the most horrific crimes.”

Execution never results in justice. It may feel good to sentence the worst of society’s criminals to death, but this will never right the wrongs of the crimes those convicted people have committed. Not only is it a barbaric mechanism for a modern government to use, but it is used in a wholly imperfect justice system, prone to human error. The justice system lacks the capability to correctly identify perpetrators with 100 percent accuracy. These downfalls are enough to repeal the death penalty entirely.

Death Row Inmates Have Been Exonerated

A perfect criminal justice system does not exist and probably never will. And with human life on the line, the government can no longer risk executing the wrong person in the name of justice — it’s far too dangerous.

It’s easy to believe that everyone convicted of a crime must be guilty, but it simply isn’t true. Since 1973, the government has exonerated all charges from 166 death row inmates. All of those people could have been wrongfully killed for crimes they did not commit. There could be more. Organizations such as Innocence Project work to free innocent people from wrongful incarceration, and despite the group’s success in freeing 365 people to date, its caseload isn’t getting any smaller.

Wrongful convictions happen due to a number of factors, many of which are honest human mistakes. The single nationwide leading cause, for example, is eyewitness misidentification. This is due to human memory errors, which lapse and misremember important details about events.

Other contributing factors, according to the University of Michigan Law School, include junk science, false confessions, government misconduct, faulty snitches, and bad lawyering. No person is immune from fallibility. These errors have forced hundreds of people into wrongful imprisonment, and it could happen to anyone, even you.

10 Guilty Should Go Free Rather Than 1 Unjustly Killed

The government claims to prioritize protecting the safety of our great nation above all else, yet it doesn’t value its own citizens enough to protect them from the potential errors of the justice system. As egregious as wrongful incarceration is, at least a wrongfully imprisoned person has the potential to be set free. The government has a chance to learn from the mistakes and, in some states, pay compensation to the wrongfully convicted. But death steals that opportunity, ridding these people of their constitutional right to due process.

The basis of human life is enough of an argument to repeal the death penalty nationally and in every state. Would it not be better to have 10 guilty people spend life in prison than accidentally end one innocent life?

Morally, this makes sense. But it’s better financially as well. Numerous studies conclude that pursuing capital punishment is more costly than the alternative sentence of life in prison. This means states that choose to pursue the safer option by abolishing the death penalty are also on track to save money in the long run, a win-win situation for both government and citizens.

It’s easy to look at the national death penalty cases before us — five inmates convicted by the courts on terrible charges involving rapes and murders of innocent children — and make a quick and vindictive judgment about how they deserve to die. But you cannot teach a society that killing is wrong by killing. The taking of another life can never demonstrate justice — only vengeance, disgracefully disguised as justice.

It’s Tyranny for Government to End a Life

Allowing the government to decide when to end a person’s life based on the criminal laws it writes is one of the most tyrannical powers a society can grant a central authority. And keeping the death penalty as a legitimate and lawful form of punishment leaves the door open for politicians to more easily apply it as a penalty for other crimes in the future, beyond the current offenses for which it is used. This is alarming, as government power only continues to grow, and even recent history demonstrates that power can easily shift from one party to another with the changing of years.

In prisons, staff must abide by a number of legal standards to uphold the health and safety of every inmate, regardless of the crimes committed. These standards are in place because Western societies have generally agreed torturing citizens is wrong, and taking away people’s basic rights while under the state’s care is inhumane. Why, then, is it justified to take away the right to life, the most sacred right? Anyone who believes in personal liberty should oppose capital punishment.

By clearing the way for capital punishment to proceed, the federal government has declared that vengeance is more important than the safety of its citizens. It should instead recognize that every human life is valuable, and risking even one potentially innocent person’s life is not worth the retribution some believe the death penalty provides.

"Repeal The Death Penalty, But Not For The Reasons You Think","Once again, the morality of the death penalty recycles to the forefront of public scrutiny, this time with notable political vigor as the latest development on the subject comes out of the Trump administration’s Justice Department.

The department on July 25 issued a press release announcing Attorney General William Barr had directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to restore the use of capital punishment for federal inmates on death row, a provision the Obama administration halted in 2014. Included in the statement were the names of five death row inmates, listing their respective capital crimes and newly scheduled dates of execution this upcoming December and January.

Capital punishment is not inherently partisan. For instance, President Barack Obama suspended federal executions in 2014 over concerns of lethal injection drugs and their effectiveness. In 1994, however, another Democrat, President Bill Clinton expanded capital punishment when he signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

An Emotionally Charged Debate

That said, discourse around capital punishment tends to be emotionally charged and often logically inconsistent. The death penalty invokes lines of argument appealing to everything from conscience to the Constitution, from biblical text to personal experience, from “Forensic Files” to government data, and everything in between.

People can and do, in good faith, argue for or against the historic practice with compelling points. Compelling or not, what if we’re asking the wrong questions? Regardless, understanding the arguments is helpful for discussion, so that’s where we will begin.

Some arguments are wholly incoherent. It was only a matter of time before opponents emerged in the Twittersphere, trying to draw nonexistent parallels between the death penalty and abortion. The killing of an innocent unborn child based on the action of another is in no way equatable with killing a convicted killer on the basis of his actions. The claim hardly merits comment.

Your administration just reinstated the death penalty and scheduled 5 executions of *actual* people. You’ve lost the right to pull your, “pro-life” narrative-talking-point- bullshit with me. https://t.co/oDDaYG8JjX — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) July 26, 2019

But other, better arguments emerged too.

You Make a Good Point …

Right here in The Federalist, in fact, Molly Davis argues that the possibility of wrongful convictions leading to wrongful execution is reason enough to abolish the practice. If an innocent person convicted of a heinous crime were executed instead of merely imprisoned, the government would be robbing him of constitutional rights to due process and his precious life, she argued.

While lawmakers and citizens should consider seriously the possibility of human error when discussing the legitimacy of policy, that outcome would not be neglect of due process. By the time a convict is sentenced to death row, he has exhausted the “process.” The U.S. attorney general must seek the final decision, which then a jury must decide unanimously, still leaving the defendant with the ability to appeal to federal courts. The federal government has only executed three convicts since 1963.

Nor is capital punishment cruel and unusual. Not only are modern execution methods mild in proportion to the heinous nature of the crimes that warrant them, but an isolated instance of a botched execution, such as that of Clayton Lockett during Obama’s second term, could hardly be considered cruel and unusual. Cruelty connotes willful or malicious intent, and unfortunate human error is neither of those things.

Many religious people advocate for the death penalty on biblical grounds, invoking God’s covenant with Noah in Genesis that “whoever sheds the blood of man through man shall his blood be shed.” In the Old Testament Torah, both adultery and disobedience to parents were considered capital offenses. In the New Testament, Jesus himself dismissed an adulterous woman without condemning or stoning her.

Assuming for our purposes that both advocacy or opposition are doctrinally defensible and that each of my above observations are conclusive, the death penalty is still bad policy and should be abolished — although it may not be for the reasons you think.

What Is the Goal?

While politicos squabble over the Trump Justice Department and Alyssa Milano distracts from the matter at hand to promote her own policy goals, the real questions we should be asking are: Which objective of the criminal justice system is the death penalty supposed to fulfill? And how effective is the policy at fulfilling that objective?

The criminal justice system embodies five objectives: deterrence, incapacitation, retribution, rehabilitation, and restoration. At least one of these goals, and sometimes more than one, govern each policing and corrections policy. If a practice is out of touch with these principles, it is probably bad policy. (For examples, note the policy errors of incarcerating hordes of the mentally ill after the deinstitutionalization of the mid-1950s versus the policy successes of “broken windows” policing.)

We can immediately rule out two of these objectives relative to execution: rehabilitation and restoration. Rehabilitation is the process by which an offender learns certain skills and overcomes criminally deviant vices so he might become a valuable, contributing member of society upon release from prison. Likewise, restoration is based on the premise that an offender can repay a victim for damages he inflicted, essentially renewing him to his standing before he committed the crime. Neither rehabilitation nor restoration applies to capital offenses.

But consider whether the death penalty is an effective deterrent. John and Paul Feinberg, in their book Ethics for a Brave New World, say it’s nearly impossible to prove the death penalty does not deter. “Opponents [of capital punishment] have never demonstrated that the death penalty does not deter,” they say. For instance, whether the death penalty is the reason non-murderers do not murder is simply not knowable.

However, the death penalty cannot possibly be an effective deterrent in keeping with the deterrence theory in criminology. According to this theory, punishments must be swift, severe, and, most importantly, certain if they are to deter criminal behavior. The death penalty is neither swift nor certain. It is applied inconsistently, and when it is applied, prisoners typically spend more than a decade and sometimes well over 20 years on death row.

The next goal, incapacitation, is to ensure the safety of the public — to keep dangerous or perpetual offenders off the streets. The death penalty certainly accomplishes this. But does it accomplish it in the most efficient and cost-effective manner with minimum necessary force? Hardly. Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole accomplishes public safety with less force and lower costs.

An Eye for an Eye

The final objective and perhaps the most difficult to reconcile is retribution. In Flawed Criminal Justice Policies, Frances Reddington and Gene Bonham Jr. contend that the death penalty must be applied proportionally in order to accomplish retributive justice.

“What this means is that the death penalty is applied equivalently based on the nature (heinousness) of the offense that those who commit like crimes receive like punishments, that those who commit the worst possible crimes receive the death penalty. Conversely, it means that it is reserved only for those who commit these worst possible crimes.”

They explain that factors including jury and prosecutorial discretion, racial bias, and geographical location result in disparities in the application of the penalty, saying:

In short, some offenders who ‘deserve’ the death penalty more than others do not receive the death penalty and some offenders who don’t ‘deserve’ it as much as others do receive it. Retribution fails if only a select few … are granted retributive justice. ‘Justice’ fails to be delivered in a manner that comports with the notion that it be provided to those who most deserve it. And, those who have suffered as victims or co-victims are often left without the justice and catharsis promised to them in the form of retribution via the death penalty.

Further, the fact remains that the clinical, humane nature of lethal injection cannot be compared to the unmitigated horror imposed upon so many unwilling victims and their families. A moral government cannot mete out the sort of lex talionis, or eye-for-an-eye, justice that capital crimes demand because the death penalty simply cannot mimic their heinousness. To do so would be torturous. And so we are left wondering how the death penalty is retributively preferable to a life sentence, which actually meets the goals of our correctional system.

If we’re not at least striving to meet our institutional goals, then what exactly are we doing? The time has come to condemn the death penalty as objectively bad policy.

Nadler Is Lying About Mueller's Claim He Would Have Indicted Trump,"To continue the Russia investigation, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler is using a misinterpretation of the special counsel report. During a press conference on July 26, Nadler said of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony, “He told us in a remarkable exchange with Mr. Lieu that but for the Department of Justice policy prohibiting him from doing so, he would have indicted President Trump.”

This statement poses one big problem: It isn’t even close to the full story. Based on this contextually bereft interpretation, however, Nadler announced his committee is filing an application for the grand jury material underlying the Mueller report and will continue to “examine witnesses” and “investigate the president’s misconduct.”

Mueller’s Misstep

The hearing got off to a rough start. Mueller was not a happy witness and was barely cooperating or offering the valuable soundbites Democrats had hoped for. That is, until Rep. Ted Lieu, the California Democrat, questioned him.

Lieu said: “I believe any reasonable person looking at these facts could conclude that all three elements of the crime of obstruction of justice have been met. And I’d like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?”

Mueller replied, “That is correct.”

Democrats got excited. House staffers immediately took to Twitter; they had their “gotcha” moment. According to Vox, “That moment set off a bit of a firestorm among left-leaning watchers. Greg Sargent, a liberal commentator at the Washington Post, tweeted, ‘Whoa!’ Nicholas Kristof, an opinion writer for the New York Times, called Mueller’s response ‘the big news so far’ and ‘very significant.’” Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department press official, tweeted, “I don’t know if this was a misstatement or a Freudian slip, but either way it is undoubtedly true.”

Can’t Stress This Enough

Yet the Democrats’ victory lap got cut short. During his opening statement for the day’s second hearing, Mueller corrected his former statement. He said: “I want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I wanted to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu. It was said, and I quote, ‘You didn’t charge the president because of the OLC opinion.’ That is not the correct way to say it. As we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.”

This is the part of the story Nadler left out, and it’s a pretty big part. Mueller had stated from the very beginning of the hearing that, even going into the investigation, he and his team knew they weren’t going to make a determination on whether the president had committed a crime.

In fact, Mueller said this in his opening statement: “Based on Justice Department policy and principles of fairness, we decided we would not make a decision as to whether the president committed a crime. That was our decision then, and it remains our decision today.”

Again, in an exchange with Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican, Mueller reiterated the point: “Well, as I started today, this afternoon, and added either a footnote or an endnote, what I wanted to clarify is the fact that we did not make any determination with regard to culpability in any way. We did not start that process down — down the road.”

Never Give Up?

Ever since the Mueller report first came out, Democrats have been attempting to draw the same conclusion: Mueller would have indicted Trump for obstruction if the Department of Justice did not have a rule against indicting a sitting president. Every time they draw this conclusion, however, they get rebuffed.

According to Fox News, Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the report stated that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was not enough evidence to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice regardless of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion. Yet after Mueller delivered a public statement about the investigation in May and announced that “charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” there was a great deal of speculation that the OLC opinion was the only thing stopping Mueller from charging the president.

However, both the Justice Department and the special counsel’s office put out a statement that said, “The special counsel’s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the president committed a crime.”

Democrats put so much hope into Mueller’s testimony that they still can’t face the fact that it was a dud. In his opening statement for the House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said, “Welcome, everyone, to the last gasp of the Russia collusion conspiracy theory.” If Mueller’s testimony was Democrats’ last gasp, this new stage is them gulping for air.

5 Real Solutions For The Troubled Cities Democrats Helped Cripple,"After two full nights of presidential debates on CNN, Democrats still have no answers to the problems plaguing America’s most dangerous cities. They were happy to call President Trump a racist for correctly pointing out that Baltimore is in horrific shape, but they are woefully mute on what to do about it.

The Democratic Party’s silence on solutions for the nation’s most suffering cities is ironic given that the latest Democratic debate took place in Detroit, Michigan—according to one study, the second most dangerous city in America. It would have been an appropriate and excellent opportunity for Democrats to speak out on how they’ll restore safety, stability, and prosperity to places like Detroit.

Instead, both debates went by with no new proposals. For the few Americans who watched the debate, all they heard was more name-calling directed at President Trump.

The Democratic Party is fresh out of worthwhile ideas. Its candidates insist that if they only had more money all their failed policies would magically start to work. Yet decades of the Democratic stranglehold on the nation’s most needy cities have turned bad situations into catastrophes. There are, however, steps that can be taken to bring the worse-off of America’s cities back from despair.

1. Promote Marriage, Family, and Responsible Fatherhood

First and foremost, a culture of responsible fatherhood and committed marriage must become the norm if any change is going to take place in America’s most dangerous cities. Beginning with President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “Great Society,” welfare has essentially incentivized single-motherhood and encouraged out-of-wedlock births. This has devastated the black community in particular. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, “[in] 1960, 22 percent of black children were raised with only one parent, usually the mother. Thirty years later, two-thirds of black children were being raised without a father present.”

Cities like St. Louis and Memphis didn’t become hotbeds of crime and poverty overnight. It will take decades, if not generations, to fully repair the damage Democratic policies have caused their social fabric.

Recovery will begin once we act on our knowledge of the role marriage plays in staving off poverty. According to findings from the liberal Brookings Institute, if you wait until 21 to get married and have children, graduate high school, and get a job, you have only a 2 percent chance of being poor in America. Brookings found that for young people who follow that advice, 75 percent join the middle class and earn more than $55,000 a year.

In the most dangerous cities, we need men to start acting like men. Rather than join gangs for community and belonging, men should find in fatherhood the greatest calling of their lives. Fathers staying in the home and proudly helping raise their children to be virtuous young men and women will help end the despair afflicting America’s hurting cities far more than any top-down government policy ever could. The Brookings study also notes, “children in female-headed families are four or more times as likely as children from married-couple families to live in poverty.”

The needed cultural transformation will only come about from increased personal responsibility supported by houses of worship, local communities, friends, family, and private charities. It was government planners—however well-intentioned—who caused much of the mess in the first place. More attempts at government planning will set any recovery back twofold.

2. Greatly Expand Charter Schools and School Vouchers

One of the single greatest things that can be done for future generations of citizens living in America’s most dangerous cities is to take back the educational system from corrupt, public school teacher unions and inept bureaucrats.

Public education has been a complete failure in Baltimore and similarly dangerous cities. It’s clear at this point that more spending will not solve the problem. Only a fundamental paradigm shift will rescue the thousands of children tragically doomed to failure and trapped in a ruinous system.

Charter schools offer a way out. Increasing grants to charter schools and allowing competition and innovation to work in the education sector will allow a flourishing of untold possibilities.

It’s high time for more cities in peril to institute some form of Milton Friedman’s proposed school voucher system. Fifteen states currently have some form of voucher program. It’s a promising start, but nowhere near enough to put a dent in the system, and many existing voucher programs are limited and attempt to regulate private schools into being too much like the public system they would otherwise present an alternative to.

How would it work? Families could take some of what the government is already spending on their child’s education and put it towards private school tuition. For instance, Maryland spends an average of $15,848 per student annually. Under a voucher system, parents would have the option of taking that allocated money—all or a portion—and spending on a school of their choice or keeping their child in the public system for a larger rebate.

This would alleviate the tax burden on families who put their children’s education first. It would give parents greater control over their children’s future and put greater responsibility on all schools to raise their standards. Without vouchers, parents who scrimp and save to send their kids to a better school end up paying twice: first in taxes, second in private school tuition.

Right now, one of the barriers to improving public education is that it functions as a government monopoly. America’s most dangerous cities are precisely where voucher initiatives are needed the most. Unfortunately, they often find resistance from powerful public-school teacher unions.

Without a voucher system, it’s hard for the private schools that do manage to exist in hurting cities to keep their doors open when parents can easily take the “free” public route. Vouchers would force stagnant, inadequate public schools to adapt and innovate or be replaced with better charter or private alternatives.

3. Stabilize Communities With a Strong Police Presence

When leftists say poverty causes crime, they have it precisely backward. Crime causes poverty. Unstable, crime-ridden communities drive productive, entrepreneurial members of society away. Law-abiding citizens don’t want to live in communities with high amounts of theft, homicide, rape, or gang activity, so the moment they can afford it, they leave. Left behind are the criminals and ne’er-do-wells that caused the exodus to begin with. In turn, the situation worsens.

During the Freddie Gray riots of 2015, Baltimore mayor allowed vandals to riot saying, “We gave those who wished to destroy a space to do that.” This sort of approach cannot continue in any major city—let alone the most dangerous ones—if meaningful progress is to be made.

Small business owners need to know that police will help protect their stores from civil unrest, gang violence, and vandalism. Only when order is fully restored, and people respect their community and its surroundings, can economic activity grow and create the jobs needed to revitalize America’s broken cities.

A large, disciplined, and respected police force is needed to stabilize broken communities long enough for law-abiding citizens to feel it is safe enough to return. Constant outreach between police and those they serve is integral to any progress. Residents should know the name of the officers on their neighborhood beat on a first-name basis. Abusive police behavior should be addressed immediately. Both policemen and citizens should be happy to see each other. Building trusting relationships between police and the communities they protect takes time, but it is a worthwhile investment.

4. End All Rent Controls

Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck once remarked, “In many cases rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city—except for bombing.”

Indeed, along with minimum wage mandates, rent control and its associated “affordable housing” policies are prime examples of good intentions having disastrous consequences. Unlike the minimum wage, which functions as a “price floor,” rent control acts as a “price ceiling.” This distorts the true market price of a given apartment or condominium. Like all price controls, this leads to both shortages of rooms to rent as well as a decrease in quality.

As landlords of rent-controlled housing do not receive the real value for their investment, there is no incentive for them to maintain proper upkeep of their properties. The result is the horrific living conditions that one sees in Baltimore, Detroit, and similar cities.

Under rent-controlled housing provisions, everyone loses. Walter Bock points out, “Even with the best will in the world, the landlord sometimes cannot afford to pay his escalating fuel, labor, and materials bills … the incentive he had under free-market conditions to supply tenant services is severely reduced.”

Art Carden of the Mises Institute agrees:

Rent control also destroys landlords’ incentives to maintain the housing stock. With rent control in place, people are lined up for housing, and therefore, the landlord can discriminate on the basis of who will take the most meager accommodations. Eliminating a landlord’s ability to enjoy the return from investing in higher-quality housing means eliminating the landlord’s incentive to invest in basic upkeep.

Removing price controls will open the housing market in America’s most needy cities to the natural forces of supply and demand. Improved neighborhood safety as a result of more effective police presence will allow, in time, businesses and housing developers to create new subdivisions that city dwellers demand.

Just as no government entity had to force Walmart to sell products at cheap prices or McDonald’s to make affordable fast food, a truly free and open housing market will naturally be filled by those who see an opening. Only a free market ensures that houses will be built to the size and cost that citizens will bear.

5. Stop Electing Democrats

Ranking America’s most dangerous cities is an imperfect science, but Sauter, Frohlich, and Lodge’s study is one of the most holistic in its approach. It considered the latest FBI statistics on total violent crime, homicides, unemployment, and the poverty rate (USA Today released the complete list here).

According to their 2018 results, listed below are the top five most dangerous cities in America. Also noted is how long Democrats have controlled the city’s mayoral office and its respective congressional district.

Kansas City, Missouri (#5)—Democratic mayors for 28 years. MO-5 (D) for 70 years.

Memphis, Tennessee (#4)—Democratic mayors for 28 years. TN-9 (D) for 26 years.

Baltimore, Maryland (#3)—Democratic mayors for 52 years. MD-7 (D) for 66 years.

Detroit, Michigan (#2)—Democratic mayors for 57 years. MI-13 (D) for 70 years.

St. Louis, Missouri (#1)—Democratic mayors for 70 years. MO-1 (D) for 70 years.

As the old adage goes, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” So how will the plight of America’s most dangerous cities improve if citizens keep sending the same politicians of the same failed political party back into power? Experiments with Democratic rule in cities like St. Louis, Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, and Kansas City have had decades to work. The results are in, and ruin lies in their wake.

Yes, it’s a tall order to ask Democrats to stop electing Democrats. The better solution would be for them to see the light and become Republicans. Stranger things have happened. After all, the most successful Republican president in history was once a Democrat.

The Republican Party needs to do everything it can to reach out to the communities that have been made worse by failed economic policies and government corruption. In return, the long-suffering people of America’s most broken cities should give the GOP and conservative, freedom-focused policies a chance. At this point, they have nothing left to lose.

The crime that landed him on death row happened on January 11, 1996. He and his partner, Chevie Kehoe, kidnapped a Tilly, Arkansas gun dealer with his wife and stepdaughter. Lewis had burglarized William Mueller’s home a year earlier, and came back believing gold and other valuables were still hidden. He tortured and killed William, then did the same his wife Nancy and, finally, her eight-year old daughter in an attempt to force them to reveal the location of this supposed hidden treasure.

He was convicted of all three murders by a jury of his peers on May 4, 1999. While Kehoe was sentenced to life without parole, prosecutors successfully argued that Lewis’s lack of remorse and long history of violence, even while incarcerated and awaiting trial, demonstrated he was a candidate for the death penalty.

On May 14, the jury returned a verdict of death. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder was asked to withdraw the death notice, but he declined. Nancy Mueller’s mother, Earlene Branch, said, “It’s hard to be a Christian and think of killing somebody. But I don’t see any other answer. I don’t want them out influencing anyone else.”

In the 20 years since, Lewis has exhausted every possible appeal to his death sentence. On July 25, Attorney General William Barr announced that his execution is now scheduled for December 9, 2019. This announcement also noted the scheduling of four others, the first federal executions since 2003.

It is gut-wrenching to read about Lewis’s crimes, even though I have omitted some of the details too terrible for print. And his are the least heinous of the five men scheduled for execution last Friday. These horrific histories are precisely what the families of the victim, first responders, investigators, and juries had to face.

There’s No Doubt This Guy Committed Heinous Crimes

It is quite true to argue abstractly, as Molly Davis did in The Federalist, that no human justice system is perfect. It is quite another thing to argue that Lewis did not, in fact, torture a family of three to death. The fact that some on death row have been exonerated speaks to the value of the appeals process. Now that Lewis has failed his appeals, no one is suggesting that he is innocent.

Evil has a face. Justice requires that we look at it unflinchingly. The same is true when considering crimes of a particularly heinous nature. These details have driven prosecutors, judges,bener and unanimous juries to impose capital punishment even if they found it hard to swallow. It is wrong to suggest that the particulars of the crime are beside the point. They are precisely the point.

For starters, we should note that since capital punishment is reserved for particularly heinous crimes, they are extremely rare in the history of federal law. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, there have been only 34 executions between 1927 and 1963. The next three decades saw none. Then, there were three between 2001 and 2003, including Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people on April 19, 1995.

Dylann Roof is on death row for killing nine members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. So also is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of killing three and injuring 260 by a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon. Videos and dozens of eyewitness accounts establish without any doubt that these men are guilty of heinous crimes. Any rational discussion of capital punishment must begin with facts such as these.

Don’t Like the Law, Change It, Don’t Filibuster

It is also important to accurately report the timing of Barr’s announcement. Mainstream media outlets reported it as though he were unilaterally lifting some federal “moratorium” on the death penalty. There was no such thing.

Calling it a “de facto moratorium” may leave the impression that federal law ended the death penalty. Nothing could be further from the truth. Rather, pharmaceutical corporations conspired to embargo the anesthetic that was administered before executions. This hampered both state and federal abilities to carry out the law.

Later, under the eight years of President Obama, as U.S attorney general Holder simply failed to schedule any of the executions that were entrusted to him by the legislative and judicial branches. Then, in 2014, he instituted a review of all death penalty procedures and protocols.

This review was ongoing when the Trump administration took office and continued while Jeff Sessions served as attorney general. Last Thursday’s announcement by Sessions sucessor Barr accompanied word that the five-year review is now complete.

Presumably as a result of that review, the three-drug procedure used at the last execution in 2003 has been replaced by the single drug, Pentobarbital. This is the same drug Big Pharma is selling in states that have legalized physician-assisted killing.

Capital Punishment Has a Long and Strong History

Having clarified the historical record, we can now turn to ethics. It should be noted at the outset that Western Civilization has always had a place for the just application of capital punishment.

The difference between pagan Roman civilization and the Christian ethos that held sway after Constantine is this: under paganism the government had authority to execute whomever it pleased, regardless of innocence. Under the Christian ethos, capital punishment is reserved for only the guilty.

This principle is founded on the teaching of the Apostle Paul that God Himself gives governments the “sword” to “execute wrath on him who practices evil” (Romans 13:4 NKJV). This, in turn, is based on the charge given after Noah’s Flood, “whoever sheds man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed” (Genesis 9:6).

Some People’s Crimes Make Their Lives Forfeit

Note well that the death penalty rests upon the assertion that “evil” is not defined by the government, but by God. The government, as God’s “minister,” must recognize it as evil and punish it accordingly. Perhaps this explains why those who were first to oppose the death penalty were avowed atheists.

Robespierre, the henchman of the French Revolution, sought to repeal the death penalty. He wrote a pamphlet against it in 1791 before guillotining 40,000 countrymen in 1793 and 1794. Likewise, in February 1917, the provisional government of the Bolshevik Revolution banned the death penalty. In the century prior to this, the tsar had executed approximately six people. In the seven decades following the Revolution, tens of millions of citizens were killed by hard labor, starvation, exposure, and the firing squad.

Governments are established by God and chartered to discern between objective good and objective evil as His representative. When a nation forgets or denies this fact, it does not become more just. It fails in its primary task and colludes in evil.

Justice Includes Punishment, Not Merely Rehabilitation

Modern arguments against the death penalty deny the very definition of penalty. In his classic essay, “The Humanitarian Theory of Punishment,” C. S. Lewis points out that progressive ideology replaces justice and penalty with criminal reform and effective deterrence. A jury of peers is perfectly suited to decide matters of justice. But the same jury is unqualified to act as experts on effective reform and deterrence.

Lacking straightforward penalties and a common sense of justice, then, the penal system relies on “experts” to prescribe sentences of indefinite duration and psychological manipulation to effect what they describe as rehabilitation. Once a government has discarded the idea that God defines evil and prescribes its punishment, its fearsome power is no longer limited. Prisons easily become camps to reeducate whoever resists the latest orthodoxy.

Kylee Zempel, also in The Federalist, helpfully points out that the five objectives of the criminal justice system still include retribution. While the other four objectives (deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and restoration) may enter into the argument, they can only be tangential. Often, they appear as red herrings.

At its root, capital punishment is about just retribution. Here again, the imperfection of human systems comes into play. Zempel cites “Flawed Criminal Justice Policies,” to the effect that “Retribution fails” if one jury imposes the death penalty where another jury does not. This argument sacrifices the good to the perfect. It uses an impossible standard of measure to overthrow what is objectively just and right.

Ending the Death Penalty Would Teach the Wrong Things

All agree that to abolish the death penalty is to make a statement. Some believe it’s a statement that life is too valuable to take. Others conclude that the lives of the victims are not valuable enough to avenge. Whatever it teaches about the lives of victim and perpetrator, it chiefly teaches something about the source and authority of government.

Ultimately, every law, from jaywalking to grand larceny, is enforced at the point of a gun. G. K. Chesterton writes in “What’s Wrong with the World,” “every statute is a declaration of war, to be backed by arms.” If government does not have the legitimate, God-given authority to take life, it has no legitimate authority at all. It has no authority to wage just wars. It has no authority to enforce just laws.

Talk of government’s basis in “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” triggers secularist sensibilities. It raises fears of a theocracy dependent upon some private revelation. Such fear is unfounded. Precisely because godly governments are established to rule believer and unbeliever alike, just laws rest on the laws written into nature and not upon the revelation of the gospel.

Either God Defines Good, or Governments Will Do It Badly

Nor should we ever forget that the very notion of a limited government derives from an understanding that government is “under God.” If a government is not limited by God, what else is capable of limiting it? Take God out of the equation and governments tend toward totalitarianism. We have seen this principle in both the French and Bolshevik Revolutions of the past, and currently in communist China. How many more examples are needed to prove the point?

Capital punishment acknowledges both the existence of objective evil and human government’s responsibility to execute justice. To conflate it with the killing of the innocent is reprehensible. For this reason, every check and balance must be followed scrupulously to ensure that innocents are not mistakenly put to death. The Innocence Project deserves our support. But it is precisely for the protection of innocent life that some crimes require capital punishment.

The pending execution of five human beings is a terrible thing. What would be more terrible still is to deny that just societies have the right to do it, and the responsibility to do it justly.

Top Tweets Of Night Two Of The Second Round Of Democratic Debates,"Did you have enough of the Democratic debates on Tuesday, when the first ten candidates had their battle royal? (Or in Sanders’s case, the battle proletarian?) Was the thought of another three hours watching ten people boast about how much of your life they want to control just too much to bear?

Fear not: we’ve collected the best tweets about the round two of the Democratic debate from Detroit. You can feel like you really watched it without the discomfort of having to have actually done so.

CNN started, as they did last night, with an NFL-style intro segment.

I can’t believe I’m subjecting myself to a second night of this — LB (@beyondreasdoubt) August 1, 2019

i absolutely hate these monday night football lead ins — b-boy bouiebaisse (@jbouie) August 1, 2019

This CNN debate intro is everything that’s wrong with cable news. Politics isn’t a game show! — Stephen Wolf (@PoliticsWolf) August 1, 2019

Who Am I? Why Am I Here?

Some of the candidates used the opening statement time to remind the viewers who they were and that they existed. Michael Bennet of Colorado did so at an oddly leisurely pace.

Is Michael Bennett getting a software update while talking? — Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) August 1, 2019

Sounds like Bennet might have hit some weed before the debate. — Ned Ryun (@nedryun) August 1, 2019

Compared to the night before, the atmosphere on stage was subdued.

de Blasio got heckled and Inslee had to remind people who he is so great start for them — Ben McDonald (@Bmac0507) August 1, 2019

Did someone put downers in the green room water? — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) August 1, 2019

It got kind of lively in the audience, though.

Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones, But Obamacare Can’t Fix Them

The first topic again tonight was healthcare. Kamala Harris has been all over the map about what she says she would do to Americans’ health insurance, and the candidates took the opportunity to pile on her from every direction. She did not handle it well.

Kamala Harris feels low energy right now. — Ned Ryun (@nedryun) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris doesn’t care about or understand policy. It’s weird she wants to be President. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) August 1, 2019

Harris is all over the place when it comes to a private plan. She’s against it. She’s for it. She doesn’t know what she’s doing. — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 1, 2019

“The cost of doing nothing is far too expensive.” Every time I hear that, I think of the salesman: “Don’t think that you can’t afford this car. Think that you can’t afford not to buy this car!” — Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) August 1, 2019

Biden has Harris on the ropes here. — Jim Swift (@JimSwiftDC) August 1, 2019

Cory Booker stayed out of it, and just wanted everyone to be nice and stop all this debating.

Booker maybe doesn’t realize that pitting Democrats against each other is sort of the point of a Democratic primary debate? — John Daniel Davidson (@johnddavidson) August 1, 2019

Cory, once again, playing Lex Luthor’s boring son. — GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) August 1, 2019

Kirsten Gillibrand jumped in briefly.

#DemDebate: Gillibrand’s really worked up about health care for someone who spent years as a big-shot attorney for Big Tobacco, no? — Lenny Dykstra (@LennyDykstra) August 1, 2019

But Tulsi Gabbard really stole the show.

Harris first emphasizes Sebelius’ love of her plan, which Gabbard criticizes as crony capitalism since Sebelius has financial interests in it, and then Harris says Sebelius merely endorsed it, didn’t write it. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) August 1, 2019

Kamala: my plan was written by the same person who wrote Obamacare. Tulsi: that would be Kathleen Sabelius and she is absolute scum. Kamala: WRONG SHE ENDORSED IT SHE DIDNT WRITE IT. — The Red-Headed Libertarian (@TRHLofficial) August 1, 2019

Tulsi Gabbard turning the Sebelius plug against Harris. That was a surgical strike. #DemDebate — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris touting the endorsement of the only person fired over the Obamacare rollout debacle is pretty great. — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) August 1, 2019

Harris’s health plan makes no goddamn sense. I mean that literally. — Richard M. Nixon (@dick_nixon) August 1, 2019

Gabbard also tried to get some of that Marianne Williamson magic going in her answer.

the “sick care system” line is functionally identical to Williamson’s “sickness care system” https://t.co/dQclic3MPA — Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) August 1, 2019

Meanwhile, Harris tried to steal Elizabeth Warren’s non-answer from last night, but the luster was wearing off.

Pinned down on health care, Harris cribs the “GOP talking point line” to rebut Bennet from last night. — Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) August 1, 2019

“Republican talking points” = basic questions for which Democrats have no answers — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) August 1, 2019

Kamala didn’t like Tulsi’s answer…. at all. — Mickey White (@BiasedGirl) August 1, 2019

De Blasio jumped in to say whatever was on his mind, but no one was interested.

de Blasio is the most annoying candidate up on that stage. Maybe ever on any stage. — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 1, 2019

DeBlasio straight up endorsing banning private insurance — Ben McDonald (@Bmac0507) August 1, 2019

BILL DE BLASIO HAS MURDERED TOO MANY ANIMALS HE SHOULD NOT BE ON THIS STAGE MAY THE GROUNDHOG REST IN PEACE — Shoshana Weissmann, Sloth Committee Chair (@senatorshoshana) August 1, 2019

Bennet tried to talk them back into the mainstream, but no one was interested in that.

Michael Bennet on keeping private insurance: “This has nothing to do with Republican talking points. It has everything to do with having faith in the American public that they can make their own choice for their families.” #DemDebate — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) August 1, 2019

Coming To America

They moved next to immigration, with Julian Castro of Texas getting the first chance to answer. After over-enunciating some place names, he tried Harris’s Jedi mind trick on the question of open borders.

“Open borders is a right-wing talking point,” Julian Castro says when asked to respond to criticism from… Obama’s DHS Sec. Jeh Johnson. — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) August 1, 2019

“Open borders is a right wing talking point. No one is saying that.” — @JulianCastro at #DemDebate Libertarians: pic.twitter.com/WDG6Za8JQw — Kat Murti (@KatMurti) August 1, 2019

He criticized Biden for not stopping deportations when he was a member of the Obama adminstration.

Biden attacks Castro for not raising his voice on deportations while he was a member of the Obama administration (fair point) — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) August 1, 2019

Biden will not hear Obama’s name spoken in vain.

Joe Biden defends Obama administration deportations citing DACA, Dream Act, and aid to Central America — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) August 1, 2019

De Blasio jumps in to say the same thing Castro already said.

Bill de Blasio with a good question to Biden. Do you agree with Obama’s awful immigration policy? Once again, there’s criticism of former United States President and current Instagram influencer Barack Obama. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) August 1, 2019

Biden brushes the unpopular mayor aside.

So far Biden looks energized. Ensure works, gang. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) August 1, 2019

Joe Biden ain’t no groundhog, Mister Mayor. — Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) August 1, 2019

I am really surprised that everyone but Biden on the stage appears to be good with bashing Obama on what his administration didn’t do. Polling suggests that Obama remains VERY popular among Democrats. — Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) August 1, 2019

I say this with no partisan rancor, but does anyone in America like Bill De Blasio? Are there DeBlasibros? — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) August 1, 2019

The moderators asked Gillibrand to join in, but she wasn’t paying attention.

Lock ‘Em Up

The next topic was crime, and who was the softest on it. According to the more progressive candidates, crime in America has one cause: Joe Biden.

Joe Biden just said prisoners should be given access to resources when they step out of jail, like Pell grants, but Biden’s 1994 crime bill literally took away Pell grants from felons. — Lee Fang (@lhfang) August 1, 2019

Booker tried to make the point, but Biden replied with the gritty details of Booker’s two terms as mayor of Newark.

Joe Biden just wiped the floor with Bookers shitty job as Mayor #DemDebate — Armani Salado (@historyofarmani) August 1, 2019

Booker had a clever rejoinder, but didn’t refute any of what Biden actually said.

Also, Biden’s three points against Booker on policing in Newark were all 100% accurate, but Booker somehow made it all go away with “You’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor” — Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) August 1, 2019

Inexplicably, they now returned to last debate’s kerfuffle over the fifty-year-old fight about busing.

WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BUSING AGAIN — Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris wasn’t gaining enough traction so she went back to Joe Biden being racist. #DemDebate — Christopher Bedford (@CBedfordDC) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris just said she would’ve been on the other side of the aisle from Joe Biden in the 70s…so, a Republican? — Andrea Ruth (@AndreaNRuth) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris says if she’d been in the Senate while Biden was there then she would have supported federally mandated busing (but at this present time presumably she does not?) — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) August 1, 2019

Back to crime, Andrew Yang chimed in with the dollars and cents.

OK, it sounds like Yang will offer me more than $1,000 if I stay out of jail. — James Taranto (@jamestaranto) August 1, 2019

Meanwhile, Biden riposted with some extremely factual attacks on Harris’s tenure as attorney general of California.

Uh oh. Harris’s record as AG in California. This is the punch Biden was waiting for.#DemDebate2 — Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) August 1, 2019

It appears Biden has been paying attention to the oppo files — Garrett Ventry (@GarrettVentry) August 1, 2019

Biden alluded to a scandal that resulted in more than 1,000 drug cases being dismissed. Gabbard claimed Harris “blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until she was forced to do so.” Both of these statements are accurate.https://t.co/X4hGEEr4GQ — Alex Daugherty (@alextdaugherty) August 1, 2019

Harris says “I am proud of the work we did” about her time as AG, that they had to fix Biden’s crime policies. Then why did she continue so many of them? https://t.co/K0I38kxYER — Elizabeth Nolan Brown (@ENBrown) August 1, 2019

Gabbard joined the attack and was even more effective. See for yourself!

Joe Biden isn’t the only one being attacked tonight. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard didn’t hold back when she took on Sen. Kamala Harris’ criminal justice record. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/7eZE6v6ZHW — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) August 1, 2019

Apparently Gabbard just tore Harris a new one over her record in California. https://t.co/Bnku9l6WVI — Amy Curtis (@RantyAmyCurtis) August 1, 2019

Head For The Hills

When the conversation turned to global warming, Yang had a powerful message: GET OUT.

Andrew Yang with some serious doom and gloom on Climate Change: It is too late. Move to higher ground. — Will Upton ⚙️⏩ (@wupton) August 1, 2019



Jay Inslee also chatted apocalyptically about his signature issue and Biden doubled down on Obama’s legacy.

So Joe Biden just said his goal is to bankrupt coal, fracking and the fossil fuel industry and virtually every Democrat on stage agreed with him. But yes, these Dems will be able to beat Trump in the rust belt. — Andrew Surabian (@Surabees) August 1, 2019

Di Blasio promised to free the earth of lead, but the evidence suggests otherwise.

This would have been an appropriate promo for the debate. pic.twitter.com/iQD3Gla5nC — Caleb Howe (@CalebHowe) August 1, 2019

By now, Harris and Biden began to fade into the background. For Harris it was not embarrassment—she is incapable of such—but perhaps out of feeling wounded by the onslaught of logic against her nonsensical platform.

For Biden, the reason was simpler: it was past his bedtime. The other candidates took advantage, and pushed their weird ideas onto the crowd.

Tapper: How would you enforce non-proliferation in Iran.

Closing Time

There was a brief break to genuflect to Planned Parenthood.

It’s amazing that there was an entire discussion about the Hyde Amendment without a single moderator pointing out that “health care services” was a just euphemism for state-funded abortions. — David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) August 1, 2019

Also some foreign policy:

Jake Tapper asks Cory Booker if troops will be brought home from Afghanistan within his first year in office and he dodges the question. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) August 1, 2019

Both Booker & Gabbard we’re asked the same question: “If elected, would you bring all our troops home from Afghanistan within your first term?”@TulsiGabbard Gabbard answered the question. She said yes. @CoryBooker didn’t answer the question. He just preened. — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 1, 2019

Asked about impeachment and the possibility of putting President Trump in jail, Harris revived.

It was, in fact, an appropriate place to leave us. For nearly three hours, we heard warnings of doom and promises of earthly salvation. Vast plans, rich in details, blessed by the finest wonks Washington had to offer.

To listen to them, with enough taxes, enough regulations, and maybe a few prison sentences—looking at you Kamala—we could make this whole world wonderful for everyone. There’s no downside, no trade-offs, no costs whatsoever: just good intentions transformed into perfect, technocratic results.

‘White Supremacy’ Report Used To Attack Tucker Reinforces His Point,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson stepped into a gigantic mess Tuesday night when he said white supremacy is “not a real problem in America,” or at least not as real a problem as issues that affect millions, like suicide rates, the opioid crisis, and a declining middle class.

Carlson’s comments came, of course, after someone who espoused anti-immigrant views slaughtered 22 human beings in an El Paso, Texas Walmart. Rather than solely blame the shooter, the media and Democrats leaped to his political ideology as a convenient way to slam anyone who holds some semblance of anti-immigration thought, from President Donald Trump to Carlson (of course, they ignored the potential politics behind the less-narrative-convenient Dayton shooter).

Not being one to shy away from an issue, the Fox News host tackled it head on during Tuesday night’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” After making the point that Trump has never endorsed white supremacy, Carlson called the whole issue “a lie.”

“If you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns of problems this country faces, where would white supremacy be on the list? Right up there with Russia probably,” said the Fox News host. “It’s actually not a real problem in America. The combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country would be able to fit inside a college football stadium.”

“This is a country where the average person is getting poorer, where the suicide rate is spiking — ‘white supremacy, that’s the problem’ — this is a hoax,” he continued. “Just like the Russia hoax, it’s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power.”

The outrage mob predictably came out in full force. Right above a call to boycott his advertisers, immigration legal assistance organization RAICES wrote, “It’s time Fox News fires Tucker Carlson. His comments put our lives in danger and have already led to murders.”

“Tucker Carlson’s claim that the threat of domestic white supremacists is a ‘hoax’ is a dangerous lie,” wrote Mia Farrow. Young Turks host John Iadarola called Tucker a “white supremacist.”

There were plenty more, all over the social network. The hashtags #FireTuckerCarlson and #BoycottTuckerCarlson were trending Wednesday, and everyone who was anyone left-of-center on Twitter was wringing his hands, declaring his virtue, and condemning Carlson as some sort of “racist” for daring to proclaim an obvious truth. By the sheer level of histrionics, you’d be forgiven if you thought what prompted all this was the Klan marching down your city’s main street in force carrying a burning cross to plant in front of your local Martin Luther King Jr. statue.

“Tucker Carlson said last night that white supremacy isn’t a ‘real problem’ in the United States,” wrote CNN reporter Daniel Dale above a video clip quoting Anti-Defamation League (ADL) source material to try to refute Carlson. “This is almost too ridiculous to fact check, but here are a few numbers from me on the extent of the problem.”

Many pundits busy using “facts” to condemn Tucker, including The Forward in this Wednesday anti-Carlson article, are generally relying on this ADL report, called “Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2018.” But take a gander through their list of examples and you’ll find that not all is what you might expect.

Here are a few to illustrate. James Mathis and his wife, Amanda Oakes, allegedly murdered their six-month-old son and put his body in a freezer. Apparently this was an “extremist” crime and warranted inclusion since Mathis had been in a white supremacist prison gang while serving a stint in the joint.

Richard Starry, another man who joined a white supremacist group in prison, killed four family members before killing himself. Local police said they were baffled over the motive, and I can find no indication from local reports that it had anything to do with race or politics. One of the victims included the shooter’s father, who would obviously have shared his ethnicity.

Jeremy Shaw and his wife, Lorena, were charged with a bevy of crimes revolving around a plot to murder a stranger and steal his property using an adverse possession scheme Shaw had been researching. Neither were charged with hate crimes, but the ADL still saw fit to include them in their list since “Nazi and white supremacist-themed items” were later found in Shaw’s home. And because it inflates the narrative they want to sell.

Joshua Daniel Miller made the list after killing a man at his ex-wife’s house during an argument. The reason for his inclusion? He was “involved with militia and Three Percenter groups.” That alone doesn’t make his actual crime anything related to white supremacy.

The Waffle House shooter, Travis Reinking, is listed because he called himself a “sovereign citizen” at some point, but even the ADL report admits that the shooting “appears to have been non-ideological in nature.”

Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland shooter, is listed even though “little evidence has so far emerged to suggest that the MSDHS shooting spree itself was conducted as a white supremacist attack.”

And then there are the “white supremacist” black folks: “Demetrius Alexander Brown, a self-proclaimed Moorish sovereign citizen, was arrested for the fatal shooting of Sharmine Pack following a dispute about a vehicle sale at an auto repair shop,” ADL writes. Well, don’t take my word for it, Google “Demetrius Alexander Brown” and see if you can tie that guy to white nationalism. While you’re at it, Google “Tierre Guthrie” and “Malachi Qaadir Dorns,” two other killers who made the ADL list.

I get it. The report says “Murder and Extremism,” so the report is technically accurate in that these murderers happened to be extremists of some form at some point in their lives. But why is the media using this report and others like it to overplay the “threat” of “white supremacy”? Their murders were clearly not all done in the name of this reprehensible worldview. It’s disingenuous to claim otherwise.

“Every extremist killing in the US in 2018 had a link to a right-wing extremism,” Business Insider brilliantly declared before linking to the report. In other words, to prop up the lie that “extremists” are rampantly committing violent, racially motivated crimes in America, any crime by an extremist of any race is cited, whether or not that crime had anything to do with “white supremacy.”

Specifically, the ADL report lists “50 extremist-related killings” in 2018. Shave that number down by the ones I mentioned and more (I didn’t even factcheck them all), and you’ve likely got fewer than 20 for 2018 alone. It’s too many, and the 22 lives taken in El Paso are too many as well, but neither does this equate to the Klan marching down the street and lynching folks at will.

Yes, white extremism is on the rise and should be countered, just as any other form of extremism should be. And yes, there are certainly horrifying instances of extremist violence motivated by white supremacy. The Tree of Life Synagogue shooter, the Charleston church shooter, and the El Paso Walmart shooter are three prominent examples.

However, in the grand scheme of things, these horrific actions represent a tiny fraction of crimes in America, yet seem to get 90 percent of the media coverage. To paraphrase Tucker Carlson, imagine how many lives could be saved if everyone focused on America’s much bigger problems.

How Sicily’s War On The Mob Can Help Baltimore With Controlling Crime,"Many residential areas of Baltimore are controlled by groups of powerful gang members who rule over the people in their neighborhoods who abide by the laws of the state. In the absence of constant and visible police presence, this ruler-ruled dynamic can harden into a siege-like situation in which people live in constant fear and with curtailed mobility.

Such an environment provides the backdrop for a typical Baltimore scene: A brazen shooting takes place in broad daylight within sight and hearing of dozens of witnesses. But, somehow, no one “sees” or “hears” anything. And so it goes, week after week, year after year.

This isn’t the worst such situation that ever was. When I consider lawlessness, gangsterism, and mayhem in all its negative glory, my imagination wanders to ponder the experience of Sicily. So many legendary films, television shows, and news accounts have trained us to think of the island as a haven for urban gangsters and rural dons.

For centuries, Sicily was known as a land where justice administered by the government barely existed, and the populace had adopted, by necessity, the rigid, secretive, honor-bound code of the criminal underworld. Every interaction was personal. Perpetual offenses and vengeances tussled in an endless cycle of vendettas, large and small.

Things were at their worst in Sicily sometime about the middle of the 16th century. A new Spanish viceroy had gone to the island in a desperate attempt to stymie the all-out criminal warfare that plagued the cities and the countryside. His name was Juan de Vega.

After settling in and immersing himself in the mayhem, he came up with an idea: What if he were to empower witnesses to capital crimes with judicial powers? How could one go about maximizing and leveraging the courage of informants among the weak?

Empowering Witnesses

At the time, the number of law enforcement officers in all of Sicily about matched the number on Western District shift here in Baltimore on any given night. The judicial system, however, was not only intact but was multilayered and ubiquitous. De Vega reasoned that, if he conferred pardoning powers upon witnesses and informants, their value in the community would rise, and they would eventually assume a protected status.

Here’s how this worked: A witnesses B commit a murder. The judicial system bestows upon A “the right” to pardon C for an unrelated misdemeanor crime. This was not protection or hiding people away. Rather, the court literally “deputized” the witness, thus giving him power and status in the community (and in the legal system) that he didn’t have before.

In our common law legal system, which is even more flexible than the Roman law regime that prevailed in De Vega’s Sicily, we can conceive of this as a form of “microtribunal” based on certain novel jurisdictional ideas derived from medieval English law. In feudal times, myriad inferior courts existed throughout the kingdom that administered justice independent of any higher or broader bodies.

These ranged from manorial courts, where justice was administered on behalf of a baron concerning the affairs of an estate, to hundred courts, which judged the criminal actions that took place among groups of 100 families, to the Marshalsea Court, which settled disputes among royal domestic servants, to, finally, the Court of Pie Poudre (referencing the dusty feet of those who sought justice therein), the lowest and quickest court of all, and judge and judged were literally “peers.”

These courts, which are often called “franchise jurisdictions,” were created to dole out justice and preserve order at the most local level. Think of such a court in a small area, such as Sandtown here in west Baltimore, and apply De Vega’s template: A witness to, say, a gangland shootout receives jurisdiction instead of conventional protection or immunity.

In exchange for her testimony, she is sworn in as a magistrate of such a microtribunal. The city then cedes jurisdiction (from the circuit and district levels) over a selection of locally committed misdemeanors or felonies to this “court.” This “court” passes nothing on to higher courts (except on appeal, which would be on the basis of jurisdictional trespass). This puts maximum judicial power in the hands of a witnessing citizen and explicitly omits paternalistic oversight.

Establishing Authority

So the witness is no longer cowering and on the run. She has a gavel in her hand, and everyone in the neighborhood knows it. She’s earned this position on the basis of her successful testimony in the shooting case. Those in the area who believe that “snitches” should be punished have two options: 1) attack a sworn judicial official of the state or 2) accede to her authority by letting her dispense justice over unrelated (but hyper-local) matters.

In this manner, De Vega cleared entire Sicilian cities and areas of the countryside of gangsters and thieves because the informant transformed into a person of tangible influence in the community. How can a gang member target an individual who has the authority to reprieve members of his own “squad”?

Any state legislature could create such a body, just as the law has established traffic, juvenile, probate, and other courts in the past, so it’s certainly doable.

Eradicating Crime

I don’t know if Baltimore could actually set up such a system of witness protection, but I do know we’re in need of creative and novel solutions to this problem. Among the hundreds of examples, take the multiple shooting that took place on Ramsay Street here back on May 9, in which two toddlers were shot. Dozens of people saw the crime take place, but no one “witnessed” it.

Now, take this microtribunal system and employ it: A bystander comes forward with a description or a name. Localized government gives her judicial authority over another unrelated case involving a crime committed by a different person on the very same block. Upon being sworn in as a magistrate, this witness stands tall and strong in the community.

Obviously, the case would still have to be proven, and the possibility of false witnessing exists, but here’s the kicker: Dozens of neighbors witnessed the crime too. If everyone from the shooter to the senior citizen on the porch across the way know the culprit’s identity, all the power is in service of the witness who came forward and was sworn as a magistrate. Now the shooter would be confronting an officer of the court and not just a meek bystander.

As you may have noticed, the police departments don’t have a prominent role in this experiment, and the fact that a system of franchise jurisdiction can operate without a massive show of force is yet another recommending factor. All it would take is a functional city sheriff’s department (to supply bailiffs) and a modicum of political creativity. In a massive fulcrum move, the microtribunal concept shifts responsibility away from law enforcement and puts the weight onto our highly evolved legal system.

Such a thought experiment may seem wacky and unrealistic to you, but it operated at absolute street level in Spanish Sicily. What other sort of solution can you think of that executes justice at curb and stoop without armor and weapons?",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/14/sicilys-war-mob-can-help-baltimore-controlling-crime/,2019-08-14
"I’m A Professor, And I Carry A Gun On Campus. Here’s Why","I am an ethics professor, and I carry a concealed handgun in the classroom. In the event of a mass shooting, I am the first line of defense between my students and an attacker. I refuse to let myself and my students be victims.

I’m sure many of my fellow professors would disagree with my actions. In fact, many would probably brand me as a traitor to academia for admitting such a thing. For them, it is inconceivable that a member of the intelligentsia — an ethics professor, of all people — could support the right to carry a so-called instrument of death.

So in what follows, let me make the moral case for campus carry. Those wanting a more rigorous statement of my argument may be interested in reading one of my academic journal articles on the topic.

The Moral Case for Campus Carry

Campus carry is simply an extension of our natural right of self-defense. Our right to life follows us wherever we go, so the right to defend our lives must also accompany us. Whether I am at home, in my car, at work, or in the classroom, I possess the absolute and unrelenting right to defend myself against unjust aggression. Because firearms enhance that right, there exists a strong presumption in favor of being allowed to own and carry a firearm as I go about my daily business.

That presumption may sometimes be overcome (such as in courthouses, prisons, or airports), but only if the government assumes the special responsibility of protecting those citizens whom it disarms through the coercive power of the law. In other words, if the government is going to tell us we can’t carry guns in a specific area, thus impairing our ability to defend ourselves, it must assume a special responsibility to protect us. It must serve the function our guns would provide had we been allowed to carry them.

An analogy might help illustrate this point. Suppose I push you into deep water as part of a swimming lesson. Because I have intentionally put you into a position of increased vulnerability, I owe it to you to make sure you do not drown. Likewise, if the government requires us to disarm ourselves before entering a specific area, it knowingly puts us in a position of increased vulnerability. It must therefore assume the special responsibility of making up for the gap it has created by increasing protective measures.

The government meets this special responsibility only if it can provide a means of defense equivalent to the one it has coercively stripped away. In the real world, this means it must maintain a pervasive armed presence in the places in which it has disarmed us.

The presence of an ordinary police force does not meet this requirement. Police responses almost always come after someone has already committed a crime. According to data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, only 47.3 percent of all personal crimes in 2008 were even reported to police. Of these crimes, only 28 percent of police responses came within five minutes of reporting, 30.3 percent within six to 10 minutes, and 33.5 percent within 11 minutes to one hour of reporting.

Clearly, for resisting attack, the police cannot play the same role as people can by carrying their own guns. The only government apparatus capable of effectively intervening in the midst of a crime is one in which police or other law enforcement officials are present everywhere, which is neither attainable nor desirable.

An ever-vigilant law enforcement presence obviously isn’t feasible in the vast majority of “gun-free” zones, especially college campuses. Even though many colleges and universities maintain their own dedicated police departments, they lack the manpower to maintain a pervasive armed presence. Given the scarcity of police protection in relation to the large areas these officers must protect, the government cannot adequately meet its special duty of protection on campuses. As such, qualified students, staff, and faculty should be allowed to carry guns on campuses.

It is absurd to think one forfeits the right to defend his life simply by entering a classroom. The right of self-defense is essential to our very dignity as human beings. Although we may sometimes partially delegate this responsibility to others, we can never delegate it completely. Even in the most secure college campus, the police response to an active shooter is measured in minutes. But when seconds matter, it is up to students and faculty to defend their own lives. And they cannot do this without a reasonable and effective means of self-defense.

The empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that forcefully resisting violent crime with a gun is associated with lower injury rates and successful resistance. Studies consistently find that defensive gun use is beneficial for both men and women.

Guns also have deterrent effects aside from their use in disrupting crimes in progress. Criminals tend to pick “soft” targets, so the mere possibility of forceful resistance from victims serves as a disincentive that may prevent shootings before they even begin. Why not extend these benefits to primary and secondary school teachers, college students, and college faculty?

Bad Arguments Against Campus Carry

Some argue campus carry creates a difficult situation for responding police officers, who will be unable to determine the good guys from the bad guys. But this objection proves too much: It applies to any situation in which the police encounter a victim who is successfully resisting an attack. If the mere possibility of mistaken identity is enough to justify a ban on campus carry, it would also justify a ban on any kind of forceful self-defense measure.

Simply because the police may have difficulty distinguishing between criminals and victims does not mean victims forfeit their right to forceful self-defense. Our right to self-defense is not a function of the ability of the police to protect us, but a basic dignity grounded in our right to life.

Many opponents of campus carry argue college-aged students are prone to excessive alcohol consumption and other reckless behavior that would make carrying more dangerous. While this may be true when considering college students in general, this does not take into account the fact that concealed carry permit holders tend to be more law-abiding than non-permit holders across all age groups. The common stereotype of college students as reckless party animals does not apply to the subset of students who are licensed to carry weapons.

Another objection is that civilians don’t have enough training to defend themselves and others while under pressure. This objection is simply false. First, one does not need to be an expert with firearms to use them successfully. As I’ve pointed out, studies consistently show that individuals do just fine when defending themselves with firearms, despite their relative lack of training compared to police officers. Even for the untrained, guns are still their best bet.

Second, just as some defense is better than no defense, having a weapon is better than having no weapon at all. If I find myself in a situation in which I must defend myself or others against a gunman, I would much rather trust my life to my gun than to my ability to tackle the shooter. Studies show armed resistance is more effective than unarmed resistance, so if I’m going to defend myself with a weapon, I’d prefer it be the kind of weapon that best guarantees a successful outcome. In that respect, nothing compares to a gun.

The final objection I wish to consider is that guns don’t belong in classrooms because they have a “chilling effect” on the free exchange of ideas. As a professor who lectures on controversial topics all the time, I regard this as pure nonsense. Self-protection is the guardian of free expression, not its enemy.

A world in which we are the most free to express our ideas is one in which we are entitled to protect ourselves from persecution for holding the ideas we have. This isn’t to say we all must carry guns on us at all times, but that self-protection complements free speech. Besides, this objection also proves too much: If allowing access to a means of self-defense is inherently at odds with free expression, this argument would apply to all kinds of self-defense, not just guns.

Earlier, I pointed out that those who carry concealed weapons tend to be extremely law-abiding. If this is true, there is no good reason to fear those who are armed for self-protection. Such fears are unfounded and promote a mistaken perception of gun carriers. Indeed, the exact opposite may very well be true: In the same way that a police presence might lead to a greater perception of safety, many people may feel safer knowing that qualified students and faculty are carrying weapons for self-defense.

Addition: Since publishing this article I have received numerous questions about the legality of what I do. I fully comply with all applicable laws and recommend the same to others.

Stop Complaining About Kim Kardashian Employing A Freed Inmate,"Kim Kardashian West chose Alice Marie Johnson alongside many other nontraditional models of all ages and sizes to model her new SKIMS shapewear line, and surprisingly, many aren’t happy about it.

After featuring Johnson in a short Skims video advertisement on social media, Kardashian West was hit with harsh press attention from a variety of news outlets and Twitter users. The critical press is ill-conceived and fails to recognize Johnson’s autonomy as a free and consenting adult, a position that’s still fairly new to her, as she was released from prison just over a year ago.

The media should be celebrating Kardashian West’s choice to feature Johnson as a win for feminism and criminal justice advocacy alike. The advertisement brings awareness to Johnson’s awful story of imprisonment and the downfalls of the U.S. justice system, while showing that the clothing line is meant for women of all ages, shapes, and sizes.

In 2018, Kardashian West worked with President Trump to help free Johnson from federal prison in Alabama. Johnson was incarcerated for her involvement in a cocaine conspiracy in 1996. After being sentenced to life in prison, she sat there for more than 20 years for a crime that, on its own, is nonviolent. But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t serious.

Johnson worked as a middleman communicator to help facilitate multimillion-dollar transactions selling and transporting cocaine. Johnson fully admits to making “a series of bad decisions” that resulted in her “desperate (and illegal) attempt to make money” through drug trafficking. Because of the extent of her involvement, some even argue she didn’t deserve presidential clemency. Kardashian West is not one of those people.

The Media Attacks Johnson and Kardashian West

After Kardashian West heard about Johnson’s case, she worked to free the grandmother from unnecessary incarceration, sparking a strong relationship with Johnson throughout the fight for her freedom. Yes, Johnson was involved in a large drug operation, but Kardashian West, as well as many others who empathized with Johnson, did not believe she should be locked up for the rest of her life for her crimes.

Johnson highlights her powerful story in the Skims advertisement, telling viewers that the brand makes her feel free in a new way, free to wear whatever she wants. A play on words, sure, but how is getting paid to tell her story while advertising a clothing brand a bad thing? One USA Today headline reads “Ex-prisoner Alice Marie Johnson is hawking Kim Kardashian West’s SKIMS shapewear line.” The use of the word “hawking” is inappropriate, and portrays Johnson as an aggressive hunter looking to do something devious, which couldn’t be further from the truth.

In the Daily Beast, Alaina Demopoulos writes that “Halloween must have come early” because “the Skims team dressed Johnson up as a PR prop, touting a woman who should be celebrating her deserved, tortuously earned clemency.” This is yet another awful characterization of the advertisement, and shameful, at best.

The article portrays Johnson as a victim of exploitation but fails to mention that Johnson is a grown woman who clearly consented to being a part of this project — and was likely amply compensated. From a quick look at Johnson’s Twitter page, it’s clear she’s excited about it too. Claiming Kardashian West is merely using her as a “PR prop” is humiliating.

America’s Criminal Justice System Is Broken

If anything, putting the spotlight on Johnson through a clothing line advertisement is giving much needed attention to her egregious case. It’s a genius way to spark interest in her story of injustice with a crowd beyond the typical political buffs and criminal justice reform advocates. That’s important because, while Johnson’s case was awful, it isn’t uncommon in the United States.

On any given day, 451,000 nonviolent drug offenders are locked up at the local, state, or federal level, and many people don’t realize it. Mass incarceration is a nationwide problem: More than 2.3 million people are incarcerated in the United States, making America the number one jailer in the world.

To highlight a more specific problem among these statistics, many incarcerated people haven’t even been convicted of a crime yet. In local jails, for example, 70 percent of people are not convicted of any crime. The latest data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reveals that out of the 745,200 inmates held in city and county jails in midyear 2017, 482,000 were unconvicted. This is due in part to reliance on a cash bail system that punishes the poor with jail time while the wealthy can afford to buy their way out — even when accused of the same crime.

For most people, facts and statistics simply won’t run the message home, but people like Johnson sharing their personal stories filled with empathy and emotion can accomplish just this. The American criminal justice system fails thousands of people, and that won’t change until Americans start paying attention through stories such as Johnson’s.

Kardashian West Perfectly Chose An Imperfect Model

Women have long felt the pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards portrayed by clothing companies and their use of young and thin models with perfect skin and hair. Kardashian West can afford to hire any model that fits this image, but her choice to work with many nontraditional models such as Johnson shows that our society — with Kardashian West leading the way in pop culture — has moved past the need for absolute perfection in advertising.

Our culture is shifting, becoming more accepting of women with varying body types, and Kardashian West isn’t backing away from this national trend with her new apparel. She certainly isn’t the first one to use nontraditional models in advertising, but as a popular public figure with millions of followers on social media, her embrace of nontraditional models will have a strong effect.

It’s true that she and her family are known for plastic surgery galore, but Kardashian West chose to shift the focus from herself and others with the typical “model body” to a more realistic standard of someone who hasn’t been touched by plastic surgery — a real person who has a compelling story to share with the world.

Ultimately, Kardashian West is trying to successfully market her brand to potential customers. But her unique way of doing so is a positive move for criminal justice reform, while showing the world that real women can overcome issues and be confidently beautiful while doing so.

Democrats Plot A Coup Against SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh,"Last year, Democrats tried every trick in the book to prevent Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court. They failed. Now, they’re at it again.

Kavanaugh was confirmed and seated on the court, but for a certain kind of rabid political mind, that fact is no hindrance. From the internet fever swamps of the left-wing commentariat, plans have emerged to remove Kavanaugh from the court by any means necessary. The madness has even spread to Congress, with radicals in the House calling for impeachment already .

Federal judges serve for life, or until they retire, and the only way any judge’s tenure has ever been cut short besides that has been through the impeachment process described in the Constitution. So the anti-Kavanaugh people seem to have a nearly impossible task: asking a Senate that just confirmed him with a majority of votes to unseat him with a super-majority. Faced with the cold truth of the Constitution and the hard math of the Senate, they have instead floated a variety of crackpot theories that will let them do what they want anyway.

A Removal Theory Made of Thin Air

For now, most voters are happy to move on and settle our political differences in the traditional way: at the ballot box. But as we saw earlier this week in Vox, clever minds are at work in subverting the independent judiciary. Ian Millhiser, late of the defunct ThinkProgress blog, now a correspondent for Vox, led the charge.

Drawing on a 2006 law review article by professors Saikrishna Prakash and Steven D. Smith, Millhiser puts forth the idea that there are other, never before imagined, ways of removing federal judges from the bench. (Professor Aziz Huq of the University of Chicago wrote a similar article last year in the Washington Post, also citing Prakash and Smith.)

Millhiser makes much of the authors’political orientation, saying that they are conservative, so this is no lefty trick. It’s the same perverse appeal to authority that featured in the Obamacare debates, when the existence of a similar plan by a Heritage Foundation scholar was trumpeted as evidence of its bipartisan appeal.

Normally, leftist authors would use the professors’ politics in ad hominem attacks to dismiss their scholarship; when the scholarship is useful, though, the attacks are reversed without a hint of embarrassment. A neat rhetorical trick.

Define ‘Good Behavior’

The Prakash and Smith article is mainly an examination of the term “good behavior.” We say that federal judges have their jobs for life, but the exact phrasing of the constitutional provision is that “Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.” “Good behavior” here is a legal term of art with hundreds of years of precedent behind it in English history. Prakash and Smith looked into what, exactly, that meant.

English kings once appointed and removed judges by whim, so the “good behavior” phrase was originally a safeguard against that, a step on the road toward an independent judiciary. What it meant, in essence, was that to remove a judge from office, a king had to prove he “had misbehaved and thus had violated the conditions attached to his commission.” The guarantee was likely designed to attract better judges, men who did not want their tenure to be determined by whether the king liked their rulings.

After the many abuses of the judicial system by the monarchs of the Stuart dynasty, judicial independence became important in English law and, later, was included in America’s state and federal constitutions. Judges, it was agreed, should be secure in their tenure, and only removable after a trial, or something like one.

Constitutional Changes Require Amendments

In some early state constitutions, impeachment was just one of several ways of accomplishing this. Prakash and Smith cite Delaware’s original constitution of 1776. “After granting various officers tenure during good behavior, the Delaware Constitution noted that all officers shall be removed ‘on conviction of misbehavior at common law, or on impeachment, or upon the address of the general assembly.’”

There are a variety of ways a state could choose to remove a judge, and not every state chose impeachment as the sole means of doing it. “Address of the general assembly,” for instance, followed English law in allowing the legislature to remove a judge by majority vote.

On the other hand, the federal Constitution discusses only one means of removing a civil officer: impeachment by the House and conviction in the Senate. Millhiser mentions the case of Judge Roy Moore’s suspension from the Alabama Supreme Court “by a special court that hears complaints against the state’s judges.” Could not the federal government create a similar method of reigning in judicial misbehavior?

Well, they could, but exactly how they might do so would frustrate the radicals’ plans. If they want to follow the Alabama precedent—which might be a first for Millhiser and Vox—they have to ask, how did the Alabama Court of the Judiciary get the power to police the behavior of the state’s judges? The answer: by constitutional amendment.

In 1973, Alabama passed Amendment 328 to their state constitution. That amendment, among other things, established a Judicial Inquiry Board and the Court of the Judiciary. If the federal government wanted a similar system, they could have it—but it would require the same method to bring it about.

Until Then, We Still Have to Follow the Constitution

In the meantime, it is hard to imagine a system of removal that would meet the requirements of the Constitution other than the one specifically mentioned in the Constitution. And American history confirms that point. While there were many methods of judicial removal in England and colonial America, the only way federal judges have ever been removed from office is through impeachment and conviction.

Millhiser writes of this as a norm, but it is rather more than that. The Constitution did not wipe out all legal precedent before it, but it did establish a new basic law to which all preceding law must now conform. Some states provided alternate removal methods in their constitutions, which shows it is possible. But the federal Constitution’s drafters, who were aware of those state constitutions (and in some cases had helped write them) chose not to replicate those provisions.

That alone is a persuasive argument that they did not intend any removal method but the one they did include. Although Prakash and Smith cite some language in the 1790 Crimes Act that could possibly be interpreted to suggest that Congress considered alternate methods, that language could also just as easily be meant to show simply that federal judges may be convicted of crimes while on the bench—something that has happened several times in our history.

This is a sticking point for Millhiser. He seems concerned that if Kavanaugh is convicted of a crime—which he believes likely, apparently—the Senate would refuse to remove him from office. This is at odds with historical practice: when judges have been convicted of crimes in the past, Congress has impeached and removed those who tried to hang on to their seats.

This is not ancient history, either: district judges Harry Claiborne, Alcee Hastings, Walter Nixon, and Thomas Porteous were convicted in the Senate over the past 40 years, one of them (Porteous) as recently as 2010. A functioning system already exists for removing judges whose behavior is shown to be bad.

Politicized Impeachment Is the Goal

Earlier attempts at impeachment show the real problem with the process dreamed of in the Vox article. The impeachments of Judge John Pickering and Justice Samuel Chase show how removing judges from office more frequently poses a threat to judicial independence and American liberty.

Jeffersonians (retrospectively known as the Democratic-Republicans) opened the 8th United States Congress with large majorities in both houses and their party leader in the White House. The judiciary, however, was packed with Federalists appointed by George Washington and John Adams. That tension showed most clearly in 1803, when John Marshall and the Supreme Court frustrated the Jeffersonians in Marbury v. Madison, striking down a federal law for the first time.

A month later, the House Democratic-Republicans impeached Judge Pickering. Pickering was not a Supreme Court justice, but a district judge from New Hampshire, and not involved at all in the Marbury decision. But he was a Federalist, and a good test case for the power of Congress to reshape the judiciary: for years, Pickering had been unable to do his job because of a combination of declining mental faculties and habitual drunkenness. Poverty and stubbornness kept Pickering from resigning, and his failure to perform his duties made him a tempting target in the effort to open up more Federalist-held seats.

Some among the Democratic-Republicans, including Jefferson, were concerned that insanity was not suitable grounds for impeachment, but they soon agreed they had no other option. Jefferson wrote privately that it showed the need for a system of removal by address, as Britain had. But he also agreed that no such power existed, and his allies in Congress moved forward with the impeachment. The Senate convicted Pickering 20 to 6 on March 12, 1804, with even some Federalists abandoning the judge.

That very day, the House set its sights on a bigger target: Justice Samuel Chase of the Supreme Court. A Washington appointee and arch-Federalist, Chase was the Jeffersonians’ primary foe on the Supreme Court. Besides his rulings, he also publicly criticized Jefferson and condemned Democratic-Republican policies from the bench, including during a grand jury charge. Yet, as in Pickering’s case, no crime had been committed. Buoyed by their success, though, the House impeached him anyway.

The charges focused on his rulings, which the House managers claimed were so wrong and prejudicial as to constitute judicial misconduct. The consequences of that line of reasoning, perhaps, were what stayed the Senate’s hand after Chase’s trial there.

There were separate votes on all eight articles of impeachment, but enough Democratic-Republicans sided with the Federalists on each vote as to defeat all eight. That ended the Jeffersonian drive to purge the bench of political opponents and established a precedent against politically motivated impeachment. Chase remained on the Supreme Court until his death in 1811, and no Supreme Court justice has been impeached since.

We Have a Congress For This, and It’s Not Acting

This, more than anything, is the point of the Vox article. Millhiser believes Kavanaugh should not be on the Supreme Court, just as Jefferson and his allies believed Chase should be removed. But in neither case did either justice commit any crime while in office, nor did either of them show themselves to be objectively unfit for the job.

Millhiser fantasizes about Kavanaugh in prison for perjury and wonders how the Supreme Court could function with a justice behind bars. But the examples of Claiborne, Hastings, Nixon, and Porteous, show that Congress is perfectly willing to remove a judge from the bench if he has been convicted of a crime.

Prakash and Smith suggested that there might be alternate methods of removing a judge; Millhiser is calling for that, but also for an alternate standard, one that goes well beyond the “good behavior” tenure required by the Constitution. Vox and their readers on the far left want a new Star Chamber, a special super-court stacked with like-minded judges who would go around the words and precedents of the Constitution and do what Jefferson could not: purge the courts of their ideological enemies.

The fig leaf of “misbehavior” is clearly a ruse when it is applied retrospectively across a justice’s entire life. This is no constitutional alternative. It is cancel culture for the judicial branch.

The ex post facto assault on the bench is born out of fear. Having seen Donald Trump appoint two Supreme Court justices and 150 lower court judges to lifetime appointments, they are anxious about what the next year (or five years) may bring. But in trying to steer their base toward lawlessness, they would chip away at the independence of the judiciary, an essential part of the separation of powers that protects us all from over-powerful government.

Why Nancy Pelosi Now Supports Impeachment Even Though It’s Insane,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a mediocre political strategist, but a very good tactician. We should not make the mistake of thinking that we understand something about the politics of impeachment over the Ukraine call that she does not.

Pelosi, who would love to remove Trump but has no realistic options for doing so, has had to thread the needle on impeachment for months. With roughly 200 House Democrats now supporting impeachment to various degrees (or perhaps 218, depending on whose head counter you trust), her options dwindled, and no longer included verbal gymnastics alone.

The latest Ukraine-related non-scandal is almost irrelevant for its lack of substance. This is not about substance. This is about Pelosi losing control of her caucus should she continue to resist impeachment, and Pelosi sensing a looming electoral disaster of monumental proportions should impeachment be launched outside the parameters she defines.

There’s Nothing Impeachable In the Phone Call

Having read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, I can say there is literally nothing there. There is no mention of military aid to Ukraine, of freezing or un-freezing of any aid, of any quid pro quo, or of any pressure on Zelensky to do anything.

I would argue that, given the nexus of the Biden family corruption to Ukraine, it is entirely proper for Trump to ask Zelensky for help investigating the precise circumstances of the Biden family enrichment. That Biden is now running for president does not give him immunity—a criminal running for president is still a criminal.

If the situation were reversed, and if a corrupt Republican ex-vice president were running for president, no Democrat would ever hesitate to ask every foreign government in the world for help in investigating that person. Nor do Democrats hesitate to ask for foreign help in investigating sitting Republican presidents. The 2018 letter to Ukraine (!) by Senate Democrats asking for an investigation of Trump is illustrative.

Anyone who is not a rabid Democratic partisan and gets through the five pages of single-spaced text of the transcript will walk away with a feeling that it’s all pretty boring nonsense. As impeachable offenses go, this one is a complete dud. So if Pelosi’s intent is to remove Trump from office for some specific (and real) offense, she is SOL. There is nothing in the transcript to hang her hat on.

This Isn’t About a Crime, It’s About Politics

Even if Pelosi only suspected this on September 24, when she supposedly jumped the gun on impeachment, she surely knew it the next day, when Trump released the transcript of the call. So why green-light the Full Monty impeachment farce three days later, when it was clear as day that this “bombshell” was already fizzling, just like all the other “bombshells”?

The answer is simple: the absence of impeachable offenses makes no difference whatsoever, because the outcome is pre-determined, and Pelosi’s options are stark: start the impeachment now, and retain control of the narrative, or start a month or two from now, and lose control completely, with the impeachment hearings dragging on into the primary season.

Pelosi understands perfectly that an election where the Democratic Party is framed as a single-issue party, whose sole concern is an impeaching a president over two casual sentences in a phone call, will be catastrophic. But she has run out of rope.

Impeachment proceedings are a given, because her caucus now almost unanimously demands it, and her caucus demands it because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the Resistance crazies and the hard left. Pelosi has also run out of cute euphemisms for impeachment—the usual Pelosi mumbo-jumbo, like “inquiry,” “investigation,” and “official inquiry,” no longer work without giving the crazies the real deal.

Pelosi had to get ahead of the tidal wave before it drowned her. As Spartan women used to say to their men, “Return with the shield, or on it.” Pelosi, who generally does not lack in political courage, would rather return with the shield this time, and live to fight another day. So she chose the better of two bad options.

Getting Rid of Joe Is a Side Benefit

Pelosi also understands quite well that the first Democratic casualty of all this will be Joe Biden. His sputtering campaign will not survive months of scrutiny of his son’s shady dealings with Ukrainian-Russian gas companies while he was handing U.S. taxpayer money to Ukraine. But Pelosi can live with this. If she has to toss Biden overboard, then so be it.

This is why Pelosi is putting a time limit of a final impeachment vote by end of the year. This is why she is circumscribing the supposed impeachable offense universe to just “the Ukraine thing”: letting the Jerry Nadlers and the Elijah Cummingses run away with tangential issues means dragging the show out into the primary season.

So no Stormy. No Mueller. No Russia collusion (at least, not explicitly — she probably hopes that people can’t tell the difference between Russia and Ukraine.) No Trump hotels. No emoluments. No obstruction. Just Ukraine.

Then Back to Blaming Evil Republicans

With the House vote done by December, Pelosi can congratulate the troops, and move on, regardless of the result (not that it’s in any doubt). She can then proudly proclaim that the House Democrats have been diligent in saving the republic, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and those nasty obstructionist unpatriotic Republicans in the Senate refuse to see the light.

With a straight face, she can tell the lunatics and the impeachment fanatics that she has given them exactly what they asked for, and that it is up to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer now. Then she can privately breathe a sigh of relief.

Pelosi can then spend 2020 working to retain her House majority, while hoping Republican voters lose their energy by next November. Democratic candidates can spend the next year talking about something else, anything else, and at least have a chance of defeating Trump.

Pelosi knows that if impeachment is on the voters’ minds next year, Trump will be reelected in a tsunami. Her majority and speakership will go the way of the Dodo bird. The only way to change that narrative is to do the impeachment show now, and forget all about it next year.

How Republicans Should Fight Back

So what should Trump and the Republicans (not to conflate the two!) do, given that Democrats have issued a declaration of war?

First, all of us out here in the real world must make it abundantly clear to congressional Republicans that spinelessness and defeatism in the face of extreme Democratic aggression will not be tolerated by their voters. Any Republican member of Congress who votes with Democrats on this one must be primaried and must lose—no excuses, no explanations, no rationalizations, no dark nights of the soul.

This is a war declared on all of us. There is no compromise and no middle ground. No Republican can win reelection if his base turns against him, and voting with Democrats is the one sure way to lose the base. Every congressional Republican must either rediscover his vertebrae, or start composing his retirement announcement.

Fight Them from the Executive Branch

Second, the word “cooperation” must be erased from the lexicon of everyone in the executive branch who is dealing with Congress. Every single demand by the Democrats must be fought tooth and nail. Delay every response. Then delay some more.

Voters out here in the real world care little about process, when the Democrats can’t explain coherently what specific crime Trump supposedly committed.

If they demand something by Monday, inform them late Sunday evening that the matter is still under review. Then claim privilege and refuse to provide documents. Then provide redacted documents. Voters out here in the real world care little about process, when the Democrats can’t explain coherently what specific crime Trump supposedly committed.

Refuse to provide witnesses, and if the witnesses have no choice but to appear, delay and reschedule. Limit the scope of their testimony in advance. Argue about every question. Insist on closed-door testimony. Claim privilege over the most trivial details and conversations.

Let the Democrats run to the courts—nothing happens in court instantaneously. Then appeal. Then appeal again. Then claim a change of circumstances, and start the whole thing over. All this will take time—days, weeks, months. The public will be bored with the endless wrangles over process.

This is not 1974. We’ve all seen thousands of these squabbles and congressional hearings. The clock will be ticking, and nobody will hear that clock better than Pelosi.

Make the Obstruction Charge Come True

Third, every Republican on Rep. Adam Schiff’s intelligence committee (which, oddly enough, is in charge of the impeachment proceedings) must dedicate his every waking moment to obstructing Schiff and his merry gang of comrades. Every question must be interrupted. Every procedural point must be raised to delay, thwart, frustrate, and obstruct.

Every single committee vote must be along party lines. Yes, Republicans will lose, but the purely partisan nature of this charade will be highlighted again and again. Every congressional hearing must turn into a farce.

Regardless, the outcome of the impeachment process is a foregone conclusion. Democrats will vote to impeach Trump. This is a fact, and there is no point shedding tears over it or debating it. No amount of brilliant oratory by lawyers, no pointing out the absence of any actual facts of any crime, not even ironclad proof of actual innocence, will make the slightest difference.

Republicans might as well get used to the idea now: President Trump will be impeached. But when and how this happens can be turned to our advantage.

You Want Impeachment? Come and Get It

Fourth, force the Democrats to vote again and again, including vulnerable Democrats. For example, Democrats already fired off subpoenas on Friday, demanding State Department documents by October 4. But the House has yet to hold a single vote authorizing impeachment proceedings, and until it does, there is nothing. For a swing district Democrat (and there are dozens who got elected by the skin of their teeth in 2018), each such vote brings him one step closer to becoming an ex-congressman.

Republican voters need to remind their Republican member of Congress, again and again, that they’ll be looking for another job should they even think of siding with the enemy.

Pelosi knows this, so don’t let her get away with an impeachment that starts without a full House vote, just on her say-so in a press conference. Democrats want documents for impeachment? Then the House must vote on impeachment first.

The final impeachment vote? Republican voters need to remind their Republican member of Congress, again and again, that they’ll be looking for another job should they even think of siding with the enemy. Let it be 236-198. The whole thing will be remembered only as an unhinged partisan hate show.

Fifth, the Senate. We already know how little McConnell thinks of all this. I wouldn’t presume to know his strategy, but I can suggest one: as soon as the House votes to impeach, schedule a quick vote the next day: to convict or not, up or down. Give it two hours of “debate,” and then vote.

That’s it. Show is over. The vote will be 52-48 to acquit (yes, Mitt Romney, you worthless cream puff of a weathervane, I am thinking of you), and that will be that.

This latest twist is merely another battle in the endless war. A House vote to impeach President Trump is now a virtual certainty and, by itself, of little consequence. What matters is what we conservatives out here do with it. Our first task must be to stiffen the backbones of our cowardly representatives.

"Actually, China’s Communist Government Can Rot In Hell","Donald Trump today tweeted his “Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China!” For diplomatic reasons, it’s become customary for American presidents to praise and commend this depraved totalitarian regime. In a just world, the president would be sending his sympathies to a Chinese people who have endured inconceivable sufferings under the communist regime since 1949.

As Helen Raleigh, whose family experienced Maoist-driven deprivations, aptly noted, the 70th anniversary of People’s Republic of China marks one of the darkest days in Chinese history. It is also one of the darkest days in mankind’s history. Of all the planned utopian economies during the 20th century, none were more deadly or dehumanizing. No government has murdered, tortured, imprisoned, and terrorized more of its own people than communist China.

The most infamous disaster of those 70 years began with 1959’s Great Leap Forward, a manmade starvation that Mao called “grassroots socialism” — one of a number Marxism inflicted on the world — which was responsible for the death of 40 million or more Chinese. “It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill,” Mao rationalized.

Though it wasn’t merely famine. Millions of innocent people were tortured to death or summarily executed on the spot for arbitrary crimes against the state.

Many of those lucky enough to survive this hell would soon be thrust into the Cultural Revolution, where gangs of Red Guards, many of them mere teens, roamed the streets targeting anyone who they deemed enemies of Maoism. No one was spared, as these grassroots murderers rooted out ideological crimes (often over trivial grievances) and the authorities sat and watched. Millions more would be compelled to participate in struggle sessions to come to terms with their counterrevolutionary thinking. Thousands more would commit suicide to avoid all of it.

“All of it” included the largest penal system ever known to man. The communists would operate at least 1,000 large-scale concentration and forced labor camps over the 70-year span. It is estimated that about 10 million Chinese were imprisoned on average every year for decades in this gulag — a majority for political crimes. Slave labor and torture ensured an estimated 5 percent mortality rate, which means more than 20 million Chinese perished in camps by the early 1990s. The mass interment of their own people is nothing new. Today, Xinjiang re-education camps are brimming with more than a million (and perhaps up to three) ethnic Muslim Uyghurs.

There has never been religious freedom in communist China. Catholics, Falun Gong, Buddhists, Muslims, and others have been harassed, or worse, thrown into prison, tortured, and forced to renounce their beliefs and adopt the state-sponsored faiths of Maoism and atheism.

Even in the latter years of the 20th century, the communists would continue a policy of family destruction through forced abortion, mandatory sterilization, and the discouragement of adoption, resulting in abandonment of an estimated 2 million children. Mostly girls.

Let’s not forget, the Chinese communists also exported their malicious ideology. After 1950, the communists murdered somewhere between 10-20 percent of the Tibetan population — many of whom bravely fought against the Red Army with muskets and swords. In 1984, the Dalai Lama estimated that, to that point, 173,000 of his countrymen had died in captivity. Tibet is still occupied territory, but is little advocating for its cause on college campuses or in the U.N.

We won’t even dive into the murderous communist regimes Red China propped up in Cambodia or Vietnam, or how it instigated world conflict and cost hundreds of thousands of lives. But let’s remember China still props up the massive concentration camp known as North Korea.

Not to mention, all the time, the vast majority of Chinese lived in poverty.

The free, capitalistic enclaves of Taiwan and Hong Kong would be constant reminders of both the amazing ingenuity of the Chinese people, and the crimes of China’s government. Even today, the brave protesters in Hong Kong won’t relent to the arbitrary rule of the communists. They deserve more from us.

In an age in which some Americans act as if losing an election is tantamount to totalitarianism, the staggering death and poverty caused by the People’s Republic of China can be difficult to wrap the mind around. Reading the history of China’s regime, which is taking an excruciatingly long time to wind down even as capitalism takes hold, is numbing in its unremitting inhumanity.

Yet this week, “President” Xi Jinping and other Chinese officials visited Mao’s mausoleum — located in Tiananmen Square, where an estimated thousands of protesters were murdered by the state in 1989 — and bowed three times to embalmed remains of the world’s greatest mass murderer. It will be a day worth celebrating when the rest of the Chinese government meets the same fate.

It’s Not A Crime For Trump To Ask China And Ukraine To Investigate Biden,"President Trump threw a glass of cold water over the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives today by essentially stipulating to the main allegation being made against him. In fact, he doubled down on it.

Asked about what he wants Ukrainian President Volomydyr Zelensky to do about Hunter Biden’s business dealings there Trump said, “I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.” He also suggested that China should open a similar investigation. But what Trump was mostly saying is that he is the president and there is nothing wrong with saying such things to foreign leaders.

The issue of whether the president may urge foreign leaders to conduct investigations of American citizens running for office has now become the crux of the impeachment inquiry. Long gone now are allegations of any quid pro quo with Zelensky. That ship sailed when the transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukrainian leader offered no evidence that the president was offering military aid as a carrot, which was the initial allegation.

Now Democrats insist that no quid pro quo is needed to prove a high crime or misdemeanor occurred during the phone call. Instead, they insist, this is a question of an illegal campaign contribution. They seem to be suggesting that Trump was asking the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden, rather than asking them to root out corruption that allegedly involved his son Hunter Biden, and potentially the former vice president himself.

But is that a high crime or misdemeanor? We know that Hunter Biden took an extremely lucrative job from a Ukrainian energy concern for which he had no relevant experience. Is it really so strange for Americans to want to know if what he was really offering was access to the vice president?

Likewise we know that Hunter Biden traveled to China with his father on Air Force Two in 2013, and that during that trip he met with a Chinese banker, and 10 days after the trip the Chinese granted a license for a new fund on which Hunter was a board member.

Perhaps these are just coincidences. Perhaps Hunter Biden possesses some vast expertise in business that he honed while snorting cocaine during his time in the Navy. But it does not seem completely unreasonable to imagine his proximity to the White House might have played a role in his hiring.

That brings us back to President Trump. Trump clearly feels that something untoward and perhaps illegal occurred regarding Hunter Biden in Ukraine and China. In regard to the former, he received information from attorney Rudy Giuliani raising questions about the firing of a prosecutor investigating the company where the younger Biden worked. So the question is, is it illegal for Trump to ask foreign leaders to look into it?

The answer to this question seems to almost certainly be no. In fact, the closest thing the Democrats can pin to the president is a vague campaign finance violation. Is it tacky? Does it violate norms? Yes, probably, but it is just as plausible that Trump wanted answers about family members in the Obama administration getting sweet deals from foreign governments as it is that he was trying to damage a potential political rival.

And what if both things are true? What if Trump is genuinely concerned about corruption in our foreign affairs, and the fact that Joe Biden might be mixed up in it is a just a bonus? If there are cases, which there certainly are, when it is appropriate and legal for a president to urge foreign leaders to investigate potential wrongdoing by Americans, then the Democrats have to prove why in this case is wasn’t.

Their answer is that Joe Biden is running for president. Their entire argument for impeachment now rests on the idea that Biden’s candidacy makes him immune to such calls for scrutiny. But they will not and can not point to an actual law that Trump violated in the conversation. Rather, they make vague arguments about courting foreign interference in an election and potential campaign finance violations.

Today Trump called the Democrats’ bluff. Now both sides have stipulated that Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden, and that he may ask China to do the same. Democrats are free to impeach the president on this basis, even without pointing to a specific crime. The Senate is free, as is likely, to acquit the president, since there isn’t any crime.

Then it will be left to the voters. The ball is in the Democrats’ court. Impeachment without a specific crime is a risky play, but they may have gone too far to un-ring this bell.

Rashia Tlaib Says Facial Recognition Analysts Must Be African American,"Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., recently paid a visit to the Real Time Crime Center after the Detroit Police invited her to tour the facilities. Tlaib had criticized the center’s usage of facial recognition software in August, so the Detroit Police thought it prudent to demonstrate to her the way in which the software could be used to prevent crime.

.@detroitpolice You should probably rethink this whole facial recognition bulls**t.https://t.co/ZvHEEQxzWB — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) August 20, 2019

Detroit Police Chief James Craig performed a demonstration with the software and introduced Tlaib to facial recognition analyst Andrew Rutebuka. The visit went awry when Tlaib told Craig, “Analysts need to be African American.” She continued, “Non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same.” She then proceeded to describe how people in the House of Representatives frequently confuse Reps. Elijah Cummings and John Lewis.

Rep. @RashidaTlaib said facial recognition techs need to be African-American because ""non-African Americans"" think all black people look alike. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said if he had said that, people would be demanding he resign.https://t.co/JxaJqiwDzO pic.twitter.com/JKXuydfLVd — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 3, 2019

Craig calmly responded to Tlaib, saying, “I trust people who are trained regardless of race and regardless of gender. It is about the training.” The exchange was visibly awkward. Prior to that, Tlaib had interjected in Craig’s presentation, telling him that data had been presented in Congress indicating the software had a high error rate. She quipped, “See if you can get some of our money back until they fix it.”

When a reporter confronted her following her remarks, Tlaib defended them, saying studies had been performed indicating a person had a higher probability of correctly identifying a suspect if both that person and the suspect were the same race. The reporter shot back, asking if that meant non-white individuals should be prohibited from working in mostly white communities. Tlaib just responded, “Look it up.” Tlaib’s spokesperson provided a link to the study the following day.

The conversation, a full video of which can be found here, was recorded by reporter George Hunter from the Detroit News. Following Tlaib’s visit, the Detroit News followed up with Craig, who shared that Tlaib’s remarks angered many at the Real Time Crime Center.

“It’s insulting,” Craig said. “We have a diverse group of crime analysts, and what she said — that non-whites should not work in that capacity because they think all black people look alike — is a slap in the face to all the men and women in the crime center.”

Craig explained that all officers and civilian employees must complete implicit bias training, stating, “That’s something we train for, and it’s valuable training, but to say people should be barred from working somewhere because of their skin color? That’s racist.”

Tlaib Insists It’s Not Racist To Say White People Can’t Be Police Analysts,"Critics from across the political spectrum are wary of the Detroit Police Department’s (DPD) use of facial recognition software to curb violent crime. Their concerns range from whether the technology violates the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, if and by what factor a largely unmonitored surveillance system successfully deters crime, and the known shortcomings in facial detection algorithms’ ability to identify the faces of African-American people, particularly women.

When freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents portions of Detroit, visited the DPD’s Real Time Crime Center, she cited a different concern. “Analysts need to be African Americans,” Tlaib told Detroit’s police chief, James Craig. “Not people that are not. I think non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same.”

From a woman who has been quick to accuse opponents of racism, the remarks were shocking. Even more unbelievable was Tlaib’s Friday Detroit News op-ed, in which she alleged her words “weren’t racist.”

The representative’s comment referenced a phenomenon known as the cross-race effect, which supposes people identify members of their own race more accurately than they do members of other races. Detroit’s population is about 80 percent African American. Citing the cross-race effect in her demand that the DPD hire all African Americans analysts implies Tlaib believes African Americans commit 100 percent of violent crime in the city.

Speaking to the Detroit News about the representative’s “insulting” comments, which he said left both black and white analysts “outraged,” Craig provided an alternative interpretation. “To say people should be barred from working somewhere because of their skin color? That’s racist.”

Attacking Before She Knows Anything

Tlaib’s tense visit to the Real Time Crime Center occurred on the heels of inappropriate and acrimonious online jabbing. On August 20, Tlaib tweeted that the DPD “should probably rethink this whole facial recognition bulls**t.” Using foul language to cover a lack of content is nothing new for Tlaib, who is preparing for her next campaign by selling apparel splashed with her uncouth rallying cry of “impeach the mother-cker.”

The DPD responded by inviting Tlaib to the center to witness how the department “responsibly use[s] [technology] in efforts to identify criminals involved in violent crimes.”

Setting the tone for her September 30 visit, Tlaib asked a Detroit News reporter taping the meeting if he was “facial recognizing [her] right now.”

Afterwards, Craig gave the representative a crash course on how his department’s analysts use the software to apprehend violent criminals. In the Detroit News video of the visit, Tlaib often appears unwilling to learn, informing Craig she comes to him “from a place of fully understanding [the issues with facial recognition software].”

Tlaib’s remarks, particularly her racist comments, prove she is far from solidly understanding the shortcomings of facial recognition techniques. She was also disrespectful of the men and women more than 550 Detroit businesses and entities entrust with their safety through Project Green Light.

How Project Green Light Began

Project Green Light began in 2016, after the DPD recognized that 25 percent “of violent crime in the city [occurred] within 500 feet of gas stations.” The DPD partnered initially with eight local gas stations. They installed real-time security cameras and placed green lights outside to signal to patrons and would-be-criminals that DPD monitored their cameras.

In late 2017, the city brought Face Plus facial recognition software to Project Green Light and the Real Time Crime Center. Although the technology is capable of real-time facial analysis, the DPD, according to Craig, does not “monitor innocent people in real time.” Only if there is an “articulable reasonable suspicion that an individual is observed or reported to have committed a crime” will a “still image [be] provided for analysis.”

While long-term studies of Project Green Light’s effects have not been completed, at a press conference in March, Craig stated car-jackings have decreased by 50 percent in three years. Additionally, the city experienced a 45 percent decline in robberies during the first quarter of 2019.

The DPD’s use of facial recognition technology went unmonitored for 18 months before the department settled a privacy policy in July. The policy aimed to ensure facial recognition software would not violate the First, Fourth, or Fourteenth Amendments, does not target specific groups of individuals based on “religious, political or social views,” and does not target individuals based on ethnic background or citizenship status.

Directive 307.5, governing the use of facial recognition technology, was passed in an 8-3 vote by the Detroit Police Board of Commissioners on September 19. In addition to addressing privacy concerns, the nine-page document limits the DPD’s sharing of its technology with outside agencies, identifies individuals responsible for oversight of the facial recognition program, and outlines penalties for those found violating the policy. Importantly, it states that facial recognition matches are “not to be considered a positive identification of any subject,” but rather must be corroborated through thorough investigation.

A number of legitimate areas for concern remain regarding DPD’s facial recognition software use, several enumerated in a June 2019 report on Project Green Light. The report states DPD has supposedly installed “hidden neighborhood cameras” in an effort to find illegal garbage dumpers, notes a sensation confessed by some Detroit business owners that they are “paying for policing,” and alleges the police prioritize Project Green Light locations over non-Project Green Light locations. Additionally, the report cites concerns that Project Green Light may not prove a long-term deterrent to criminals, as locations are only patrolled virtually one time each day.

I Know More about Racism than You, Chief

Tlaib’s visit to the Real Time Crime Center, however, did not focus on legitimate concerns about possible DPD overreach or the effects of Project Green Light. Rather, she seemed intent on ensuring Craig, who began his police career in 1977, benefitted from her expertise.

Tlaib’s frequent interruptions were designed to catch Craig and his department in misbehavior, which came into focus when Craig put his software’s shortcomings on display. Craig demonstrated how it identified an African American male suspect as an African American female. “The computer, not [the analyst]” Craig began to explain, before Tlaib cut him off.

Local Support for Project Green Light

Although murder, assault, rape, and robbery decreased in Detroit from 2017 to 2018, FBI statistics released on September 30 show that, in 2018, Detroit still ranked as the most violent big city in the nation.

In a city of 139 square miles, Project Green Light allows a force of 2,200 officers, whose response times are among the longest in the nation, to better protect Detroit citizens. As shown in a map of Project Green Light locations on the DPD’s website, Detroit’s efforts have found plentiful partners. The city boasted more than 568 Project Green Light locations in July, with an additional 80 businesses “in the pipeline.”

That Tlaib would disregard the public buy-in of Detroit residents to a program they feel increases their safety is no surprise.

Clement Brown, the owner of several clothing stores in downtown Detroit, the Detroit News reported in March that “thieves drove a truck through the window” of one of his storefronts in 2018. Although Brown initially worried over the cost to join Project Green Light, an upfront fee of $4,000 to $6,000, and an additional $150 per month for video storage, he stated “it’s definitely worth it.”

The Detroit Housing Commission used a federal grant to upgrade bring Project Green Light to a community of elderly and near-elderly Detroit residents in November 2018. At a community meeting attended by Craig and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan to gauge residents’ interest, an attendee interviewed by the Detroit Free Press said “almost all” of the 50 to 60 residents who attended “were for [Project Green Light].”

Yet, in July, Tlaib sponsored a bill that would prohibit the use of facial recognition software in public housing around the nation. “We cannot allow residents…to be criminalized and marginalized with the use of…facial recognition technology,” Tlaib stated. After her visit to the Real Time Crime Center, Tlaib indicated she still believed it would be “dehumanizing to have surveillance” in public housing.

That Tlaib would disregard the public buy-in of Detroit residents to a program they feel increases their safety is no surprise. The representative has a history of prioritizing her beliefs over her constituents.

The effectiveness of and privacy concerns regarding Project Green Light and the Real Time Crime Center deserve to be thoroughly investigated and addressed, particularly as the DPD prepares to expand the programs. Tlaib’s visit to the DPD made no progress on this score.

Her racist comments prove the representative maintains an ignorance of the algorithmic and human shortcomings that lead to racial bias in facial recognition, or believes that, in Detroit, only people of color commit violent crimes. By doubling down on those comments, and alleging in her Detroit News editorial that the DPD is using “broken technology…to lock up black and brown people in Detroit,” Tlaib shows she took nothing away from her grandstanding visit to the Real Time Crime Center.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/07/tlaib-insists-its-not-racist-to-say-white-people-cant-be-police-analysts/,2019-10-07
Does American Jewry’s Future Include Officers Guarding Us In Riot Gear?,"Passing on religious rituals was something I remember looking forward to before I became a mother. Little did I know that the Jewish High Holidays in 2019 would hardly resemble the holidays of my childhood.

Growing up in the 1980s and ‘90s, anyone could walk into my suburban New York synagogue for Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. Sure, adults were supposed to have tickets, but there was no bouncer by the door. We had two local police officers who stood out on the street directing traffic for those two holidays, but that was explained by my synagogue’s location atop a hill; drivers climbing that hill couldn’t see the larger-than-usual stream of pedestrians from afar.

After 9/11, the synagogue I attended in D.C. added year-round security. Whenever I arrived from work for Friday evening services, I faced a security guard and a bag check.

The level of security at synagogues, Jewish schools, and Jewish community centers has only increased since then. Some of these buildings have video camera buzzer systems, security guards, or police officers. This is all to protect American Jews while we pray, socialize, and educate our children. In the wake of attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway, California, that trend is unlikely to reverse itself.

This situation isn’t normal, yet it’s American Jewry’s new normal. The metro area where I grew up feeling incredibly comfortable as a Jew now makes headlines for a seemingly endless parade of antisemitic hate crimes. New York City, home to more than a million Jews, is in the thick of it.

As of Oct. 6, a spokesman for the New York City Police Department told me the department had recorded 323 hate crimes for 2019, 170 of which targeted Jews. By contrast, there were 111 antisemitic hate crimes at this point in 2018, marking a 53 percent increase over last year.

Former New York State assemblyman Dov Hikind, who founded Americans Against Antisemitism, told The Federalist, “What’s going on is unconscionable, the crimes that are going on on a regular basis. Every time you turn around, a Jew gets assaulted.”

Rosh Hashanah was no exception, with attacks over that two-day holiday that included a teenager pulling a 22-year-old woman’s religiously significant scarf and wig from her head in Bedford-Stuyvesant and vandals breaking the windows of a Williamsburg synagogue while Jews prayed inside. On Oct. 5, a group of Hasidic teen girls walking in Williamsburg had their hair pulled by girls asking, “Is it real?”

Shortly before Yom Kippur, Chaim Deutsch, chairman of the New York City Council’s Jewish Caucus, told me he’d spoken to both the mayor and the police commissioner. “They see the urgency of how the community is very concerned about their safety and well-being,” and responded with visibility patrols and police cars with their light bars on, ensuring people requiring help can find it easily.

This sounded promising. When I saw pictures of four New York City synagogues, however, my heart sank. While I applaud and very much appreciate the men and women of the NYPD, does American Jewry’s future include officers in riot gear? If so, American synagogues are likely to become unmarked fortresses rather like those in Europe. While our children might accept that as normal because they won’t know any different, we definitely do.

Hikind, whose organization recently held a rally outside City Hall, wants Mayor Bill de Blasio to visit Brooklyn’s most affected communities, declare a state of emergency, and “bring people together in a real dialogue” to “ask the questions no one wants to talk about.” Those questions include: Who’s committing these crimes (probably not all right-wingers, Mr. Mayor), why, and what’s required to end such crimes?

Councilman Deutsch, who says “no one deserves to be walking out of their house and ending up in a hospital,” told me the city has begun to take action. Its actions include creating a new mayoral office for hate crime prevention and the council funding the installation of surveillance cameras near synagogues, playgrounds, and schools starting in November.

NYPD plans to increase security over Sukkot and Shabbat, as well as expand its civilian volunteer corps, so communities can better collaborate with the police. The newly established Citywide Jewish Leaders Task Force will also assess security needs across the five boroughs and help hold the courts accountable by following up after arrests.

Deutsch observed, “When incidents happened up until now, everyone scrambled and didn’t know what to do, but we’re beginning to build a foundation where we no longer have people just get arrested. Now we’re taking preventive measures, have everything in place, and then can reassess what’s still missing.” Knowing New Yorkers as I do, I expect they won’t hold back if more is needed.

"Last WWII Nazi Stands Trial, And Holocaust Remembrance Passes To Us","This article includes descriptions of torture and murder.

Former Schutzstaffel (SS) guard Bruno Dey is on trial in Hamburg, Germany, charged as an accessory to 5,230 murders that took place in the Stutthof concentration camp between August 1944 and April 1945. Because his alleged crimes occurred when Dey was just 17, the 93-year-old is being tried in juvenile court.

Dey’s trial is part of Germany’s renewed effort to bring those complicit in Nazi genocide to justice for their crimes. Prosecutors admit he was a “small wheel in the machinery of murder,” so Dey faces six months to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Around 65,000 of the 110,000 prisoners held in Stutthof were killed there, including 28,000 Jews. They died from overwork, disease, or torture, being hung or shot, or being killed by means of injection with phenol and gasoline, or with Zyklon B gas.

Dey Has Changed His Story

During his extensive pretrial testimony, Dey admitted he was aware of the purpose of Stutthof’s gas chamber. He also claimed to have heard screams from within the gas chamber, and had witnessed bodies being transported to the crematoria. He explained he understood the Jews in the camp “hadn’t committed a crime, that they were only in [Stutthof] because they were Jews.”

Dey’s testimony in court on October 25 told an amended story. When the judge asked what he had witnessed from his position on the watchtower, Dey responded “people were led in, into the gas chamber…the door was locked.” After admitting hearing screams and banging noises from inside the chamber, Dey stated he “didn’t know that they were being gassed.” He likewise admitted only to hearing “rumors” that camp prisoners included Jews.

Dey also did much obfuscating during his first day of testimony on October 21. After apologizing to Stutthof victims, he let loose with maddening claims that he has long been haunted by “images of misery and horror,” and lamented how his trial is “‘destroying’ the autumn years of his life.”

At one point, Dey attempted to draw comparison between himself undressing for a military physical and camp prisoners being forced to undress to be inspected by guards. His self-pity shows a horrifying lack of compassion for the victims of Nazi crimes at Stutthof.

New Legal Precedent Enabled Dey’s Trial

In the aftermath of World War II, six million Jews, two-thirds of the pre-war European Jewish population, had been killed by the Nazi architects and enablers of genocide. Between 1945 and 1949, the Allies tried 199 high-ranking Third Reich officials in Nuremburg, convicting 161, and sentencing 37 to death. Allied forces had “captured millions of documents during the conquest of Germany,” allowing prosecutors to present “3,000 tons of records at the Nuremberg trial.”

Both a divided and a reunified Germany struggled to hold the remaining Nazi criminals accountable. The extensive Nazi paper trail has not prevented individuals from “deflect[ing] their responsibility for the killings.”

A breakthrough arrived in 2011, when prosecutors brought charges against 91-year-old John Demnjanjuk, a naturalized American citizen who worked during the war as a guard at the Sobibor death camp. As a guard, prosecutors argued, Demjanjuk had been an enabler of mass killings, making him an accessory to 28,000 murders.

Although he denied his guilt, Demjanjuk was convicted. The precedent established was tenuous, however, as Demjanjuk’s conviction was never entered into legal records because he died while awaiting appeal.

In 2015, 95-year-old Oskar Gröning, the “bookkeeper of Auschwitz,” was tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder. Gröning, who admitted he was “beyond question…morally complicit,” was convicted, and sentenced to four years in prison. Gröning nonetheless appealed his conviction, which was upheld by federal courts. He died awaiting a second appeal.

Finding Nazis Who Disappeared After the War

In the aftermath of these and a number of other successful convictions, the German Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes began looking into guards at other Nazi death camps, as well as former members of Hitler’s Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads that committed mass murder of Jews throughout Eastern Europe. Stutthof marks the first concentration camp where the German Central Office has focused its efforts.

In 2016, the office announced it had located eight individuals who worked at Stutthof after it was brought into the German concentration camp system in 1941. Dey is the second of these individuals to be brought up on charges.

Former Stutthof SS guard Johann Rehbogen was tried in a Münster, Germany juvenile court for accessory to murder in November 2018. The 94-year-old wept at the trial’s opening, but obstinately claimed that, while he knew of “mass cremation of corpses,” he was unaware of killings within the camp, and knew nothing of the camp’s gas chamber.

Although Rehbogen never issued an apology to Stutthof’s victims, he made a statement admitting “moral responsibility.” Because of his failing health, Rehbogen’s trial ended without resolution last December.

Given his age, Dey’s trial could likewise end without a clear conviction. More important than any precedent or prison sentence is the possibility to secure additional facts about the Nazi genocide for future generations, and to provide closure to the survivors and families who remain.

“We are giving the chance to the accused and the witnesses to tell us their stories – and not just to the media,” explained Jens Rommel, from the German Central Office. “They are telling them in a courtroom.”

American Survivor Testifies in Dey’s Case

A senior Nazi hunter at the Simon Weisenthal Center located two dozen Stutthof survivors to be co-plaintiffs in the Stutthof trials. Among them is 90-year-old American Judy Meisel. In 2017, German investigators traveled to Meisel’s Minneapolis home to record her testimony about the Stutthof guards.

While her mother remained in the chamber, Meisel ran back to her barracks, preserving her life.

Meisel was transferred from Auschwitz to Stutthof with her sister, Rachel, and mother, Mina, in summer 1944. There, two camp guards tore out her hair by hand, using it for a child’s doll. Meisel and other female prisoners were forced to undress before being beaten by a camp guard. When she was caught swallowing a note passed from the men’s camp, the camp commandant used pliers to pull out her nails.

Meisel nearly perished in Stutthof’s gas chamber. As guards led a group of Jews, which included Meisel and her mother, into the chamber on November 21, 1944, one guard yelled at Meisel to get out. While her mother remained in the chamber, Meisel ran back to her barracks, preserving her life.

With her sister, Meisel manufactured a series of incredible escapes to secure their ever-more-unlikely survival. When the girls were liberated, 16-year-old Meisel weighed just 47 pounds.

Meisel became a civil rights activist in the United States, and still speaks publicly of her experience to “inspire others to stand up to hatred, bigotry and prejudice.” Unable to travel for Rehbogen’s and Dey’s trials, her grandson, Ben Cohen, has attended both in her stead.

“I’ve realized that her story is actually my story,” Cohen told reporters. “I actually have a role to play.”

For the World, the Trials Matter

Like Cohen, we all have a role to play. The antisemitism that caused the Nazi genocide nearly 75 years ago has not retreated, but resurfaced with its dangerous offshoot of Holocaust denial. The phenomenon is taking place not just around the world, but also at home. In 2018, the Anti-Defamation League recorded 1,879 incidents of antisemitic hate across the United States.

Sunday marked the passage of one year since a white supremacist killed 11 Jewish worshipers from three different congregations which used Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to practice their faith. On April 27, a man killed one Jewish congregant and attempted to kill three others at Chabad of Poway, in California.

As of September, antisemitic hate crimes in New York City had increased by 63 percent from 2018, and included acts of vandalism as well as violence targeting Orthodox Jews. In Boca Raton, Florida, a principal was reassigned in June for informing a parent he could not prove the Holocaust was a “factual, historical event.”

In such an environment, the trials of former Nazis matter. Dey’s twice-weekly, two hour sessions of questioning demonstrate to the watching world the face, and the consequences, of hatred. They are a warning that our actions, even of complicity or silence, have consequences.

For the victims of the past, and for future generations, the world must make an example of perpetrators like Rehbogen, Dey, Göring, and Demnjanjuk. No amount of passing time can diminish the harm done by accomplices to genocide.

Many believe Dey will be the final Nazi to come under scrutiny for his wartime actions. The population of victims and perpetrators is aging. Soon, the torch will pass to the rest of us to recall the Holocaust. We must prepare to bear the heavy burden of protecting the past. To do so will require putting our politics aside and presenting a united front against Holocaust denial, and the hateful pseudoscience of antisemitism.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/31/as-the-last-wwii-nazi-stands-trial-the-holocaust-remembrance-torch-passes-to-us/,2019-10-31
California’s ‘Woke’ Prop 47 Doomed Cities With Crime Rings And Theft,"Since the passage of the infamous Prop 47 five years ago, then marketed by California Democrats as the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,” theft has increased across the state, as organized crime rings have transformed ordinary shoplifting into a lucrative and sophisticated operation. It’s likely no coincidence that San Francisco now has the highest rate of property crime of America’s twenty largest cities.

Passed in 2014, Prop 47 was allegedly designed to emphasize rehabilitation and keep non-violent offenders out of the state’s already packed prisons by reducing certain non-violent felonies to mere misdemeanors. For instance, a thief can now steal twice as much as he or she formerly could before facing a felony charge. But thieves and organized crime gangs capitalized on this loophole. In other words, Prop 47 is now a mechanism for gangs to immunize themselves from felony charges. In cities like Vacaville, CA, just outside of the state’s capital, theft has more than doubled, and police believe Prop 47 is to blame.

According to the National Retail Federation’s 2018 survey on Organized Retail Crime (ORC), this jump is in petty theft as a result of relaxed laws is common (and given its ubiquity, should now be expected).

In states where the felony threshold has increased, over half report an increase in ORC case value. None reported a decrease. It appears that ORC criminals understand the new threshold and have increased their thefts to meet it.

Rachel Michelin, who currently serves as President of the California Retailers Association, explained to Fox News the crude savviness of the latest generation of shoplifters. “[Shoplifters] know what they’re doing. They will bring in calculators and get all the way up to the $950 limit.” She continued. “One person will go into a store, fill up their backpack, come out, dump it out and go right back in and do it all over again.”

The relaxation of penalties, combined with selective enforcement to focus on more “serious” crime, has seemingly been disastrous for the state’s larger cities. Although Prop 47 was championed by the state’s Democratic overlords, as well as by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), many attribute California’s growing property crime problem to lax initiatives like this one.

As Del Seymour of the non-profit Code Tenderloin emphasized to Fox News, the theft patterns in the city are a mix of international gangs, usually from Mexico or Guatemala, as well as homeless addicts looking to secure enough money to finance their next fix. The stealing and handoffs often take place in broad daylight and ironically, right in front of San Francisco City Hall. When I lived in San Francisco, City Hall was infamous for being a beehive of illicit activities and an area best avoided at all times of day.

Oddly enough, unrelated measures, like the additional charge for plastic bags, have made it more difficult for store owners to spot theft, given the frequency with which shoppers now simply throw items into their purses or backpacks after purchase. As Michelin noted, this type of behavior now allows shoplifters to “fit in” with the paying customers. Michelin predicts that stores will increasingly turn to locking up their products for fear of theft.

The jump in retail theft is just one part of the picture when it comes to property theft in the state. According to the San Francisco Police Department, there is a car break-in every 22 minutes in the city, resulting in the formation of neighborhood “vigilantes” devoted to stopping break-ins. A 2018 study from the Public Policy Institute found evidence that Prop 47 was a contributing factor in the almost 20 percent-increase in car break-ins from 2014 to 2016. It seems the rampant property crime in the city is creating a dystopian hellscape that the cops haven’t been awarded the authority to address.

California voters may have had enough. In 2020, California residents will vote on whether to rollback the reforms implemented under Prop 47 in the hopes of reinstating the deterrents that fell by the wayside under the auspices of the state’s Democratic leadership.

When I lived in San Francisco’s fabled Bernal Heights, I was instructed to empty my car each night to discourage thieves from smashing my windows. There were some evenings I would forget after a long commute home, and I would hold my breath walking to my vehicle in the morning, always relieved to see that the windows were still intact (I detail my San Francisco trials here). If California voters are smart, perhaps San Francisco’s next generation of residents won’t have to feel terrorized by the constant barrage of petty crime.

‘The View’ Host Falsely Claims Don Jr. Tweeting Whistleblower Identity Is A Crime,"On ABC’s “The View” Thursday, host Sunny Hostin falsely claimed it is a federal crime to name or out a whistleblower while interviewing guests Donald Trump Jr. and former Fox News contributor Kimberly Guilfoyle.

“You’re a lawyer, we know each other, you worked for a prosecutor,” Hostin said to Guilfoyle. “I mean, did you advise your boyfriend that it is a federal crime to out a whistleblower?”

Very embarrassing moment for @TheView's @sunny Hostin. She falsely claims ""it is a federal crime to out a whistleblower. … My law degree says it is."" But according to experts, @DonaldJTrumpJr is right! NPR: Experts Say It Would Not Violate Any Lawshttps://t.co/p0bv91VDq1 pic.twitter.com/3nWJBzo8gJ — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) November 7, 2019

“Well it’s not a federal crime. It’s only a federal crime for the IG to do it, that’s in the statute,” Trump Jr. said.

After this segment aired, Trump Jr. tweeted the statute that shows outing a whistleblower is only a crime for the Inspector General, not for a member of the media or a private citizen.

The hosts of The View are lying about the whistleblower statute. Here's the statute that proves it's only a crime for the IG to release the name of the whistleblower. Totally legitimate & legal for members of the media & private citizens to name him.https://t.co/M2DefCURRF — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 7, 2019

Trump Jr. is correct. The federal whistleblower statute requires only the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) to keep a whistleblower’s identity confidential, unless the ICIG determines it necessary to disclose.

No other government official is required to protect the anonymity of a whistleblower. There is no such statute that exists.

According to Sean Davis of The Federalist, “Such a requirement would be a blatant violation of the First Amendment as it would be an unconstitutional prior restraint on the freedom of speech and the press.”

The whistleblower statute only protects punishment by other government officials for blowing the whistle. This includes demotions, firings, or punishments of that nature.

Trump Jr. is well within his right to name the anti-Trump whistleblower.

That’s not stopping Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., from saying he wants to pass legislation to make what Trump Jr. did illegal.

“In the future, you will go to jail if you out a whistleblower. Legislation coming,” Swalwell tweeted.

In the future, you will go to jail if you out a whistleblower. Legislation coming. — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) November 7, 2019

Swalwell’s tweet infers that Trump Jr. tweeting out the whistleblowers name is legal, because it is.

San Francisco's New Socialist D.A. Is The Last Thing The City Needs,"On Saturday, public defender Chesa Boudin won the race to become district attorney of San Francisco. His victory, although celebrated as part of the larger national movement to elect more criminal justice reformers to offices of power, may not be such a gift to San Francisco, whose crime woes seem to be at least partly the result of too little criminal enforcement.

Boudin’s political leanings are fairly unsurprising. San Francisco’s newest DA and self-proclaimed socialist is the son of former members of the violent revolutionary far-left group Weather Underground, an organization that rose to infamy in the 1970s and carried out as many as two dozen bombings of government properties. Both of Boudin’s parents were imprisoned for murders related to a robbery they conducted as Weathermen, and Boudin’s father David Gilbert is still serving time.

In his parents’ stead, two other militant Weathermen, known as leaders within the organization, raised Boudin. Indeed, in an interview with Jacobin (yes, that Jacobin), Boudin spoke positively of how his four parents’ “activism” has inspired his own work, despite the “mistakes” they all made—a supposedly “charming” detail that is fundamentally grotesque.

As a Yale-trained lawyer, Boudin eventually left the United States to work as a translator for Venzuela’s now-deceased socialist dictator Hugo Chavez, an outrageous resume data point that ought to get someone laughed out of political office (for those unfamiliar, Chavez’s socialism eventually transformed Venezuela into a failed state). But predictably not so in San Francisco, where behemoth, yet ineffective government is fetishized to the point of allowing piles of human feces in the streets.

Starting January 1, 2020, Boudin will hold the office of the city’s top law enforcement official, but his staggeringly leftist vision—regarded by some as exceptionally to the left, even by San Francisco standards—may be at sharp odds for what the city needs.

True, Boudin isn’t entering the easiest of roles. Among the United States’ 20 largest cities, San Francisco currently ranks number one in property crime, a status that has been driven by a cottage industry of organized gangs reselling stolen goods, often in broad daylight. Boudin’s stated approach to crimes like this is to stop punishing them.

Boudin’s platform is nominally predicated upon reducing mass incarceration and racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Among Boudin’s declared initiatives is to no longer charge for gang enhancement, which significantly increases the penalties if an offender is found to have participated in a street gang.

Boudin has called this penalty “racially motivated” since recent studies have found that only 8 percent of documented gang members are white. However, San Francisco, whether its latest DA is willing to admit it or not, has a serious problem with gang activity. For instance, 70 to 80 percent of the city’s car break-ins are carried out by organized gangs, and a car is broken into in San Francisco 80 times per day. If these numbers suggest anything, there isn’t enough deterrence for joining a street gang.

Decriminalizing gang membership should not be used as a political cudgel to advance the left’s identity politics drivel, and doing so may have disastrous consequences. San Francisco has previously relaxed certain policies, reducing penalties for some facially non-violent charges, to reduce incarceration levels and allow police supposedly to focus on violent crime. While this method can be applied with some measured success, it requires a highly tailored approach that San Francisco has shown itself ill-equipped to carry out.

For instance, when San Francisco passed Proposition 47 five years ago, it met loud applause from criminal justice reform groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). But it was an abysmal failure. As I wrote last week when reflecting on Prop 47, “Prop 47 was allegedly designed to keep non-violent offenders out of the state’s already packed prisons by reducing certain non-violent felonies to mere misdemeanors. For instance, a thief can now steal twice as much as he or she formerly could before facing a felony charge. But thieves have begun to capitalize on this loophole. In cities like Vacaville, CA, just outside of the state’s capital, theft has more than doubled, and police believe Prop 47 is to blame.”

Boudin’s platform, in all its emphasis on reducing incarceration (as opposed to reducing crime), likely promises more failed policies similar to Prop 47. Some have voiced their discontent with Boudin’s election, which they fear will only exacerbate San Francisco’s current crime woes, ones that remained largely unaddressed by San Francisco’s former DA George Gascon. On Saturday, police union president Tony Montoya declared in an official statement, “Unfortunately, the election results mean that San Francisco residents will have to suffer through another four years of George Gascón style policies that have plagued our city and decimated public safety.”

Two Marches ago, I reflected in the tone of a sad desperado how San Francisco had begun to resemble a failed state. As a former San Franciscan, I have little hope that Boudin’s policies will do anything but exacerbate what is, by all metrics, an urban crisis fomented and sustained by excessive liberalism.

"If Biden Wasn’t Impeached Over Quid Pro Quo, Trump Shouldn’t Be Either","The Latin phrase quid pro quo means “this for that.” Whereas these ten letters have become “dirty words” in the left’s lexicon, the phrase is the very foundation of a market economy, in which people trade goods and services based on the valuations buyers and sellers place on them.

Governments behave similarly. The United States values having a democratically elected government sans corruption on Russia’s doorstep. Ukraine values U.S. aid. A mutually beneficial exchange takes place when Ukraine values American aid more than corruption and the United States values a corruption-reduced Ukraine more than the dollars it must part with to secure it. This is all part and parcel of strategic efforts to secure U.S. interests abroad.

The seminal issue in play in the Ukraine controversy is whether this exchange served the public interest of the United States broadly defined, the private interest of President Trump in attempting to submarine the candidacy of Joe Biden, or some combination of the two. While the motives of the two parties will never be known with certainty, the case for impeachment on the merits is decidedly weak.

To put it succinctly, if Biden remained in office given his public pronouncements regarding the quid pro quo, transitivity argues that Trump should as well. That is, at least until the 2020 election, when the court of public opinion weighs in at the ballot box.

The Economics of Exchange

In a market economy, consumers allocate their scarce dollars to purchase goods and services to maximize their utility or satisfaction. Businesses produce the goods and services that consumers desire by securing inputs that generate more in revenues than they impose in costs.

When I purchase a car for $30,000, we may infer that I value the car more than I value the $30,000. Symmetrically, when the dealership sells me the car for $30,000, we may infer that it values my $30,000 more than the car that it sold me.

Sending U.S. aid abroad to elicit desired legal, business, and social behavior from foreign governments is really no different. The only question on the table insofar as Ukraine is concerned is whether the underlying motivation for the exchange was private or public interest?

Just as the managers of a corporation are agents of the shareowners, elected government officials are agents for the citizenry. As such, they are expected to carry out their duties that serve the best interests of the country—the so-called public interest. When elected officials serve their private interests instead, they are no longer good stewards of the public trust. In such circumstances, they may be removed from office by another branch of government or via free elections.

Blurring the Lines Between Private and Public Interest

When as vice president Biden publicly proclaimed on video that he was withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine until the prosecutor investigating his son’s company was fired, was he acting in the private interest of his family or in the public interest of the United States? Unfortunately, the two are not mutually exclusive.

It is not inconceivable that the Obama administration harbored legitimate concerns about the Ukrainian prosecutor. The question is whether the Bidens benefitted personally from the dismissal of this prosecutor as a direct product or merely as a byproduct of the quid pro quo?

Blurring these lines is not benign. To maintain the public trust, elected officials must not only avoid impropriety, they must also avoid the appearance of impropriety. At least on this latter score, Biden failed.

Likewise, President Trump, acting as an agent for the American people, has a legitimate interest in securing a corruption-free Ukraine. He could have stated in no uncertain terms to Ukranian President Zelensky that U.S. aid is contingent on eliminating corruption in their government and that means identifying and prosecuting any and all individuals regardless of party affiliation that are complicit in the corruption.

This statement would have cast a wide enough net to include the Bidens without identifying them specifically by name. The fact that Trump singled out Hunter Biden in the discussion blurred the lines between the public and the private interest, but only because Joe Biden is a potential presidential rival for Trump.

This is a non-issue if Joe Biden were merely a private citizen whose son was involved in questionable business dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden does not warrant a free pass merely because he is running for president, nor does the president have license to invoke the power of the federal government to take out a political rival.

Nuance Needed, But Not Part of the Package

A more nuanced Trump would have found a way to motivate Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden as part of a larger corruption-eradication effort. Words do matter, and Trump is not as careful as he needs to be in parsing his.

This is unfortunate, but perhaps understandable. Trump did not work his way up to the presidency by winning a series of down-ballot elections. If he had, the rough edges that continually trip him up would have been smoothed over or he would have failed to advance. Nor did he work his way up to the presidency by climbing the corporate ladder and developing the diplomacy that is the sine qua non for such an ascent.

Trump’s path to the presidency was as unconventional as the man who occupies it. Working for change agents is never easy, precisely because they see the world differently, characteristically before the rest of the pack, and their relentless pursuit of the endgame invariably ruffles feathers along the way. To wit, for all of his creative genius, Steve Jobs would never have been anyone’s choice for boss of the year.

If Trump were more diplomatic he would unquestionably have less trouble with Congress, not to mention his cabinet. Unlike his predecessor, Trump is the antithesis of nuanced. He uses criticism as a form of political blood-doping; it energizes him.

Paradoxically, this may well explain why he is president. In electing Trump, the American people voted for the anti-politician in hopes of charting a different course for the country. It is perhaps not reasonable to ask Trump to be more artful in his discourse when he was voted into office precisely because he is not.

With both Biden and Trump, the lines were blurred between the private and the public interest. If nothing else, both men bear some culpability for failing to recognize that they were probably not the best choice to deliver the non-corruption message given the personal skin each had in the game. They failed to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

Transitivity of ‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors’

There is ongoing debate as to whether Trump tied U.S. aid to the investigation of the Bidens, or to the eradication of corruption in the Ukraine more generally. This issue will not be resolved anytime soon, if ever. The transcripts of the phone calls with President Zelensky and the testimony before Congress will amount to little more than a political Rorschach test.

To impose a higher standard on Trump than Biden cannot be justified, particularly when Biden aspires to the office Trump now holds.

Biden tied U.S. aid to the dismissal of his son’s prosecutor, as video clearly attests. Did the U.S. have a vested interest in the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor that transcends his investigation into the business dealings of Mr. Biden’s son?

Did Trump and Biden put personal interest above public interest? We will probably never have definitive answers to that question. What we do know is that Biden was not investigated, impeached, nor forced to resign for his actions. Is it principled for Trump to be impeached or forced to resign when the weight of the evidence supporting a personal interest quid pro quo is arguably stronger for Biden than it is for Trump?

Transitivity argues that if Biden remained in office despite a stronger signal of a personal interest quid pro quo, then Trump should as well in light of the decisively weaker signal of such impropriety. To impose a higher standard on Trump than Biden cannot be justified, particularly when Biden aspires to the office Trump now holds.

This is not to suggest that Democrats will not attempt to apply a different standard to Trump, because they already have. Nonetheless, this is one of those gambles in which Democrats win big or lose big.

If the Ukrainian affair bears no more fruit than their claims of Russian collusion, the Democrats will not retake the presidency or the Senate and risk losing the House in the process. House Speaker Pelosi is in for the fight of her political life, but this is an old story that the veteran, crafty politician should know well. If you go after the king, you had better not miss. That said, Pelosi’s party looks increasingly like the gang who couldn’t shoot straight.

Americans Aren’t Stupid

The issue on the table is not whether the president committed “high crimes and misdemeanors” however ill-defined these terms may be. The real question is whether behavior that has already been found not to constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” for one candidate can still be found to constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” for another candidate.

The American people are not stupid. In fact, they tend to exhibit uncommon wisdom and foresight at the presidential ballot box. If the past is prologue, Trump is well on his way to a second term while Biden won’t even be able to find his way to his own party’s nomination.

If there is a silver lining in all of this, it is that Congress is investigating prospective corruption rather than passing intrusive and economy-killing legislation. Had the 2016 presidential election been decided differently, corruption would be standard operating procedure.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/15/if-joe-biden-wasnt-impeached-over-a-ukraine-quid-quo-pro-trump-shouldnt-be-either/,2019-11-15
SCOTUS Won’t Hear Case Claiming Gun Maker At Fault For Shootings,"The U.S Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal from Remington Arms Company as to whether the Connecticut Supreme Court, in allowing a lawsuit by victims of the Sandy Hook tragedy to proceed against Remington, correctly interpreted a narrow exception to the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). PLCAA bars lawsuits against members of the firearms industry seeking to blame them for harm caused by the criminal misuse of a lawfully sold, non-defective firearms.

In March the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled (4-3) that this wrongful death lawsuit could proceed based on a claim that Remington’s advertising was a knowing violation of law applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms and that the advertising in question was the proximate cause of the murders committed by Adam Lanza.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s denial of Remington’s certiorari petition is disappointing to the firearms industry. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, filed an amicus brief on behalf of Remington. While the U.S. Supreme Court grants review in very few cases, we believe this case warranted review.

For decades NSSF has been working to defend members of the firearms industry against frivolous lawsuits. NSSF was instrumental in drafting and successfully advocating for the passage of the bipartisan PLCAA that was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2005.

The PLCAA simply codifies the bedrock common law principle that a manufacturer or retailer that lawfully sells a legal, non-defective product is not legally responsible for the subsequent criminal misuse of that product by a remote third person over whom the manufacturer or retailer has no control. That’s a long way of saying the PLCAAA says, “It’s the criminal who is solely responsible for his crime, not the manufacturer or retailer.”

Gun control advocates that are crowing about a big win shouldn’t cheer too early. Here’s what’s next.

The case, Soto v. Bushmaster, goes back to Connecticut state court for trial. There, the plaintiffs will need to prove that Remington’s advertising was a knowing violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), the only claim remaining in the case, and that it caused Lanza to murder innocent victims.

In a strongly worded and well-reasoned dissent, Connecticut’s chief justice, Richard A. Robinson, rejected the majority’s overly broad interpretation of the scope of the limited PLCAA exception (known as the “predicate exception”) as contrary to the legislative text, canons of statutory interpretation, and clear legislative history and purpose of the PLCAA.

The plaintiffs allege that certain marketing and advertising by Remington was “unethical, oppressive, immoral and unscrupulous” as laid out in CUTPA. In short, they argue the advertising for these lawfully produced firearms somehow enticed the murderer to commit his heinous crimes.

Nothing in Remington’s advertising of these products connotes or encourages the illegal or negligent misuse of firearms. Facts are important here: The murderer didn’t buy the rifle. The first crime this murderer committed was stealing the rifle that was lawfully purchased by his mother, Nancy Lanza, two years prior. The second crime he committed was murdering his own mother as she slept.

Further, nothing demonstrates that Nancy Lanza, who legally purchased and possessed the firearm, or her son, who stole it and committed unspeakable crimes, saw or were influenced in any way by any advertisement. Remington did not and does not advertise to felons, or encourage firearms’ theft or murder.

In fact, Remington promotes the lawful and responsible ownership of firearms. As NSSF members, Remington actively supports the industry’s Real Solutions. Safer Communities campaign, which advocates that firearms should be locked when not in use and adjudicated mental health records must be submitted to the FBI to keep firearms from prohibited individuals. The campaign also promotes the prevention of straw purchases and firearms retailer thefts and burglaries as well as outreach to prevent suicides.

The Supreme Court passed an opportunity to demonstrate the sound legal doctrine of PLCAA that the firearms industry is not responsible for the crimes individuals commit. The courts don’t hold Ford accountable when an individual chooses to drive drunk. It’s the driver’s fault for not obeying the law.

The same logic applies here. The criminal stole and misused a rifle that was never advertised to him. He committed the crimes. He alone bears the blame. As the Connecticut Supreme Court noted in its 4-3 decision allowing the case to proceed noted, “Proving such a causal link at trial may prove to be a Herculean task.”

Members of the firearms industry continue to feel sympathy toward the Sandy Hook victims. NSSF is headquartered in Newtown. But make no mistake: the murderer alone is responsible for his heinous actions.

"Bloomberg’s Apology For Stop, Question, And Frisk Is Shameful","Ladies and gentlemen, meet woke Michael Bloomberg. The newly minted, almost-candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination is planning to run in the moderate lane, but that didn’t stop him from reversing course on one of the biggest questions of his political career this week, and in the process, throwing his own legacy and the New York City Police Department under the bus. In an act of shameless pandering, the three-term New York mayor apologized for the policing tactic known as “Stop, Question, and Frisk.”

At a church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg made his farcical mea culpa, saying, “I got something important really wrong. I didn’t understand back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives — but as we know: good intentions aren’t good enough.”

If you look closely at this statement you can see what makes it nonsensical. He was focused on saving lives, God forbid. In 2002 Michael Bloomberg inherited from Rudy Giuliani the most effective police force to ever exist. When Rudy and his police commissioner William Bratton took over in 1994 there were over 2000 homicides in New York. By the time he left that number was more than cut in half.

Those numbers were the result of a revolution in crime fighting known as proactive policing. Central to this success was CompStat, a computerized system that allowed the NYPD to pinpoint where resources were needed to fight violent crime. In most cases, those resources were needed in black and Latino communities where murder rates were vastly higher than in other neighborhoods.

In 2002, when Bloomberg took over as mayor he brought on Ray Kelly to lead the NYPD. A tough-as-nails beat cop and the first person ever to rise from police cadet to police commissioner, Kelly’s tenure lasted until 2013 when the murder rate was almost cut in half again. His signature policy, which intended to and succeeded in keeping illegal guns off the street, was Stop, Question, and Frisk.

The practice of Stop, Question, and Frisk was rooted in the 1968 Supreme Court decision, Terry v Ohio, which allowed police officers without probable cause to arrest, to frisk a suspect they considered to be dangerous. What Kelly, the beat cop, knew was that police in their districts know where the danger is, and need the tools to protect against it. Under Kelly’s reign the risk of carrying an illegal gun in New York City became enormous, and he for one has no doubt that Stop, Question, and Frisk was essential in saving thousands of lives, most of them black and brown.

Not too long ago Michael Bloomberg agreed with that assessment. He was furious when a federal judge found the practice unconstitutional, notwithstanding Terry v Ohio, and even more irate when Bill de Blasio, who took over as mayor in 2014 refused to appeal the decision. Opponents of the practice argue that crime has continued to decrease since it stopped, although troubling indicators are already emerging.

But this argument fails to take into account the fundamental transformation of neighborhoods that Kelly’s police force undertook. It’s like looking at a drug addict who is five years sober and saying, “see, she’s still sober, rehab had nothing to do with it.” If Bloomberg had simply taken the position that Stop, Question, and Frisk is no longer needed that would be one thing, but to apologize for it is an insult the police force that helped make his reputation as an effective mayor.

This could not come at a worse time. In New York City today, people are jumping turnstiles en masse to protest police keeping the subway system safe. Officers have had buckets of water thrown on them and their vehicles. Every move the NYPD makes occurs under the gaze of 8 million smart phones and still abuse is rare. But that doesn’t keep the professional Left from smearing New York’s finest as a bunch of racist thugs, despite the fact that the NYPD is a leader in expanding diversity.

For Bloomberg to lend his voice to this slander in a cynical and vain attempt to win the White House is shameful. Michael Bloomberg was not the one patrolling the streets of New York City as the crime rate plummeted, much as he likes to take credit for it. He was not in harms way if criminals were carrying illegal guns, the NYPD were.

Bloomberg’s change of heart is not the result of any new information, its pure politics, plain and simple. And it is an insult to a police force that more than anything else, transformed the world’s greatest city and saved thousands of lives in the process.

How Republicans Won Phase One Of Impeachment,"With the likely conclusion of Rep. Adam Schiff’s impeachment proceedings, it’s worth taking a step back and looking at how things went for the majority Democrats and minority Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Democrats ideally would have started their inquiry with credible bipartisan support and run things in such a way that public opinion developed in their favor. Public opinion would build pressure on Republican members toward an impeachment vote that had even stronger bipartisan credibility.

That did not come even close to happening. To begin with, not only was the vote to begin proceedings not bipartisan, there was bipartisan opposition to it. Polling initially looked promising for impeachment, with media outlets attempting to claim significant bipartisan support for inquiry and removal, but then the polling moved in the wrong direction for Democrats.

Emerson polling showed that support for impeachment flipped since October from 48 percent support with 44 percent opposing to now 45 percent opposed and 43 percent in support. Among key independents, the switch was even more pronounced. In October, 48 percent supported impeaching President Donald Trump, with 39 percent opposed. Now, 49 percent of independents oppose impeachment, while only 34 percent support it.

A new Marquette University Law School poll found that 40 percent of registered voters in the swing state of Wisconsin think that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 53 percent do not think so. Another 6 percent weren’t sure.

A new Gallup poll shows that Trump’s approval has ticked up two points since the impeachment drama began, with 50 percent of Americans opposed to it and 48 percent in support. Henry Olsen notes that Gallup polls all adults, not just registered voters, meaning that a poll of registered voters would have Trump’s job approval even higher and impeachment opposed by closer to a 52-46 margin.

And not only are no Republicans expected to join with Democrats in an eventual impeachment vote, some members expect the bipartisan consensus against it to grow.

Republicans, by contrast, needed to aim for bipartisan opposition to the impeachment proceedings, keep their members in line, make the case that the impeachment proceedings lacked fairness, and that concern about Ukrainian corruption was legitimate. They managed to do all that.

Here’s why things went well for Republicans in phase one of impeachment.

It was completely unclear what crime, much less what high crime, Trump was accused of committing.

Before we get to the politics and how they were played by Republicans and Democrats, it should be noted that President Donald Trump has not been credibly accused of committing any crime, much less a high crime or misdemeanor. It’s almost shocking that Trump, of all people, keeps managing to do well on this score. Yet, as with the Russia collusion hoax, in which he was accused of being a traitor to his country, the lack of evidence for the charges against him is his ultimate saving grace.

What the charge is keeps changing, of course. The whistleblower initially suggested a campaign finance violation arising from a call Trump had with the president of Ukraine. That morphed into a quid pro quo for military aid to Ukraine, then extortion, then bribery, then obstruction of justice, then back to a quid pro quo, but this time only a quid pro quo for a White House meeting. The lack of certainty among even Trump’s critics certainly worked in his favor.

There can be no question that President Trump generally dislikes the boatloads of taxpayer cash in the form of foreign aid that is sent to countries, wishes other countries would support their neighbors more, and absolutely disliked Ukraine corruption. Further, we all know Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate Ukraine’s 2016 election meddling and the involvement of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden in well-known corruption of Burisma, the energy concern on which’s board the former VP’s son found himself on in questionable circumstances. We know these things because of Trump’s public statements and the release of his transcripts with Ukraine’s newly elected president.

We also know that Trump’s support of Ukraine increased over the Obama years, including with the provision of Javelin missiles. And precisely no one had any evidence of anything actually illegal happening, even if they wished that Trump loved foreign aid more and didn’t want the investigations he told everyone he wanted. That further made the case against Trump difficult to argue.

The hearings were boring and complicated.

Objectively speaking, they weren’t just boring but soul-crushingly boring. The testimony was lengthy, the discussion was complicated and bureaucratic. The questions weren’t particularly interesting and the answers they elicited weren’t particularly compelling. You can complain all you want about the fact that they were boring, but they were boring.

Media outlets did all they could to bolster Schiff’s show and ran the impeachment hearings non-stop, as if Schiff’s inquiry had a legitimacy it never quite managed to earn on the merits. But instead of viewership increasing over time, it decreased.

Reporters kept deleting their tweets because they were getting facts about the hearings wrong. If reporters who were paid to follow the hearings weren’t able to keep details straight, what hope was there for normal people who have real lives and better things to do than watch hearings all day?

Adam Schiff lacks credibility.

Democrats didn’t want Rep. Jerry Nadler chairing impeachment since he had so completely botched the initial impeachment effort that was the Robert Mueller probe. Any chair worth his salt would have investigated whether star witness Robert Mueller was fit to answer any questions, much less the questions needing careful handling for an impeachment probe given the failure to find treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election.

Instead, a seemingly confused Mueller destroyed the chance of convincing the country that he had run the probe that bore his name and had morphed into an attempt to nail Trump for vehemently fighting the false charge he was a traitor. A few other mistakes by Nadler meant that Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave Schiff the gavel for the big show.

Schiff had run the Democrats’ efforts in the Russia collusion conspiracy they peddled for several years. During that time, his team leaked like sieves to compliant media outlets such as CNN and falsely claimed for years to have secret knowledge of Trump being a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. With compliant media outlets, again, he tore down Republican members on his committee and their efforts to get at the bottom of the Russia collusion theory.

When it came time for impeachment, he followed the same pattern, leaking to the compliant media selected excerpts of transcripts to paint a false narrative. But this time, it didn’t work nearly so well. For one thing, the complexity that he weaponized so successfully in the Russia hoax didn’t work with the public. The public had been willing to at least consider an elaborate tale of Trump being a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election.

But when it turned out that Schiff, other Democrats, and the media had been completely wrong about their elaborate theory, it had consequences. They weren’t nearly so willing to fall for the old song and dance a second time, particularly on a story that conveniently began precisely the day after Mueller’s failed testimony.

Even worse for Schiff, he had destroyed the goodwill and comity that had once existed on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. While the compliant media were willing to spoon up whatever he gave them, Republican members knew not to trust him at all. They had also learned from the Russia collusion hoax that they had spent years painstakingly evaluating. Their report outlining Russian meddling as well as a report on some of the concerning behavior of government officials investigating the Trump campaign holds up infinitely better than the Democrats’ report on the same.

Democrats’ witnesses kept making Trump’s case for him.

While the argument for impeachment was difficult to understand, Democrats’ own witnesses kept making Trump’s case against “the swamp” for him. There is no question that these bureaucrats, sometimes using third-hand information, were deeply opposed to Trump, his policies, and his behavior. Their problem was that they were not elected president. In fact, they weren’t elected anything. Some of them were political appointees — a testament to the awful job Trump has done at finding personnel who can accomplish his policy goals — and other times they were career bureaucrats.

The Resistance has generally had a difficult time with this issue, but the proper way to litigate political differences is not with the 25th Amendment, threats to the Electoral College, leak campaigns, spying operations, or impeachment proceedings, but at the ballot box. At no time did any witness make an effective case for anything other than, at best, a trip to the ballot box.

In part because Schiff and his team seemed confused about what case they were prosecuting, questions to witnesses were almost always leading, but never focused on a particular or consistent goal. Conversely, Republicans kept focused during their questions, always pointing out that the witnesses didn’t actually have first-hand information, or were basing their views on their own conjecture, a shaky basis for impeachment.

In general, Republican members did a surprisingly good job on cross examining witnesses. The Democrats kept rolling out new star witnesses, and some, such as Gordon Sondland and Lt. Col. Alex Vindman had opening statements that were quite strong for Democrats. Their opening statements withered under strong GOP questioning.

GOP members stayed on message about the unfairness of the proceedings.

Schiff kept a tight hand on the wheel, controlling witness lists, controlling their testimony, keeping things secret, selectively leaking, and withholding information. That’s his prerogative, but for impeachment to be considered something other than political theater, the unfairness didn’t work.

The entire proceeding began because of a whistleblower claiming a nefarious phone call took place. Initially, Schiff insisted that this whistleblower testify. Schiff repeatedly demanded that testimony. That all changed the precise moment that it was revealed the whistleblower had communicated with Schiff’s staff, something both the whistleblower and Schiff had been dishonest about.

Republicans hammered Schiff about his self-serving about face, even if the media wanted to pretend it wasn’t a big deal. They also reminded him that they weren’t being allowed to call their own witnesses, ask questions, use transcripts of previous depositions, and other things that a fair proceeding would allow. It worked to their benefit.

The initial phase of impeachment being done prior to a vote being held, and in manipulated secrecy did not help Schiff’s case.

The media generally overpromised and underachieved.

The lack of daylight between Democrats and many in the media was difficult to ignore. They seemed to march in lockstep with the day’s messaging from Schiff, as well as the overall legitimacy of the proceedings.

Here, too, the media seemed to underestimate the significant toll their participation in the Russia hoax had on their credibility. Where the public previously may have been willing to trust them when they claimed they had done their homework before claiming some evidence of wrongdoing by Trump, that trust no longer exists.

Each day, Schiff’s team would leak out the messaging for the day along with the prepared testimony of the morning witness. “Wow,” the corporate media would all say in unison as they repeated the message.

The problem is that none of their bombshells exploded, as the Washington Post’s Marc Thiessen noted. The supposed “bombshells” rarely made sense, were frequently contradictory, were never based on first-hand information, and mostly just supported the claim that many bureaucrats wish they ran foreign policy instead of the president.

The general wackiness of the Resistance.

When Republicans mounted an effective case against the impeachment, NeverTrump zealots reacted in a crazed fashion. Some of them became enraged when Rep. Elise Stefanik, a young Republican member, effectively showed weaknesses in witness testimony.

George Conway called her trash and distributed a fake photograph of her supposedly behaving in boorish fashion. Nicolle Wallace, a woman who undermined the McCain-Palin campaign on which she ostensibly served before going to MSNBC, lashed out at Stefanik as “pathetic” and compared her negatively to Nikki Haley. Former Ted Cruz aide Amanda Carpenter called the fake photo “believable” and derided Stefanik as “obnoxious.”

By the end of the hearings, the media were falling back into their most dramatic Russia collusion theories, long since debunked. GQ writer Julia Ioffe, who has had a rough couple of years, saw a Russian plot in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette’s story about Hunter Biden being the father to an Arkansas child.

Impeachment will occur, but on the weakest possible grounds.

Impeachment has been all but a foregone conclusion since the moment Trump shocked the ruling classes with his 2016 victory. The Washington Post announced within minutes of his inauguration that the “campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.”

The Mueller probe was supposed to be the vehicle to accomplish this goal and it would have been if it had been able to come up with anything in favor of its dramatic tale of treasonous collusion to steal the election. Democrats responded to that defeat not by coming up with a stronger case, but a dramatically weaker one.

Still, if media reports are to be believed, it will proceed apace before heading to the Senate where Republicans will control the inquiry on much more favorable ground for Trump. There, they may drag things out to showcase questions about the Biden family’s enrichment during the previous administration, general corruption with countries that have powerful and connected American board members, and other witnesses that Schiff forbade.

They will presumably call the whistleblower to testify about who leaked information to him and which members of Schiff’s committee he worked with before filing his claim. They will almost certainly call Schiff himself to testify about his team’s role in helping the whistleblower set things in motion.

While many in corporate media will attempt to pretend otherwise, the first phase of impeachment did not go well for Democrats. It needed to be their strongest phase. It needed to be a time when support for the inquiry and impeachment grew. Instead, it shrank. Partly that’s due to Democrats’ failed strategy.

But GOP members also played a significant role. They stood strong against both the media and Democrats, showed very little weakness, sent signals early on that they weren’t going to sit back and cower during the proceedings, and generally learned a great deal from the previous few years’ efforts to undo the 2016 election.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/22/how-republicans-won-phase-one-of-impeachment/,2019-11-22
What Kids In Portland Public Schools Learn About Thanksgiving,"Pity the poor child in Portland, Oregon, schools. While many still think of Thanksgiving as a time to come together with family and friends to celebrate our multicultural heritage over a festive meal, eighth-graders in the Antifa epicenter have the notion drummed into them that Thanksgiving really is a celebration of the genocide of the Indians by greedy capitalist Europeans.

The district’s celebration of Native American Heritage Month in November is intended to, in the words of the National Congress of American Indians, “celebrate rich and diverse cultures, traditions, and histories and to acknowledge the important contributions of Native people,” as well as to “educate the general public about tribes, to raise a general awareness about the unique challenges Native people have faced both historically and in the present, and the ways in which tribal citizens have worked to conquer these challenges.”

One would expect a positive curriculum that delves into the diversity of the more than 570 federally recognized tribes, especially those in Oregon. As a second-grader in Rochester, New York, I remember eagerly learning about the Seneca Indians, a people who had lived in the very same place where I walked to school, with numerous families living in one “long house.” My instruction gave me an appreciation for the region’s history and for a people who lived there long before I did.

Today, in Portland, all eighth-graders are assigned Marxist Howard Zinn’s “A Young People’s History of the United States,” the simplified version of his phenomenally influential “A People’s History of the United States.”

Rebecca Stefoff adapted Zinn’s book from the original version, with sentences, in my opinion, at the third-grade level. It makes a cartoonish presentation of myriad people groups from the Bahamas and South America to New Mexico and New England. They are falsely oversimplified as universally peace-loving, Mother Earth-respecting, generous, and welcoming. All Indian tribes are lumped together as a mass of childlike people oppressed by the greedy capitalist explorers and settlers.

Stereotyping Everybody Involved

The stereotyping begins with the presentation of the “Arawak” Indians that Columbus encounters in the Bahamas. The same material is in the young people’s version, along with Zinn’s plagiarism and misleading selective quotations, which I document in my book, “Debunking Howard Zinn: Exposing the Fake History That Turned a Generation against America.” It uses material plagiarized from a short paperback screed written for high school students by Zinn’s radical anti-Vietnam War comrade and novelist Hans Koning.

Through Stefoff, Zinn describes the Arawaks as being “like the Indians on the American mainland”; all “believed in hospitality and sharing.” But Columbus was “hungry for money,” so “as soon as he arrived in the islands, he seized some Arawaks by force so that he could get information from them,” namely, the answer to “Where is the gold?” As a result, the Europeans enslaved, tortured, and executed the Arawaks to extinction.

Columbus’s landing was “the start of the history of the Europeans in the Americas. It was a history of conquest, slavery, and death.” As he does in the original version, Zinn speaks directly to the young reader, informing him of his position as a historian who will present the hidden ugly side of American history, telling “the story of the discovery of America from the point of view of the Arawaks” and of the Constitution “from the point of view of the slaves,” and on. Columbus is not the heroic explorer earlier historian Samuel Eliot Morison presented him as, but a genocidaire.

Deleting Columbus’s Pro-Native Statements

In the young people’s version, the same things are left out in Zinn’s transposition of Koning’s text that make up the first five pages, including critical passages from Columbus’s diary that indicate he warned his men to “take nothing from the people without giving something in exchange” and (in a set of ellipses for two pages of deleted material) his view of the Indians as “a people who can be made free and converted to our Holy Faith more by love than by force.”

Eighth-graders read, “The tragedy of Columbus and the Arawaks happened over and over again. Spanish conquerors Herman Cortés and Francisco Pizarro destroyed the Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of South America. When English settlers reached Virginia and Massachusetts, they did the same thing to the Indians they met.”

The Aztecs and Incas serve to implicate the English settlers as part of the capitalist European imperialist pattern. What is left out is the fact that Cortés was welcomed as a liberator by the tribes, especially the Tlaxcalans, who had been persecuted by the Aztecs for more than 100 years. Cortés could not have defeated the Aztecs without the help of the 50,000 Indians who joined him.

The Pequot War is attributed to the colonists “wanting the land” of southern Connecticut and Rhode Island. While admitting “massacres took place on both sides,” Zinn and Stefoff write, “The English used a form of warfare that Cortés had used in Mexico. To fill the enemy with terror, they attacked civilians, people who were not warriors. They set fire to wigwams, and as the Indians ran out to escape the flames, the English cut them to bits with their swords.”

Of course, the use of fire as “a form of warfare” was practiced by Indians long before Europeans came. It was used by the Tuscaroras and their allies against colonists in 1711, and in other attacks. The name Pequot, from pekawatawog, means “the destroyers,” a trait they displayed in the Pequot War. As I also point out, American Indians served in both World Wars, with deserved pride in their fighting abilities.

Indigenous Peoples Can Do No Wrong

In the “Young People’s History,” the Indians are described as superior human beings in every respect, down to treating their children better than did the Europeans because they shunned corporal punishment and imbued children “with independence and courage.”

The Iroquois, “the most powerful of the northeastern tribes,” shared land and food, and “the work of farming and hunting. . . . Women were important and respected . . . , and the sexes shared power. Children were taught to be independent. Not only the Iroquois but other Indian tribes behaved in similar ways.” Overall, the Indians “lived in greater equality than people in Europe did.”

Actually, Iroquois was the name of a confederacy of five tribes: Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca. The confederacy was established between 1450 and 1500 to “unite and pacify the infighting Iroquois and to gain strength in numbers in order to resist the opposition of Huron- and Algonquian-speaking neighbors.”

To add to the year-long immersion in Zinn are lessons from the Zinn Education Project, recommended for students as young as fifth-graders, on Columbus and the Cherokee Removal. ZEP even offers lessons for first- and second-graders, for example, on red-lining in Portland.

Never Talk about Any Native-Settler Cooperation

The school district provides other resources on its Native American Heritage Month website, including no-no’s in teaching about Thanksgiving. In a provided video, a Native American teacher instructs educators to never ever tell students that Pilgrims and Native Americans “helped each other.”

Making headdresses and headbands, or dressing up, is “cultural appropriation.” Creating Native American names and spirit animals is not “culturally sensitive.” Even coloring bows and arrows is forbidden, as is singing “Ten Little Indian Boys.” One of the resources she recommends is the notorious Southern Poverty Law Center’s curriculum, “Teaching Tolerance.”

Another recommended resource is a video produced by Teen Vogue featuring six girls somberly seated behind a table laden with a traditional Thanksgiving feast. They discuss “the real history of Thanksgiving” as a celebration of deaths of entire villages and “war crimes” as dramatic music plays. They describe what they are “thankful” for—their “culture” and being born “indigenous.” As the music comes to a doomsday crescendo, the six angrily overturn the table and declare, “Happy Thanksgiving, America.”

So when grandma asks the 13-year-old grandchild what she has been learning in school during “Native Heritage Month” she will likely hear a lecture about Columbus’s genocide, the Pilgrims’ “war crimes,” and the “cultural appropriation” of the squash casserole. Let us hope this teen will not overturn the Thanksgiving table.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/25/what-kids-in-portland-public-schools-learn-about-thanksgiving-war-crimes-and-racism/,2019-11-25
IG Report Shows FBI Has Lost Control Of Its Source Network,"Years ago, while I worked as a prosecutor, I received a visit from a detective in the local police department. A confidential human source (CHS) had approached him to ask for help with a felony case I recently filed. I knew who he was asking about because she so frequently appeared as a player in multiple felony cases. She had never cooperated as a potential witness in any case. The detective asked me to ease off on the prosecution.

“Why would I do that, Brad?” I asked (not his real name). Detective Brad explained that she provided valuable intel in an important case he was working. I knew better. In my position, I had oversight over prosecution of all non-victim crimes in the jurisdiction. This included all narcotics and property crimes.

“Detective, I’ve never listed you as a witness in one felony prosecution in the last year. You say you have all these CHSs, but where are the cases?” I asked. I knew some of his CHSs from cases made by other officers. They were all attractive females, including the one he was asking about. I had no idea what he was getting out of the relationships with these CHSs. But I did know he wasn’t making cases.

When law enforcement runs a confidential informant, it dances with the devil. The CHSs are typically recruited from the ranks of existing criminals. The relationship with law enforcement allows them to continue to commit crimes, in theory to maintain credibility with even more important criminal targets.

While several valuable cases rely upon such sources, the temptation for corruption can be devastating to the overall law enforcement enterprise. Cops get too close to their CHSs. Sometimes they accept gifts, drugs, even sex. The relationship can quickly deteriorate from a legitimate law enforcement exercise into a joint criminal enterprise in which the cop begins protecting and helping the criminal.

So it is no small thing that the FBI has failed to maintain controls over its confidential informant program. Indeed, the recent inspector general report, available here, shows that the program has run amuck. The FBI maintains an undisclosed number of CHSs, many of whom it has maintained a relationship with for more than five years. It pays $42 million a year to these CHSs.

How does law enforcement guard against CHSs seducing their handlers into becoming unwitting partners in crime? It’s a problem serious enough that the FBI invested heavily in creating guidelines for making sure the CHSs actually produce law enforcement information that justifies continued partnership with practicing criminals. So it is no small matter that the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General issued a 56-page report finding a total breakdown in oversight over the program.

The OIG found that the FBI has allowed oversight of these relationships to virtually disintegrate. It found that, since 2010, there has been 86 percent decline in personnel dedicated to overseeing and validating the CHSs. The few reviews that do continue to take place reveal significant problems.

Approximately a third of all reviews reveal problems that require supervisory intervention between the handler/CHS relationship or outright closure of the relationship. In one case, a CHS was discovered to be a child sex offender considered too repugnant to permit the relationship to continue. In others, the handling agent was found to have not properly reviewed the illegal activity of the CHS.

The OIG questioned whether the number of invalid, even corrupted, relationships with CHSs might be much higher, noting that handlers prepare reports of their CHS that “lack any significant risk factors” and that “field offices may avoid validation review of the most risky CHSs, to ensure that they can continue using them.”

As noted by the report, “As of May 2019, nearly 20 percent of the FBI’s [confidential human source program] met its definition of a long-term CHS.” A “long term” relationship with a CHS (more than five years) begs the question as to why the FBI is spying on something that isn’t producing a case. These “long term” relationships have the greatest potential for corruption and inversion the way infamous Boston mob kingpin Whitey Bulger turned his own FBI handlers into unwitting business partners.

The scale of the FBI program to pay CHSes is troubling and jaw-dropping. $42 million a year likely represents tens of thousands of criminals being paid to act as sources for the FBI. The rules exist to prevent the CHS from using the FBI to pursue his enemies. And that’s exactly what appears to have happened in the case of Christopher Steele, the CHS at the center of the Russia collusion hoax.

As I note here, Steele hated Donald Trump and used his existing relationship with the FBI to help launch the investigation against Trump, all while taking money from the Democratic National Committee. Effectively, the DNC paid Steele to use his relationship with the FBI to attack Hillary Clinton’s political opponent.

The number of rotten CHS/FBI relationships like Bulger or Steele impossible to know for sure. The OIG wrote, “We found that the FBI failed to comply with [Attorney General] Guidelines’ validation requirements and its own validation policies and procedures, and maintained a significant backlog of long-term CHSs awaiting validation…We believe these issues increased the likelihood that some of the risks associated with long-term CHSs were likely not mitigated.”

Risks likely not mitigated? What that means in non-OIG-speak is that there are countless rotten relationships within the FBI that enable criminals to proceed under the protection of the FBI without verifying the FBI is getting help to solve even bigger crimes. It’s a dangerous and widespread problem that must be aggressively and promptly addressed to restore public confidence in the FBI.

Democrat Witness: Evidence Of Crime Not Needed To Impeach Trump,"One of the Democrats’ witnesses slated to testify before the House on Wednesday as part of the latest partisan impeachment proceedings argued more than two years ago that President Donald Trump could be impeached even without evidence of a crime.

Harvard Law School Professor Noah Feldman, who claims to specialize in constitutional studies, told The New Yorker in an article published in May 2017 that Congress could vote to impeach the president without evidence justifying a “high crime and misdemeanor” constitutionally required for presidential impeachment and removal.

The New Yorker article says:

Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law School professor who specializes in constitutional studies, argues that, even without evidence of an indictable crime, the Administration’s pattern of seemingly trivial uses of public office for private gain ‘can add up to an impeachable offense.’

Feldman is set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to kick off phase two of the latest campaign to undo the results of the 2016 election.

Feldman will appear alongside Pamela Karlan from Stanford Law School, Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina Law School, and Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School to offer their legal opinions to the House Intelligence Committee on whether Trump committed an impeachable offense.

The latest conspiracy theory Democrats have come up with to oust the Republican president features Trump allegedly conspiring with the Ukrainian president to investigate political opponents at home in exchange for U.S. military aid. The charges have centered on a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, an unredacted transcript of which has been declassified and released to the public.

The transcript reveals no quid pro quo, and instead reveals an American president urging the Ukrainian leader to weed out corruption in its government, includes potential corruption related to the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, and to investigate the roots of Ukraine’s involvement in peddling the grand Russian collusion hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States.

Nevertheless, Democrats have rushed forward with impeachment proceedings based on the call, first with secret hearings held in the basement of the Capitol followed by the two weeks of public hearings that did nothing but exonerate the president.

In turn, public support for impeachment has not risen as Democrats had hoped, but plummeted, dashing hopes of galvanizing enough voters to apply pressure on Republican senators to vote to remove the president from office as a consequence of unsubstantiated claims.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/03/democrat-witness-evidence-of-crime-not-needed-to-impeach-trump/,2019-12-03
Seattle Prosecutes Pastor For Trying To Pray At Library Drag Queen Show,"This last June, a Christian pastor named Afshin Yaghtin dared to question the sexualization and objectification of our children on public property, and he paid the price. After his case was thrown out of court, last week Spokane officials announced they’ll appeal their prosecution of him for attempting to nonviolently use his free speech on public property.

In June, Yaghtin attempted to enter the Spokane, Washington, South Hill Public Library to quietly pray for children attending a Drag Queen Story Hour, an event in which a crossdressing person reads young children books about sexuality. When Yaghtin stepped onto the public property of the library parking lot, a slew of police officers confronted him and informed him he would not be allowed on public property — because he was a Christian opposed to men in dresses reading to children and exposing them to a sexual fetish.

This author was present at this event and watched as police arrested Yaghtin, who was not holding a sign or a megaphone, nor attempting to be disruptive. He simply wanted to enter a public building and exercise his constitutionally guaranteed rights. The pastor objected to police obstructing him from entering a public building because of his Christian faith — and they promptly arrested him for obstructing them. Yaghtin did not fight with police, and he did not raise his voice. He simply told the officers he had a constitutionally guaranteed right to enter the public library.

One would think that after Yaghtin was arrested, he would be let go with at most a warning, as he was not threatening, violent, or even an agitator. But the Spokane City Attorney’s Office pressed full charges against this dangerous Christian who dared to exercise his constitutional rights.

Thankfully, when brought before a Spokane Municipal Court, the judge rightly threw out the case for violating Yaghtin’s right to free speech and for a lack of evidence. This was a huge win for free speech and religious liberty — or was it? Unfortunately, this story is not over yet. The City of Spokane Prosecutor’s Office has indicated it plans to appeal the judge’s decision and make an example out of this Christian man.

Currently, Spokane is ranked third most dangerous for property crimes nationally, and 649 rape kits are awaiting attention, an opioid crisis is raging, and a serial killer still hasn’t been caught, yet the city attorney’s office is determined to throw the book at a pastor who had an opinion about a sexist minstrel show being performed for children.

Why is the city so intent on going after a Christian exercising his constitutional rights? How dangerous can Christian ideology be that the city will invest so many resources in prosecuting one man for allegedly obstructing the police rather than into investigating rape or murder? Does the City of Spokane Attorney’s Office have an anti-Christian bias? The lead prosecutor’s social media indicates so. On Facebook, he referred to people associated with the case as “religious loonies.”

Opposing exposing children to drag — a misogynistic and demeaning sexual fetish — automatically makes a person a “religious loony,” according to the city prosecutor who is continuing the appeal. This statement alone paints a picture of a biased prosecutor with a bigoted, anti-Christian, liberal agenda.

The Spokane City Council also has a history of bias against the conservative Christian population, threatening to shut down religious services and prayer vigils outside Planned Parenthood and libraries hosting Drag Queen Story Hour. Council members regularly accuse these Christians of being extremists and sending out the full force of the Spokane Police Department to every outdoor prayer event they have.

Prosecutors with biased political agendas are nothing new in this country. We see this playing out at the federal level in the attacks against conservatives and the president. They relentlessly prosecute citizens for process crimes, but they are really attacking them for their political ideology.

At libraries across the country, drag queens are reading gender-queer books to preschoolers. Planned Parenthood is passing out condoms and lube to tweens. Trans activists are telling teens the wonders of hormone replacement drugs and genital mutilation. Meanwhile, leftist hit jobs have resulted in the arrests and media smears of conservative Christians. While sexual deviants and porn peddlers have free reign and access to our children, conservative Christians are arrested for objecting.

There’s an old saying, “If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.” But what if you didn’t commit a crime? Or even worse, the crime was committed against you and your constitutional rights were violated — yet you’re the party being pursued to do the time? And the only so-called crime you’ve committed is being a Christian and speaking and acting like one?

A corrupt justice system propped up by biased media will be the downfall of our country, for it will lead to the collapse of the rule of law. I hope the irony of this corruption led by district attorney’s offices across the country is not lost on the judiciary. It certainly isn’t lost on the law-abiding citizenry.

Democrats Are Passing The Weakest Impeachment In American History,"Democrats are on the verge of passing the fourth set of articles of impeachment this week through the House Judiciary Committee, putting the House one step closer to officially impeaching President Donald Trump. They include one article for “abuse of power” and one article for “obstruction of Congress.” Judiciary committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said near midnight last night the vote will be held this morning at 10 a.m.

It all marks Democrats’ closest attempt to finally achieve the top item on their policy agenda for the past three years: to reverse the results of the 2016 election. It has been an ongoing effort since day one of the Trump presidency and has been destined for failure from the beginning.

First, it was Russia. Democrats and a complicit media tried for years to convince the American public that Trump was a Russian asset working to undermine the interests of the United States for an adversary. After wall-to-wall media coverage, a deep-state FBI surveillance operation based on junk information funded by the Democratic National Committee, and a two-year special counsel investigation with unlimited resources, no one, none of the Democrats, no one in the media, not even Robert Mueller found one person from the Trump campaign, let alone Trump himself, had colluded with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton.

Since the grand failure of the Russian collusion hoax, Democrats have pushed onward with their attempts to delegitimize the Trump presidency. They’ve advocated for the destruction of the constitutionally created Electoral College, labeling it a “racist” institution. They’ve continued to claim Trump’s victory was a consequence of “fake news.” They’ve claimed Russia “hacked” the election. They’ve rioted across the country chanting “resist” at every opportunity.

The latest attempt now supposely centers on Ukraine. The latest scheme to undo the will of nearly 63 million voters in 2016 relies on yet another conspiracy theory lodged by Democrats offered legitimacy once again by a compliant media, this time alleging Trump conspired with the Ukrainian president to investigate political opponents at home.

The evidence Democrats have relied on, however, makes for the weakest impeachment ever launched in American history, highlighting gross abuse of congressional power and serving as a national embarrassment.

Examining The Evidence

The impeachment proceedings were kicked off by an anonymous whistleblower complaint of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint marked “credible” and “urgent” by the intelligence community inspector general despite no first-hand knowledge of the phone call was rejected by the Department of National Intelligence. An unredacted transcript of the phone call, however, was still declassified and released to the public by the administration, putting the conversation between the two world leaders in plain sight for all to see in an unprecedented move.

Democrats have argued the call reveals a seditious President Trump pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden’s family in exchange for nearly $400 million in military aid that was withheld days before the call.

Upon the transcript’s release, media outlets selectively sliced up the text to fit the false narrative of Ukrainian collusion. The Washington Post and The New York Times glossed over entire portions of the transcript to corroborate misleading headlines connecting “favor” with an investigation of the Biden family. CNN completely omitted 540 words on air to frame the president in an claimed quid pro quo.

A true and honest reading of the transcript however, offered no such evidence. The grand revelation from its release? That the American president urged the leader of one of the world’s most corrupt nations to rid his government of the corruption, and to investigate Ukraine’s peddling of the Russian collusion hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States. That’s the basis for which Democrats are impeaching President Trump for a “high crime and misdemeanor.”

In 1868, President Andrew Johnson, the first president ever to be impeached, clearly violated a congressional statute. A century later, President Richard Nixon clearly did something wrong and resigned before the articles could pass a full vote on the floor of the House. Twenty years ago, President Bill Clinton lied under oath.

Trump’s “high crime?” That he demanded a foreign leader clean up his own government. President Zelensky himself even said he felt no pressure to launch the requested investigations to receive the aid.

Of course, it is up to the House to define what exactly constitutes a “high crime and misdemeanor.” With this loose authority, it’s surprising that it has taken this long for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to finally pick something to charge the president, given the 86 bogus reasons Democrats have come up with to impeach. Granted, Democrats placed a big bet on Mueller report solidifying their made-up charges of collusion based on debunked intelligence from the DNC-funded Steele dossier.

The Democrats’ Own Witnesses Exonerated the President

House Democrats still held four weeks of impeachment hearings to make their case to the public — two weeks of hearings in the House Intelligence Committee to interview fact witnesses followed by two weeks of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee to make their legal arguments.

Neither round produced any incriminating evidence to impeach the president of any kind of crime, whether it be a “quid pro quo,” “bribery,” or “extortion,” let alone the conventional standard of a “high crime and misdemeanor” constitutionally required to pursue presidential impeachment. In fact, to the contrary, witnesses called by Democrats either destroyed their own credibility as characters of the deep-state or exonerated the president of any wrongdoing.

Ousted former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich blatantly admitted that Trump committed no crime.

“Do you have any information regarding the president of the United States accepting any bribes?” Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah asked during her hearing.

“No,” Yovanovitch said.

“Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the president of the United States has been involved with at all?”

“No.”

Enter Former State Department Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Staffer Tim Morrison whose testimonies both sliced straight through the crux of the Democrats’ impeachment theory. In their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, both affirmed that there was no quid pro quo offered from Trump to Ukraine regarding the withheld military aid, which was ultimately released.

“In no way, shape or form in either readouts from the United States or Ukraine did you receive any indication whatsoever, or anything that resembled a quid pro quo, is that correct?” Republican counsel Stephen Castor asked Volker.

“That’s correct,” Volker said. “I was never involved in anything that I would consider to be bribery at all…or extortion.”

Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California also posed the same question to Volker and Morrison, who were testifying together.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?” asked Nunes.

“No,” said Morrison.

“No,” said Volker.

U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland’s testimony was also supposed to be a bombshell day for Democrats, and mainstream media reported that it was. Sondland indeed testified that he believed there was a quid pro quo offered with Ukraine in exchange for the military aid.

Sondland, however, who had changed his testimony several times since the start of the impeachment process, offered no hard evidence to prove his claim and admitted during his testimony that his conclusion was based entirely on presumptions. Sondland was also asked during the hearing whether anyone told Sondland that the military aid was contingent on any political investigations.

“Mr. Sondland, let’s be clear: no one on this planet—not Donald Trump, Rudy Guiliani, Mick Mulvaney, Mike Pompeo—no one told you aid was tied to political investigations, is that correct?” Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio asked the ambassador.

“That’s correct,” Sondland said.

Sondland further conceded that Trump explicitly told the ambassador that he wanted “no quid pro quo.”

When impeachment proceedings came to the Judiciary Committee, no witnesses offered any new facts to advance the Democrats’ case. Instead, legal experts offered their own opinions on whether what Trump committed was impeachable conduct.

The Biden Problem

Witnesses testifying before the House Intelligence Committee also furthered the case to investigate the Biden family, with every single person to come before the committee agreeing that there was a perceived conflict of interest when Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden was serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while Joe Biden oversaw U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president.

Hunter Biden was raking in $50,000 a month for serving on the board despite no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of comparable board compensation reveals this sum to be astronomically higher than what Hunter should have been making even with a high level of expertise in the field.

“My concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,” testified Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. Kent also told lawmakers that in 2015, Kent raised his discomfort over the situation the Obama White House, which brushed off his discontent.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told lawmakers in an October private deposition. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth the deal with family related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

Even Democrats Are Peeling Away From Impeachment

Public polling has shown Americans have not bought into the Democrats’ charade. Even after four weeks of hearings, public support for impeachment has failed to rise as Democrats had hoped, remaining steady at the same levels prior to the public proceedings.

A new Monmouth poll released Wednesday reveals that a majority of voters remain opposed to Trump’s impeachment 50-45 percent, well outside the survey’s +/-3.3 percent margin of error.

NATIONAL POLL: Support for impeaching and removing @realDonaldTrump unmoved by public hearings in House. 45% support (44% in November)

50% oppose (51%)https://t.co/HPGFli9vo1 pic.twitter.com/r3ac3D8kHH — MonmouthPoll (@MonmouthPoll) December 11, 2019

Further, impeachment has become wildly unpopular in key congressional swing districts vital to Democrats hoping to cling to their House majority next fall. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Democrats are now bracing for at least six additional moderates to break from the party on the House floor next week when the articles come for a full vote. Two Democrats already defected from impeachment when the House voted on the formal proceedings late in October.

The only bipartisan vote likely to take place next week is in opposition to the Democrats’ partisan effort to cast aside the will of the voters in 2016.

New Expose Outs Another Pedophile Among France’s Literary Elite,"Modern society has agreed on certain taboos, written and unwritten rules that can help keep people in line and societies flourishing. Many of these taboos cross cultural boundaries and continents, uniting us in mutual opposition to things like theft and murder. Yet apparently one taboo not all countries can agree on is sexual crimes against children.

This form of child exploitation is now challenging societal norms in France with the publication of the novel “Le Consentement,” or “The Consent,” by Vanessa Springora, detailing her relationship with a famous French writer, Gabriel Matzneff.

Matzneff might not be a household name in America unless French literature is really your thing. Matzneff’s books were published by Gallimard, one of France’s primary publishing houses. He’s written books for decades detailing his sexual preferences for children, both boys and girls, under the age of 16, even titling one of his books “Under 16 Years Old.” Somehow more than 40 of these books have been published. If this appalls you, you’re in good company.

Matzneff’s perversions have not been private, hidden, or pushed to the side, but a vital part of his literary career. He’s done radio and TV interviews about his behavior, published columns and books about his sexual preferences, and traveled in search of children to add to his list of sexual exploits.

His career demonstrates the uncomfortable truth that pedophilia has been accepted, not punished, in France when it is carried out by authors and artists, including other French notables such as Michel Foucault, John-Paul Sartre, Charles Baudelaire, and Georges Bataille, and published by elite sources such as Libération and Le Monde. This is an issue lurking behind many so-called literary elites. Matzneff’s situation is just more uncomfortable and acute because he is still alive, still writing, and has an accuser now doing her own writing about his misdeeds and their effects on her life.

Matzneff’s Crimes Were Far from ‘Exceptional Love’

Since the publication of “The Consent,” French prosecutors have begun to look into Matzneff. France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, has also announced a review will be conducted of the government’s writer’s allowance that pays Matzneff’s living expenses.

While this shows some belated attention by authorities to Mazneff’s evil actions against children for decades, it’s almost too little, too late. Twenty-five years ago, another culture minister in France awarded him the Order of Arts and Letters, which “recognize[s] eminent artists and writers, as well as people who have contributed significantly to furthering the arts in France and throughout the world.”

Springora’s book chronicles her relationship with this famous author, who was 50 years old when they met, from their initial meeting when she was 13 years old through their sexual relationship when she turned 14. At the time she believed she was in love with him. He would pick her up from school, take her to his house in the afternoon, and be physically intimate with her. This all changed when Springora discovered she wasn’t unique in Matzneff’s life, but part of his pattern of seducing young teens, including traveling to Asia to pay to perform sex acts on children.

Matzneff doesn’t deny the sexual relationship with Springora. Nor does he deny that it happened when she was under France’s age of consent, which is 15. He excuses the relationship because of what he calls “exceptional love” between the two of them, despite the massive and illegal age gap. He also says he won’t read her book because doing so will cause him emotional pain.

He took all of those actions despite the damage and harm done to the child involved. Serial child rape isn’t something society should ignore, even when it’s couched in terms of seduction and love, attraction, and the older party’s desire for young partners. This isn’t about sex between consenting adults, both with equal power in the relationship. This is about influential people seeking out schoolchildren to use for their sexual desires — and about a culture that has excused this practice for decades.

Elites Should Get No Pass for Child Sex Crimes

In France especially, this attitude flourished because of beliefs about the freedoms and rights of elite, creative people. Pierre Verdrager, a French sociologist, wrote about this troubling trend and the ripples across French culture, noting, “There was an aristocracy of sexuality, an elite that was united in putting forth new attitudes and behavior toward sex. And they were also grounded in an extreme prejudice toward ordinary people, whom they regarded as idiots and fools.”

It is beyond time for France to stop excusing poor behavior because of perpetrators’ professional output. Other famous celebrities with problems relating to child sex crimes, such as Roman Polanski, who was convicted of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl in the United States, live in the country without penalty. Society has no good place for adults who think children should be their sexual partners, nor for societies that excuse this practice. Children should be able to enjoy their childhoods, not be pursued by predators decades their senior.

We can have art without encouraging perversion or excusing it when it is brought to light. It’s time for Matzneff to be accountable for the young lives he scarred, and for the French to face exactly why they ignored this for so long. Talent and degradation do not need to go hand in hand. All children deserve far better than this.

Many People New York Jails Might Soon Go Home Under New Bail Law,"Forty percent or more of people in jail awaiting trial in New York could soon be released as a result of the 2020 Bail Reforms Bill that went into effect on January 1. The bill, which was passed in the state Senate by a Democrat majority last year, eliminates bail for defendants being prosecuted for misdemeanors, felonies labeled nonviolent, somefelony robberies, and burglaries in the second degree.

While 40 percent might sound like a high number, the statistic may go up as the law is implemented. The Vera Institute of Justice predicts that’s a conservative estimate of the effect the bill will end up having on prisons in New York.

Bail is supposed to encourage defendants to show up in court. It’s an indeterminate amount of money that judges can chose to charge defendants when the judges think they might attempt to evade trial. In a criminal case, the defendant goes through two court hearings. The first formally introduces the charges to the defendant, at which point they have a chance to enter a plea. The second trial, which happens at a later date, evaluates the charges in light of the evidence.

Sometimes, judges release defendants on the good-faith promise that they will return to court for their trial, and that promise is called a “release on recognizance.” After swearing to their return, the accused is free to go.

But not all defendants can be considered trustworthy—especially when the crimes they are being charged with are substantial. It’s in these instances where bail comes into play. The amount is up to the judge: it could be as little as $100 or well above $10,000. If the defendant meets all required court appearances, that sum will then be returned. When the accused is either unwilling or unable to pay the bail, he’ll await trial in jail.

To put it bluntly, bail is either court insurance or jail assurance.

But as of January 1 in New York, bail is no longer applicable for misdemeanors, felonies labeled nonviolent, and some instances of theft. For violent offenses, bail is still applicable. In cases involving a charge of violence, the bill instructs judges to take into account the severity of the crime and a defendant’s ability to pay the amount. With the exception of those charged with violent crimes, a whole lot of people are in prison right now for a bail that no longer applies to them.

More People Charged With Crimes Free

For better or worse, individuals who have been charged with things like driving under the influence, possession of a controlled substance, stalking, trespassing, assault as a minor, and vandalism could be reappearing on the streets. Some think that’s a cause for concern, especially personnel in law enforcement like New York City’s police commissioner, Dermot Shea.

“The cash bail is not at what the heart of what concerns me,” Shea told 1010 Wins, a New York radio outlet. “It’s the fact that when we have an individual who poses a danger to the community, that’s arrested over and over, and really breaks laws, that this person gets put right back on the street. It’s not about the cash bail, it’s about danger as the priority for us.”

A research brief from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice took the policies laid out in the bill and applied them to New York City prison numbers from 2018. In 2018 in New York City, 31,609 people committed some sort of crime and, as a result, were subject to bail. Some paid and walked free and some didn’t and waited for their trial in jail.

Keep in mind that 31,609 is the total number of bail cases for the whole year—not all of those cases resulted in a stay in jail. Of those, bail was set and not paid for in 27,235 cases, resulting in the incarceration of the defendant. That’s 88 percent of cases involving bail in one year. Thus, in the vast majority of cases where a bail was set, the defendant went to jail before trial.

The study further found that if the 2020 Bail Reforms been in place two years ago, of the total 31,609 cases where bail was used, 20,349 would have no longer qualified. That’s 64 percent of all bail cases and a whole lot of defendants, most of whom would have otherwise been in jail.

With numbers like that, it’s not hard to see why commissioner Shea is worried about keeping New York safe. So it begs the question, why would Democrats want to pass a bill that makes a defendant’s return to the street more likely?

Lots of People in Jail Who Haven’t Been Convicted

There are two stated main reasons for the reforms. First, it’s there to decrease the amount of resources used on the criminal system. According to the Vera Institute, the daily average number of people in jail in NYC in 2018 was 24,000. The bill is partially an attempt to bring that number down, along with the costs associated with it. Secondly, and more importantly, the bill is supposed to address concerns that bail unfairly targets defendants with less money. And that’s really the crux of the issue.

Back in 2016, Jeffrey Pendleton, a 26-year old from New Hampshire, was charged with possession of substance. It wasn’t a particularly dangerous drug. It wasn’t cocaine or LSD or ecstasy, it was marijuana. His offence wasn’t really threatening as far as crimes go, but then again neither was his bail.

All he had to do was hand over $100 and Pendleton would have been able to walk free until his trial. But unknown to law enforcement, Pendleton was struggling to make ends meet, unable to pay rent, and, as a result, was incarcerated on March 8. On March 13, less than a week later, Pendleton was found dead in his prison cell. The cause of his death is uncertain.

While Pendleton’s story certainly isn’t typical, he isn’t the only one to have been unable to meet bail—even an extraordinarily low bail—and leave behind a sad story. Many defendants who can’t pay end up pleading guilty instead of fighting their charges, facing the consequences of whatever might come next. It’s stories like these that cause reformers to assert that bail unfairly targets poor people and makes some observers want to get rid of bail completely.

Yet Sometimes Bail Protects People

But here’s a different kind of sad story. In April of last year, Samuel Lee Scott, a 54-year old resident of St. Louis, was arrested and couldn’t afford his $5,000 bail to go home during a lengthy preparation for trial. Scott was well on his way to jail when a nonprofit group paid Scott’s fee, freeing him to go home to his wife.

Tragically, what the nonprofit overlooked was that Scott had been arrested on domestic abuse charges. What initially looked like a happy intervention soon turned murderous. Later that night, after having endured extreme beatings, Scott’s wife was rushed to the hospital and died from her injuries the Saturday after.

Both of these instances point to a need to reform bail policy. Yes, bail can hurt poorer individuals. But bail can also save lives and protect innocent bystanders. Clearly, some crimes are too dangerous to allow people to walk free. On the other hand, there are certainly people who have been unable to pay bail, thrown in jail for feeble charges, and suffered disproportionately terrible consequences.

Democrats are right about the need for a change in policy. But will the 2020 Bail Reform Bill provide changes that will protect poor defendants and the people on the streets?

We’ll Find Out the Effects Soon Enough

The real question is whether the 2020 bill has managed drawn the line somewhere down the middle. For now, that line has been drawn at violent crimes, which helps prevent cases at either extreme. Under the 2020 reforms, it appears Pendleton and Lee’s stories are more unlikely. Pendleton would have walked free until the time of his trial and Lee’s pretrial would have most likely been set at a much higher bail.

That may not be good enough. For commissioner Shea, keeping bail around for violent crimes but eliminating it for others doesn’t seem to comfort him all that much. A whole lot of crimes in the middle of the two extremes still hurt innocent New Yorkers every day.

“I don’t see a distinction between these low-level crimes and…let’s say a robbery or one of the more ‘serious’ crimes,” he said. “Each crime really has an impact on victims.”

It’s possible that in a well-intentioned attempt to solve one problem, the bill has created an entirely new set of public concerns. This becomes increasingly troubling as recent antisemitic attacks have taken the criminal spotlight in NYC.

Last month, for instance, a woman named Tiffany Harris was taken into custody and released without bail after allegedly slapping a number of Jewish women. Small acts of aggression like these have been building up in the last few weeks, leading to public outcry and demonstrations. It’s in light of recent events like these that led Gov. Andrew Cuomo, once an avid supporter of the 2020 Bail Reform Bill, to admit that it might need a second look.

“We’re going to need to work on it because there are consequences we have to adjust for,” Cuomo told reporters at CBSN. Cuomo made no mention of the 2020 Bail Reform Bill when he addressed audiences in his State of the State speech Wednesday night.

IG Bombshell: Did The DOJ Ask Putin’s Buddy To Help Get Trump?,"A previously unnoticed passage in Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on federal surveillance abuse suggests Bruce Ohr and his compatriots were willing to bargain with a Russian oligarch to take down Donald Trump.

Two-hundred-plus pages into the IG report, while discussing former Associate Deputy Attorney General Ohr’s continued contacts with Crossfire Hurricane dossier author Christopher Steele, Horowitz revealed a significant detail that to date has been overlooked: “On December 7, 2016, Ohr convened an interagency meeting (including representatives from the FBI) regarding strategy in dealing with Russian Oligarch 1.”

The IG report added that after the meeting “one of Ohr’s junior Department colleagues who attended the meeting” asked “Ohr about why the U.S. government would support trying to work with Russian Oligarch 1”—the moniker used in the IG report to refer to one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants, the aluminum oligarch Oleg Deripaska.

Ohr’s reported response is shocking: “Ohr told her that Steele provided information that the Trump campaign had been corrupted by the Russians,” and that the corruption went all the way to president-elect Trump. Ohr’s junior colleague told the IG that Ohr explained “this information was ‘the basis for the [Deripaska] discussion” in the interagency meeting they had just left.

It has been known for some time that Steele spoke with Ohr about Deripaska. But while the Steele-friendly press portrayed those discussions as FBI attempts to flip Deripaska, the IG reached a different conclusion. He found “Steele performed work for Russian Oligarch 1’s attorney on Russian Oligarch 1’s litigation matters, and, as described later in Chapter Nine, passed information to Department attorney Bruce Ohr advocating on behalf of one of Russian Oligarch 1’s companies regarding U.S. sanctions.” The IG further found that Ohr and Steele’s communications concerning Deripaska occurred “in 2016 during the time period before and after Steele was terminated as a [Confidential Human Source].”

These findings, coupled with previous reports that Steele worked for one of Deripaska’s lawyers, London-based Paul Hauser, and appeared to lobby on behalf of Deripaska through a D.C.-based attorney, Adam Waldman, renew questions concerning whether Steele violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Likewise, the IG report’s notes that “Ohr said that he understood Steele was ‘angling’ for Ohr to assist him with his clients’ issues,” and that “Ohr stated that Steele was hoping that Ohr would intercede on his behalf with the Department attorney handling a matter involving a European company,” suggest the need for a FARA investigation into Steele’s work.

But the larger question concerns what the above excerpted passage from the IG report suggests about the December 7, 2016 meeting.

5 Things We Learned From This Excerpt

While no further mention was made of this meeting in the IG report, and while Horowitz remained vague in his description of the meeting, the passage nonetheless revealed several key points: (1) that Ohr had “convened,” (2) the “interagency” meeting, (3) after Americans elected Trump . We also know that (4) one of Ohr’s Department of Justice junior colleagues attended the meeting, at which (5) there was a discussion of “trying to work with” Deripaska.

From these facts, we can surmise that Ohr called the December 7, 2016, meeting in his capacity as then-director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), for three reasons. First, OCDETF is a multi-agency task force, comprised of members from the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Treasury Department, U.S. Postal Service, and Department of Labor. Second, Ohr testified before Congress that, as director of OCDETF, his duties included “coordinate drug and organized crime investigations within the Department,” and that “organized crime investigations” including transnational investigations of Russian organized crime and Russian oligarchs.

Relatedly, the IG report noted that Ohr said when he became the OCDETF director, his boss “expressed his desire for Ohr to expand OCDETF’s mission to include transnational organized crime matters.” Ohr then told the IG “that, as a result, he continued working on transnational organized crime policy and, in order to maintain awareness, tracked Russian organized crime issues.” Finally, we know that one of Ohr’s “junior colleagues” attended the meeting, indicating Ohr called the gathering in his official capacity and not as part of his unauthorized Crossfire Hurricane spying.

We can also surmise that because the IG did not identify any specific FBI agents from the Crossfire Hurricane investigation as present at Ohr’s meeting, the “representatives from the FBI” in attendance were not ones involved in the Russia collusion probe. Further, had other members of the Crossfire Hurricane team been present at the December 7, 2016 meeting Ohr called, Horowitz would have surely discussed their role.

Likewise, we can infer that Ohr did not explain during his meeting why the task force should “try to work with” Deripaska, because had he, his junior colleague would have had no need to question him on that point after the meeting. Finally, we know from Ohr’s response to his junior colleague that he suggested working with Deripaska because of the “intel” Steele provided that the Trump campaign was corrupt—all the way up to the then-president-elect.

The implications are startling: Ohr, in his apparent capacity as director of OCDETF, called a meeting of agency members to discuss “working with” a Russian oligarch because of his belief, premised on the unverified Steele dossier, that President-elect Trump was corrupt.

Yet it appears from the IG report that Ohr did not convey to his interagency team why he sought to work with Deripaska, much less that Steele’s “intel” formed the basis for his advocacy. Again, why else would his junior colleague need to inquire on that point?

The Details Don’t Stop There

Ohr’s supervisors were also unaware of Ohr’s contact with Steele, but here there is another significant detail from the IG report: “When asked why he did not alert anyone in ODAG [the Office of the Deputy Attorney General] about his contacts with Steele and Simpson, . . . ‘Ohr stated that his contacts with Simpson and Steele were not part of any of his OCDETF cases, so he provided the information to the FBI and career people instead.’”

Maybe his “contacts” with Simpson and Steele were “not part of any his OCDETF cases,” but did the Steele “intel” prompt Ohr to push for the United States to work with Deripaska in Ohr’s role as director of OCDETF?

The timing of the December 7, 2016, meeting suggests another troubling possibility: that Ohr called the meeting to discuss the U.S. government “working with Deripaska” to jump-start the lingering criminal investigation of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. As the IG report noted,

in addition to Ohr’s interactions with the FBI and Steele in connection with the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, Ohr also participated in discussions about a separate money laundering investigation of Paul Manafort that was then being led by prosecutors from the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), which is located in the Criminal Division at the Department’s headquarters. That criminal investigation was opened by the FBI’s Criminal Investigation Division in January 2016, approximately 2 months before Manafort joined the Trump campaign as an advisor, and concerned allegations that Manafort had engaged in money laundering and tax evasion while acting as a political consultant to members of the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian politicians.

Now the kicker: “Shortly after the 2016 elections, Ohr participated in several meetings with three senior attorneys from the Department’s Criminal Division during which they discussed ways to move the Manafort investigation forward more quickly.” The IG report then notes that “between November 16, 2016 and December 15, 2016, Ohr participated in several meetings that were attended, at various times, by some or all of the following individuals: [Bruce] Swartz, [Zainab Ahmad], Andrew Weissmann (then Section Chief of CRM’s Fraud Section), [Peter] Strzok, and Lisa Page.”

Further, according to the IG report, the meetings involving Ohr, Swartz, Ahmad, and Weissmann focused on their shared concern that MLARS was not moving quickly enough on the Manafort criminal investigation and whether they could move the investigation forward. Additionally, both Ohr and Swartz told the IG “they felt an urgency to move the Manafort investigation forward because of Trump’s election and a concern that the new administration would shut the investigation down.”

Remember, Weissmann Ran the Special Counsel

During one December 2016 meeting—the date of which was not specified—Ohr, Swartz, Ahmad, and Weissmann “discussed a plan for the Department to approach [a] foreign national,” who was currently under indictment and who “Ohr, Swartz, Ahmad, and Weissmann came to believe had information relating to Manafort’s alleged criminal conduct.” The plan discussed called for them to “seek his cooperation against Manafort.”

Significantly, none of these individuals had any role in the Manafort investigation and no one from MLARS attended their strategic sessions. Further, Ohr’s boss stated that “it was ‘unbelievable’ that Ohr was involved in these meetings because as OCDETF Director it was not his job to involve himself in the Manafort investigation.” But that begs the question of whether Ohr tried to use his position as OCDETF director to affect the Manafort investigation.

This raises serious questions concerning whether Ohr and his compatriots discussed Ohr leveraging his position to push for a deal for Deripaska, with the end goal of getting Manafort and then Trump.

While the IG report notes the foursome discussed seeking the cooperation of an indicted foreign national in the investigation against Manafort, no mention is made of any discussion concerning using Deripaska to bring down Manafort. That omission seems strange given that, during Ohr’s first meeting with Swartz and Ahmad on November 16, 2016, he advised them of information “about [Paul] Manafort and Trump and possible Russian influence that [Ohr] was getting from Steele and Glenn Simpson.”

We also know from the IG report that “on September 23, 2016, at Steele’s request, Steele met with Ohr in Washington, D.C.,” and at that meeting Steele conveyed “information regarding Russian Oligarch 1’s willingness to talk with the U.S. government about Manafort.”

We also know from the IG report that Ohr’s telephone log shows Ohr called Simpson on December 8—the day after the interagency meeting in which “working with Deripaska” was discussed. While Ohr “could not recall why he contacted Simpson, Ohr said that he met with Simpson on December 10, 2016, and that Simpson gave him a thumb drive” at that time.

Adding this chronology to the facts the IG report reveals about Ohr’s December 7, 2016, interagency meeting raises serious questions concerning whether Ohr and his compatriots discussed Ohr leveraging his position as the director of OCDETF to push for a deal for Deripaska, with the end goal of getting Manafort and, in turn, so they thought, Trump.

While it is too late for Horowitz to consider these questions, the same cannot be said for U.S. Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham.

27 Problems With Media's Latest Failed Attack On AG William Barr,"Some days it seems as if Attorney General William Barr is one of very few adults in Washington, D.C. The highly respected attorney is serving his second tour at the head of the Department of Justice. The first was during the George H.W. Bush administration. A brilliant legal mind with a candid and no-nonsense attitude, Barr is able to withstand pressure from the media and other members of the Resistance.

Partisan media vehemently oppose Barr, partly for being an effective advocate of President Trump’s policies at the Department of Justice, but mostly for admitting and expressing concern about the Department of Justice’s role in the Russia collusion hoax that undermined the Trump administration.

Nearly the entire political media establishment worked with anonymous sources inside the government and Democratic offices to spread the false conspiracy theory that Trump was a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. This false and dangerous conspiracy theory negatively affected national security and foreign policy, sidelined Barr’s predecessor at the Department of Justice, and generally made it difficult to run the executive branch or secure good political appointees to work in the administration.

As the media did with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who accurately raised the alarm about Russia collusion story, they have put out a series of attacks and hit pieces on Barr and John Durham, the federal prosecutor Barr appointed to investigate the FBI’s spying on the Trump campaign. The playbook is for the media and Democrats to discredit whomever they decide is a threat.

Rep. Adam Schiff, who spent years falsely claiming to hold evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia, called Barr “the second most dangerous man in America.” One Washington Post headline: “John Durham has a stellar reputation for investigating corruption. Some fear his work for Barr could tarnish it.” As in, if Durham’s investigation doesn’t match the false narrative set by the Post and other media outlets, they’ll rewrite the story about his reputation. Nice reputation you have, Durham. Shame if something happened to it.

The fear of Durham’s investigation and Barr’s support for that investigation is legitimate. The media and other Resistance members staked their reputations on the Russia probe, which imploded spectacularly when, despite the daily if not hourly promises of bombshells and “walls closing in,” Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his sprawling investigation were unable to find a single American who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election.

While he doesn’t have the resources Mueller had, Durham doesn’t face the limitations other investigations into the Russia collusion hoax had. Unlike the inspector general, who recently found the FBI committed egregious errors in its efforts to wiretap a Trump campaign affiliate, Durham can obtain information from people outside the Justice Department, including former employees, other agencies, and those outside the government. The probe has found enough to become a criminal investigation.

Latest Hit Piece on Barr Fits This Pattern

The best hope the media and other Resistance figures have is to discredit Nunes, Durham, Barr, and anyone else who threatens to embarrass them. That’s the context for the latest hit piece on Barr, by The New Yorker’s David Rohde. Rohde’s extreme bias against Trump is apparent in this and other writings, such as the one where he fantasized that Barr might be imprisoned for his support of Trump, and would have to recuse himself from the administration of the Justice Department as Democrats push their media-led impeachment effort.

The framework of the article is that a top official in the Trump administration supporting Trump and his policies is somehow nefarious. Among other things unique to the Trump administration is the media’s idea that political appointees should be virulently opposed to the president elected by the American people. Another key theme of Rohde’s is that a cabal of Christians is conspiring to do … bad things in the administration. The article is absolutely riddled with errors and omissions of key facts.

Peter Baker of The New York Times said Rohde’s article was a “smart, richly rendered and compelling profile.” It is, alas, not even close to any of these things.

1. Lies About the Historical Record

For example, in the second paragraph, Rohde writes about a speech Barr recently gave at the University of Notre Dame. Barr asserted that declining religious influence in American life has left the country more vulnerable to government dependency. He also noted that some of the left’s secularists are not particularly tolerant.

For Rohde, the speech was “a catalogue of grievances accumulated since the Reagan era, when Barr first enlisted in the culture wars. It included a series of contentious claims. He argued, for example, that the Founders of the United States saw religion as essential to democracy. ‘In the Framers’ view, free government was only suitable and sustainable for a religious people—a people who recognized that there was a transcendent moral order,’ he said.”

Of course, there is nothing contentious about the claim that the Founders saw religion as essential to maintaining the republic. You can read the full speech here (in so doing, you might note that every word of Rohde’s characterization is wrong or misleading). Barr follows up that line by immediately quoting Founding Father, statesman, attorney, writer, second President and first Vice President of the United States John Adams:

As John Adams put it, ‘We have no government armed with the power which is capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.’

The factual errors, inaccuracies, omissions of context, and poor sourcing are riddled throughout the article. While political differences such as those between Rohde and Barr account for some of the problems, such as whether it’s a good or bad idea to have a religious test for political appointees, Rohde gets major issues wrong, such as War Powers, the Mueller report and its handling, and the FISA abuse investigation.

2. The U.S. Didn’t Invade Kuwait In 1990

But he gets even basic facts wrong, such as his claim that “In August, 1990, Bush invaded Kuwait, with congressional approval.” It was Iraq that invaded Kuwait in August of 1990. The U.S.-led response to that invasion began with an aerial campaign in January 1991 and ground troops expelling those forces from Kuwait in February 1991, followed by a brief incursion into Iraq. The New Yorker has an unwarranted reputation as diligent in fact-checking, but the piece is full of errors that would be easy to check, suggesting the absence of fact checking.

Every paragraph in the nearly 10,000-word article has significant problems. Taken together, it is just one long string of innuendos that Barr is evil. Yet the innuendos are laid down in such a dry, disaffected style it’s as if Rohde and his editors don’t think the reader will notice how they’re leading him to one facile conclusion after another. It’s almost parodic.

Beyond the two errors cited above, here are just some of the other significant problems with Rohde’s emotional screed against Barr.

3. Mischaracterizes Independent Counsels

Rohde argues that Barr’s views on executive power are wrong. He praises President Jimmy Carter for signing legislation allowing independent counsels while denouncing all criticism of these counsels from Republicans or conservative Supreme Court justices.

Rohde writes, “During his [earlier] tenure, Barr turned down multiple requests to name prosecutors to examine potential executive-branch abuses. ‘The public integrity section told me that I had received more requests for independent counsel in eighteen months than all my predecessors combined,’ Barr recalled. ‘It was a joke.'”

Nowhere does Rohde mention that there was broad bipartisan consensus, led by Democrats, against the independent counsel legislation and that it was allowed to lapse as a result. Here’s the top of a 1999 CNN article, for example:

Saying, ‘I don’t think it is fixable,’ Sen. Tom Daschle on Sunday echoed the sentiments of many lawmakers on Capitol Hill toward the Independent Counsel Act. With the statute set to expire on June 30, it is almost certain the law will be allowed to lapse. ‘The time has come for us to close the books and try to find another way within the Justice Department itself to handle these responsibilities,’ the South Dakota Democrat said on ABC’s ‘The Week.’ Even GOP members of Congress agree with the Senate’s minority leader.

4. Ignorance of Actual War Power Debates

Rohde takes snippets of an interesting interview with Barr to suggest that Barr’s views on executive power are crazy. For instance, he inaccurately summarizes a discussion between Barr and President Bush over whether the president has the right to go to war.

While Barr’s explanation is lengthy and specific to the circumstances, Rohde says his view is simply that the president can go to war whenever. Barr further explains his case that even though Bush had the right to fight Iraq and specific congressional approval to put troops near Iraq, that he should explicitly obtain Congress’s support for a counterinvasion.

Here’s how Rohde puts it:

Barr feared that lawmakers would try to block such an action, and so he urged Bush to cover himself by obtaining Congress’s support. Even the other conservatives in the room were startled; Justice Department officials were expected to maintain scrupulous impartiality. According to Barr, Cheney, at that time the Secretary of Defense, reprimanded him: ‘You’re giving him political advice, not legal advice.’ Barr recalled that he said, ‘I’m giving him both political and legal advice. They’re really sort of together when you get to this level.’ In August, 1990, Bush invaded Kuwait, with congressional approval. The following year, he named Barr Attorney General.

The quotes are from Barr’s own telling of events, and he never describes anyone as startled. As described in Judge David Barron’s “Waging War,” power struggles between Congress and the president go back to George Washington. And most successful presidents who have waged war use a combination of their commander in chief authority and congressional approval when serving. It is hard to imagine that seasoned government officials would be startled by discussions of law and politics before entering war.

5. Mischaracterizing Views On Criminal Justice

Rohde is upset that Barr doesn’t think the poor are more immoral than the rich. “In a 1995 symposium on violent crime, he argued that the root cause was not poverty but immorality,” Rohde writes, aghast. It’s unclear precisely what Rohde’s problem with the statement is. He notes that Barr doesn’t believe poverty programs will fix violent crime. But that’s not Barr’s view so much as the simple truth. Many billions of dollars have been spent on poverty programs without the desired effect on violent crime.

Later he writes, “In 1992, rioting erupted in Los Angeles following the acquittal of four police officers who had been videotaped beating the motorist Rodney King. Barr deployed two thousand federal agents on military planes to stop the unrest. He later argued that civil-rights charges should have been brought—not just against the offending officers but also against the rioters on the streets of L.A.”

Again, it’s unclear what his problem is. He leaves out, incidentally, that California Gov. Pete Wilson requested the agents, or that the deputy attorney general was responsible by statute for authorizing their deployment. More than 60 people were killed in the riots and nearly 2,400 were injured. It’s unclear why Rohde doesn’t think those victims matter.

6. Confuses Problem With Mueller’s Political Team and Other People’s Political Action

“In another article, Barr criticized Robert Mueller for hiring prosecutors who had donated to Democratic politicians—but did not disclose his own donations to Republicans,” Rohde writes, apparently confused about the difference between needing a politically balanced team to handle the most politically sensitive investigation in the Justice Department’s history, and being a Republican appointee and political donor.

7. Bizarre Characterization of Barr’s Memo About Obstruction of Justice

Here’s Rohde’s characterization of Barr’s memo to the Justice Department arguing against redefining obstruction of justice to include lawful actions taken by the president.

Barr has said that he wasn’t interested in the position of Attorney General. But in June, 2018, he sent an unsolicited, nineteen-page legal memo to Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, who was overseeing the Mueller investigation. He spent much of the letter elaborating an argument that a President’s Article II powers rendered him essentially incapable of obstructing justice. He acknowledged that such blatant acts as destroying evidence and encouraging perjury were impermissible. But, he wrote, ‘Mueller’s core premise—that the President acts ‘corruptly’ if he attempts to influence a proceeding in which his own conduct is being scrutinized—is untenable.’ Benjamin Wittes and Mikhaila Fogel, of the blog Lawfare, described the memo as ‘bizarre.’ Barr, without firsthand knowledge of the facts in the case, had devised a legal theory of obstruction, attributed it to Mueller, and then declared it ‘fatally misconceived.’

Rohde provides no evidence for his insinuation that Barr was seeking to be made attorney general. As for the memo, it was completely vindicated by the eventual attempt of Mueller to, well, redefine lawful actions taken by the president as obstruction of justice. The idea that Benjamin Wittes — given the nickname Dr. Tick Tock Von Boom Boom for his use of a cannon to suggest the Mueller investigation was tick-tick-ticking to an explosive outcome — as a good arbiter of what’s bizarre is itself bizarre.

8. Speaking Of Rohde’s Sources

Rohde clearly did not have access to Barr or most people close to him. There is maybe one person quoted who is not a member of the Resistance. Instead, Rohde goes to implicated parties in the Russia collusion hoax, such as Wittes, James Baker, and David Laufman. Laufman wasn’t just implicated in the Russia story, he was also a figure in the smearing of Brett Kavanaugh. As one former Justice official asked, “Was Rohde even trying?”

The most telling choice for a source was Don Ayer, a former Bush DOJ official Rohde used extensively. Ayer has attacked Barr on NeverTrump podcasts and is the media’s go-to source for negative quotes about his former colleague.

It probably should have been mentioned that Ayer had a disastrous and brief tenure as the deputy attorney general before being replaced by Barr in 1990. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh scrambled to find a deputy after his pick failed to make it through Senate confirmation. An aide suggested Ayer, who made it through, but quickly proved to be a bad match. He only made it a few months before being canned.

On his way out, Ayer trashed his boss and his career never took off. There are reports he felt resentful of Barr going back to 1990. Ayer ended up handling pro bono cases for Jones Day. It’s fine to use activists, implicated parties, or people with personal grudges as sources, of course, but Rohde should have disclosed all of these things.

9. Weird Description of Confirmation Hearing

Rohde suggests that Democratic senators should have given Barr a religious test for confirmation. “Ignoring the advice of some aides, Democrats did not dwell on Barr’s statements regarding criminal justice, or on whether his religious beliefs might affect his views.” Barr is Roman Catholic, which Rohde paints as a sick and demented belief system that should perhaps be barred from public service. That bigotry is woven throughout the article and thoroughly debunked here.

Rohde goes on to suggest that Barr should have seen his role as confrontational to Trump, deferential to Mueller, and supportive of the Russia hoax. “He testified that he believed that Mueller, a longtime associate whom he described as a “good friend,” should be allowed to complete his investigation. But he also signalled skepticism about the idea that Trump had colluded with Russia, and repeatedly expressed support for the President’s policies.”

Left unsaid is that Trump had not colluded with Russia and such skepticism was warranted. Or that neither Trump nor Barr nor anyone else interfered with the Mueller probe in any way.

10. Revisionist History on Kavanaugh

In Rohde’s telling, President Trump is such an obstructionist, that he was hostile to Congress’s request for information on Kavanaugh.

When past Presidents resisted sending materials to Congress by claiming ‘executive privilege,’ Justice Department lawyers tried to help resolve the disputes. Under Trump, that practice has stopped, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told me. As Brett Kavanaugh was going through confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court, Congress requested documents describing his work in the George W. Bush Administration. The White House refused access to more than a hundred thousand pages of them. Blank sheets of paper arrived on Capitol Hill stamped ‘Constitutional privilege,’ a category that members of Congress said they had never heard of before.

Rohde does not mention that senators could review Kavanaugh’s 307 opinions and hundreds of other opinions he joined, totaling more than 10,000 pages of the actual writing that matters. Or that Kavanaugh submitted more than 17,000 pages of speeches and articles, along with a 120-page written response to the Senate, more than any other nominee ever had. Or that senators were given nearly half a million pages of documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the executive branch.

Read more — and stuff that’s way more exciting than paperwork battles — in the best-selling book I co-authored with Carrie Severino, “Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.”

11. False Claims About Barr’s Summary of Mueller

“When the special counsel Robert Mueller released the findings of his inquiry into connections between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, Barr presented a sanitized four-page summary before the report was made public, which the President used to declare himself cleared,” Rohde writes. In fact, Barr’s summary explicitly quoted Mueller’s view that while the report “does not conclude the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

12. Falsely Claims Trump Demanded Barr Launch Investigation

“At the behest of the President, Barr launched an investigation of the F.B.I.’s Trump-Russia probe and the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia intervened on Trump’s behalf in the election,” Rohde writes, without any evidence. In fact, Barr testified as to why he was launching an investigation and it was not because Trump demanded it.

13. Oddly Suggests Barr Should Have Used a Commission to Investigate

“Rather than seek a nonpartisan commission, Barr appointed a federal prosecutor, reinforcing the President’s claims of a ‘coup,'” Rohde writes. It is unclear why Rohde thinks that a federal prosecutor would reinforce this claim, but former Justice officals laughed at the idea that a commision, rather than a federal prosecutor, would be a good idea. Durham was previously appointed by other attorney generals to serve in a similar role of investigating the agency and Rohde doesn’t mention it, much less oppose those previous instances.

14. Suggests It’s Weird to Want FBI Investigated for Its Malfeasance

The entire tenor of the piece is that Barr is weird to want to get to the bottom of malfeasance in the surveillance of a presidential campaign.

“A government official, who asked not to be named, told me that, while Barr does not believe that the ‘deep state’ is plotting to force Trump from power, he is convinced that there was something nefarious in the F.B.I.’s conduct of its investigation,” Rohde writes, apparently completely unaware that the IG definitively found not just “something nefarious” in the FBI’s conduct but many things that were “nefarious.” For example, an FBI agent doctored evidence to make information helpful to a surveillance target appear to be damaging to him — all for the purpose of convincing a court to let the FBI spy on the individual.

15. Falsely claims IG Found No Evidence of Political Bias

“When an exhaustive review by the Justice Department’s inspector general found no evidence of political bias in the F.B.I. investigation,” Rohde writes. That is absolutely false. In fact, Horowitz catalogued hundreds of pages of political bias and anyone with brain waves can read for themselves what that political bias was.

He explicitly said “we did not reach that conclusion,” when asked if he found no bias. He had said that his team “did not find documentary or testimonial evidence” of political bias in the opening of the investigation — and even that statement was disputed by others. Beyond that, however, the political bias was extensive. Rohde later falsely claims that an investigation into Peter Strzok, known for his extreme political bias, found no evidence of political bias.

16. Claims Without Evidence that Barr Misrepresented IG

“Barr issued a statement misrepresenting its findings and arguing that the evidence in the Russia probe was ‘consistently exculpatory’—leaving out the fact that five people connected to Trump’s campaign have been indicted for lying to investigators,” Rohde writes.

It is unclear what Rohde believes about the misrepresentation, because he does not substantiate the claim in any way, shape, or form. Here’s Barr’s statement.

Further, Rohde doesn’t note that none of the five people connected to Trump campaign were accused of being Russian agents who treasonously colluded with that country to steal the 2016 election. That was the central claim of those who advanced the false and dangerous Russia collusion theory, not that such campaign affiliates couldn’t be rung up on process crimes.

17. Doesn’t Know That Evidence on Russia Was Exculpatory

As for the above line about the evidence in the Russia probe being consistently exculpatory, if it wasn’t consistently exculpatory, perhaps Mueller would have found a single American — much less a single American tied to the Trump campaign, much less Trump himself — who had colluded with Russia, as Americans had been told by the media and other Resistance figures. If Rohde disputes the Mueller report’s findings or the exculpatory evidence, it’s unclear where he does.

18. Numerous False Claims Regarding Horowitz Report

Without substantiation, Rohde asserts that the main prediction from critics of the Russia collusion hoax was that the report would find political bias. It is unclear where he developed this belief. Then while he admits that the report found “misconduct,” it was mostly in the “applications to the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court.”

It appears that Rohde doesn’t realize FISA applications were the only thing Horowitz was looking into. He also bizarrely asserts that the report “concluded that Trump’s allegations of an F.B.I. ‘coup’ were false.” A simple word search of the 400+ page document finds no instance of any discussion of a coup, much less a conclusion regarding the claim.

19. Describes Brennan as a Mild Critic of Trump

In a section suggesting that Trump is a tyrant, the Rohdes article describes former CIA Chief John Brennan as someone “who has criticized” Trump. That is certainly one way to describe his unhinged tweets and media appearances accusing Trump of treason.

20. No, Trump Did Not Starve 33,000 FBI employees

“Last winter, during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the Bureau’s thirteen thousand agents and twenty thousand support staffers struggled to pay their bills. After employees walked into supervisors’ offices in tears, agents set up impromptu food banks to help colleagues,” Rohde writes, blaming Trump. The month-long shutdown may have been difficult for some FBI employees, but it’s unlikely that all 33,000 suffered, much less struggled to pay bills. A bit more sobriety in discussing topics is in order.

21. Heavy-handed KGB References

The comic book art that accompanies the article is joined with a headline about Barr being Trump’s “sword and shield.” That’s a none-too-subtle reference to the Soviet Union’s KGB, which is known as the sword and shield on account of its insignia. What doesn’t work about the reference, in addition to the feeling that Rohde might be a Russia truther, is that Barr is looking to restore credibility to an agency that spied on its political opponents, leaked against its political opponents, excused behavior from its political allies, and rang up its political opponents on petty process crimes.

22. Unaware That FBI Investigation Was Launched On Thinnest of Suspicions

Rohde writes that, “Despite the core finding that the investigation was initiated properly, Barr argued that the report ‘makes clear that the F.B.I. launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions.'” One wonders if Rohde has even passing familiarity with the report, which found that while the FBI launched the investigation not just on hearsay but on hearsay that much of the world was saying.

That is, the claim was that the FBI had to do an intensive investigation because someone heard someone say that Russia might have access to Hillary Clinton’s emails since she had not secured them properly. Much of the world was saying this, and one hopes that it didn’t launch investigations into all those people. From that hearsay, overseas intelligence assets, confidential human sources, email wiretaps, phone wiretaps, and other surveillance was launched.

23. False Claims About Mueller’s Executive Summaries

“Mueller had prepared an introduction and executive summaries, and he urged Barr to release them,” Rohde writes. That’s not true. Not only did Mueller not make that request, Barr asked Mueller for a report he could quickly disseminate, meaning a report that wouldn’t have classified information. Instead, Mueller’s team submitted a report filled with classified information, delaying any release of it to the public.

24. False Claims About Barr Holding Onto Mueller Report

“When Barr finally released the report, in April, he held a press conference before journalists had access to it, which prevented them from asking detailed questions about its contents,” Rohde writes. In fact, Barr was under no obligation to release the report, which the law only required to be submitted to him for his use. Even though he didn’t have to release any information, he did so and did so quickly because he thought the issue was significant enough for the public to learn about.

25. False Claims About Durham Investigation

“Barr and Durham made trips to the U.K., Italy, and Australia, where they asked officials for evidence of misconduct by the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.,” Rohde writes. In fact, no trip to Australia was made, although that country did reach out to the Department of Justice to offer help.

26. Paints Barr’s Father as Radical for Believing in Rules

“His father, Donald, was the headmaster at Dalton, a progressive private school on the Upper East Side. During the Second World War, Donald had served in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the C.I.A. As headmaster, he believed that discipline instilled morality, helping to fend off the ‘social pathology’ that his son warned about decades later,” Rohde writes, later describing him as “obsessed with adherence to rules.”

It’s a telling line from The New Yorker. The whole notion of a society that lives by order through law is based on rules and consequences. There is nothing radical or even particularly noteworthy about it.

27. Quotes Justice Department Official Saying Oversight Is Totalitarian

The quote from Laufman, the attorney with ties both to the Russia collusion hoax and the Kavanaugh smear operation, is particularly problematic.

“‘We’re into Crazy Town,’ Laufman told me. The investigation, he said, was ‘evocative of regimes in history that conduct purges for perceived disloyalty,'” Rohde writes.

What an absurd comment to make. There have been no findings from Durham, but there have been from congressional and inspector general investigations, both of which found malfeasance. There have been criminal referrals for misconduct and personnel actions taken against some of the bad actors. The idea that full accountability can come without a proper investigation is ridiculous.

If the FBI and Department of Justice, much less the other involved agencies, are to have their reputations restored, it will be because men like Barr and Durham were brave enough to take on the implicated parties and their echo chambers and find the truth. One gets the sense they knew the media campaign against them would be waged and one hopes they have the courage to withstand the bullying.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/15/27-problems-with-medias-latest-failed-attack-on-attorney-general-william-barr/,2020-01-15
The Problem With American Criminals Isn’t Trump’s Celebrity Pardons,"After President Trump’s Super Bowl ad featuring former cocaine trafficker Alice Johnson celebrating her commuted sentence, The Washington Post criticized Trump’s pardoning as too celebrity-influenced and stingy.

“[A]ll but five of the 24 people who have received clemency from Trump had a line into the White House or currency with his political base, according to a review by The Washington Post,” the Post article says. “As the administration takes its cues from celebrities, political allies and Fox News, thousands of other offenders who followed Department of Justice rules are waiting, passed over as cases that were brought directly to Trump leaped to the front of line.”

The article implies Trump is unique in this, when it is far more about the oligarchic nature of big government than it is about Trump. There are simply too many requests for clemency for it to be otherwise.

According to the latest U.S. Department of Justice data, there are 12,892 requests for pardon or clemency (reduction of sentence) pending before President Trump. That is 35 per day for an entire year. Even an extremely hardworking, intelligent, fair, and subject-matter-knowledgeable person could not possibly decide justly on 35 applications for clemency every single day for an entire year. That would require reviewing possibly massive casefiles for each applicant, and dispatching one every 40 minutes — if the decisionmaker never slept.

So it is humanly impossible for Trump to make these decisions, even if he had no other duties as president. Although of course he has staff to do vetting for him, he’s still responsible for his decisions and should take some time and thought making them. That’s why getting his attention requires celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Would the Post or anyone else truly prefer that instead the advocates for convicts did their lobbying in secret, instead of on Twitter?

No, The Data Doesn’t Show Trump Is Stingy with Pardons

The Post article also confusingly compares Trump to former presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan across different categories of data, so that in the Post article Trump looks less likely to grant clemency. But that’s actually not true so far.

If you add the same columns of U.S. Department of Justice data for both presidents, you’ll see that Trump has granted more pardons and commutations than Obama did in each man’s first three years as president. From 2017 to 2019, Trump granted 21 petitions for pardon and clemency. From 2009 to 2011, the comparable time period for Obama, Obama granted 17 pardons and no clemency. (Neither president granted any remissions, the “R” column on the chart, in those years.) The comparable number for George W. Bush is seven, and for Bill Clinton 56.

As for denials, Trump’s administration made 180 in its first three years; Obama’s made a whopping 3,976, Bush’s made 2,856, and Clinton made 994. Compared to the pending cases of each presidency at the same point, this does indicate a large backlog at Trump’s justice. This may suggest they need to hire more people, or that the Trump administration has other priorities. But it doesn’t without other evidence indicate that Trump is less lenient than other presidents, or his approval process more political.

The Real Action Is in Legislative ‘Reforms’

Because they apply to everyone, not just the few lucky enough to be noticed by Kim Kardashian, the real action is not in presidential pardons. It’s in “criminal justice reform” laws such as the First Step Act and more radical versions such as that recently passed in New York. In his State of the Union Tuesday night, Trump touted First Step as “landmark criminal justice reform.” Such penal code revisions are a response to what the American Civil Liberties Union calls a “mass incarceration crisis.”

But I’m skeptical that we really have such a crisis — or, to put it more precisely, that the reason most Americans are in prison and jail is the law’s fault rather than their own and their communities’. And the examples being touted by the “criminal justice reform” crowd make me trust them less rather than more.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP0pOeERO_Y

Johnson, for example, is constantly labeled a “nonviolent drug offender” who was inexplicably given a life sentence. That’s just plain propaganda. As Georgi Boorman writes, “Over a period of four years, Johnson helped manage regional operations of the Cali mafia’s drug business (based in Colombia).” Local news reports at the time of her conviction say Johnson “le[d] a multimillion-dollar drug ring that dealt in tons of cocaine.”

I don’t necessarily believe life in prison is a punishment equal to this crime. But I also didn’t sit on Johnson’s jury, and have very limited knowledge about her case. Serious punishment seems warranted based on what we do know. Learning more facts about the record of this “nonviolent drug offender” who has been made a totem for “criminal justice reform” makes me trust other pity pleas even less.

The Post article, for example, gives the example of Nichole Forde, whom it also claims “has served about nine years of a 27-year sentence for nonviolent drug crimes.” At this point, I wouldn’t believe she’s really a “nonviolent offender” without reviewing her court documents.

That’s especially because anyone with any legal experience knows that frequently the crime listed on a person’s conviction is much lesser than the ones he committed. They’re routinely bargained down to cut court time and costs. So while someone’s record might say she’s a “nonviolent offender,” that might very easily not at all be true, and the media and politicians obviously don’t have a trustworthy track record of honesty on this or any other issue.

Weekend Tokers Aren’t Driving U.S. Incarceration

It’s not just Johnson. The entire underlying narrative that “U.S. overincarceration” is substantially due to “nonviolent” drug war offenses like hers is false. As Rafael Mangual wrote in City Journal last summer:

Yes, about half of federal prisoners are in on drug charges; but federal inmates constitute only 12 percent of all American prisoners—the vast majority are in state facilities. Those incarcerated primarily for drug offenses constitute less than 15 percent of state prisoners. Four times as many state inmates are behind bars for one of five very serious crimes: murder (14.2 percent), rape or sexual assault (12.8 percent), robbery (13.1 percent), aggravated or simple assault (10.5 percent), and burglary (9.4 percent). The terms served for state prisoners incarcerated primarily on drug charges typically aren’t that long, either. One in five state drug offenders serves less than six months in prison, and nearly half (45 percent) of drug offenders serve less than one year.

The majority of American prisoners have been convicted of robbery or violent crimes like murder, physical assault, and rape. Many of them have gotten “second chances” already, and many used those second chances to do even worse things. (Read Mangual’s article for the evidence.)

“Because so few American prisoners are serving time for trivial infractions, aligning America’s incarceration numbers with those of, say, England or Germany would require releasing many very serious and frequently violent offenders,” Mangual says. “Yet many in the decarceration camp have been calling for just such a mass release.”

Like most Americans, I don’t think a dude smoking weed in his basement should be attacked by SWAT teams or jailed. All people deserve justice, and sometimes that will include reducing an unjustly strict sentence. But that also is not the typical story of the vast majority of incarcerated people.

Like it or not, we lock up lots of people mostly because lots of Americans are deranged and violent. There are lots of reasons for this that deserve attention, money, and action. One would be reviving humane institutions that aren’t prisons or homelessness for the mentally ill. Another would be doing everything possible to reduce broken families, since father loss is strongly correlated with crime. Another would be not normalizing or easing access to non-pharmaceutical drugs.

But simply letting people out of prison without addressing the reasons they put themselves there, plus letting our border remain controlled by drug cartels while states legalize the use of their wares, will lead to another crime wave like the one Americans freaked out over in the 1980s. In some cities, it’s already happening.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/05/the-problem-with-american-criminals-isnt-trumps-celebrity-pardons/,2020-02-05
Bloomberg Defending Stop-And-Frisk: 'Throw Them Up Against The Wall',"An unearthed recording from a 2015 Aspen Institute event reveals former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg defending the city’s stop-and-frisk policy by justifying police disproportionately stationed in minority neighborhoods “because that’s where all the crime is.”

“Ninety-five percent of your murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one M.O.” Bloomberg said in audio released by podcaster Benjamin Dixon. “You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25.”

Bloomberg continued.

That’s true in New York, that’s true in virtually every city (inaudible). And, that’s where the real crime is. You’ve got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed. You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets. Put those cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods. So one of the unintended consequences is people say, ‘Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.’ Yes, that’s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. And the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them.

Since making his late entrance into the Democratic presidential primary last fall, Bloomberg has apologized for championing the city’s aggressive “stop-and-frisk” policing for a decade that a federal judge ruled in 2013 as racial harassment.

As The Federalist’s New York Correspondent David Marcus points out however, the revolutionary method of policing more accurately described as “Stop, Question, and Frisk” dramatically reduced crime in the city. Thus Bloomberg’s apology is little more than a sop to African-American voters, who are a key voting bloc essential to securing the Democratic nomination.

Bloomberg, who has a Forbes estimated net worth of $61.5 billion, has spent more than $300 million on his campaign and is polling fourth in nationwide polls, according to RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate. of surveys.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/11/audio-reveals-bloomberg-defending-stop-and-frisk-throw-them-up-against-the-wall/,2020-02-11
"Mike Bloomberg Is Not A Racist, And Neither Is Trump","Earlier this week new video and audio surfaced of presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg defending police practices under his administration as mayor of New York City. In the clips, a blunt Bloomberg explained that he sent more police to minority, mostly black and Latino, neighborhoods because that’s where most of the violent crime was. He further said the controversial practice called “Stop, Question, and Frisk” (SQF) was needed to get illegal guns off the streets of Gotham.

Almost immediately, Twitter lit up with the hashtag #BloombergIsRacist. Leftists, who can find racism in a glass of milk, were giddy with disdain. Even though Bloomberg had wrongheadedly apologized for SQF, his use of the term “throw them against a wall” to describe frisking got him back in the hot water of identity politics.

There are some legitimate civil liberties concerns about SQF, although living in a city the size of New York comes with some loss of personal freedoms. But the application of SQF was not motivated by race, it was motivated by policing where the crime is. It’s was what Thomas Sowell called disparity rather than discrimination.

Conservatives also jumped on the bandwagon. Even the president tweeted (but then deleted) the allegation that Bloomberg is a racist. But here’s the thing. Mike Bloomberg is not a racist. The allegation, much like similar ones levied at Trump, only make sense if you apply the left’s perverse logic in which everything is racist. For conservatives, this is not so much an opportunity to hurt Bloomberg, but to defend Trump.

There are a few reasons conservatives might want to pour gasoline on the Bloomberg race fire, but before getting into them, try a virtual experiment. If you told most conservatives that a generic big city mayor had drastically reduced crime by applying aggressive police tactics that disproportionately affected black and Latino neighborhoods where the most crime was committed, few if any would call that mayor racist. The only reason some are doing so now is that Bloomberg is running for president.

There are electoral reasons conservatives might want to help paint Bloomberg as racist, even if they don’t really believe it. They may view him as the biggest threat to Trump, or they may just want to ding as many Democrats as possible to create infighting and a fractured resistance to the president. But this is political roulette. Remember how desperate Democrats were for the easily beatable Trump to be the GOP nominee in 2016? Be careful what you wish for.

But the more common reason that conservatives are embracing the claim about Bloomberg is a kind of ideological whataboutism. “They made the rules” is a common refrain, suggesting that if the left wants to call everyone racist then a candidate hoping to fly their banner must be hoisted by his own petard. This is almost certainly what Trump was engaged in with his tweet. There is little to no chance that he honestly thinks Bloomberg, whom he has praised in the past as a good mayor, is a racist.

This trolly approach with its healthy dose of schadenfreude is understandable, but it’s also wrong. The larger opportunity here is to use this incident to expose how irrational leftist definitions of racism are. For them, racism is not about any outward, or even hidden, animosity towards any group, which is the literal definition of racism. It’s rather about refusing to condemn systems that they claim are oppressive and thus refusing to support left-wing proposals they claim will fix the situation.

That is the “racism” that Mike Bloomberg is accused of and the exact same “racism” Trump is widely charged with, including by Democratic presidential candidates, and it’s a big load of garbage. The double standard is real. Democrat Ralph “Blackface” Northam is still governor of Virginia, after all. But rather than using Saul Alinsky tactics against Bloomberg, conservatives should use this opportunity to drag the leftist view of racism and in so doing defend President Trump.

This also makes political sense. Trump himself, as recently as 2015, vociferously defended SQF and even suggested it be used across the country. That will come back to haunt him if he now says it was racist. Far better it would be to point at this situation and say, “You see, this is exactly what they do to me, smear me with politically driven, nonsensical allegations of racism.” It’s a powerful argument.

Some believe Trump’s victory in 2016 had little to do with ideas and much to do with stirring the pot and being a fighter. The latter played a role, but so did the former. Most Americans reject the identity politics of the left. This ridiculous claim that Bloomberg is a racist is a perfect opportunity to show them that conservatives agree.

Pete Buttigieg Said The Same Things Bloomberg Did About Crime,"On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Democrat presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg took a hit when audio surfaced of him celebrating his police department’s targeting of minority neighborhoods. The media pounced, quickly forcing the former New York City mayor to apologize for his dated comments. Yet, for all the outrage, the press ignored the nearly identical sentiments South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg voiced mere days earlier, during the New Hampshire Democrat debate.

“Ninety-five percent of your murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops,” Bloomberg said during a 2015 appearance at an Aspen Institute event. Bloomberg then sketched their profile: “They are male minorities, 16 to 25,” before adding:

That’s true in New York. That’s true in virtually every city. And that’s where the real crime is. You’ve got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed. Put those cops where the crime is, which means minority neighborhoods. So one of the unintended consequences is people say, ‘Oh my G-d, you are arresting kids for marijuana. They’re all minorities.” That’s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that’s true. Why do you do it? Because it’s where all the crime is.

In November, just before declaring he would run for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy police executed under his leadership. “Addressing a black church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg said the practice often led to the disproportionate detaining of blacks and Latinos,” adding he couldn’t “change history,” but now I realize, “I was wrong.”

While Bloomberg’s comments came nearly five years ago, and he has since apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy he ineptly described while speaking before the nonprofit Aspen Institute, the same cannot be said of Buttigieg’s Friday night comments, which came during the most recent Democratic debate.

Moderator Linsey Davis challenged Buttigieg on his record, noting that “under your leadership as mayor, a black resident in South Bend, Indiana was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident. Now, that racial disparity is higher than the rest of the state, in fact, it’s higher than the rest of the nation, and that disparity increased in South Bend after you took office.”

Davis then asked the young former mayor how he explained “that increase in black arrests under [his] leadership.”

Buttigieg responded with misdirection—twice—by highlighting an unrelated statistic: “The reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana.”

Buttigieg’s deflection didn’t defeat Davis, however, with the moderator correcting the candidate, “No, there was an increase. The year before you were in office, it was lower. Once you came in office in 2012, that number went up. In 2018, the last number year that we have record for, that number was still up.”

Then Buttigieg channeled Bloomberg’s comments from years earlier, stating that “one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target—when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence, which was slaughtering so many in our community, burying teenagers, disproportionately black teenagers, we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder. There things are all connected.”

Buttigieg’s comments went mainly unnoticed before the New Hampshire voting, allowing the young mayor to ride to a second-place victory, just behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But with attention turning the Nevada and South Carolina contests—states with “significant minority populations” compared to the Iowa and New Hampshire electorates—Buttigieg’s blunder may sound the demise of his candidacy, which already lacks the support of African-Americans, a crucial demographic for Democrat candidates.

Things will only get worse for the former midwestern mayor, with the dwindling field of candidates providing more opportunities for tough questions. And the natural follow-up to last week’s debate query about black marijuana arrest rates concerns Buttigieg’s firing of South Bend’s first American-American police chief, Daryl Boykins. The national media has yet to explore that local scandal, which threatens to blow up the former mayor’s shot at the White House.

Whether the national media bites is anyone’s guess. A good tell will be whether the media pushes Buttigieg on his Bloombergesque justification for a four-fold disparity in arrests of black pot possessors on his watch.

"As Bloomberg Rises In Profile, So Do Stories Of His Incompetence","Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is set to face the first big test of his candidacy Wednesday night on stage with his Democratic rivals at the Las Vegas Paris Theatre for the next primetime debate.

Until this moment, Bloomberg has avoided the scrutiny that comes with mounting a competitive presidential bid by circumventing the first four primary states and pivoting resources to the nationwide contests held on March 3 dubbed “Super Tuesday.”

While the candidates sparred through Iowa and New Hampshire, Bloomberg spent millions running a massive operation to build up his name and reputation in states across the country in preparation for an upset after making a late entrance in November. Now, with less than two weeks to go until 16 states hold their Democratic nominating contests, Bloomberg will be challenged live before a primetime national audience while polling in third place in RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate of national surveys. Candidates are eager to turn their knives on the New York billionaire as a series of unearthed revelations begin to bombard the businessman’s blitzkrieg to the nomination.

Stop And Frisk

Bloomberg has come under fire in recent weeks for formerly championing the controversial “Stop and Frisk” policing strategy employed under his tenure as New York mayor. Despite dramatically reducing crime in the city, the tactic was declared racially discriminatory and unconstitutional by a federal judge. Last fall, Bloomberg apologized for promoting the effective method of crime fighting with the knowledge that his former embrace of “Stop and Frisk” would hurt attempts to court minority voters in the Democratic primary.

Earlier this month, an audio recording of Bloomberg’s comments defending the policing policy targeting minority communities will make the businessman’s effort to redefine himself to voters all the more difficult.

“Ninety-five percent of your murders – murderers and murder victims – fit one M.O.” Bloomberg explained to attendees of a 2015 event with the Aspen Institute.

You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That’s true in New York, that’s true in virtually every city (inaudible). And, that’s where the real crime is. You’ve got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed. You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets. Put those cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods. So one of the unintended consequences is people say, ‘Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.’ Yes, that’s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. And the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them.

The comments prompted Bloomberg’s rivals to take aim, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders issuing the sharpest criticism.

“Regardless of how much money a mulit-billionaire candidate is willing to spend on his election, we will not create the energy and excitement we need to defeat Donald Trump if that candidate pursued, advocated for, and enacted racist policies like stop and frisk, which caused communities of color in his city to live in fear,” Sanders said over the weekend in Nevada.

Fellow billionaire Tom Steyer also issued criticism of Bloomberg, calling the former mayor’s past comments “scary” to reporters.

Bloomberg Gets Me Tooed

Past allegations of sexist comments and hostile work environments are also coming back to haunt Bloomberg. Over the weekend, the Washington Post published a lengthy chronicle of Bloomberg’s history in New York of combatting charges of inappropriate behavior towards women.

In 1990 the Post reported, Bloomberg was given a booklet of remarks attributed to him. In one instance, Bloomberg is accused of marveling how the company’s financial information computers “will do everything, including give you [oral sex]. I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.”

Bloomberg also allegedly told one female employee to “kill it” upon learning she was pregnant. In a primary that even saw one candidate try to rise on the back of the Me Too movement, past allegations of workplace sexism are sure to be an issue to Bloomberg as he continues to navigate through the process.

Bloomberg Knows Nothing About 21st Century Farming

In a willful display of arrogant ignorance, Bloomberg played right into the characterization as an out of touch New York elite who knows very little about the people living America’s heartland.

More embarrassing comments of Bloomberg’s past at a university forum were unveiled over the weekend where Bloomberg cast farmers as individuals in the workforce who are unable to adapt to the 21st-century information economy.

“The agrarian society lasted 3,000 years and we could teach processes. I could teach anybody, even people in this room, no offense intended, to be a farmer,” Bloomberg told students at the University of Oxford in 2016. “It’s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then we had 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. At one point, 98 percent of the world worked in agriculture, now it’s 2 percent in the United States.”

Bloomberg on why farmers can’t work in information technology MB: “I can teach anyone how to be a farmer 1 dig a hole 2 put a seed in 3 put dirt on top 4 add water 5 up comes the corn” The skill 4information technology is completely different you need more grey matter#farmers pic.twitter.com/HM13tA6goz — Pete (@NYBackpacker) February 15, 2020

Of course, farming in the modern era has become one of the most sophisticated industries in the 21st century as farmers and scientists continue to develop better ways to grow enough food to feed the world.

Soybean farmer Sid Rodgers told Fox News that farming in the digital age has pushed those harvesting the nation’s crops to be more innovative than ever.

“Listen, farmers have been innovative people all their life,” Rogers said. “They have to be well-versed in multiple occupations from welding and fabricating to electrical, plumbing, being a vet… we have to be masters of GPS, soil science, weather, marketing – in order to stay alive.”

Fourth-generation farmer Mary Blackmon explained to Fox that farming requires “a very well-informed, detailed strategy on every single aspect from financing your seed selection to your planting to what tractors and machinery you are going to use.”

Farming is hardly just sticking a seed into the ground and hoping something worth selling grows.

It’s Just The Beginning

The recent slew of damaging details from Bloomberg’s past have only just begun, and have likely just scratched the surface of the 78-year-old businessman’s long history as a business tycoon and politician in New York City. As the primary progresses and Bloomberg’s billions threaten to peel off delegates from the other candidates, Bloomberg will face tougher obstacles moving into the subsequent stages of the Democratic contest.

"In Minnesota, People Who Sexually Abuse Children Are Usually Given Just Probation","The good people of America were rightly furious when news emerged last month that an Iowa man convicted of molesting more than a dozen children — ranging in ages from one to 13 — would be released because he was undergoing transgender hormone therapy. Americans would be even shocked to know that the leniency shown to the Iowa predator is not an exception. It’s more like the rule.

That’s because this country often treats child predation like an illness. Yes, these predators are “sick,” and many suffered abuse as children. But treating the problem like a disease has put too much focus on rehabilitating criminals and too little focus on keeping children safe.

Consider that a man who rapes an adult woman is sick also. Yet just imagine the uproar if such a criminal were sent to expensive rehabilitation, serving only a few months in jail. All sorts of activist groups would cry foul, and the story would get national media attention, which would shame the judge and prosecutor.

Nobody argues an offender against an adult needs “rehabilitation.” They correctly argue for the offender to be thrown in jail, and for the jail key to be sunk to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Not so for cases involving children. They have no voice, few lobbyists, and little state-level data to document crimes against them. Where data is available, it shows America is failing children.

States Aren’t Tough on Child Predators

In 2016, the National Association to Protect Children (PROTECT) spent tens of thousands of dollars compiling sentencing data from 2007 to 2016 for one state, Minnesota. PROTECT’s sentencing data for crimes against children are separated into three buckets: criminal sexual conduct (rape), child sexual abuse imagery, and trafficking.

Right off the bat, the reader should notice that trafficking is not the entire threat. Here, the national conversation has so far missed the point. The media gives a lot of attention to sex trafficking, especially of minors. Sex trafficking is a huge problem, and more government resources focused on stopping it is a wonderful thing. But too little attention is being paid to the child-predator threat overall.

For criminal sexual conduct involving a child under the age of 13, data shows that in most Minnesota counties, offenders are being given a stay (probation) and no prison time 50 to 60 percent of the time. Some of these offenders are even receiving a stay of imposition, reducing the crime to a misdemeanor, and not required to register as sex offenders. Far too often, the offender is even placed back in the home with the children he victimized.

Even when prison is the outcome in the 40 to 50 percent of these cases, the sentences are often too short. In response, prosecutors claim some cases are hard to prosecute and that it’s sometimes hard to get a young child to take the stand. This is sometimes true. But prosecutor John Choi in Ramsey County has a starkly better record than other prosecutors in populous Minnesota counties.

This excuse also doesn’t work for child abuse imagery or materials. Here you only need a technical expert to take the stand, and it’s more or less an open-and-shut case.

Nevertheless, with child abuse imagery or materials, well more than 90 percent of predators are granted stays in most counties. This isn’t just policing what people look at, says Grier Weeks, a senior executive at PROTECT. The material being traded online depicts the violent abuse, torture, and rape of young children — even toddlers. The material, says Weeks, should break our hearts. It is “far worse than heroin or meth. … It’s like anthrax.”

The predators viewing this material are an active threat to children around them. Not only that, according to research compiled by PROTECT, at least 55 percent of those found possessing and sharing child abuse imagery are also “contact offenders” with local child victims, or “dual offenders.”

On trafficking, the data is also awful — although, according to PROTECT, some of this Minnesota data may have treated prostituted teens, adults, and johns all as “offenders,” which may cloud the data. Nevertheless, even on trafficking, the stark difference between Choi’s record and other Minnesota prosecutors is telling. Overall, PROTECT says this is one area more data needs to be collected. For more analysis on the Minnesota data, read my article here.

Underfunding the Fight Against Predators

Because this issue is national — child abuse crosses both state and national lines — the federal government needs to be involved. As stated above, much attention is being paid to child trafficking, but the federal government has done far too little to fight back against child abuse materials and imagery.

Today, the United States has 61 Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task forces, made up of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors. The program is administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) within the Department of Justice. An ICAC requires recognition from the OJJDP, which necessitates a federal grant — so by definition, ICACs require federal funding.

But on this one thing, the federal government has been incredibly stingy. Right now, the federal government spends only $30 million per year on the ICACs, out of $85 million spent overall for child-rescue programs, which includes the quasi-governmental National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

To put that in perspective, the federal government spent $85 million to build an unfinished hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, while the overall War in Afghanistan costs nearly $50 billion per year. It spends nearly $70 million on “wild horse management” every year and about $100 million annually on “fetal tissue research,” which subsidizes abortion providers.

Because federal grants never cover all the costs of an ICAC unit, state and local money typically covers personnel, buildings, cars, and even equipment. As a result, PROTECT, which helped pass the 2008 law that authorized the ICACs, has also helped to pass a law — dubbed “Alicia’s law” — in at least 12 states, creating a dedicated revenue stream for the ICACs.

‘Tens of Thousands’ of Uncaught Predators

One huge problem is the lack of resources to ICACs, and it isn’t because the ICACs aren’t effective. In just one national sting operation in 2019, named “Broken Heart,” law enforcement made more than 1,700 arrests and rescued 357 children.

“I would stress that I consider the work ICACs do — detecting and interdicting online child exploitation — to be the most effective child sexual abuse prevention tool ever devised,” says Weeks. “As you know, at least 55% of possessors are hands-on abusers, and for some types of imagery, the rate is much higher.”

According to Weeks, in the last few years, due to underfunding, the ICACs have nearly ceased their most promising work: proactive investigations of the most dangerous offenders. Weeks says this is because cyber tips from internet providers — sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which forwards the tips to the appropriate ICAC — have increased exponentially. More than 18 million tips were received in 2018 alone. Even though 80 percent of these tips are “non-actionable,” the ICACs are under pressure to triage and work them, partly because 20 percent are actionable.

Yet this focus is “often to the exclusion of opening proactive investigations of suspects they have in their own databases,” Weeks explains. According to Weeks, children’s lives are hanging in the balance:

ICAC investigations have located tens of thousands of suspects who could be arrested and easily prosecuted for distribution of child abuse imagery. Those arrests would rescue tens of thousands of American children and prevent predictable atrocities against many more. Yet, over 90% of those leads are not being investigated, due to sheer lack of resources.

Weeks says the ICACs can see a map of where many of the predators are. One of PROTECT’s handouts gives an example. It’s overwhelming.

America needs a war on child predators, and smart politicians looking to run on something people actually care about should get on board.

What Governments Need to Do

First, the federal government needs to properly fund the ICACs — $100 million instead of $30 million would be a start. Despite the ICACs’ success, the Department of Justice has consistently refused to ask Congress for more ICAC funding. For example, Weeks reports sitting down with former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein promised action, but the DOJ’s next budget request asked for only a nominal increase of ICAC funding.

Next, every state should pass a version of Alicia’s Law. The federal government should fund the ICACs, but states also need to have skin in the game. Smart federal legislation could even come up with some kind of federal dollar-matching program to incentivize states to conduct quality control on ICACs — to bring in another shareholder aside from the DOJ.

Finally, states need tougher penalties against those who hurt kids. State sentencing on child sex crimes is too lenient, but prosecutors aren’t being held accountable because nobody is collecting data. Every state legislature should require data to be collected on sentences for child predators.

States have too often placed a huge emphasis on rehabilitation, an industry that makes serious money. It claims great results, but the rehabilitators are really just saying that only a certain percent of predators get caught again. And far too often, states will put a “rehabilitated” predator back into the home with the victimized children. What are the chances these children, who are now basically hostages, will report something again?

States also need mandatory minimums for those caught trading child abuse materials and imagery. Right now, only the federal criminal code has a mandatory minimum of five years for this crime. In effect, many states have decriminalized this material, but there are discrepancies. Arizona has tough penalties, and prosecutors in Virginia can stack charges, but in Minnesota, the statute on these awful materials isn’t even in the criminal section of the law. It’s so bad that law enforcement officers consistently say they need to get the feds involved if they actually want a predator to be locked up for any significant period of time.

Here, there’s no excuse for state inaction. Federal prosecutors say these mandatory minimums help them, not hinder them. These minimums are also targeted — structured not to go after the teenage sexter, for instance — and people don’t stumble across this material randomly.

If states have a problem with minimums, state politicians should fight for minimums for when the material depicts sadistic acts and torture. According to Weeks, most of the bad guys have this sort of material. This stuff is straight from hell, and states and the federal government should treat it as such.

What Normal People Can Do

Here’s what the average person can do: Search your state law, and see what the penalties are for child abuse materials and imagery. If the verbiage is something like “zero to 10 years” across the board, there’s no minimum, and your state may be handing out probation to 90 percent of offenders, just like Minnesota is.

First, lobby for your state law to mirror federal law. Second, lobby for the passage of Alicia’s Law in your state, which will set up a dedicated stream of state funds to the local ICAC.

Concerned citizens should also look up how much their state is spending on rehabilitation, realizing that state legislators not acting on toughening the law probably have the rehabilitation industry whispering in their ear. Push for a law that keeps predators from being put back into homes with children they have victimized, if the state doesn’t already have such a law.

Next, push the legislature to pass a law requiring data collection on sex crimes against minors, the prosecutor and judge involved in each case, and the sentence received. It’s hard to tell how bad your state is without collecting the data, which may get prosecutors’ and lawmakers’ attention if it’s recorded.

In general, talk to law enforcement officers or a lawmaker you trust, and see if they are willing to help. Law enforcement officers especially will be happy if someone draws attention to this topic. They have to deal with this awful material, and it is more than frustrating for them when the bad guys aren’t put away.

How Shutting Down The Economy Could Kill Tens Of Thousands,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues across the world, leaders and policymakers have scrambled to respond to the growing health crisis. In the United States, multiple state governors have issued statements urging their citizens to follow social distancing guidelines.

Other governors have taken more extreme measures, issuing orders to effectively lock down entire state economies. The current goal of these responses has been to slow the spread of the virus in the hope of reducing the strain on the health-care system. Discussion over the proper precautions is a necessity in such a time.

There have been forecasted estimates of virus-related death totals for the United States from as high as 10 million, to 2.2 million, to more conservative estimates of 5,000. The models used to estimate the potential death rates are not without criticism and repeated adjustment. Sampling bias may be a significant problem. These data errors are an important problem to resolve as policymakers use these models to inform their responses.

Lives Depend on Economic Activity

The difference between social distancing and complete economic shutdowns is too dramatic not to be taken seriously. It is imperative that more testing be conducted to provide better access to data, as well as the health benefits that come with knowing who does and does not have the virus. However, as important as it is to get the cost of not shutting down right, it is also important that policymakers properly weigh the cost of the economic shutdowns themselves.

Getting the cost right is not simply a matter of valuing “profits over people,” as the social media memes may suggest. Rather, even in times of crisis, the ability to operate in a functioning economy is important for the people within it.

The economy is the people, and the people are the economy. The ability to continue to function in a market system does matter to individuals within the system, particularly when the ability of business to remain open and continue to employ them is in question.

We have already started to see some of these human effects as the unemployment has quickly rocketed beyond even the early initial projections. A rise in unemployment is correlated with a number of negative socio-economic effects. For some, these effects can be quite deadly, particularly when the changes are rapid, as is currently the case.

The Longer the Shutdown, the More People Will Be Hurt

The economic predictions for the shutdowns may be as varied as those for the virus itself. The Federal Reserve’s James Bullard has noted that unemployment may rise to as much as 30%. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated a possible unemployment rate of 20%.

Bullard’s number is higher than the unemployment seen in the United States during the Great Depression (25%), and both estimates are significantly higher than the unemployment during the Great Recession (11%). Even if we take the more conservative estimate of 20% unemployment, that is a 16.5% rise in unemployment from its recent historic lows of 3.5% unemployment.

Although it is difficult to estimate how long this downturn may linger, that is a severe shock to the economic system. It is possible that people return to work and economic activity returns in strength in short order after the shutdowns are lifted.

Even then, the costs of shutting down will have been quite large. However, it is also possible that some businesses who had to pause activity for a month or more may not be able to return at all. The recession could be longer than some economists are projecting. If the economy does linger in its downturn, the human costs to the shutdown will inevitably begin to increase.

Possibly 28,797 More Deaths from Opioids

A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper finds a 3.6% increase in the opioid death rate per 100,000 people for a 1% rise in unemployment. There were 14.6 opioid death rates per 100,000 in the United States in 2018. If we use the more conservative estimate of a 20% unemployment rate without a quick return to lower levels, then there would be an estimated 59.4% rise in deaths per 100,000, leading to an increase of 8.7 deaths for a total of 23.3 for opioids.

With a current U.S. population of 331 million, there are 3,310 groups of 100,000, meaning there is potential for an additional 28,797 deaths from opioids annually. Consider that for 2018, the Centers for Disease Control reports that there were 67,367 deaths from all-drug deaths, with 46,802 of those coming from opioid use. The 46,802 deaths were considered an opioid crisis. A possible 75,599 should not be dismissed quickly.

The negative effects will not be felt just through opioid use either. The numerical increase in deaths provided above is only for opioid users, but the all-drug death number will rise as well. In a 2018 study, Bruguera, et al, found that of the 180 drug users they surveyed about use during the Great Recession, 58.3% reported an increase in use while only 25.6% reported decreasing use, resulting in greater all-drug use for the period.

Similarly, Mulia, et al, (2014) connects a rise in alcoholism to economic loss during the Great Recession. The CDC estimates that 2,200 people die in the United States just from alcohol poisoning annually, not to mention the additional alcohol-related deaths that occur. In 2017 alone, there were also 22,246 deaths resulting from alcoholic liver disease. As the jobless rate increases and the economic losses continue to mount, these numbers are likely to rise.

Unemployment Increases Suicide, Homicide

The deaths related to economic downturns go beyond those from chemical dependency, also. The mental toll is not inconsequential. For example, Blakely, et al, (2003) find that being unemployed may also increase the risk of suicide two to threefold. Milner, et al. (2014) similarly finds that unemployment is associated with a higher relative risk of suicide, with prior mental health issues being a key factor in that association. While a study by Kerr, et al, (2018) did not find that unemployment is directly linked to suicides, it did find a significant link between poverty, suicide, and alcoholism.

Unemployment does have a direct impact on older portions of the population, the portion of the population many of the current shutdowns are most meant to protect.

When breaking the population into age groups, Lin and Chen (2018) do find that unemployment does have a direct impact on older portions of the population, the portion of the population many of the current shutdowns are most meant to protect. Whether it is the direct unemployment effect or the potential poverty produced from the economic shutdown that leads to greater suicides, an increase from the 48,344 suicides and 1,400,000 suicide attempts in the United States in 2018 should give decision-makers pause during their response to this pandemic.

Increased harm to oneself is not the only harm caused by economic downturns. There is also the threat of rising crime in general. Ajimotokin, et al, (2015) estimate that a 1 percent change in unemployment will increase the property crime rate by 71.1 per 100,000 people and the violent crime rate by 31.9 per 100,000 people.

With our estimated 16.5% rise in unemployment, we could see a significant increase in both property and violent crimes. The violent crime also may add to the death toll in this period. Kposowa and Johnson (2016) find that unemployed workers are more than 50% more likely to become homicide victims than those who are employed. They also find people not in the labor force are 1.3 times more likely to be victims than those who are employed. As workers become discouraged due to an inability to find jobs during a recession, their lives as well as their livelihoods are called into question.

The future during such a pandemic is largely uncertain, and misinformation is rampant in the current panic. Policymakers face tough decisions as they navigate the issues of data collection, virus transmission, and economic ramifications of doing too little or too much. It is vitally important, literally life and death, that the proper costs and benefits are weighed with the decision on how much and how long to shut down economic activity through the pandemic.

6 Ways The Obama Administration Flouted Rule Of Law To Destroy Flynn,"In prosecuting Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Obama administration holdovers used the appointment of a special counsel to weaponize the legal system. After finding no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia to influence the 2016 election, Robert Mueller’s team had to justify continuing their investigation by going after Flynn for a crime even James Comey’s FBI didn’t believe he committed.

1. Unmasking and Leaking

The decision to prosecute Flynn was not the first nor the last affront to due process or the rule of law Flynn suffered at the hands of the Obama administration. Recently released documents from Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell reveal there were 49 requests to unmask Flynn’s name in just two months, meaning attempts to reveal his identity in intercepted communications, particularly those between Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

These requests came from officials such as Joe Biden, Obama’s chief of staff Denis McDonough, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and UN Ambassador Samantha Power. Power alone submitted 300 requests to unmask American citizens in less than a year. These new facts vindicate the claims of Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., from three years ago that there was wide-scale unmasking of Trump officials by the Obama administration.

Almost every report from mainstream media sources states that unmasking is commonplace. “Nothing to see here,” they say. Yet looking at unmasking from a constitutional perspective paints a different picture.

It is illegal to spy on an American citizen without a warrant. To do so is a breach of that citizen’s right to due process and of protections against undue search and seizure. So when an American citizen’s phone conversation with a foreign national is inadvertently recorded, the law dictates the American’s name be masked. While unmasking is at times necessary, it should be done with the utmost of caution.

Flynn’s constitutional rights were obviously not considered in the Obama administration’s frenzied search for a crime. The Obama administration was intent that Flynn not be Trump’s national security adviser. They advised the Trump transition team not to hire Flynn, but were ignored.

The fact that the Obama administration targeted Flynn isn’t just a crime against him, but a crime against our constitutional system. The Obama administration had no right to try to handicap Trump’s foreign policy or to ensure that a corrupt investigation into a presidential candidate continue as a clandestine investigation into a sitting president.

To make matters worse, not only was Flynn’s name unmasked, but the contents of his call with Kislyak were leaked to the press. While unmasking isn’t a crime, leaking certainly is, and can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison. Leaks were commonly used as a political weapon during the early days of the Trump administration. Three leaks were made to the Washington Post from this call alone. To date, no one has answered for these crimes.

2. The Sham Crossfire Razor Investigation

The FBI’s reasons for opening a sub-investigation into Flynn called Crossfire Razor are ridiculous. The first reason given was Flynn’s service as a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.

The campaign was already being investigated in the umbrella case known as Crossfire Hurricane. This investigation was predicated on an uncorroborated dossier paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. In Comey’s FBI, any type of association with Trump was reason enough to release the full force of the bureau’s investigative powers — just ask Carter Page and George Papadopoulos.

Another reason Flynn was targeted was because of a trip he took to Russia in 2015. After the trip, stories came out about Flynn’s meeting with various Russian state actors as well as an alleged affair with Svetlana Lokhova, a supposed Russian spy.

Just a few problems with this story: Lokhova is not a Russian spy, and she has sued the Wall Street Journal for publishing this claim, not the likely move of an actual spy. She and Flynn also both deny having an affair and assert they only met once at a Cambridge dinner. Further, newly released documents confirm that Stefan Halper was the FBI’s confidential human source that peddled this false information, the same Stefan Halper who spied on Papadopoulos, Page, and Sam Clovis.

Additionally, Flynn very well may have met Russian state actors, as it was his job. What most accounts leave out is that after his trip, he gave a full report to the Defense Intelligence Agency and had cleared the trip with the Pentagon.

One reason using the 2015 Russia trip to investigate Flynn is ridiculous is that in April 2016, the Obama administration had renewed Flynn’s top secret/sensitive compartmented information clearance, meaning he passed extensive background checks and a polygraph test. One of the newly released documents is a case-closed memo, written Jan. 4. An FBI agent wrote that they found “no derogatory” evidence that Flynn committed a crime or posed a national security threat. However, agent Peter Strzok rescinded the memo, saying the seventh floor (FBI leadership) was now involved.

3. The FBI Interview

Flynn was further victimized when the FBI ambushed him. In an unprecedented and underhanded move, Comey sent two FBI agents to the White House to interview Flynn about his phone call with Kislyak. In so doing, Comey bypassed the normal procedure of going through the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel’s office.

Not only did Comey not go through the DOJ, he defied the wishes of Sally Yates, a former deputy attorney general. She and others had expressed concerns about interviewing Flynn without proper procedures. She was ignored. As Comey now infamously said in a televised interview with MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace: “I sent them. Something I would not have ordinarily done with a more organized administration.”

Newly released documents reveal some of the behind-the-scenes conversations taking place among FBI agents about the interview, including discussions about its purpose. Was it to find out the truth, or get Flynn to lie so he would be fired or prosecuted?

Also discussed was how to trick Flynn into not realizing he was at an official FBI interview, how to get around the legal requirement to inform Flynn that lying to the FBI was a crime, and how to get him not to bring a lawyer. To schedule the meeting, then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe called Flynn and asked whether some FBI agents could meet with him, telling Flynn “it was no big deal” and it would be easier if he could just meet with the agents alone.

Normal interview procedures were not followed. Flynn wasn’t shown a transcript of his call and instead was asked to recall from memory a conversation he had weeks prior.

Flynn didn’t deny talking about sanctions. He said he didn’t know and that it was possible he and Kislyak had talked about sanctions, although he didn’t think so. Flynn would have been stupid to lie, as he admitted to McCabe in the phone call that set up the interview that he was sure the FBI had a recording of the call. “You listen to everything they say,” Flynn told McCabe.

In their motion to dismiss, the DOJ has decided that even if Flynn did lie, since there was no legitimate investigation going on, it was not material to the case and was therefore not a violation of law.

There are, however, major doubts that he lied in the first place. Strzok and Joe Pientka, the two agents who interviewed Flynn, left the meeting believing that though he hadn’t gotten the particulars of his call correct, he displayed no behavior that indicated he was lying. Pientka had even attended a briefing with Flynn prior to the interview to get an understanding of his baseline demeanor to compare with the interview to follow.

According to Yates, the FBI wasn’t even sure what kind of investigation they were operating. They seemed to morph between describing it as a counterintelligence investigation and a criminal investigation. In the end, it wasn’t an investigation at all, but a setup, a perjury trap.

A perjury trap occurs when the facts are known to the prosecutors or investigators and the only purpose of the interview is to catch the subject in a false statement. Then-Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Bill Priestap wrote in a note that he was afraid the FBI was “playing games” with the interview to get Flynn to lie so they could either prosecute him or get him fired.

He conveyed his concerns to McCabe and Comey, but was ignored. A handwritten note by Priestap reads, “What is our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”

4. Misuse of the Logan Act

The Logan Act was used as the pretense for the FBI’s interview of Flynn as well as for Yates’ campaign to get Flynn fired. As Mark Hemingway quips, the fact that the Logan Act is still on the books is an “accident of history.”

The law is considered by almost all legal experts to be unconstitutional. Passed in 1799, it has been used to prosecute only two cases, neither successfully, and last in 1852. The law makes it illegal for a private citizen to speak with a foreign government about policy in a way that contradicts the current administration’s policy.

Applying this law to Flynn’s phone call with Kislyak is problematic for several reasons. First, this antiquated law is an obvious infringement on the First Amendment right to free speech. The only reason the law hasn’t been struck down is because it hasn’t been prosecuted since the creation of the DOJ.

Second, the Logan Act is violated all the time and often far more publicly than Flynn’s phone call. Dennis Rodman and John Kerry are just a couple of the famous perpetrators, yet there has never been talk of prosecuting them.

In reality, the Logan Act was a mere pretense. Obama, the FBI, and the DOJ all knew it wasn’t going to be used to prosecute Flynn. They simply used the Logan Act as a tool to get Flynn fired. McCabe testified that he was told a prosecution under the Logan Act was a long shot. In a DOJ memo, Mary McCord, assistant attorney general at the time, said a Logan Act prosecution seemed like a stretch.

5. Flynn’s Prosecution and Guilty Plea

Flynn was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which makes it a federal crime to “knowingly and willfully” make a false statement of “a material fact” to a federal official.

More evidence has come out to indicate that Flynn’s plea was coerced. It turns out the prosecution threatened to prosecute Flynn’s son for Foreign Agents Registration Act violations unless Flynn senior pleaded guilty. Even worse, the prosecution sought to keep this deal off the books so they would not have to reveal it when using Flynn to testify against his business partner. This is a violation of Giglio disclosures and demonstrates the prosecution’s disregard for the rule of law.

Further, the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence from Flynn’s defense team. They withheld the emails, texts, and handwritten notes of FBI agents that demonstrated Flynn was being set up and that there was no underlying investigation. They also withheld texts between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page that prove they significantly edited the original 302 document.

Both Nunes and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, requested materials on Flynn’s case and other related matters more than two years ago, but were told such records did not exist.

6. Judge Sullivan Taking the Law into His Own Hands

In an unprecedented move, Judge Emmet Sullivan has put the motion to dismiss charges against Flynn on hold. He will allow friends of the court to argue against the dismissal.

Sullivan’s moves act against two controlling precedents, according to Mark Chenoweth, executive director of the New Civil Liberties Alliance. Just one week ago, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticized the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for similar tactics.

As Margot Cleveland argues, the Constitution makes clear that it is not the judiciary’s role to second-guess prosecutorial decisions. Based on mandatory precedent from the D.C. Circuit Court in United States v. Fokker, the prosecutorial role lies squarely within the executive branch.

This move by Sullivan is like a bad sequel. Flynn has suffered unjustly enough: first at the hands of the Obama administration, then at the hands of overzealous prosecutors, and now at the hands of an activist judge. It is time to let the man move on with his life.

GOP Leaders Need A Lesson In Law And Order From Richard Nixon,"In light of the protests and rioting engaged in, in the name of George Floyd, no words are more prescient and timelier than Richard Nixon’s acceptance speech at the 1968 Republican National Convention. The relevance stems not from its oratorical delivery—it is unthinkable to expect any, and I mean any, current politician to emulate Nixon’s stern sincerity—but due to the striking thematic similarity between 1968 and 2020.

Nixon’s words were just as appropriate in 1968 as if they were spoken by a conservative leader today: “As we look at America, we see cities enveloped in smoke and flame. We hear sirens in the night. We see Americans dying on distant battlefields abroad. We see Americans hating each other; fighting each other; killing each other at home. And as we see and hear these things, millions of Americans cry out in anguish. Did we come all this way for this?”

After eight years of relentless divisive race-baiting and institutional corruption under President Obama; after more than three years of relentless institutional partisanship in academia, media, to our bloated bureaucracy; from women’s marches to “Russian collusion,” from radical campus professors to nihilist youths with little loyalty to community or country; mix these with external factors like rising great power hostility and a stagnating war in a faraway land, and it appears the country has finally reached its boiling point.

This Struggle isn’t Racial, it’s Cultural

The last few days are the culmination of a societal breakdown that was a long time coming. From Killer Mike’s emotional speech blaming CNN and one of the recent monologues delivered by Tucker Carlson, it is evident this insanity is not racial but cultural.

Photos abound of lower and middle-class black and white protesters attempting to protect their neighborhoods, stopping and pleading with Antifa, and cleaning up after complete anarchy. Yet we have also seen photos of petty looters making off with Star Wars Lego sets and Louise Vuitton bags. Nothing proves one’s social justice bona fides like looting.

There is a direct tie from the chaos of the last seven days and what is taught and preached in up-market society—from college campuses to partisan media preaching hate and divisiveness. The thugs out to plunder require the hard end of a baton, they are not Madisonian rebels seeking justice.

Martina Navratilova promoted rioting, and celebrities like Steve Carell, Janelle Monáe, and Cynthia Nixon helped looters get bail. There are also some reports indicating protesters were organized through social media and came from outside the regions engulfed in flames.

Fighting the Roots of the Problem

Perhaps the FBI should focus more on infiltrating these Antifa cells and the radical institutions that promote and organize such rampant domestic violence. Unless, of course, the FBI itself is compromised, complacent, or worse, full of bleeding-heart liberals who’d much rather spend time on nonsensical issues like Russian teens posting memes from Ulitsa Savushkina. But why would we think that?

Labeling Antifa a radical organization isn’t enough. There are enough laws available to prosecute these groups. The bigger question is how best to tackle the hubs of the radicalizations, the universities that teach these people, and the groups that fund and organize them.

We need massive rallies and counter-protests against all those public figures who bailed out thugs. We need to publicly shame and protest all the sympathetic celebrities who egg the Antifa-types on. We must reinstall a deterrence to the radical leftist ideology that fuels these riots.

As Nixon said in ‘68, “I don’t promise that we can eradicate poverty, and end discrimination, eliminate all danger of war in the space of four, or even eight years. But, I do promise action—a new policy for peace abroad; a new policy for peace and progress and justice at home.”

Unfortunately, it’s easy to blather about Iranian ayatollahs than it is to rise up against radicalism within your own country. We have called for humanitarian intervention in other countries for far less. Even our libertarian cousins at Reason now lament how the police force failed to protect lives and properties.

Soviet influence on domestic terrorism was not curtailed by praying to Gaia, but by constant vigilance by intelligence services. Cancer is not cured by chanting; it is removed with clinical precision.

Choosing Law and Order Over Chaos

“If we are to restore order and respect for law in this country,” Nixon proclaimed, “there is one place we are going to begin. We are going to have a new Attorney General of the United States of America. I pledge to you that our new Attorney General will be directed by the President of the United States to launch a war against organized crime in this country.”

Realism dictates that in the worst possible choices, anarchy is always far worse than tyranny. For, if by an unfortunate scenario, you end up helplessly under tyranny, there’s a statistical possibility that you can somehow survive if you follow the brutal rules set by the tyrant. Anarchy, on the other hand, is chaotic. No matter how many rules you follow, you will still suffer.

A retired black firefighter started a bar with his life’s savings until rioters burned and destroyed it. This is a law-abiding citizen who forms the silent majority of most Western countries. Yet despite him following all the rules and paying his taxes, elected leaders have failed to protect him. In what civil society can this be considered just?

The rulers we’ve elected to govern us, have in many cases, failed to govern, opting instead to preach the social justice nonsense taught by their woke PR assistants. Liberal mayors and leaders have essentially prevented law enforcement to subdue this madness. Liberal media fans the flames even more

Nixon understood that more than the market, more than foreign interventions, the backbone of conservatism is law and order. Law-abiding people crave order among lawlessness, chaos, and anarchy. Law-abiding people are also the silent majority. They have no color or creed. They are not paid to protest or taught by radical professors or egged on by media and celebrities. As Nixon said, the silent majority “is the voice of the great majority of Americans, the forgotten Americans—the non-shouters; the non-demonstrators. They are not racists or sick; they are not guilty of the crime that plagues the land.” That is the ultimate truth in any democratic polity.

Republicans should channel their inner Nixon, a stalwart conservative law-and-order leader, pledging “the wave of crime is not going to be the wave of the future in the United States of America.” Because if conservatives of the world refuse or fail to be the party of order, then the people may well resort to electing anyone who promises the justice they demand. Restore order, Mr. President, before it’s too late.

Minneapolis Politicians Rally Around Abolishing The Police Department,"In response to the unrest following the death of George Floyd, Ilhan Omar today became the first member of Congress to publicly support abolishing the police force of Minneapolis. The statement came in response to City Council members rallying behind the previously unthinkable policy.

The Minneapolis Police Department has proven themselves beyond reform. It’s time to disband them and reimagine public safety in Minneapolis. Thank you to @MplsWard3 for your leadership on this! https://t.co/AQfHM5M6eR — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) June 5, 2020

An article published at Time by City Council member Steve Fletcher argues that because of their inability to reform, he is supporting the call to “disband our police department and start fresh with a community oriented, non-violent, public safety and outreach capacity.”

The policy suggests increased use of medical responders, and the creation of vague “unarmed, community-oriented street teams.” The policy does not address how violent crime will be handled in the city. Minneapolis holds one of the highest crime rates for American cities in the country, with rape, robbery, and property crime at twice the national average. Fletcher goes on to complain about how police forces were unable to protect local businesses.

In addition to the support of Rep. Omar and Fletcher, numerous council members have backed disbanding the police, including the Minneapolis Council President, the Chair of Public Safety, and Council members Jeremiah Ellison, Jeremy Schroeder, and Alondra Cano. The group is currently controlled entirely by members of the Democratic Party, and one member of the Green Party. None so far have come forward to oppose the policy.

This movement is at the forefront of a nationwide push by groups like Black Lives Matter. While Omar is the first congresswoman to publicly support it, related proposals are gaining steam. More “moderate” ideas, such as defunding law enforcement and redirecting their funds to social welfare spending have also gained traction. Progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, just yesterday announced her support for the policy. Many more congresspeople and local politicians on the Left have yet to make their position clear on either plan, likely weighing the political headwinds of the unprecedented policy.

Slashing law enforcement’s reach is well documented to show increased crime rates, as disincentives from breaking the law vanish. This can even lead to more arrests in the long term. Historical studies from 1960-2010 show that on average, every $1 invested in police results in $1.63 in social benefits as fewer murders are committed. As of now, no major studies exist on the effect of entirely removing the police department, as the policy has never been seriously considered for a major city before.

"According To The Left, Only Progressives Can Use The Church As A Prop","The world has reached a point where the Bible and churches are only props, and only leftists can use them. No, this is not a variation on Shakespeare’s line that “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players,” but rather the official position taken by prominent Catholic leaders.

In a statement concerning President Donald Trump’s visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington, D.C., to announce his executive order that would promote religious freedom around the world, Archbishop Wilton Gregory fumed, “I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree.” To support this, Gregory repeated the fake news narrative that Trump had used “tear gas” on “innocent protesters” to take vanity photos at St. John’s Episcopal Church.

Father James Martin, the editor of America Magazine and popular leftist advocate, couldn’t help but join in the fray, criticizing Trump’s visit to the shrine and St. John’s with a Bible in hand: “Let me be clear. This is revolting. The Bible is not a prop. A church is not a photo op. Religion is not a political tool. And God is not a plaything.” Martin is apparently blind to the fact that he has continually used his priestly vocation to advance political causes greatly at odds with church teachings.

The Left’s Double Standard

It’s difficult to see this opposition as anything but a shameless projection of leftist intolerance. Bishops, priests, and charity directors label Trump and his supporters hypocrites and Pharisees, while they themselves use their considerable influence and authority to block people with whom they disagree politically, assuming the moral and spiritual high ground as they do so.

As Trump visits the St John Paul II National Shrine today, I hope someone proclaims today's Gospel (Mark 12:13-17) where Herodians and Pharisees are called out for their hypocrisy. — Bishop John Stowe (@BpStowe) June 2, 2020

Furthermore, these critics betray an obvious double-standard when they permit corrupt pro-choice politicians such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Joe Biden to attend Mass, receive Communion, and scandalize the faithful without any word of reproach. Nor do they say anything about President Barack Obama delivering a commencement address and receiving an honorary degree at Notre Dame University while vigorously expanding abortion access and taking the Little Sisters of the Poor to court. Nor do they raise an objection when Pope Francis yucks it up with socialist dictators in Bolivia or cuts deals with the anti-human totalitarian regime in China.

Rather, progressives in the Catholic Church mostly celebrate these intrusions of leftist politics into spiritual life. This change, which most people date back to the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), has effectively elevated leftist radicals of all stripes while minimizing conservatives and traditionalists. This has resulted in a dilution of church teachings, a decline in religious practice, and an ongoing crisis in leadership. For orthodox Catholics clinging to the faith of their fathers, it has been demoralizing, to say the least.

An Exchange of Doctrine for Leftist Dogma

Besides harming the Catholic Church, and other Christian denominations by extension, the leftward turn of Catholic leaders has damaged the culture at large by making religion synonymous with politics. Put simply, the world has become less Catholic, both in its values and appearance, and this has serious implications for all people living in the West.

In terms of values, the church has traded away a religious and moral system for a secular one. Faith, hope, and charity have been replaced by self-esteem, conformity, and tolerance. Fighting evil has morphed into having a dialogue with it. Goodness has turned into niceness, truth into leftist ideology, and beauty into what’s useful. Sure enough, these values have embedded themselves into the modern society, propping up secular politicians while denigrating honest citizens such as Jack Phillips.

In terms of appearance, the church, once a great patron of the arts, has become invisible. People all over the world, even in places filled with Catholic monuments, are losing this Catholic societal context. As Malcolm Gladwell pointed out in his book “Tipping Point” 20 years ago, such context is critical to achieving a certain kind of behavior.

Gladwell explains this by discussing New York City’s urban blight and petty crime in the ’70s and ’80s and how this contributed to the city’s notoriously high crime rate. Once police and politicians addressed this blight in the early ’90s under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, cleaning up graffiti and broken windows and addressing minor crimes, they started seeing a collective change in behavior and rapid drop in crime.

The church today is the spiritual equivalent of crime-ridden New York in the ’70s and ’80s. It is ugly and teeming with thugs. Those pursuing holiness are marginalized and silenced while those peddling sin as gospel have taken control. This situation has led to a majority of Catholics abandoning key church teachings about marriage, birth control, and the Blessed Sacrament. It is even affecting those Catholics who grew up in Catholic families and attended Catholic schools.

As Gladwell’s analysis suggests, this is because people’s behavior is more influenced by their context than their core values: “The convictions of your heart and the actual contents of your thoughts are less important, in the end, in guiding your actions than the immediate context of your behavior.”

A Plea for Restoration

In response to this problem, church leaders have only doubled down on their commitment to this abysmal status quo, sniping at conservatives, echoing leftist activists, neglecting the victims of religious persecution, and ignoring the emptying pews.

The priests and laity who try to resist this decline and make reforms are quickly reported, censured, and pushed out, so no one bothers anymore. Faithful Catholics have to do what they can at home or flee to various traditional Catholic enclaves in the countryside. For those outside the church, few will ever hear the gospel since, as even Pope Benedict XVI noted, most missionary zeal has long since died in the developed world.

Ironically, the one public figure who wants to revive the Christian context and restore traditional values is thrice-married, nominally Christian Trump. He seems to recognize the secular blight infecting American culture, if not the Catholic Church, which is why he heavily pushes symbols: the American flag, the Bible, St. John’s Church, and the John Paul II Shrine. Leftist Catholics see this as appropriation, but it’s really a restoration.

Faithful Americans should take heart in this, not offense, and help the president by doing the same in their own communities. They may face criticism, but they also may finally succeed in saving souls again and finding meaning in religion. The world needs healing, and only a culture-wide spiritual renewal can make this happen.

Four Reasons Minneapolis Shouldn’t Disband Its Police Department,"Nine of the Minneapolis City Council’s 13 members announced on Sunday they pledged to disband the local police department. With nine votes, the council would have a veto-proof supermajority.

“We committed to dismantling policing as we know it in the city of Minneapolis and to rebuild with our community a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe,” Council President Lisa Bender said to CNN. “[We need] to listen, especially to our black leaders, to our communities of color, for whom policing is not working and to really let the solutions lie in our community.”

Bender told CNN she and the City Council were considering shifting police funding toward community-based strategies (whatever that means) but that ultimately the city council would discuss how to replace the current police department. “The idea of having no police department is certainly not in the short term,” Bender clarified.

It’s a bad idea to disband any local police department. But as a native of the Gopher State, I’d argue it’s especially dangerous to disband Minnesota’s. Local officials should pursue significant reform instead. Here’s why the police should stay.

Minneapolis is an Area with High, Violent Crime

For starters, Minneapolis is not a rural town where crime is minimal. Minneapolis is the largest city in Minnesota, in the top 50 largest cities in the U.S., and it boasts one of the highest crime rates for its size in the country. The FBI’s uniform crime report for 2018 states, “Minneapolis crime rates are 82% higher than the national average; Violent crimes in Minneapolis are 108% higher than the national average.”

Additional stats provide national context: “With a violent crime rate of 1,063 reported incidents for every 100,000 residents, nearly three times the corresponding national rate, Minneapolis is one of the most dangerous cities in the country.” In 2019, the Star Tribune reported that police data showed “the city’s 37 homicides climbed 32% from 28 this time last year, while aggravated assaults, rapes and robberies also rose during the first 10 months of the year.”

According to CNN, Bender said she and other council members analyzed the nature of 911 calls by constituents and found most were for mental health services, EMT, and fire services. It’s not clear how many calls they analyzed or how they came to that conclusion given these outrageous crime statistics—unless Minneapolis residents have just given up. Regardless, there’s too much crime to disband the police force, even one that may have its flaws.

Crime is High—Without Police, It Will be Higher

Of course, one response to increasingly higher crime rates in a city like Minneapolis is to proclaim, “See? The police aren’t working!’ It isn’t the first time this discussion has taken place in Minnesota between law enforcement and local and state elected officials. Just last year, as crime increased, residents and officials wondered if increasing police staff would resolve anything and reduce crime.

Yes, crime is high in Minneapolis, but that doesn’t mean the police department should be abolished altogether, despite terrible incidents like we observed with the death of George Floyd. Without police, crime will increase to astronomical proportions.

Every year, there are approximately 8.25 million criminal offenses and 10 million arrests made by police officers. Imagine a world without anyone but community organizers trying to stop these criminal activities. From a basic civics class to “The Communist Manifesto,” any historical references and political ideology would reject the notion that a society that wants to be law-abiding, peaceful, and prosperous, should do so by disbanding its local police force.

In her book “The War on Cops,” Heather MacDonald explains that police do a lot of good in society. Through extensive use of data, she makes a powerful case that police are often painted as bad guys due to the media, Black Lives Matter, and even flaws within the judiciary. She says these attacks on cops are a blatant attack on law and order itself, and serve to make everyone less safe.

Read that again: It’s not the cops—it’s the way they are portrayed. In an article in the Wall Street Journal just last week, MacDonald said, of course, bad cops should be held accountable. She disabused readers, however, of the notion that there is a widespread racial bias among law enforcement. If you thought crime was bad now, it would certainly increase without a police department.

Police Presence Provides a Sense of Protection, Law, and Order

The presence of police, even if they’re not arresting folks, can help maintain order in a society that will generally wane toward chaos without it. From traffic stops or drug raids to attempted rape and robbery, a nearby police force provides aid for people who need it, particularly folks who are young, elderly, without a personal firearm, or just vulnerable.

This criminal justice policy reform article describes the role of police in people’s everyday lives well: “Community policing reduces crime and fears of crime as well as perceptions of policing discrimination. At the same time, it increases public satisfaction of police and increases positive attitudes toward officers. A recent analysis of the scholarship around community policing confirms its positive impact on community satisfaction and perceptions of legitimacy.”

Can you imagine a society without the presence of armed officers near the White House, outside a bank, or just patrolling your neighborhood? America’s 911 system handles 500,000 calls daily and about 183 million annually. Many of these are genuine calls for help. If your daughter was in college and was about to get raped, would you not want a police department available to answer the call? If your son was walking home from school and a stranger tried to abduct him, would you not want a police officer standing by?

It would be “The Purge” come to life—2013’s dystopian thriller where all crime becomes legal for one night a year because law enforcement is suspended. Except, this would be more than one night, and it would not create a better society. It would allow the worst of society to create anarchy. Only dystopian, authoritarian governments reject the idea of law-abiding officers that aid the vulnerable and weak leaving only the strong to ward off criminals.

We Shouldn’t Disband Police When Reform is Possible

No matter how overrun with violent protesters, rioters, or looters, even some cities seem to understand that it’s silly, if not absurd, to disband the police when what they actually want is significant criminal justice reform. In fact, there’s a bit of gaslighting going on about this. At the very least, there is confusion as some state and local leaders are clarifying they don’t actually want to defund or abolish the police—they just want reform to take place.

Black Lives Matter co-founder: ""Defunding the police"" means ""reorganize our priorities"" https://t.co/gn61uEC7Ig pic.twitter.com/ybbTM0oRAN — The Hill (@thehill) June 7, 2020

It’s obvious that despite all the good things police departments try to do, they are human, flawed, and make serious mistakes—mistakes that can, sadly, cost lives. Many on all sides of the political spectrum have advocated for police reform. Yet this Washington Post article bemoans reform, saying Minneapolis police already struggled with police violence, adopted reforms, and still, George Floyd died.

With all due respect, the reforms the department achieved were clearly not enough. Within hours of Floyd’s murder, it was revealed with a quick search that his alleged murderer, police officer Derek Chauvin, had numerous complaints filed against him that had been logged by the department itself.

Imagine if that policy itself had been reformed. Had Chauvin been fired after the second or third complaint, Floyd would be alive, the nearly 70 Minneapolis businesses that have been burned down would still be operating, and the 15 people who have subsequently been killed due to protests about Floyd would still be alive.

Just because some reforms didn’t work, doesn’t mean none will work. William O. Douglas said, “It is procedure that spells much of the difference between rule of law and rule by whim or caprice.” I’ve long said there needs to be significant policy reform when it comes to training. Shoot to kill should not be the go-to police mantra, among other issues.

The last time police reform came up, body cameras were an instrument of reform, and those have been useful, not only to prove the innocence of citizens but police officers themselves. Body cams can nail cops like this guy who was illegally planting drugs on unassuming suspects.

According to Jeremiah Mosteller of the Charles Koch Institute, “Police academies spend, on average, 228 percent more time training new officers on firearm skills and defensive tactics than community policing. Police academies and departments across the country seeking to adopt community policing should ensure that officers are equipped to be effective collaborators with their local communities.” There’s much that can still be done in the area of reform. Giving up is simply not a wise option.

Law enforcement serves an important purpose in a free society. The majority of police officers promote public safety and uphold the rule of law in an effort to preserve our individual rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No police department is perfect. Significant reform must take place. But we cannot simply disband local departments in favor of anarchy. Doing so will not help anyone, especially not the vulnerable among us who need police the most.

Let’s Look At The Actual Facts About The Alleged Racism of Police,"This past week, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with the second-degree murder of George Floyd, a black man. Footage and photos of Floyd’s death launched protests and riots across the country. Despite there being no evidence yet that the officer was racist, it is simply assumed that racism motivated the Caucasian cop’s abusive actions.

Law enforcement officers can be careless or abusive without being racist. In Dallas, in 2016, a Caucasian man died after being arrested in the exact same way. The officers joked about the man being asleep, but he had died after pleading for help “more than 30 times.”

On Fox News Sunday this past weekend, host Chris Wallace mentioned a handful of cases that he thought showed a racist pattern. He pointed to Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead by a retired police officer in February while out jogging in Georgia. He also mentioned a recent disturbing incident in New York’s Central Park, where a Caucasian woman who was walking her dog called police to report that she was being threatened by “an African-American man.” The man simply told her that the law requires her to keep her dog on a leash.

It’s worth recalling that following the nationwide riots after the Michael Brown shooting, the “Hands up, don’t shoot” aspect of the story was revealed to be false.

The media have helped create a biased perception that is far from the reality of shootings by police. A study conducted by the Crime Prevention Research Center (where I serve as president) found that when a Caucasian officer kills a suspect, the media usually mention the race of the officer. When the offending officer is black, however, any news coverage rarely mentions race.

Furthermore, there’s ample evidence that black Americans aren’t all that fed up with the police. A July 2017 Quinnipiac University poll in New York City found that black Americans strongly support the cops in their own neighborhoods—62 percent approved compared to just 35 percent who disapproved. That approval rating was 11 percent higher than for the New York City Police Department as a whole. It makes sense that people only know their local cops but rely on media reports to form impressions about the parts of the city they are less familiar with.

More recently, a Monmouth University poll surveyed a national sample of 807 adults between May 28 to June 1, 2020, and found that Americans of all races are largely supportive of their local police departments.

Monmouth poll: How satisfied are you with your local police department (Very or somewhat satisfied/ Somewhat or very dissatisfied): College educated whites: 73% / 9%

Non-college whites: 70% / 14%

Black: 72% / 17%

Hispanic/Asian: 68% / 18% — Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) June 3, 2020

Through our own extensive research, my organization found 2,699 instances of police shootings across the nation from 2013-2015. That’s far more than the FBI found since its data is limited to only 1,366 cases voluntarily provided by police departments.

The FBI data has other problems, as well: It disproportionately includes cases from heavily minority areas, giving a misleading picture of the frequency at which blacks are shot.

Our database keeps track of characteristics of both the suspect and the officer involved in each shooting, local violent crime rates, demographics of the city and police department, and many other factors that help determine what causes police shootings.

Officers kill black Americans at a higher rate than their share of the population: 25 percent of the suspects killed were black, 45 percent Caucasian, and 16 percent Hispanic. But that isn’t true where the highest concentration of deaths occur. Black suspects tend to die in larger cities with populations averaging over 600,000 (overwhelmingly run by Democrats), while Caucasians are killed in smaller cities with an average population of 250,000.

Caucasian suspects were slightly more likely to be holding a firearm than blacks (63 percent to 61 percent). Black and Caucasian suspects where both equally likely to have been involved in violent crime when they lose their lives, though blacks who died were more likely to be involved in drug or property offenses.

It’s important to note, however, that police generally have more challenging jobs in cities where blacks are killed. The average city where blacks are killed had a 61 percent higher violent crime rate and a 126 percent higher murder rate than where the average Caucasian was killed.

After accounting for these and other factors, including the average differences across police departments to deal cultural differences in departments, we found that black officers were at least as likely as their Caucasian peers to kill black suspects, but that black officers were more likely to kill unarmed blacks than were Caucasian officers.

The data offered some advice for reducing these attacks. While it can’t explain all instances such as George Floyd’s case, usually when more police are present at the scene of a confrontation with a civilian, suspects face reduced odds of being killed. For each additional officer, there is about a 14 to 18 percent reduction in the suspect’s chances of being killed.

This makes intuitive sense. Officers feel more vulnerable if they are alone at the scene, making them more likely to resort to deadly force. Also, suspects may be emboldened and resist arrest when fewer officers are present.

It is a dangerous fiction that prejudiced Caucasian officers are going out and disproportionately killing black men. But that doesn’t mean that measures can’t be taken to reduce shootings by police. The most obvious step would be to increase the number of officers, to avoid forcing lone, vulnerable officers to make life-or-death decisions.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/08/look-facts-alleged-racism-police/,2020-06-08
Defunding Police Won't Fix The Chain Of Failures That Lead To Brutality,"George Floyd’s death is properly the responsibility of the senior arresting officer on the scene. Had that officer’s training been better, Floyd might be alive today.

Had the officer been disciplined or fired for prior improper behavior, Floyd might be alive today. Had the Minneapolis City Council, mayor, and local district attorney done a better job at police department oversight, Floyd might be alive today. Had local politicians not been so concerned about winning the approval of the powerful Minneapolis police union, Floyd might be alive today.

In his book “Outliers,” Malcolm Gladwell posits that culture can be a contributing factor in catastrophic airplane crashes. Beyond pilot error, most crashes feature other problems. By themselves, these problems are not fatal, but when added together they result in a cascade of failure: bad weather, low visibility, a minor mechanical failure such as a broken warning indicator light, contaminated fuel, engine failure, or a bird strike.

Floyd’s death offers a parallel list of failures. Many of them could be addressed with deliberation, persistence, and follow-up — things notoriously in short supply in our political system. Other systemic failures may take decades to improve. A few might be beyond the reach of effective government action, though likely not for lack of trying.

Encounters with Police

One factor likely influencing fatal police encounters is frequency of contact with law enforcement. A few factors other than systemic racism could explain this.

Police encounters are often initiated because of the need for probable cause to detain suspects. Any traffic violation provides an excuse for a law enforcement officer to pull over a driver and ask questions. This action most frequently results in a ticket or warning, but as police examine a car and its driver, they may develop information that leads to an arrest.

This is the root of the “driving while black” complaint of many of our fellow Americans who suffer a higher rate of being pulled over. Even Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, in a statement on the Senate floor in 2016, noted that in 2015, he was pulled over seven times — twice for speeding and five times for “driving while black.”

“Imagine the frustration, the irritation, the sense of a loss of dignity that accompanies each of those stops,” Scott implored his colleagues. “I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling that you’re being targeted for nothing more than just being yourself.”

If being pulled over for no apparent reason leads to justifiable anger, imagine having the police seize any cash in your car — or even your car itself. This is where civil asset forfeiture comes in. With its roots in maritime law dealing with piracy, modern civil asset forfeiture was created and expanded in response to the growing sophistication of international drug kingpins during the 1980s.

The practice allowed law enforcement agencies to keep the proceeds of items, including cash, seized during illicit drug investigations or even routine traffic stops — even if no guilty verdict was achieved or no one was even charged with a crime. It became very tempting, as cash and other valuables enrich law enforcement organizations without the need for taxpayer dollars. It’s essentially “found money.”

Civil asset forfeiture increases negative encounters with law enforcement. Possible reforms include requiring that any assets taken by law enforcement go to the state general fund, which would remove the profit motive for local police, sheriffs, and district attorneys. At the federal level, the Department of Justice can end the practice of “equitable sharing” which allows local law enforcement to bypass state restrictions on the use of civil asset forfeiture.

Using law enforcement as a revenue-generating arm of government also increases adverse encounters with police officers. This was a huge irritant in Ferguson, Missouri, and other towns where various fines and fees, including court fees, have become a significant source of government revenue. When someone is levied a fine for an infraction (say, uncut grass), failure to pay can lead to an arrest warrant.

The death of Eric Garner during an arrest in Mayor Bill de Blasio’s New York City in July 2014 is another example. Garner was accused of selling “loosies” — individual cigarettes without a tax stamp. In NYC at the time, cigarettes came with $5.85 in state and city taxes per pack of 20. No wonder an estimated half of all cigarettes smoked in New York are smuggled in.

Law enforcement’s time and effort ought to be invested in preventing and solving crime, two difficult tasks that are far more readily accomplished with community support. Collecting cigarette taxes and arresting people for unpaid fines make the vital work of public safety much more difficult.

While reforming civil asset forfeiture and the use of fines and fees to fund government will reduce the chances for police-involved deaths, especially among the poor and minorities, violent crime is a far more difficult issue.

Militarization of Police

In response to the rising violence that crested in the early 1990s, police culture became increasingly “militarized,” shifting officers’ mental framework from that of community guardian to that of an occupying force. This change in attitude, often starting at the police academy, occurred over decades and will likely require time and a concerted effort from the bottom up to shift back. It too often manifests itself in quickly resorting to SWAT teams, heavily armed no-knock entries into homes at 2 a.m., and the increasing use of surplus military equipment. All of these increase the odds of a fatal police encounter.

Violent crime is key factor when considering police shootings. From 2014 to 2018, according to the federal crime victimization report, an average of 1.08 percent of whites reported being the victim of violent crime, compared to 1.23 percent of blacks — with blacks’ victimization rate about 13 percent higher. More victims generally mean more calls to police for help.

Furthermore, in 2018, some 70.3 percent of the time that blacks were victims of a violent incident, the perpetrator was another black person. Yet in Minneapolis today, some groups are urging residents not to call 911 in response to an emergency. This may end up creating far more victims of crime, some of whom will die as a result, than would ever be the case due to a fatal police encounter.

Meanwhile, Chicago just suffered its most violent day in 60 years on May 31, with 18 people killed. Over the entire weekend, 25 people were killed and another 85 wounded by gunfire. Should this increase in violence continue, much of the current debate over policing will likely be forgotten as a nation besieged by crime might return to a familiar playbook.

It was rampant violence back in the early 1990s that led President Bill Clinton, then-Sen. Joe Biden, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, then a member of the House, to support the bipartisan 1993 crime bill. Both the House and Senate featured Democratic majorities that year. That crime bill funded 100,000 new police officers and started a prison construction boom.

Yet the violent crime rate had peaked in 1991, at a rate of 758.2 per 100,000 people, more than double the rate in the most recent year reported, 388.9 per 100,000 in 2018.

Demographics of Perpetrators

Violent crime is mainly the domain of young, single men. The most recent criminal victimization report from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, found that in 2018, males were responsible for 77 percent of violent incidents, females for 18.3 percent, and males and females acting together for 4.7 percent.

In a recent Washington Post article detailing police shootings, the authors note, “The overwhelming majority of people killed are armed. Nearly half of all people fatally shot by police are white.” The authors found, “Fatal police shootings are relatively rare events,” and most of the “[h]undreds of thousands of police officers … will never fire their guns on duty” during their careers. Further, 94 percent of the 5,400 people shot and killed by police since 2015 were armed with some sort of weapon — more than 3,000 with guns. “About one in four had some mental-health issues.”

The article went on to detail the racial and ethnic makeup of those shot and killed by police, noting:

White people, who account for 60 percent of the American population, made up 45 percent of those shot and killed by police. Black people make up 13 percent of the population but have accounted for 23 percent of those shot and killed by police.

When providing data on shootings and race and ethnicity, context is vital — context that when missing can lead to deeply unserious proposals such as the demand to “defund the police.”

The most recent crime victimization report found different demographic groups have different rates of committing violent crimes. White, non-Hispanics made up 62.3 percent of the population but committed 50.2 percent of violent crimes. Blacks were 12 percent of the population and committed 21.7 percent of violent incidents. Hispanics accounted for 17.1 percent of the population and 14.4 percent of violent incidents. While Asians made up 6.3 percent of the population, they committed only 2.5 percent of the incidents. The prior year’s report found that white suspects committed 49.2 percent of nonfatal violent incidents while black suspects committed 24.5 percent.

The offender data for 2017 and 2018 tracks closely with the Washington Post’s findings on the demographics of those shot and killed by police. Without mentioning the statistical connection between fatal police shootings and the rate of violent criminal acts, a reasonable reader of the Washington Post article might conclude that systemic racism within police departments is the main thing driving the higher likelihood of police shooting and killing black Americans.

Lastly, the role of healthy families, vibrant communities, and a strong economy can’t be understated. Violent crime doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and policing isn’t its main deterrent.

That said, if calls to “defund the police” result in reduced budgets and dismantled police departments, America is likely to see some of its cities get “mugged by reality” in the near future — with the preponderance of harm visited not upon generally wealthier and whiter suburbs, but upon those urban communities most vulnerable to crime.

Welcome To Your New World Order: A Rundown Of Woke Insanity,"America is in the midst of a new cultural civil war that for years has been brewing under the surface as left-wing academics breed aggressively woke children now permeating throughout the nation’s mainstream institutions.

Since the killing of George Floyd at the knees of a Minneapolis police officer sparked the worst outbreak of civil unrest in decades, protests that grew out of demanding justice for Floyd morphed into a dark operation to fundamentally transform the nation’s psyche, convincing the people of their own inherent evil from ancestral wrongs.

Battle lines are clearly being drawn, where the radical left has offered Americans a binary choice in a false dichotomy between total submission or unrelenting exile with those opposed to the new woke world order cast out of society as unrepentant racists refusing to atone for past generations’ sins. No justice, no peace. Silence is violence. You’re either with us, or against us. There is no middle ground. Which side of history are you on?

Of course in reality, (and sanity), it’s clearly not that black and white, but if recent events show us anything, they expose that this mentality is no longer one of a fringe left-wing movement but a central tenet of our mainstream culture of what it means to make “progress.” America, according to the now only acceptable narrative, is an irredeemably racist society that was built for the sole purpose to oppress. It has never been great. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is as guilty as the slaveholders who lived more than 150 years ago.

For as long as the nation continues to go mad, purging books, movies, statues and history in its own cultural revolution launched by woke elites, The Federalist will be chronicling its destruction, updating this list with each new event in its collapse. The Federalist will also be keeping tally of those fired from lack of allegiance to the new woke overlords found here.

Immigrant-Owned Louisville Restaurant Gets Demands Letter From BLM To Improve Diversity

An immigrant-owned business in Louisville, Ky., saw protestors gather in support of the restaurant in early August after a Black Lives Matter group sent them a letter with a list of demands that included filling at least 23 percent of positions with black employees and ensuring at least 23 percent of inventory came from black retailers while providing diversity training at least twice a year.

According to the Courier-Journal, demonstrators told the restaurant owner Fernando Martinez that he “better put [the list of demands] on the door so your business is not f–d with.”

“How can I be called a bigot and a racist when my family is black? When my son is gay?” Martinez said to a crowd of supportive protestors. “I’m the proud father of a gay son, and I’m gonna fight for him against anybody.”

In an attempt to discredit President Trump’s patriotic parlance at a pillar of American pride near the peak of Mount Rushmore, CNN’s political editor-at-large, Chris Cillizza went line-by-line of the address and titled his piece, “The 28 most outrageous lines from Donald Trump’s Mount Rushmore speech.”

Among the lines Cillizza took issue with, was of Trump pledging to protect the iconic monument.

“I am here as your President to proclaim before the country and before the world, this monument will never be desecrated,” Trump said.

“Uh, was there some sort of movement to tear down Mount Rushmore I was unaware of or…?”

In fact, monuments to the four presidents enshrined on the mountain have been desecrated or destroyed across the country, and 44 percent of self-identifying liberals have voiced support for blowing up the mountain, an idea seemingly embraced by the Democratic Party.

Trump Gives Patriotic Speech Sending Media Into Rage

President Trump’s unapologetically patriotic speech delivered at the base of Mount Rushmore on the eve of Independence Day drew the ire of legacy media publishing left-wing opinion pieces covering the address and advertising them as straight news.

“President Trump delivered a dark and divisive speech at Mount Rushmore, leaning into the culture wars and barely mentioning the pandemic,” the New York Times pushed out in a breaking news update moments after the prime time address.

The usual culprits joined the dishonest fray featuring the Washington Post charging Trump with exploiting social divisions and ABC News doing the same.

Boeing Executive Cancelled For Decades Old Op-Ed

Boeing’s now former Communications Chief Niel Golightly was cancelled in July and resigned after an employee filed a complaint over a 1987 article opposing women serving in military combat.

“My article was a 29-year-old Cold War navy pilot’s misguided contribution to a debate that was live at the time,” said Golightly in a statement. “The dialogues that followed its publication 33 years ago quickly opened my eyes, indelibly changed my mind, and shaped the principles of fairness, inclusion, respect, and diversity that have guided my professional life since.”

Democratic Party: Independence Day Glorifies White Supremacy

If one had any doubt, the Democratic Party’s endorsement of the idea that celebrating America is akin to glorifying white supremacy proves extremism has gone mainstream.

In a quickly deleted tweet in the week leading up to the Fourth of July, the Democratic Party said President Donald Trump’s plan to attend a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate American independence was “glorifying white supremacy.”

A new Quillette survey released in June reveals 70 percent of self-identifying “liberals” want a complete rewrite of the U.S. Constitution “to a new Americans constitution that better reflects our diversity as a people.”

The same survey found overwhelming majorities, 76 percent of “liberals” and 81 percent of those who identified as “very liberal,” want to “rebalance the art shown in museums across the country until an analysis of content shows that it reflects the demography of the population and perspective of Native people and citizens of color.”

BLM Co-founder: The Goal Is to Oust Trump

“While we’re also going to continue to push and pressure Vice President Joe Biden around his policies and relationship to policing and criminalization, that’s going to be important. But our goal is to get Trump out now,” Cullors said.

Organizations such as the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which is sponsored by a 501(c)(3), are prohibited from conducting campaign activity, according to the IRS.

Google released a statement however, debunking NBC’s reporting that The Federalist had already been demonetized, clarifying that the Silicone Valley tech giant is still threatening to introduce sanctions on the website over third-party content in its comment sections.

Coronavirus Is Woke-Sensitive

On June 1, dozens of public health experts signed an open letter blaming white supremacy on societal illnesses applauding the protesters for combating the true pandemic without regard for the novel Wuhan coronavirus that shut down the nation causing irreparable damage in the process.

“As public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risk for COVID-19 transmission… This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” they wrote.

In other words, protests are fine as long as they remain in the name of social justice. Any other form of expression however, must be banned, for public health that is. Surely that’s a convincing message to the millions of Americans forced down to food pantries because the government deemed their life’s work as non-essential, or to the families unable to say goodbye to loved ones because funerals of more than 10 people were too dangerous.

So it turns out viruses are woke-sensitive. If you are protesting against racism, you won’t get Covid-19 or spread it to others.

Riots Destroy Minority Businesses

The worst of the rioting might be over (hopefully), but the destruction left behind will take years to rebuild. While violent protesters terrorized communities, minority neighborhoods reported bearing the brunt of the damage. Such progress for the advancement of the “oppressed.”

"No, Camden, New Jersey Didn't Eliminate Police. It Increased Them","Proponents of defunding or disbanding police departments are lauding Camden, New Jersey, as a model for the nation. They suggest that the rapid decline in the city’s crime since it disbanded its police department in 2012 proves the merits of their position.

We can discern the truth by analyzing the policies Camden implemented after it disbanded its police department and measuring how well they worked.

It bears noting up front that in spite of the heartening declines in crime rates Camden has achieved since 2012, it remains one of the most dangerous cities in America. Its violent crime rate in 2019 was eight times that of New Jersey’s overall rate of violent crime, the highest rate by far of any city in a state with several high-crime urban centers. Yet this qualifies as progress. Last year marked the lowest-crime year in Camden in decades.

Proudly labeling Camden’s transformation as the result of disbanding its police force would be to tell less than half the story. Rather, Camden reorganized and grew its police force.

Camden Didn’t Exactly ‘Defund the Police’

In 2012, facing spiraling crime rates and fiscal strains stemming in part from its unionized police force, Camden dissolved its force to replace it with a then-nonunionized county police force that, as described in a 2014 Governing exposè, “rehired most of the laid-off cops, along with nearly 100 other officers, but at much lower salaries and with fewer benefits than they had received from the city.” Camden’s “disbanding” can really be thought of as a technical transition from a city to a county police department.

In 2011, amid budget cuts, Camden’s police force had reportedly dwindled to 175 officers, charged with protecting a city of more than 75,000. As few as 12 cops were on patrol at times. Subsequent to the reorganization, Camden had more than 400 officers, providing it one of the highest police presences on a per-capita basis of any large U.S. city.

Camden neither disbanded its police force, nor did it defund it. On the contrary, as Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki recently told Tapinto Camden: “As far as the change that has taken place, the number one difference is resources.”

Indeed, the Camden County Police Department (CCPD) has received ample resources, including tens of millions of dollars per year. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, from the time the CCPD emerged, it received substantially more funds than originally budgeted. Its budget has only grown, today costing more than $68 million per year. By contrast, Paterson, another high-crime New Jersey city with a population nearly double Camden’s, estimates its annual police budget at $45 million.

Camden has used the funding not just to beef up the police force, but to equip it with sophisticated crime-fighting technology. As Matt Taibbi detailed in a December 2013 feature for Rolling Stone, Camden installed a massive surveillance apparatus, replete with more than 100 high-tech cameras covering the entire city, a mobile 30-foot patrol crane, dozens of microphones for identifying gunshot locations to within a few meters and pointing cameras to escape routes, and “Minority Report-style” scanners for reading license plates and generating warnings. Even civilians work as crime analysts to “patrol” the city virtually and direct uniformed officers from a robust command center.

In short, Camden today has more police — including many of its original officers — who operate using pervasive surveillance equipment likely to give civil libertarians pause. Moreover, presumably contrary to the desires of the defunders, the force consists of a significantly smaller percentage of minority police than did its predecessor.

Camden Police Haven’t Been Without Incident

Defunders will likely chafe at the suggestion that the policies chronicled above comport with their vision of policing. They will, however, point positively to Camden’s policy reforms. Camden has embraced the concept of “community policing.” This includes more cops walking the beat and interacting regularly with Camden residents, as well as far more restrictive use-of-force guidelines and de-escalatory training. In recent days, numerous profiles have covered these policing practices favorably. Evidence is thus far inconclusive as to the effectiveness of such policies in reducing crime.

While the city claims its policies have led to a dramatic reduction in complaints, from a state-high 65 in 2012 to three in 2019, the force has been implicated in alleged malfeasance. One particularly gruesome case is now pending against Camden County and several officers over a 2014 arrest that resulted in Xavier Ingram being rendered a quadriplegic.

Police pursued Ingram over suspicion that he had ditched a gun after departing from a group the police believed to be engaged in drug activity. The police chased Ingram, and he fell. In spite of claims that he was not resisting, police subdued him — allegedly with enough force to break his neck. Ingram was charged on gun possession and drug charges, which his lawyers dispute.

Discovery in Ingram’s lawsuit showed that during an 18-month period from 2013-2014, Camden dismissed practically every complaint against the CCPD, including virtually all of the 100-plus use-of-force complaints, while department-issued complaints were regularly sustained.

To be clear, anecdotal examples of alleged abuses of power, including this pending case, and complaint statistics are not dispositive in judging a police department. But the defunders might well do so on this basis, were they aware of such evidence.

Meanwhile, it would seem the city has also embraced policies that might be more aptly described as “broken windows” policing, again likely to the chagrin of defunders. The American Civil Liberties Union has previously criticized the CCPD for increasing enforcement of low-level offenses. The city has also spent millions of dollars razing hundreds of blighted buildings that often served as hubs of criminal activity.

Camden has likely benefited over time from criminal incarceration and the deterrence that follows from improved policing. Camden’s reforms also come against a backdrop of economic growth and improved educational outcomes.

What Do the Statistics Say?

What has happened to Camden’s crime rates since the reorganization of its police department?

It is undeniable that Camden has witnessed a significant reduction in both overall and violent crime between 2013 when the CCPD came on the beat, and 2019. A CCPD-provided crime report obtained by the author shows that during this period, Camden experienced a 38 percent drop in overall crime and a 40 percent drop in violent crime.

These numbers, on their face, are significant. But with such data, we must always ask, “Compared to what?” To evaluate the strides made by the CCPD, one must weigh its change in crime rates against those of the state in which it is situated, and cities similarly riddled with crime.

To make these comparisons, the author conducted a preliminary analysis based on New Jersey’s uniform crime reports, which are consistent with the numbers reported in the FBI uniform crime reports, but differ slightly from the CCPD’s (this may have occurred due to the CCPD’s reclassification of crimes and other factors).

Since New Jersey published only quarterly data for 2019 and the FBI has not published corresponding final data for that year, and because Camden’s greatest decline in crime since the reorganization of its police unit in 2013 occurred during 2018, it is most appropriate to look at 2013-2018 crime rates 1) statewide, 2) for Camden, and 3) among the five other cities New Jersey has historically classified as its “major urban” centers: Elizabeth, Jersey City, Newark, Paterson, and Trenton. These have typically been among the highest-crime areas in the state.

What are the findings? Between 2013 and 2018, New Jersey experienced a 25 percent reduction in overall crime and a 27 percent drop in violent crime. Camden experienced a 32 percent reduction in overall crime and 35 percent drop in violent crime.

Beating the state average is a good start. But was Camden the best performer of its peer group? No.

Newark experienced a 45 percent reduction in both overall crime and violent crime during this period. Interestingly, there has been no such clamoring for police across the nation to emulate the Newark Police Department. So too, Paterson and Jersey City each experienced declines in violent crime within 4 percent of Camden’s, albeit with smaller reductions in overall crime.

While the defunders are squarely focused on the CCPD’s performance post-2012, it is also clarifying to look at crime statistics over a longer period. Between 2000 and 2018, New Jersey experienced a 48 percent reduction in overall crime and a 44 percent reduction in violent crime. Camden’s overall crime rate fell by 43 percent and its violent crime rate by only 22 percent. That is, it lagged behind the rest of the state’s improvements, particularly regarding violent crime. It also lagged behind several of its peers. Newark, Jersey City, and Trenton all experienced greater reductions than Camden in both overall and violent crime during this period.

Don’t Jump to Conclusions

Two points ought to be made here. First, New Jersey in general and its cities in particular have followed the overall national trend of declining violent crime that we have been blessed to enjoy in America at a pronounced rate since the 1990s. This trend was the result of policies that defunders seem willing to toss out overnight, irrespective of their benefits to societal peace and prosperity.

Second, Camden’s more recent gains may reflect a catching up of sorts to its peers, though again, the relatively superior performance of Newark is striking. No two cities are alike, and we ought to be careful in drawing conclusions over relatively short time periods. But those heralding Camden’s policies as a panacea ought to consider the full context.

A prudent analysis must factor in not just the disbanding of the department, or its shift to community policing, but the increasing number of cops on the streets, the equipping of the police force with better tools, the residual effects of removing violent criminals from the streets over time, the potential deterrent effect of its superior police force, economic growth, and educational improvements, to name just a few factors. It must also consider crime reductions on a relative basis to determine if Camden has found the “secret sauce” of policing.

After conducting such an analysis, to the extent it holds true that Camden has implemented reforms that have uniquely reduced crime, its policies should be adopted wholeheartedly. But we should be skeptical of claims not grounded in rigorous analysis, particularly in the throes of tumult.

Maybe It’s Time To Privatize The Police,"On Wednesday Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe was formally charge with felony murder in the killing of Rayshard Brooks. While evading arrest after having assaulted Rolfe and his partner, Brooks points a Taser at Rolfe and fires. At that point, and exactly that point Rolfe takes out his gun and shoots. If this act of self-defense by a cop is felony murder, then we need to take a hard look at what the police are in today’s American society and what we wish them to be.

Traditionally the badge gives law enforcement officers wider latitude than it gives a regular citizen in using violence to prevent crime and physical harm. We offer this wider latitude because when police use violence they do so on behalf of society, not in furtherance of their own individual interests. We understand that the chaotic nature of crime will inevitably put police in untenable situations and since most of us don’t want to deal with crime ourselves, we offer legal support, as well as good pay and benefits to those willing to do the job for us.

But in the case of Rolfe, the Atlanta District Attorney Paul Howard does not appear to give the police officer any wider latitude based on his job, much the opposite in fact. The DA has almost nothing to say about the fact that Brooks resisted arrest, attacked police, stole a weapon and fired it at them. At one point Howard referred to Brooks’ behavior as “jovial.” The message is that Brooks’ actions were irrelevant to the situation. Rolfe should have been counting Taser shots and known in those split seconds that the person firing a weapon at him actually posed no threat.

If this is the new standard, if we are not going to give police wider latitude, if we are going to strip them of qualified immunity, then we are basically treating them like anyone else with a gun. That being the case it makes more sense for us to consider the privatization of the police than to pretend they are officers of the government with special protections. If we demand that police enter dangerous situations but tell them if something goes wrong its all on them, not on the society they serve, then police are in an impossible position.

Privatizing the police force would solve this problem. And for many progressives it also has the advantage of being the inevitable outcome of their goal to abolish police. Communities could simply hire private police who are subject to the same laws as anyone else. They also could not be required to enter dangerous situations so there would be no reason for them to have special legal protections.

The downside to this plan of course is that poor communities might just go un-policed, but then again that would end police brutality in those areas. But the big upside is that we could finally hold those who enforce the law fully accountable. We would no longer be forcing cops to put their lives on the line for us and therefore we would have no responsibility to grant them any legal protections.

Instead of policing being an oppressive tool of the state, it would be a matter for individuals and communities to deal with themselves. Without special rules and protections private police will be more likely to simply ignore crime than get involved in violent complicated situations that could end badly.

The system of policing we have used until now has worked, it has reduced violent crime, it has kept most of our communities safe, but inherent to that system is that police officers are a unique and protected class of individuals when violence occurs. Taking away those protections breaks an essential social contract with police. Once that contract is broken we have no right to compel them to enter dangerous situations.

The fact of the matter is that most of the plans put forward from abolishing, defunding, to reforming the police involving stripping away protections for them, and undermining their ability to be protected by their union leadership. Fine. But if being a cop is no different than being anyone else with a gun then like anyone else with a gun police should be free to decline to intervene in dangerous situations.

I don’t like the idea of armies of George Zimmermans in the employ of gated communities keeping the peace. I would prefer to keep the traditional system in which policing is a function of the state that confers on the police protections and immunities. But asking the police to do that job without such protections and immunities leaves them in a no-win position. If that is where this is going, then we are better off with private police forces that can decide for themselves when the danger is worth it.

Celebs Call To Abolish The Police While Hiding Behind Private Security,"The Black Lives Matter movement seeks to counter the systemic racism they believe is foundational in American culture with a systemic solution: defunding the police. The calls to defund the police have reached the ears of every elected official, from local levels up to the federal executive. Now, the cries from the street are being echoed by celebrities.

A group of some of the most notable black artists in America have penned a letter to studios and Hollywood executives demanding the entertainment industry divest from police. But the experience of the wealthy in the absence of police will be far different than that of the average BLM protester.

While many on the left have said that defunding the police does not mean disbanding them entirely, many others have said that abolishing the police force is exactly what they have in mind. A public letter from black artists and thinkers states they are inspired by the protesters, and want to amplify their demands:

[The protesters’s] courage and imagination have inspired us to build on their necessary demands — including, chiefly, the abolition of police, and the complete dismantling of the racist prison-industrial system. Through this statement, we hope to amplify the movement’s work and to call out our own industries for what they are: institutions that promote colonialism, capitalism, and racism, and that function in exploitative and destructive ways.

In echoing the protester’s demands, these celebs claim themselves and their industry as part of the “systemic” alleged problems. Instead of using the clout and platform that accompanies celebrity status to offer leadership or guidance to those marching in the streets, they first offer to dismantle their own workplaces. The letter calls on cultural institutions to act:

…publicly condemn the use of police as a violent force that exists to further class divisions and capitalistic exploitation which harm our communities. Museums, arts foundations, theaters, studios, events venues, festivals, universities, libraries, book stores, publishing houses, schools, and social media companies must break contracts with police departments and reconceive what it means to keep art, audiences, and patrons safe. This is a first and clear step that cultural institutions must take toward the broader call to defund the police nationwide.

This level of self-obsession is so typical of members of the celebrity class. But what would this mean in terms of actionable, real consequences? If there were no police, or a force that had been cut in half or more, what would this look like?

Speaking to The Daily, John Eligan relays his conversation with a Black Lives Matter activist who details her take on what the abolishing of police would be like in practice. “It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need,” she tells Eligan, “We can’t decide that.”

Theoretically, money would be diverted from police departments to community-based programs, where people would decide for their communities what they need. At a studio level or the level of cultural institutions across the board, those organizations and businesses would decide what they need for security.

Many options are not police-based. Facial recognition software could be used to require all visitors, artists, and executives to be vetted via criminal background checks to ensure criminals aren’t coming on set. If everyone could be fingerprinted, these fingerprints could be used to gain entry to these unpoliced spaces. Of course, studios could also hire private security companies for protection.

But while it’s one thing to attempt such reforms at the institutional level where people can consent to give up their privacy or employ cops-for-hire so these spaces stay safe, what about in entire metropolises?

Celebs Can Go Without Police — Regular Americans Can’t

Instead of police responding to homelessness, “homelessness outreach personnel” would respond. Instead of police responding to late-night domestic disputes, social workers would pull up in their Subarus ready to make a new case file. Instead of police responding to violent crime, members of the community would respond in whatever way their neighborhood group saw fit. Instead of police investigating homicides or organized crime, something else would happen — or not. According to the “Defund The Police” activists, police don’t do a great job anyway, so they wouldn’t be missed.

In his interview with the BLM activist, Elgin brought up that, while they were different and distinct cases, self-deputized members of the community took matters into their own hands to end the lives of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery. Her response was, “I know, I get that, and I’ll be really real with you. I don’t have all the answers for that either, I don’t, and I wish I did.”

The celebs who penned this letter don’t have concrete answers either. What they demand and present are platitudes: “to break ties with the police…put their money where their mouths are…advocate for black people…get educated…[and] imagine black freedom.”

If cultural institutions stopped working with the police, they would hire private security companies to do the work instead. Private security companies are not beholden to anything or anyone other than their clients. Celebs who already have bodyguards or security details would be able to retain those services as well. While celebs would be safe and snug behind their walls of wealth, communities across the country would be left vulnerable to dangerous criminals.

When the wealthy call for defunding police, they are speaking from a place of privilege in society that means they can have little to no regard for those who are most affected by the decline in the enforcement of criminal laws.

Calls to ‘Abolish the Police’ Are Wildly Utopian

The narrative against police that tells us crime is a direct result of social inequity, and that should social inequity be destroyed crime would not exist, is driving this conversation that our nation does not need police. But it is a lie.

There is this idea that if there were no police, if that money were redirected at vulnerable communities, there would be no crime in these areas. The claim is that in the absence of systemic problems, there would be no reason for people to commit crimes. Despair and economic injustice leads to crime, goes the claim. A group called MPD150, which advocates for abolishing police in Minneapolis, states:

Crime isn’t random. Most of the time, it happens when someone has been unable to meet their basic needs through other means. So to really ‘fight crime,’ we don’t need more cops’ we need more jobs, more education, opportunities, more arts programs, more community centers, more mental health resources, and more of a say in how communities function.

This concept is not rational or reasoned. It is the eternal attempt of human beings striving for a utopia, a paradise on earth, a perfect commune where everyone has what he needs and wants for no more. It isn’t reality. Material gain does not eliminate the human drive for more; often, it accelerates it.

The black artists and celebrities of “Black Artists for Freedom” have not chosen to display leadership. Instead, they are seeking a way to remain safe within the industry that butters their bread. A group of people requesting the abolition of something they don’t even need is disingenuous at best, and callous at worst.

Every time police lessen their presence in the vulnerable communities of New York, Minneapolis, Seattle, or elsewhere, more death always comes for the downtrodden. In turn, the result is more violence and less accountability for both criminals and police.

In giving their voices to the mob, these artists have done little for liberation. Instead, all they’ve done is provided cover to those who would violate the very communities they claim a desire to protect.

NASCAR: Driver’s ‘Hate Crime Noose’ Was Really A Garage Pull Rope,"Separate FBI and NASCAR investigations found what some claimed was a “noose” in NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace’s garage at Talladega Superspeedway was instead a pull rope for a garage door that had been there since 2019.

A joint statement from U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town and FBI Special Agent Johnnie Sharp, Jr., says a federal investigation found no federal crime was committed. The rope was determined to be there randomly. Fifteen FBI agents spent numerous hours investigating this allegation of a hate crime launched by NASCAR.

NASCAR announced in a Monday morning conference call that some of the members of team 43 found what they perceived to be a noose Sunday afternoon, and they called on the FBI for an investigation.

The pull rope was hanging inside Wallace’s garage. Wallace, the only black member of team 43, stirred up controversy and negative reaction from many of the sport’s fans earlier this month when he called for NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag from its properties earlier this month, which it did on June 10.

Wallace didn’t discover the “noose” for himself but was informed of its presence by NASCAR officials.

Before the end of the investigation, many expressed their criticism on Twitter, claiming the reporting of the noose was falsified or staged. Wallace responded to critics Tuesday morning on “The View” in a discussion of the event.

“People are entitled to their own opinion to make them feel good or help them sleep at night,” he said, adding, “Simple-minded people like that, the ones who are afraid of change, they use everything in their power to defend what they stand for.”

Bubba was assigned to use garage no. 4, where the rope was found, only in the last week. The rope has been in the garage since as early as October 2019, according to confirmed NASCAR footage.

“Although the noose is now known to have been in garage number 4 in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage no. 4 last week,” the FBI statement says.

Also, the item wasn’t a noose at all, but a garage pull rope, according to an independent NASCAR statement: “The FBI report concludes, and photographic evidence confirms, that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/23/nascar-drivers-hate-crime-noose-was-really-a-garage-pull-rope/,2020-06-23
"No, The U.S. Shouldn’t Disarm Police Like In The U.K.","Oh, to be in England, where the bobbies patrol without guns, and peace and harmony rule. That’s the idea peddled by The Nation’s D.D. Guttenplan, who calls for not only defunding but also disarming the police.

In one sense, you can’t deny the logic of his argument. If you reduce the number of police through defunding and then take away their guns, there are sure to be fewer police-involved shootings. But defunding and disarming police would also give you more of some things, not the least of them being more violent crime.

Calls to disarm the police ignore this, just as they ignore the fact that police shootings have declined dramatically over the last 50 years. As Manhattan Institute scholar Rafael A. Mangual recently noted in the Wall Street Journal: “In 1971 the New York City Police Department reported 810 firearms discharges by officers, which wounded 220 people and killed 93. In 2016 those numbers were down to 72 shootings, 23 wounded and nine killed.”

Mangual also cited a 2018 study analyzing more than 100,000 arrests. More than 99 percent of those arrests were made without the use of physical force, and when force was used, 98 percent of the suspects sustained only mild or no injury.

It is safe to say that many of those arrested would have been far more tempted to use physical force to resist arrest, had the arresting officers not been armed. The mere presence of police firearms can be a powerful deterrent to violence.

Calls to adopt “the British model” ignore another salient fact: We don’t live in Great Britain. The U.K. does not recognize a right to keep and bear arms—a right that existed in our country even before it was enshrined in the Second Amendment in 1789—and has spent the last century systematically disarming its civilian population. Today, fewer than 4 percent of the British population own any sort of firearm.

America is far different. More than 40 percent of our citizens live in a household with guns. Indeed, there are more firearms in America than there are Americans. Millions of them are on the streets illegally, and not all of them are in the hands of good guys.

With remarkably few exceptions, the police are the good guys. And it’s a good thing they are armed. The ability of armed law enforcement to respond quickly to violent threats has saved countless lives.

Consider last year’s shooting in a crowded section of downtown Dayton, Ohio, when local police neutralized the shooter less than 30 seconds after he fired the first shot. Or the earlier mass murder in Gilroy, California, in which armed police brought down the shooter in about a minute. Those two incidents alone claimed 12 innocent lives. How many more would have been lost had the police been armed with only billy clubs, Tasers, and whistles?

To ask police to do their jobs in extremely dangerous environments without adequate means of protection defies logic. Even in idyllic England, they recognize the need to increase police firepower consistent with increased risk. Thus, in the aftermath of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, London equipped more of its officers with guns. As violent crime has risen, the city continues to boost the number and response capabilities of its armed police.

It’s a false idea that disarming the police would usher in an era of non-violent conflict resolution in which nobody gets hurt and everyone gets along. That’s not the real world. In the real world, there are criminals committing serious crimes. They are an active and powerful force, and police departments were created specifically to counter that force. Defunding and disarming the police would only cede ground to mayhem and chaos.

What would be the real-world consequence of doing that? Christopher F. Rufo describes it this way: “In the subsequent vacuum of physical power, wealthy neighborhoods would deploy private police forces, and poor neighborhoods would organize around criminal gangs — deepening structural inequalities and harming the very people that the police abolitionists say they want to help.”

In short, the body count would rise, and majority-minority communities, where most violent crime occurs, would suffer the most. Moreover, if fewer police officers carried firearms, the number of citizens purchasing guns to protect themselves and their loved ones would undoubtedly increase dramatically.

Yes, there are ways we can reduce the number of police-involved shootings. De-escalation training, for example, has routinely proved effective in this regard, as has increased training using realistic shoot-or-don’t-shoot simulators. We should do more of these. We also favor greater transparency and accountability to weed out bad cops, and providing incentives to help recruit high-quality candidates willing to serve and protect.

But at the end of the day, we live in a sinful world, one in which an effective and adequately armed police force is necessary to keep the forces of death and destruction at bay. We’ve seen what happens when local officials effectively suspend the rule of law by neutering their police forces. Riots. Arson. Looting. Murder.

Although violent crime rates have dropped over the last two decades, we still believe, regrettably, that we have not entered the Age of Aquarius and that Thomas Hobbes’s vision that in the state of nature, people would live in “continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” is closer to the mark.

Society disintegrates quickly without the rule of law. And a heavily armed nation needs well-armed, well-funded, and well-trained police officers to assure the safety of its citizens and to serve justice.

Shootings And Killings Surge In Democrat-Run Cities Across the Country,"Last week, The Federalist reported on early signs of a coming violent crime wave in Atlanta, Georgia. “You ain’t seen nothing yet,” a resident stated following a murder near his home. It’s becoming clear now how predictive his statement was.

On Monday evening, Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Atlanta. A thousand National Guardsmen were deployed to quell surging violent crime across the state’s capital. The events followed the death of an eight-year-old girl in just one of 75 separate shootings across the city over the last few weeks.

“You can’t blame this on a police officer; you can’t say this is about criminal justice reform,” the city’s Democrat mayor said Sunday night. “This is about some people carrying some weapons who shot up a car with an 8-year-old baby. We are doing each other more harm than any police officer on this force.”

She, like many other Democratic city leaders across the country, had in the past weeks criticized the city’s law enforcement and stated her support for “reallocating” police spending.

Happening Across the Country

Since June, shootings and murders have surged across many of the country’s major cities. Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Nashville, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and New Orleans have all seen murders jump over 20 percent this year. The violence is heavily concentrated in the last few months, ever since protests have led to nationwide pressure on politicians to “defund” and “reimagine” policing.

Just as concerning is that these stats do not include data from the end of June and July. Data from New York and Chicago, recent data from which we do have, tells that the last few weeks have seen by far the worst of the violence. Murders and shootings in the Windy City are up about 80 percent, and New York has averaged at a 209 percent over these last weeks compared to the same times last year. It’s likely these disturbing numbers for the cities above only captures a fragment of the lives lost during unrest in which many protesters chant “Black Lives Matter.”

It’s also worth noting that Atlanta appeared to lack this crime spike just a few weeks ago, according to the statistics released above. If it serves as a bellwether, then the cities that already had a surge at the time of recording are in deep water. The scale will likely become apparent over the next few weeks.

Every one of the cities above has both a Democrat mayor and Democrat-controlled city council.

Hard Questions for Democrats

The surge in violence has drawn attention from Republican leaders. “Violence and death, which are disproportionately harming young African Americans, are tragic and unacceptable, particularly on such a shocking scale,” the White House recently stated in a letter addressed to Chicago leadership. “You continue to put your own political interests ahead of the lives, safety, and fortunes of your own citizens. The people of Chicago deserve better.”

Republican-led cities, such as Jacksonville and San Diego, have not had equivalent surges, according to the data above. As awareness spreads of the scale of the problem, it’s unlikely these criticisms will disappear. In a critical election year, this could pose a problem for Democrats making a case for left-wing policing and other policies.

The surge also raises questions about the role of existing reforms in causing the violence. Of the eight cities with the worst surges listed above, Minneapolis‘s leadership has pledged to abolish the city’s police department, while Philadelphia and New York have already cut money from law enforcement under pressure from activists. All have voiced criticism of police departments. While police chiefs in both Chicago and New York have begged city leaders to grant them greater latitude to deal with the surge, city leaders have instead taken the politically expedient route of keeping policing limited.

Combined with a public willing to attack officers making arrests, it’ll surprise few to learn that record numbers of police are abandoning their line of work, straining cut resources even further. Having more officers on the street is widely recognized to reduce crime of all stripes, and the inverse is true as well. With blue cities’ law enforcement spread thin, restrained, and lambasted by soundbite attacks, it will be difficult for politicians to dispute the link between their policies and results on the streets.

No major Democrat politician has yet come forward to address the connection.

"No, ‘Gun Violence’ Is Not To Blame For The Spike In Violent Crime","With violent crime skyrocketing in American cities, local officials and mediahave blamed the deaths of innocent children and mostly African-American victims on “gun violence,” a term that obfuscates who is responsible for these tragic crimes.

The term “gun violence” has long been used by gun control groups, politicians, and the media to refer to the criminal misuse of firearms, in an attempt to pin the violence on guns themselves, not criminals, despite the fact that a gun is an inanimate object incapable of violence on its own.

After New York City saw more than 300 people, all minorities, shot since the start of June, the New York Police Department’s Chief of the Community Affairs Bureau Jeffrey Maddrey said “gun violence” was the common enemy of communities and cops.

After a six-year-old African-American boy was shot and killed in San Fransisco while watching fireworks on July Fourth, local media said the mayor decried “gun violence.”

A CNN headline read, “At least 6 children were killed by gun violence across the nation this holiday weekend.”

In a PBS NewsHour report titled, “What’s behind a recent surge in U.S. gun violence — and how to stop it,” one panelist concluded the problem is “the underlying police violence,” saying he believes “there is actually a connection between police violence and community violence.”

Since June 20, nine children under the age of 18 have been shot dead in Chicago, a city that touts some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Similar stories have emerged out of Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., where the official response is not to address grieving parents asking why black lives don’t matter regarding black-on-black crime, but to instead call for more restrictions on guns.

The Washington Post responded to the recent crimes in their city by publishing an op-ed calling black-on-black crime a “fallacy,” and concluding by blaming “lawmakers’ blind devotion to the NRA.” Nevermind the fact that more homicides are committed every year with knives and blunt objects than are committed with firearms.

Larry Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said there have never been more firearms lawfully owned by Americans, and until very recently, we have seen crime rates plummet. “In reality, when law-abiding citizens own firearms, crime goes down, not up,” he told The Federalist. “What we have here are criminals engaging in criminal activity, illegally possessing firearms, and misusing them to commit their crimes.”

Of course the recent spike in crime is related to a number of complicated and intertwined factors like coronavirus, an economic collapse, the defunding of local police departments, and mayors allowing chaos and anarchy in cities like Seattle. But that has not stopped the gun control lobby’s friends in the media and the Democrat Party from blaming “gun violence” for all of the above.

As for the gun industry and the Second Amendment, all of the above has never made them safer.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/09/no-gun-violence-is-not-to-blame-for-the-spike-in-violent-crime/,2020-07-09
How Selective Reporting Hides The Truth About Race And Crime,"On Saturday, a man drove his car onto a Seattle freeway that had been closed by a Black Lives Matter crowd. The driver killed one person and seriously injured another after going the wrong way up a ramp and then around a barricade. Reports noted that police “don’t believe impairment was a factor.” Over the weekend, news outlets replayed the brutal hit, but there’s one thing you won’t learn from their coverage: The driver was black and his victims were white.

NPR linked this attack to other car-ramming incidents by “right-wing extremists targeting Black Lives Matter protesters.” They quote a researcher about how these right-wingers were “trying to intimidate the most recent wave of BLM protesters, to stop their movement.”

The driver was a Seattle local named Dawit Kelete. But you’ll find scant mention of the driver’s ethnicity in mainstream media coverage. You might have more easily learned that Kelete was black by going to the Australia Broadcasting Corporation. The American national media also doesn’t note that Kelete’s two victims were white. You can find that out over at the U.K.’s Daily Mail.

Among the few U.S. outlets to mention the race of the driver is Heavy.com. The rest of the news media seemingly would rather have people assume that a white driver attacked two black protesters. Acknowledging the driver’s and victims’ ethnicity wouldn’t advance their narrative of oppression, so it apparently isn’t newsworthy.

One case doesn’t prove a pattern. It could just be that while the American media knows almost everything about this killer, including his name, age, and where he lives, they couldn’t find information on his race. Possibly the foreign news outlets were just lucky to discover that information.

Of course, the media outlets might honestly not view race as essential to the story. But their selective reporting of it shows that they think race is important when it involves certain situations. The problem is that this gives readers a biased perspective, inflaming prejudice, and creating stereotypes.

Research conducted by the Crime Prevention Research Center, of which I am president, on all police shootings from 2013 to 2015 found that while local news coverage will often mention the race of the officer and the suspect, the national coverage is much more selective. While the evidence indicates that black officers are no less likely to shoot suspects than white officers, local news coverage of black officers shooting black suspects gets picked up by the national news in just 9 percent of cases. By contrast, 38 percent of the cases in which local news reported on a white officer shooting a black suspect get national coverage.

The selective coverage creates the belief that white officers are the problem — they are the ones shooting blacks, presumably because white officers treat black suspects differently than white ones. Watching the news, you would never guess that the research found that black officers were just as likely as white officers to shoot an unarmed black suspect.

The media’s selective coverage has done real harm. It has heightened racial divides and sown distrust of the police in the communities that need them most. Now, with police sidelined and facing “defunding,” gun violence is rising fast in major cities around the country.

The media similarly seems intent on claiming that mass public shooters are disproportionately white and right-wing when nothing could be further from the truth. While 58 percent of the mass public shooters from 1998 to 2019 were white (excluding people of Middle Eastern descent), about 75 percent of the total U.S. population was white. Middle Eastern Arabs made up just 1 percent of the population but accounted for 8 percent of shooters. Of all the mass killers, 72 percent have no known political affiliation or views — only 3 percent are known to be conservative or Republican.

Race and politics increasingly divide Americans, and selective media reporting is largely to blame. The media, not Trump, is fanning the flames of violence. The destruction and the long-term harm that is being done to heavily minority parts of our cities is their responsibility.

AOC’s Marxist Take On Gotham’s Crime Spike Is Dangerous And Naïve,"One of the things to admire about Marxists is their stubbornness. Since the publication of the Communist Manifesto in 1848, these class struggle warriors have claimed that crime is merely a reflection of economic inequality. True to her Marxist roots, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) blames lockdown-related poverty for the striking surge in crime, especially the shootings and murders ravaging New York City.

AOC had this to say about the uptick in violence: “Maybe this has to do with the fact that people aren’t paying their rent & are scared to pay their rent & so they go out & they need to feed their child & they don’t have money so… they feel like they either need to shoplift some bread or go hungry.”

AOC on increased NYC crime: ""Maybe this has to do with the fact that people aren't paying their rent & are scared to pay their rent & so they go out & they need to feed their child & they don't have money so… they feel like they either need to shoplift some bread or go hungry."" pic.twitter.com/oHSTWWJZ6a — The Hill (@thehill) July 12, 2020

That was on Thursday. Fast forward to Sunday night. In Brooklyn’s Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood after 11 p.m., men got out of a car and began spraying bullets into a BBQ held near a housing project. A one-year-old child was shot and killed. No loaf of bread or case of baby formula was stolen. This was not a righteous crime attacking up the racist food chain. This was the evil taking of a child’s life.

But for AOC, this kind of crime does not exist. If not for the horrible systems of racist oppression, she implies, this crime would never have occurred. This even though plenty of white people who are supposedly beneficiaries of our systems of oppression also commit horrible violent crimes. But perhaps those white people also are victims of some capitalist conspiracy she will get to the bottom of, like the Scooby Doo gang.

If you want to know why criminals are now running around New York City carrying guns, shooting children, and generally doing whatever they please, look no further than this video. This shows exactly what has happened to our police department under leaders like AOC and Mayor Bill de Blasio.

.@NYCMayor @BilldeBlasio @NYCCouncil @NYCSpeakerCoJo are endangering the lives of every New York City Police Officer, and the new limits on the physical restraints are also going to lead to a quicker escalation of deadly force. @NYGovCuomo DO SOMETHING! .pic.twitter.com/re1KsZi9O6 — Bernard B. Kerik (@BernardKerik) July 11, 2020

What we see in this video is vitally important because several things are wrong here. First of all, the officers clearly appear to feel limited in what they can do to restrain the suspect. This means the suspect successfully fights off the officers, creating chaos. This leads to another individual assaulting an officer. At that point, anything could have happened.

There is a secondary message here. These assailants clearly had not the slightest fear of the police. They attacked them with impunity, cheered on by the guy shooting the video. This is exactly the attitude that has led to New York City’s criminal class returning to the streets with a vengeance. And it is an attitude too many Democrats have sympathy for.

That’s what is really happening in New York City right now. The problem isn’t scared dads who are shoplifting food, although that is probably happening too since Democrats won’t let anyone go to freakin’ work. But it’s not why people are being killed. People are being killed because de Blasio and his allies like AOC have basically stood down the greatest police department on earth.

I don’t like to accuse politicians of having blood on their hands. Politics is a job of choices, often between competing bad options. But in this case, as shootings surge in New York City, the progressives calling the shots need to call a time out and restore order. At a certain point, these lives being lost become their fault.

"On Reservations, Supreme Court Reminds Congress To Keep Its Promises","“On the far end of the Trail of Tears was a promise.”

Playwrights, novelists, and screenwriters spend entire careers without penning an opening line of such weight and power. Yet this sentence isn’t the epigraph for a new book, nor the first screen for a new HBO miniseries — it’s the start of one of the most well-reasoned and poignant Supreme Court rulings in recent memory.

On the last day of announced decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020, as most of the political world waited for rulings on President Trump’s tax returns, history was made elsewhere. In a 5-4 decision, the court declared in McGirt v. Oklahoma that a vast portion of Oklahoma is Indian country for the purposes of the Major Crimes Act. The ruling, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, affirms several cardinal precepts of the American republic: that we are to be governed by laws, not men; that promises should be honored, and that might must never be allowed to triumph over right.

The role of a Supreme Court justice is not to craft legislation or to engineer desired outcomes. Members of the judicial branch serve to see that the U.S. Constitution is properly followed as the supreme law of the land. Its members unelected and appointed for life, the Supreme Court is the ultimate referee, the most prominent umpire separating necessary and proper government actions from those that go beyond conferred constitutional powers or infringe upon the natural rights innate to every American.

When the court sticks to its appropriate responsibilities, much of its business is staid, unglamorous, and rarely inspiring. Yet there are moments, few as they may be, when in the course of interpreting the constitutionality of laws the court can do something profound in the process. McGirt is one of those all-too-rare occasions.

Holding Government to Its Word

McGirt v. Oklahoma entered the docket of the court when Jimcy McGirt, a convicted sex criminal and American Indian, argued the state of Oklahoma was wrong to prosecute him within historical Creek Nation territory. McGirt argued that, as mandated by the Major Crimes Act, crimes involving an American Indian victim or perpetrator within recognized reservation boundaries fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction.

The legal question involved in the case was never the guilt of Jimcy McGirt, undisputed by both sides, but whether the land granted to the Creek Nation holds — and should have always been viewed as retaining — its status as “Indian country.”

The dissenters, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, say decades of congressional and demographic intrusions into eastern Oklahoma sufficiently demonstrate the intent of Congress to disestablish the reservation. Yet, as the U.S. Congress never adopted any single statute that explicitly disestablished or terminated the promised reservation status, the majority of the Supreme Court ruled that 19 million acres of eastern Oklahoma is Indian country for the purposes of criminal prosecutions involving American Indian defendants or victims.

Oklahoma’s ascension to statehood did not erase pre-established reservation land. Indeed, the text of the Major Crimes Act assumes that Indian country may exist within states. Additionally, official reports by the U.S. Department of the Interior labeled the eastern half of Oklahoma a reservation well past the time Oklahoma joined the Union.

Justice Gorsuch puts the matter succinctly: “Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.”

Like all cases of such importance, it’s crucial to read McGirt carefully and in its entirety. There’s a great deal of difference between 27,000 words and headlines or Twitter posts limited to 280 characters, that, needless to say, can fail to accurately capture the full truth.

Non-Indian residents of eastern Oklahoma are not affected by McGirt, which simply shifts the responsibility of major crimes prosecutions committed by American Indians in Oklahoma’s Indian country from the state to the federal government. The decision also doesn’t change land ownership. Private property is not touched, just as I own the property where my house rests and not my state.

Furthermore, Michael McBride, a tribal law specialist from Oklahoma City, does not expect McGirt to be released from prison, believing he will likely be retried with charges brought against him at the federal level.

Justice Remains the End of Government

McGirt should not be read as a newly opened door to reparations for all of America’s real or perceived past sins. Regardless of what should have happened, the U.S. government never promised reparations to freed black slaves or their descendants.

It did, however, promise land west of the Mississippi “shall be solemnly guaranteed to the Creek Indians” as well as a “permanent home to the whole Creek nation” through treaties ratified in 1832 and 1833. Then, as the court explains, in another treaty ratified in 1866, “Congress explicitly restated its commitment that the remaining land would ‘be forever set apart as a home for said Creek Nation.’”

Neither the U.S. government nor conservativism writ large should be in the business of advocating the violation of treaties. As James Madison writes in Federalist No. 51, “Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit.” As a fulfillment of justice in giving to those what they have been promised, agreements like the treaties in question, written to last in perpetuity, should be honored.

Conversely, the Constitution does grant Congress the power to fully, explicitly, and brazenly break treaties with Indians in full public view if they so desire and if they have the stomach for it. As the court acknowledged in Solem v. Bartlett, “only Congress can divest a reservation of its land and diminish its boundaries.” Yet what was perpetrated in the tragic case of American Indians of eastern Oklahoma was an assumption that three generations of legal negligence accomplished what Congress could never bring itself to do officially: scheming Indian territory out of existence.

What happened over nearly 90 years wasn’t the case of a small town collectively ignoring a local ordinance prohibiting jaywalking. This was the prolonged and unjust flouting of laws passed by the U.S. Congress and bearing the signature of the president.

Congress Can’t Delegate the Court To Do Its Job

If a sound judicial reading using either an original public meaning or textualist legal interpretation leads to a decision that many find unsatisfactory, then, the root cause to be addressed is always the law itself — at which point the U.S. Congress can either write new legislation or be content with a certain level of public displeasure.

Justices have no constitutional authority to assume the powers of the legislative branch when Congress is too cowardly, feeble, or inept to do its job. Congress can explicitly and properly disestablish any Indian country or reservations it so chooses. Until then, the treaties mentioned in McGirt were officially signed and codified into law, and remain in force despite years of embarrassing hand-wringing and willful blindness.

The harsh truth of the matter is the state of Oklahoma — aided and abetted by the U.S. Congress — allowed non-American Indians to buy land and settle in territory officially demarcated for the Creek by Congress, without shrinking the borders of the reservation. In effect, Congress enabled the violation of the very treaties it crafted and passed. The fact that settlements grew into towns and cities was the result of Oklahoma choosing to ignore the legal boundaries of the Creek’s Indian territory for nearly a century.

When James Madison acknowledges in Federalist No. 10 that “the public good is often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority,” he was offering advice on how the young American nation should not proceed.

Madison was aware that even republics could devolve into the rule of the strong at the expense of the weak. With the McGirt decision, Justice Gorsuch reaffirms a commitment to heed Madison’s warnings — that America should be a country where all of its people receive the same protection of written laws irrespective of power or influence.

Ideas of Right or Wrong

Alexander Hamilton writes that society itself rests on faithfully keeping promises:

The established rules of morality and justice are applicable to nations as well as to individuals; that the former as well as the latter are bound to keep their promises; to fulfil their engagements to respect the rights of property which others have acquired under contracts with them. Without this there is an end of all distinct ideas of right or wrong, justice or injustice, in relation to society or government. There can be no such thing as rights, no such thing as property or liberty; all the boasted advantages of a constitution of government vanish into air.

It is a tragic understatement to say that for more than two centuries, actions at both state and federal levels towards American Indians have failed to live up to the standards of morality and justice outlined by Hamilton.

That said, an unrelenting, concerted dwelling on the errors of the past is counterproductive to the goal of working towards a more perfect union in which we can all live together in peace. Focusing on America’s shortcomings while ignoring her triumphs, virtuous actions, and reconciliatory measures fails to capture the true history of the United States.

“The magnitude of a legal wrong is no reason to perpetuate it.” writes Gorsuch. “Unlawful acts, performed long enough and with sufficient vigor, are never enough to amend the law. To hold otherwise would be to elevate the most brazen and longstanding injustices over the law, both rewarding wrong and failing those in the right.” Indeed, this is the rationale for overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey — wrong is wrong, and the passage of time does not turn vice into virtue.

One of the hallmarks of American conservatism is its belief in eternal, objective truths that apply to all men, all times, everywhere. There are such things as right and wrong, good and evil, just and unjust. And, as Justice Gorsuch just reminded the nation, the obligation to do the right thing doesn’t come with an expiry date.

Ben Domenech On Spikes In Violent Crime: ‘People Should Be Outraged’,"Federalist co-founder and publisher Ben Domenech said Tuesday that those up in arms about police brutality ought to be similarly outraged by recent spikes in violent crime sweeping the nation’s cities.

“I think we have to recognize that in the view of our politicians, our leaders in the media, these lives are not equally valuable,” Domenech said on Fox News’ “Outnumbered” following the death of a 1-year-old boy named Davell Gardner Jr. who was shot to death in New York City on Sunday. “The life of this young child, who will never see his second birthday, is less valuable from their perspective than the life of some kid who gets killed in Park Slope. That’s just the way that they treat these stories, because what happened in this case is somehow deemed normal or expected or acceptable.”

While Black Lives Matter continues to protest in major cities across the country, demanding the dismantling of law enforcement, violent crime has skyrocketed while demoralized police forces become increasingly paralyzed through budget cuts and undue scrutiny. In Detroit, protests erupted last week with demonstrators calling for “justice” in the form of action taken against police who shot and killed a black man that began firing at them first at point-blank.

In New York City, the crime surge continued, with 28 shootings over the weekend, leaving 35 people shot and Gardner dead.

“This is unacceptable,” Domenech said, emphasizing the fact that the defunding of New York City’s police department, which is the envy of the world, hurts poor people the most. “It’s just unacceptable. It’s heinous, and people should be outraged about it.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/14/ben-domenech-on-spikes-in-violent-crime-people-should-be-outraged/,2020-07-14
Why Is Hillary Clinton Support In 2016 Correlated With Cities’ 2020 Riots?,"Image Credit Lorie Shaull / Flickr

In a soon-to-be-released book, Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan says when President Obama called him during the 2015 riots in Baltimore, he expected the president to offer federal assistance. Instead, Obama urged Hogan to back off.

Hogan ignored Obama’s advice about the violence following the death of Freddie Gray, and worked to restore order to the state’s largest city. More than $20 million of damage was done after Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told reporters the city would provide space to “those who wished to destroy.”

If Baltimore’s Democrat leaders gave $20 million of “space to destroy” in 2015, the price tag ballooned 100-fold in cities governed by the hard left in the 2020 round of urban violence.

The left and major media say the urban violence often accompanying protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 is a direct descendant of America’s past paroxysms of racial unrest. As such, the looting and arson in major cities is claimed to be the righteous child of Baltimore (2015), Ferguson (2014), Los Angeles (1992), and even the widespread riots in America’s major cities following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.

But is it really? Or could it be something entirely different?

In past urban riots, a single spark ignited a mixture of anger and resentment over racial discrimination, poverty, or police brutality. When the cities burned, the damage concentrated in and around the neighborhoods of the urban poor. I witnessed this first-hand as an Army National Guard officer deployed to Los Angeles in 1992. The city was calm in the morning, and by the evening there were widespread murders with businesses being looted and burned.

In 2020, Floyd’s death appeared to trigger something different. Rather than a spark, a signal flare was sent aloft, with prepared cadres launching protests in cities across the nation often followed by violence late into the night.

Unlike Baltimore in 2015, cities like Minneapolis and Seattle featured leftwing mayors and governors, none of whom appeared interested in restoring order. This was due to those elected officials’ deep sympathy towards the protesters’ stated goals: defund the police, or, at the very least, reduce the apparent incidence of police brutality while shifting public funds out of law enforcement to more social welfare spending.

While the protests are ostensibly about the police, including accusations of routine police brutality and racist law enforcement practices, this claim can be subjected to a statistical test. For instance, are cities that spend more on police, resulting in a higher number of police per capita, more prone to violent protests in reaction to perceived over-policing?

Similarly, might cities with a high percentage of black residents have a larger share of their population that may harbor anger at their treatment by law enforcement? Or are cities with high crime rates that routinely feature violent interaction between neighborhood criminals and law enforcement stoking resentment against the police? Lastly, might poverty be a driving factor, with poorer urban areas leading to anger among the residents about the lack of opportunity?

Let’s Run the Numbers

The number of police per capita, the share of the black population, violent crime rates, and poverty levels are routinely reported by the FBI and Census Bureau. It is also possible to estimate recent urban violence by measuring protest news coverage in 37 of America’s big cities when a story also mentions “violence,” “looting,” or “arson” in the period from May 26 to June 30, and then factoring for a city’s population.

(The cities analyzed total 41.5 million people in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Madison, Miami, New York, Newark, Oakland, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa, and Washington D.C. Minneapolis was excluded since many news stories included mention of Minneapolis in stories about local unrest.)

Comparing the above factors in a multivariate regression analysis with the incidence of violence as the dependent variable shows a statistically noisy and weak link to the number of police.

Of note, considering an additional variable—the share of a city’s population with a college degree or post-graduate degree—generates an even higher correlation to violence than does police per capita, suggesting that the protests and allied rioting are not the result of a working-class movement.

But none of these factors is convincingly determinative. There was one variable that did correlate strongly to urban violence: a city’s percentage of vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The more a city voted for Clinton, the more violence it saw in conjunction with the protests. (For the statisticians, the regression provides a significance of 0.0019 with the 2016 vote variable yielding a P-value of 0.003). The greater percentage of support for Clinton in 2016, the more likely a city was to suffer wanton destruction in connection with the “mostly peaceful” protests.

The figure below displays the simple correlation between urban violence and the 2016 Clinton vote.

Tellingly, out of the top ten cities for violence, looting, and arson, the average vote for Clinton was 77 percent. In the ten cities with the least destruction, Clinton won 53 percent of the vote.

That a city’s political leanings are more likely to lead to a breakdown in law and order in service of political protest shouldn’t be a surprise. In this, Seattle, with a black population of 7 percent, San Francisco (5 percent), Portland, Oregon (6 percent), and Madison, Wisconsin (7 percent) have one big thing in common with Washington D.C. and Atlanta, with black populations of 47 percent and 52 percent, respectively: They are all governed by the far-left.

Why did the leaders of the hardest-hit cities decide to give space to destroy? Some mayors saw the protest organizers as political supporters. A few may have calculated that widespread coverage of burning cities would harm President Trump’s reelection chances. And some just didn’t want the responsibility of ordering their police to restore order.

Unfortunately, it is often the case in politics and revolutions that the common people—the proletariat—are sacrificed for the movement. In this case, it will be those living in dangerous neighborhoods who will end up being murdered, robbed, raped, and extorted in greater numbers if the misguided call to “defund the police” becomes a widespread reality.

Americans have largely forgotten the hard-won gains made in public safety since 1992, during the last peak of violent crime. If crime rises to the level of a generation ago, we would suffer 14,261 more murders (almost double those murdered in 2018), 580,460 more robberies, and 636,038 more aggravated assaults every year. And these crimes would be concentrated in our urban centers, specifically in working-class and poor neighborhoods.

Think about that the next time you see those young vanguards of the proletariat, armed with law degrees and Molotov cocktails, visiting violence upon a city, only to return to their expensive lofts with a city view before daybreak. In this, the leaders of our recent round of urban violence appear to be trying to ignite a revolution rather than merely win a campaign.

Fifteen of those people who are being treated at five different hospitals reported the Sun Times, were shot outside a funeral home Tuesday evening when people in a black car fired upon a grieving crowd leaving the proceedings.

Tuesday’s episodes of violence follows another day of epic violence on Monday, where 25 people were shot, and three of them died.

“Far too many have suffered. Far too many have attended funerals and tried to start the process of healing entire communities following another senseless tragedy,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in the shootings’ aftermath. “We cannot give shelter to killers. People know who are responsible.”

Meanwhile, the mayor’s city is suffering in a downward spiral in an epidemic of inner-city violence seeing some of its most deadly weekends in the city’s recorded history. Seventy people were shot over the weekend killing 11, just weeks after the Windy City saw at least 106 shootings that killed 14. In the immediate aftermath of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, 25 people were shot to death between May 29-30 marking Chicago’s most violent weekend in more than six decades.

Instead of welcoming federal resources to combat the outbreak of violent crime engulfing the nation’s third largest city, Mayor Lightfoot began making threats on Twitter explicitly rejecting federal law enforcement.

“Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump’s troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents,” Lightfoot wrote.

When confronted over the epidemic of violence gripping the community in an explosive May conference call, the Democratic mayor blew off alderman concerns.

“When downtown is in lockdown, our neighborhoods are next, and our failure to fully get ready for what’s going on in the neighborhoods, we’re seeing this destruction, and we’re thinking that it’s going to somehow end tonight. We have seen where, in other cities, this has gone on for days; and we need to come up with a better plan for days, at least for the next five days, to try to stabilize our communities,” said Alderman Raymond Lopez. “Once they’re one looting and rioting and whatever’s going to happen tonight, God help us, what happens when they start going after residents? Going into neighborhoods?”

And that was on May 31, to which the mayor dismissed the alderman’s concerns with “next question.”

“I think you’re 100 percent full of s**t,” Lightfoot said when Lopez pushed for answer.

The violent crime wave has also cemented its grip on cities nationwide, where Los Angeles saw a 250 percent rise in homicides by early June and New York suffers a nearly 70 percent shooting increase from Jan 1 to July 17 compared to the same time last year. One fatal New York City victim was 1-year-old Davell Gardner Jr. whose death was met with silence from Black Lives Matter activists demanding community abolition of law enforcement.

“Everbody talk about ‘Black Lives Matter.’ What about baby lives?” said Gardner’s grandmother.

GOP Rep. Demands Federal Investigation Into Anti-Christian Hate Crimes,"Indiana Republican Rep. Jim Banks is demanding federal authorities at the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate mob attacks on Christian statues and churches in their continued purge of human history in the name of “social justice.”

“Over the last two months as Americans have seen statues of American heroes toppled and memorials dedicated to our national memory desecrated, those responsible for these acts have also in their sights Catholics, statues of saints and churches,” an email from Banks’ office read Wednesday.

Banks went on to cite Federalist reporting chronicling how self-described social justice warriors have unleashed violent rage against memorials to true social justice warriors. In Boston, a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary was lit ablaze at St. Peter’s Parish Church along with another in Brooklyn. In Ocala, Florida, police arrested one man after he rammed his minivan into a Catholic church and set the church on fire.

Further west in Los Angeles, a fire almost entirely burned down the San Gabriel Mission founded by St. Junipero Serra in 1771.

“Will those with a large platform fight anti-Catholic, anti-Christian bigotry like they have fought other forms of discrimination?” Banks asked.

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a leftist organization that styles itself an arbiter of hate crimes and hate groups and is frequently cited as such by corporate media, did not immediately respond to The Federalist’s request for comment on whether they will devote resources to the surge in anti-Christian hate crimes.

The recent epidemic of outrage has made Christians just one of many targets of mob hatred.

Race-Obsessed Media Don't Care About The Brutal Murder Of 5-Year-Old,"Every day, corporate media commit sins of omission and commission. In their current scramble to shine a spotlight on what many leftist journalists deem “systemic racism,” they have elevated the deaths of black Americans at the hands of white people, while turning a blind eye to black-on-black crime as well as white victims of black perpetrators. Today, their grave sin of omission involved the execution of an innocent 5-year-old boy.

Went online to confirm the details of this story- couldnt find a single national media outlet covering it. Not one. Absolutely horrific, nightmarish story. Pure vicious evil. And media silence around it is disgusting and obvious. https://t.co/TJhxvnJJIX — Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) August 11, 2020

On Sunday, 25-year-old Darius Sessoms, a black man, allegedly killed white 5-year-old Cannon Hinnant while the child’s two young sisters looked on. While Hinnant was riding his bike in the front yard of his father’s North Carolina home, Sessoms, his neighbor, reportedly ran across the yard and shot the child in the head point-blank. One neighbor witnessed the incident, as did the boy’s 7- and 8-year-old sisters.

“My first reaction was he’s playing with the kids,” said Doris Lybrand, the neighbor who saw Sessoms run across the lawn and shoot the boy. “For a second, I thought, ‘That couldn’t happen.’ People don’t run across the street and kill kids.”

“We were eating our dinner and heard a bang. We knew it was a gunshot,” Charlene Walburn, another of the boy’s neighbors, described the scene. “So I told him to call 911, and I ran to the door.”

The boy’s father dashed out to his son, screaming and holding his bleeding body. Hinnant was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

After the shooting, Sessoms fled in a black vehicle. The U.S. Marshals Service Carolinas Regional Fugitive Task Force, Goldsboro police, and Wayne County Sheriff’s Office arrested him nearly 24 hours later. Sessoms is being held in the Wilson County jail without bond and has been charged with first-degree murder.

“I just don’t understand why he did it,” Walburn continued. “How can you walk up to a little boy, point blank, and put a gun to his head and just shoot him? How could anyone do that?”

The same neighbor described Hinnant’s sweet demeanor. “He would come over, him and my husband would always talk back and forth and he would ask my husband to put air in his tire,” Walburn said. “If he saw me on the porch with a popsicle, he would always come over and ask me if he could have a popsicle.”

Sessoms reportedly had dinner with Hinnant’s father last week and was seen at the father’s residence earlier in the day Sunday.

Day in and day out, the national media has stoked the coals of racial tension in America, cultivating a blazing inferno of strife — both literally and figuratively. The world has watched as lawless rioters and looters desecrated America’s cities, setting businesses and churches ablaze, coaxed onward by an approving news media. Journalists have run cover for violent actors, lumping them in with peaceful protesters.

WATCH: Federalist Radio Hour: How The Media Exploits Crises, From COVID-19 To Race Relations

Over and over, the media have repeated the story of George Floyd and hurled blanket accusations of police brutality, which has encouraged violence against police officers, all while largely ignoring deaths that aren’t politically expedient. These deaths include that of black police officer David Dorn, who died while protecting a store from violent looters in St. Louis. Now the media is ignoring the death of Hinnant at the hands of a black man.

The media will continue their race framing, as if every act of man is the product of a racial consideration. It doesn’t apply only to crime, either. Everything in American culture and politics in 2020 must be viewed through a racial lens. Brands have been canceled, sports teams renamed, and Black Lives Matter scrawled across basketball courts and end zones. Former Vice President Joe Biden yesterday announced the selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, after activists and party leaders pressured him to choose a woman of color.

As the blaze of manufactured conflict continues, be mindful of the media’s framing. Note not only their sins of commission as they intentionally divide Americans over the color of their skin, but also their sins of omission as they ignore victims that cut against the “America is racist” narrative, such as the many victims of black-on-black crime. Today, the victim they’ve ignored is Cannon Hinnant.

How Biden’s Housing Plans Would Destroy America’s Suburbs,"As America heads toward another presidential election, one of the biggest voting blocs up for grabs will be suburbanites.

In 2016, Donald Trump won the suburban vote over Hillary Clinton. Recent polling has shown the incumbent president trailing in the suburbs, however, particularly among women. If suburban voters knew what Joe Biden has in store for their communities once elected, they might change who they’re willing to cast their ballot for come November.

In 2015, President Barack Obama’s Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a regulation known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH). The administration claimed it issued the rule to combat “housing segregation” in suburbs, despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968 already outlawing discriminatory housing practices.

According to the New York Post, had the regulation been successfully implemented nationwide, localities across the country would have had to “scrap zoning, build bigger water and sewer lines to support high-density living, expand schools and social services and add mass transit. All pushing up local taxes.” In essence, virtually all control regarding local governance would be outsourced to the federal government.

Biden Wants to Centralize Power

Not only has Biden agreed to implement AFFH if elected, but he has also promised to go much further. Originally, the AFFH rule used HUD grants as a persuasion tactic to bring suburban communities into compliance, while local communities could still make decisions about whether to pursue these grants or retain local zoning control.

Biden, however, has signed on to a proposal by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., that would effectively withhold federal transportation grants, used to build and repair highways, unless communities sign on to AFFH. It would be almost impossible for many communities to decline this funding for critical infrastructure, handing over America’s suburbs to the federal government.

Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, recently spoke in an interview with Mark Levin about how a Biden presidency would effectively abolish America’s suburbs as we know them. “It would allow bureaucrats in Washington, in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to control zoning laws, to control the placement of transportation and business districts, even to some degree the drawing of school districts,” Kurtz said. “In other words, almost every important local governmental responsibility could, under AFFH, fall into the de facto control of the feds.”

The Trump administration officially discarded the rule in July, arguing the regulation was a blatant power grab by the federal government. “President @realDonaldTrump and I agree that the best run communities are the ones run locally,” tweeted HUD Secretary Ben Carson. “Today, we are tearing down the Obama Administration’s Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, which was an overreach of unelected Washington bureaucrats into local communities.”

Today, we are tearing down the Obama Administration's Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, which was an overreach of unelected Washington bureaucrats into local communities. — Archive: Ben Carson (@SecretaryCarson) July 23, 2020

The administration is replacing the Obama-era rule with its own policy, called Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice. According to a HUD press release, the new rule “defines fair housing broadly to mean housing that, among other attributes, is affordable, safe, decent, free of unlawful discrimination, and accessible under civil rights laws.” The new regulation also provides more power to local governments with regard to zoning decisions.

Goodbye to Peaceful Suburbs

Suburban voters should also know that with AFFH, the crime we routinely see on TV every night, such as the riots in Portland, will likely no longer be exclusive to major cities. As localities surrounding metropolitan areas begin to be forcibly melted into inner cities, we very well might see city crime begin seeping into once-peaceful suburbs.

The very same soft-on-crime policies that have encouraged crime, such as those in New York City, will become the new norm for our suburbs as city police newly encompass suburban police, under worse policies for both. Following the death of George Floyd, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio slashed the New York Police Department’s budget by more than $1 billion and disbanded the plainclothes anti-crime unit. Coupled with the state’s new bail-reform laws, the results have been catastrophic.

According to the Washington Examiner, “In one week in July, shootings in the city increased by 176% compared to the same week last year, with 47 shootings reported compared to 17 shootings last year. Additionally, killings also increased that week, with 14 killed compared to five during the same period in 2019.” In addition, the month of July marked more shootings in New York City so far this year than in all of 2019.

If Biden is elected in November, Americans in the suburbs can kiss their peaceful communities goodbye. Citizens who moved out of the cities hoping to escape violence would be under a Biden administration more likely to be trapped in the same circumstances they fled.

There’s a reason the Democrats and mainstream media continue to avoid this issue. If suburban voters begin to understand what Biden’s AFFH rule would mean for their communities, many would flock to Trump, irrespective of what they think of his tweeting habits. Americans want to live in safe neighborhoods, where their children can go outside and play. If Trump can campaign effectively on this issue, his chances for reelection will improve dramatically.

Where Black Lives Matter Rioters Learned To Call Looting ‘Reparations’,"In Chicago this summer, Black Lives Matter protesters have repeatedly called for committing crimes as vengeance for claimed racial injustice. A few days ago, marchers in Millennium Park unfurled huge banners, one of which proclaimed “loot it all back.”

March organizers called for the banner to lead the march, according to Grace Del Vecchio, a local writer onsite who also provided video.

After widespread looting in the city as part of ongoing civil unrest accompanied by a crime wave, on Aug. 11 local Black Lives Matter leader Ariel Atkins openly defended looting as “reparations,” according to local outlets.

After 100 looters were arrested and 13 police officers injured by mobs on a protest-enabled crime spree, she said this: “I don’t care if somebody decides to loot a Gucci’s or a Macy’s or a Nike because that makes sure that that person eats. That makes sure that that person has clothes. That’s a reparation,” Atkins said. “Anything they want to take, take it, because these businesses have insurance.”

In a TV interview after Atkins’s comments, while not openly endorsing property crime, Black Lives Matter Chicago cofounder Aislinn Pulley failed to flatly condemn looting as a part of her group’s tactics. Instead she called discussions about looting a “preoccupation” that “works to distract away from the actual cause of the outrage.”

Pulley also implied that rampant property crimes decimating Democrat-run cities like Chicago during ongoing summer protests are not the fault of those committing them, but the fault of voters and elected officials who don’t do what she wants: “The refusal to enact any meaningful change will mean that we will have continued instances like this…We will continue to have unrest, intercommunal violence and these things until the root causes are resolved.”

In other words, don’t blame the criminals, blame the laws they’re breaking and the people enforcing those laws. Just like this admitted ATM robber and his friends say, we need to focus on “what can be done for this man to feel like he don’t need to loot again.” It’s our fault he tried to loot an ATM, you see. We’re responsible for his feelings and actions, not him.

These ideas are not simply isolated, fringe, and from random rabble-rousers. They were also proclaimed to the world on CNN by New York Times lead 1619 Project writer Nikole Hannah-Jones. An interview with Christine Amanpour included this exchange:

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: You’ve said, among other things, ‘people who have been left out of the social contract find no need to adhere it.’ Somebody, sort of, checked you on that and said, ‘not left out, but excluded from the social contract.’ And you agreed with being term-checked. NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Absolutely. You are asking whose communities have been looted for decades, don’t have proper schools, don’t have proper amenities. When we see someone killed by the police, that is the worse manifestation of police violence, but it doesn’t get to the daily violence that doesn’t end in death, or the daily degradation that black Americans face. The fact that these communities have been prayed upon by predatory lenders, it goes on and on. When we think about someone taking something from some big-box name store, it is symbolic. That one pair of shoes that you stole from Footlocker is not going to change your life, but it is a symbolic taking.

Retired prison psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple points out that a refusal to take responsibiliy for one’s own actions and life is a hallmark of criminals and the underclass, aided and abetted by elites who exploit the poor for lucrative careers managing the downtrodden.

The idea that the existence of evil in the world justifies adding more is enabled by a slew of publicly funded white-collar professionals who make bank stoking racial tensions. What rioters on the street hear as “it’s okay to steal from people who have more stuff than I do” in The New York Times, NPR, and The Atlantic’s offices sound like “The Case for Reparations.”

“The case I make for reparations is, virtually every institution with some degree of history in America, be it public, be it private, has a history of extracting wealth and resources out of the African-American community,” reprised Ta-Nehisi Coates to The New Yorker in 2019 of his 2014 Atlantic essay that brought the idea mainstream among elites. “I think what has often been missing—this is what I was trying to make the point of in 2014—that behind all of that oppression was actually theft. In other words, this is not just mean. This is not just maltreatment. This is the theft of resources out of that community.”

In other words, we can steal from you, because you stole from us first. This spirit of revenge is the sentiment behind much of the recent resurgence in identity politics grievances and anti-American hatred. The United States stole land from Native Americans. Therefore we owe them welfare outlays and so-called sovereignty over reservations in perpetuity, as well as copious white tears.

The United States stole blood, sweat, and tears from enslaved Africans. Therefore, the country owes people it has not enslaved white guilt all the way to the point of undoing all the good things about America. As well as power and money — lots and lots of money, in the form of university and Smithsonian Institution sinecures for the white-collar aggrieved, and a bit of looting for the blue-collar aggrieved to supplement their subsidized housing and groceries.

Reparations are simply legalized looting, dressed up in fancy justifications for TV. The reasons are myriad, starting with the fact that no living American today owned slaves. The vast majority of Americans never owned slaves.

In addition, since the days of slavery, immigrants joined the United States by the tens of millions. Thus the vast majority of Americans living today do not even have ancestors who enslaved anyone. Even that presumes that it is right to punish children for the sins of their fathers, which is an injustice if I ever heard of one.

It also presumes that the death, dismemberment, and economic hardships the Civil War caused are not a sufficient punishment upon the nation for its sin of slavery. These are big presumptions, and they deserve open debate in which they could be fairly proven wrong or at least doubted, not pressuring people to leave them uncontested under pain of being called a racist so we can move on to the looting — excuse me, reparations.

Excusing violence against other people’s person and property is even part of the so-called American justice system in some places using the same rationales, as recent reporting by Empower Wisconsin illustrates. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Everett Mitchell “made headlines as the University of Wisconsin’s director of community relations when he said prosecutors should go easy on shoplifters at ‘big box’ stores.”

“I just don’t think that they should be prosecuting cases … for people who steal from Wal-Mart,” Everett said. “I don’t think Target or all them [sic] other places, the big boxes that have insurance, that they should be using … the fact that people steal from there, justification to start engaging in aggressive police practices.”

Notice that this man, formerly employed in a public institution of supposed higher education and now charged with executing the laws as a judge, voiced the exact same conclusion a Black Lives Matter leader did: It’s okay to steal from people who have more than you do. I’ll give you one guess at which side of the political spectrum both of these individuals would place themselves on.

“As a judge, Mitchell has been a ‘social justice’ activist on the bench, handing out light sentences — or no sentences — to repeat offenders,” Empower Wisconsin reporter Matt Kittle writes.

There is also evidence from other parts of the “social justice” agenda that much of today’s far left, the source of the Democratic Party’s energy today, sees racial grievances as a justification for legalized plunder. Take, for example, the demand of Chicago’s protesters to steal a place to live — i.e., “cancel rents and mortgages.”

The implication is that people should just get things because they want them, and their desires alone justify taking it from other people. As with the looting, there’s no mention of work, reciprocity, or any other form of assuming responsibility for one’s own life.

I’m here at Daley Plaza in the #Loop where protesters have gathered alongside @LTBcoalition with the following demands:

1. Lift the ban on rent control

2. Cancel rents & mortgages

3. Stop all evictions during this pandemic #ChicagoProtests pic.twitter.com/AgWNbRHbbA — Grace Del Vecchio (she/her) (@delvecchiograce) August 17, 2020

Despite the obvious injustice of redistributing wealth and power according to ancestry that reparations entail, support for it is high among influential Americans and growing among the left’s ignorant ground troops. It is fomented by making Americans believe racism is rampant, even though research suggests the United States may be the least racist country in the world.

Against the reality, 56 percent of American voters currently agree “American society is racist,” found a July Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. “In other signs of substantial shifts in views on race, more voters see racial bias as a feature of American society and support protests aimed at addressing it,” the journal said.

The poll uncovered a jump from zero Americans thinking white people are discriminated against in all earlier polls to 15 percent in its latest rendition, in July 2020. While there were big jumps in perceptions of discrimination against all politically potent racial groups, the perception of anti-white racism was by far the largest percentage increase.

As numerous observers have pointed out, pushing Americans to think of themselves in terms of skin color and to allocate resources according to a politicized ethnicity scrum is a very, very dangerous game. Those playing it are currently winning big. But the nation stands to lose everything.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/19/where-black-lives-matter-rioters-learned-to-call-looting-reparations/,2020-08-19
"While Claiming To Champion Justice, Democrats Are Letting Cities Burn","The leaders of the Democratic Party think they are destroying America in order to save it. Our nation’s urban revival, of which New York City was the preeminent example, was one of the great successes of the last few decades. Now this achievement is in danger as the costliest civil unrest in American history drags on, enabled by the deliberate fecklessness of Democratic leaders.

Nightly riots and assaults in Portland, massive organized looting in Chicago, and escalating violence in NYC and elsewhere are still ongoing as police are pulled back. The destruction and pillaging have devastated local economies already wounded by the Chinese coronavirus.

The Democrats who run our cities have stood by and allowed them to be ravaged, and many people and businesses have had enough and are leaving. Years of economic development and crime reduction are being undone by the incompetence and malice of Democratic leaders, motivated by a mix of ideology and cynicism.

Democrats Are Undoing Years of Progress

Ideologically, many are supine before any claim or deed on behalf of “racial justice,” no matter how spurious. Thus, the same mayors who closed playgrounds in response to the Chinese coronavirus encouraged mass protests. Some have tacitly accommodated vandalism and violence as legitimate forms of protest and treated looting as justified reparations.

Amid the destruction, the national media repeat the words “mostly peaceful” to the point of absurdity, using protests as moral cover for vandalism, arson, looting, assault, and even murder. Democratic leaders have followed suit. For example, Seattle’s mayor endorsed the armed occupation of part of her city, which began with assault and extortion and predictably ended with multiple murders. Many other local Democratic leaders appear sympathetic to the destruction and rioting, permitting and downplaying it while offering only tepid condemnations of the worst violence.

Other more cynical Democrats see the chaos as a political weapon against President Donald Trump. If he does not intervene against the rioting, he appears weak; if his administration acts to quell it, Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accuse him of being an incipient dictator deploying stormtroopers.

Regardless of the reason — ideological insanity or as a cynical strategy to win an election — it is folly to trash America’s cities. The damage has been much worse than reported in legacy media, and the worst suffering will fall on those city-dwellers the Democrats claim to champion.

Attempts to rein in the destruction have been halfhearted and often underscore just how bad the situation is. After Chicago’s famous Magnificent Mile was sacked, again, by organized looters (some even brought U-Hauls to facilitated the pillaging), the city started raising bridges to limit access to downtown, literal drawbridges against barbarian invaders. Meanwhile, the nightly riots in Portland did not stop after federal agents left. In New York, Gov. Andrew “send the infected into the nursing homes” Cuomo is begging the wealthy to come back to New York City and continue paying for its outsized spending.

Even from the partisan Democratic perspective, the riots and unrest might do far more damage than good. Democrats hope the damage can be quickly repaired after a Biden-Harris victory in November and perhaps some police budget cuts, but what if crime doesn’t go back down, businesses don’t rebuild and reopen, and professionals continue to move away? What if we are in for decades of urban decay and subsequently increased crime?

Poor Minorities Will Suffer Most

Cities are not rebuilt automatically. Apologists for the rioting recite the refrain “they have insurance” as though every business has perfect riot insurance that will quickly settle all claims for the full value of everything destroyed, including months of lost revenue. But reality is not like an insurance commercial; many of the damaged and destroyed businesses are never coming back. Many people are deciding city life is no longer worth it.

America’s great cities are the heart of the Democratic Party, and the long-term effects of another period of urban decline are unclear. Perhaps Democrats could adapt. A diaspora from their urban strongholds might even help if those leaving retain their partisan allegiance. Or perhaps voters will decide to punish Democrats. Either way, the urban poor and minority voters Democrats claim to care for will bear the brunt of the decline.

Of course, Democrats are also responsible for the conditions being protested. Very few large cities are governed by Republicans, and Democrats have run many for generations. The problems of cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, and Milwaukee are not the GOP’s fault. The American urban revival did not lift everyone up. Some cities were left out, and those that got ahead still left neighborhoods and groups behind.

Thus, the rioting and unrest have highlighted the fractures in the Democrats’ high/low coalition, which is run by the (mostly white) educated and well-off, ostensibly on behalf of poor and minority voters. If big-city policing is racist, what does that say about the Democrats who have been running those cities? Likewise, if American education is institutionally racist, how can the reliably Democrat teachers’ unions, as well as left-wing professors and administrators, escape the blame?

Democrats Are Wasting Real Opportunities

The pieces of the Democratic Party do not fit well together. Compromise is intrinsic to coalition politics, but the Democrats are past compromise into incoherence. The interests of the corporate left and urban working class do not align. Likewise, the interests of the student-debt-ridden adjutant classes are inimical to those of the urban working class.

For example, slashing police budgets and replacing cops with social workers is a jobs program for (mostly) white women with college degrees, at the expense of working-class men of all races. This is why white radicals and their cultural obsessions, such as renaming football teams, have hijacked a movement supposedly dedicated to racial justice and police reform.

For those who genuinely care about police reform and racial equality, this is a wasted opportunity. Earlier this year President Trump, a populist Republican, was running for reelection on a record of criminal justice reform. This would have been unthinkable back in the days crime was so bad that Democrats such as Joe Biden were promoting get-tough policies. Public safety made reform palatable, but disorder might take it off the table.

After the horrifying alleged police killing of George Floyd, there was a chance for bipartisan reforms, but it has been wasted on rioting and radicalism. Democratic leaders chose to filibuster federal efforts at police reform. Changes and proposals have occurred at state and local levels, but too many are rooted in anti-police ideology. The solution to police misconduct is not no police, but better police. It does not help poor or minority citizens to deprive them of the law’s protection.

In service to their political goals, Democratic leaders have allowed, enabled, and encouraged tremendous damage to our nation. But destroying cities will not end racism nor increase racial equality. It might not even help the Democrats defeat Trump, let alone build a long-term governing majority (there are now a lot of new gun owners). All Democrats have ensured is suffering for the urban poor and marginalized, whose neighborhoods are destroyed, whose economic prospects are blighted, and who are now easier prey for criminals.

Regardless of whether Biden or Trump wins in November, we will all be stuck with the Democrats’ choice to let our cities burn.

NYT Sympathizes With Adults Who Want Sex With 13-Year-Old Girls,"In a gross article crossing into territory any decent person would find morally abhorrent, The New York Times decided to defend so-called “victimless” child sex crimes in a lengthy apologetic for men in prison for soliciting sex with minors.

The article is a surreal read. Rather than focusing on how sex crimes devastate victims’ lives, or the efforts of organizations to halt sexual violence against children worldwide and domestically, or even focusing on the grueling work of the law enforcement agents involved in these vile crimes, the Times waxes sympathetically about the lives of three men who were arrested for soliciting sex with minors online and how it has affected their families.

The Times introduces the first not by his crime, sentence, nor any apology for his actions, but by telling about his hobbies and close relationship with his mother. The paper describes him as an avid online gamer, a “Dungeons and Dragons” dungeon master, and, in the words of his mother, “introverted, sensitive, immature, coddled, nerdy.” Jace Hambrick, at 20 years old, connected with a Craigslist ad for sex that was ultimately part of a net nanny sting.

This wasn’t the first time he had solicited sex online. Hambrick answered an ad and exchanged messages with an undercover agent posing as a 13-year-old girl. The cover identified herself multiple times as age 13, including when Hambrick asked clarifying questions about her age.

From the Times’ description, their age discussion from Hambrick’s viewpoint was as follows: “Was this an elaborate game? Again she claimed to be 13. The photo seemed to tell a different story, and the gaming chair she was seated in looked too expensive for a kid. She used slang a 13-year-old probably wouldn’t know, like ‘FTP’ — ‘[expletive] the police’ — that originated in ’80s hip-hop. The vulgarities and snide tone seemed too adult. Her texts were full of ‘lol’s. Was she an immature teenager? Or a sly adult? Her driving directions seemed too specific for 13.”

Children Are Not Potential Sex Partners — Ever

Regardless of whether you think picking up strangers on the internet for sex is a sound idea, hearing that your would-be sex partner is only 13 years old should bring the conversation to a full stop. That should be a total dealbreaker, not an opportunity to think of situations in which the person on the other side of the screen could be saying they’re 13 but are actually older, or why she might be 13 but somehow more mature, or any of this nonsense.

Driving directions were too specific? Slang that 13-year-olds might not know? What on Earth does any of that matter if there’s even a chance she is a child? These excuses are an attempt to duck and shift blame, but there are simply no situations in which adults should be considering sex with kids.

It should go without saying, but if someone says she’s a child, she is not a potential sex partner. It doesn’t matter how pretty she is, how much slang or how many pop culture references she can spit, or how many mutual interests you share. Children are not sex partners, and hooking up with them or making plans to hook up with them is criminal. No mitigating factor suddenly makes this acceptable, and attempting to normalize this by describing laws tailored to protect children as draconian is bizarre.

New York Times Bemoans Sentencing for Solicitors

The article also spends a significant amount of time complaining about the length of sentences for these internet-based solicitation crimes — wherein people take the further step of actually buying condoms and showing up to meet who they think are young children for sex — versus crimes against real children.

“The men caught in these cases can wind up serving more time than men who are convicted of sexually assaulting and raping actual children,” the Times article reads. “While there are no statistics comparing sentencing among different states in such predator stings, Washington’s criminal code has some particularly draconian provisions that result in unusually lengthy sentences.”

Another section of the article again casts the perpetrator as the victim, especially with sentencing, saying, “Unfortunately for Wright, there was no victim in his case, or in any of these cases. In Washington, a man could be caught fondling his niece and potentially qualify for an alternative sentence, but if he sends lewd texts to an undercover detective, he does not.”

As Tim Ballard, CEO of Operation Underground Railroad, an organization that rescues children from human trafficking, told me in an email in response to the Times’ article and portrayal of perpetrators:

I’m saddened to see an article like this come out that sympathizes with child predators. We are seeing a shift in society where sympathy is somehow given to these monsters who show up to rape children. The New York Times’ criticism of the Net Nanny operation having ‘no victims,’ is appalling and to that I would ask, what would have happened if it wasn’t law enforcement on the other side of that door? …Operations like Net Nanny are successful in pulling dangerous people who are scavenging the internet for children off the streets. While the New York Times didn’t include this in their article, once perpetrators are arrested in operations like Net Nanny, oftentimes you will have past victims of theirs come forward or law enforcement is able to investigate other child assault crimes and these offenders are properly brought to justice.

Don’t Normalize Child Sex Crimes

I feel for the parents in this article. It must be devastating to watch your child be arrested, tried, and dragged through the media for attempted sex crimes against a child. I can’t imagine the stress of worrying about them in prison, especially with the reputation of how awful prison is for sex offenders. But I’m also taken aback by the idea of fighting these sentences and blaming the law enforcement officers involved, as well as organizations such as O.U.R.

It’s clear from the communications to those convicted of these crimes from the undercover agents that the potential sex partner in these situations was a child — and sometimes a very young child. Some of the net nanny setups involve hypothetical children as young as six years old. Until the men walk through the doors of the sting house and see the waiting police officers, they don’t know it’s all adults and no real children. They’re walking into situations with sex with a child in mind.

There’s no reason to create sympathetic narratives around these situations and the people snared by these online ads. Decrying the sentencing because a real child’s life wasn’t actually destroyed, just planned to be destroyed, is baffling and horrifying. The very last thing we need is child solicitation and rape to be normalized in any way, in any medium, in our society.

New York City Suffers 50 Percent Murder Spike In August,"While left-wing ideologues demand cities defund the police, the current situation in New York City offers a compelling case for law enforcement’s existence, showcasing the need for more, not less, public protection.

New York City suffered 242 recorded shootings in August alone, up from 91 last year, according to an analysis of crime data from the New York Times published Tuesday. As shootings more than doubled, homicides naturally rose along with them from 36 to 53.

The August numbers continue a traumatizing trend seen in the Big Apple and other major cities across the country. Crime has skyrocketed amid the coronavirus pandemic, a suffering economy, and a perpetual wave of historic unrest sweeping the nation’s urban centers in a presidential election year.

The Times reported that while crime in America’s largest city still hasn’t eclipsed peak levels from two and three decades ago, the sharp increase in murders and shootings has driven numbers up to rates not seen since the 1950s. According to the Wall Street Journal, murders have surged 34 percent for the year overall compared to 2019, from 217 to 291, coinciding with an 87 percent increase in shootings. Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio chalks up the rise in violent crime to the city dealing with a “perfect storm” of issues after he and fellow Democrats defunded the police department by $1 billion.

Chicago saw an 88 percent increase in people shot for the month of August compared to last year, from 268 to 503. That has meant 63 killed this year as opposed to 49, reported a local ABC affiliate.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/03/new-york-city-suffers-50-percent-murder-spike-in-august-shootings-more-than-double/,2020-09-03
Labor Day Weekend Shootings Continue Upward Trend In Urban Crime,"Violent crime continues to spike in U.S. cities this year. While the summer historically produces an upward swing in violence, leaders in many cities attribute the increase in shootings to COVID-19 lockdowns.

While journalists and politicians seem to assert that everything is fine in their neighborhoods and that the violence demonstrated over the last six months is a political ploy exploited by President Trump, cities like NYC, Chicago, Boston see record numbers of fatalities grow.

President Trump pointed out that the alarming violence statistics demonstrated by cities in 2020 is pushing people to leave their political party as well as their city and even state in a tweet on Tuesday.

NYC

New York City experienced a violent weekend after there were “22 shootings with 28 victims Friday through Monday.” One shooting following J’ouvert celebrations injured a 6-year-old boy who was shot in both legs.

The NYPD Chief tweeted about the incident calling it a “senseless shooting.”

At tonight’s senseless shooting in Brooklyn where five people were shot, officers also arrested two men — and recovered two guns. The investigation is in its early stages and is ongoing. We’re asking anyone with information to contact @NYPDTips at #800577TIPS. pic.twitter.com/ChjdMlurj3 — Terence Monahan (@TerenceMonahan) September 7, 2020

According to the New York Times, “shootings [in NYC] more than doubled over the same period last year and murders rose by nearly 50 percent”

“Since May, the city has recorded 791 shootings, a more than 140 percent increase over the same period in 2019. The 180 murders seen between May and August is a more than 51 percent increase compared to 2019,” The New York Times reports.

The New York Post found that “only about 20 percent of shootings have ended with an arrest” in 2020 and the “shooting clearance rate has hovered around 30 to 33 percent.”

Chicago

In Chicago, at least 51 people were shot and 10 died over Labor Day weekend. Some of the victims were children or teens hit by stray bullets. One eight-year-old girl died after being struck in a vehicle at a stoplight.

According to ABC7, the rising violence over the last few months pushed Chicago Police Department to “cancel days off for officers ahead of the holiday weekend,” “extend shifts to 12 hours,” and “put about 8,000 officers on the street.” CPD Superintendent David Brown also said he would be “extending the use of the CPD Summer Mobile Patrol Unit for another 90 days,” but the extra time put in wasn’t able to quell the violence this weekend.

Boston

At least eight were injured in shooting incidents over the weekend in Boston.

According to the Boston Herald, shootings are up “29% from January through August compared to the same time last year” and “deadly shootings are up 34%” and are occurring more frequently in low-income areas.

“Gun crimes are on the rise even as city crime, in general, has dropped 5% overall compared to last year, police records show,” the Herald reports.

Baltimore

Multiple shootings and stabbings left three dead in Baltimore this weekend. One of the shootings was a supposed ambush on a food delivery driver where “someone lured the victim to a house.”

“We believe that he was ambushed,” Baltimore police Detective Donny Moses said. “We later learned that the house he was supposedly delivering to was vacant. So we do believe in this case, someone called an order, placed an order to that location and it was literally to get him there to basically attack him. We are not sure if the victim in this case was robbed, but he was shot.”

According to police, “the city has had 222 homicides so far this year, as compared to 239 the same time last year” and “486 nonfatal shootings, compared to 557 the same time last year.”

Defunding The Police Won’t Help

Rev. Al Sharpton expressed his concern about the increasing violence on MSNBC after interviewer Willie Geist said that New York City “does not feel different or unsafe to me”

“On the ground it is certainly feeling more violent, feeling more unsafe, in unsafe communities, if you know what I mean,” Sharpton said.

“To take all policing off is something a latte liberal may go for as they sit around the Hamptons discussing this as an academic problem. But people living on the ground need proper policing,” he added.

Why Can't We Talk About George Soros’s Plan To Remake America?,"Since 2015, George Soros has been executing a plan to reshape the country through local district attorney elections by pumping unprecedented amounts of money into races that typically only see candidates spend in the low five figures.

Here’s why he has an interest in these local races. Soros is exploiting the reality that all politics are local in some way. To transform America, you have to transform the way towns and cities operate.

A recent exchange on Fox News involving former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, Democrat commentator Marie Harf, and Fox commentator Melissa A. Francis made the hair on my arms stand up because I realized how many people were either unaware of what Soros is doing or have been silenced by the idea that it’s somehow antisemitic to criticize Soros’s political activity.

Criticizing People’s Political Actions Isn’t Racist

Before we dive into what Soros has done, we need to put the antisemitism argument to bed. Criticizing how an enormously wealthy individual uses his money to change a nation is not in any way related to criticism of that person’s ethnicity or religious beliefs. It’s simply an exercise of civic engagement, which is essential for any self-governing people.

The left’s assumption that questioning someone’s political spending is equivalent to questioning his dignity as a person is itself a deeply bigoted assumption, designed solely to silence dissent and shut down debate.

In the segment I referred to earlier, Gingrich brought up the indisputable fact that Soros has been spending what can only be described as unprecedented amounts of money on local races in recent years, with a goal of flipping DA races to far-left “progressive” candidates who will implement soft-on-crime policies that inevitably result in skyrocketing crime rates and violent criminals walking free.

In response, Harf and Francis objected: “George Soros doesn’t need to be a part of this conversation.” Harf went so far as to deny that Soros is buying these races, and Faulkner did not step in to correct her. The segment ends in awkward silence as a disappointed Gingrich remarks that it’s apparently “verboten” to speak about Soros on Fox News now.

This is one of the weirdest exchanges I’ve ever seen on TV. @newtgingrich correctly points out that George Soros threw an unprecedented amount of money into DA races all over the country to elect radicals and Fox News basically told him to shut up. WTF? pic.twitter.com/IxwcLG2gOH — Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) September 16, 2020

Buying Prosecutors Who Are Soft on Crime

Since 2015, Soros has pumped tens of millions of dollars into local races in Texas, Colorado, California, Oregon, Washington, Florida, and New York, as well as swing states such as Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Arizona. In 2016, Soros spent $2,000,000 on a single sheriff race in Maricopa County, Arizona, helping the leftist candidate, Paul Penzone, win.

In Philadelphia, Soros spent an insane $1,700,000 to elect Larry Krasner DA. Soros has also given millions of dollars in grants to candidates in other states. These enormous contributions have a correspondingly enormous impact.

Although his efforts haven’t been universally successful, the vast majority of Soros-backed candidates have won with Soros donations pushing them across the finish line. Here are just a few examples:

$2,000,000 to fund Kim Foxx in her Cook County (Chicago, Ill.) re-election bid.

$1,400,000 to fund Aramis Ayala’s campaign to become state’s attorney of Orlando, Fla.

$1,150,000 to fund Jake Lilly’s run to become DA of Jefferson and Gilpin County (Denver) in Colorado.

$958,000 to fund Joe Gonzales’s run to become DA of Bexar County (San Antonio, Texas).

$650,000 to fund Jose Garza in his Travis County (Austin, Texas) re-election bid.

$750,000 to fund Joe Kimok in his Broward County, Fla. state’s attorney race.

$583,000 to fund Kim Ogg’s run to become Harris County (Houston, Texas) DA.

$583,000 to fund Parisa Dehghani-Tafti in her race to be Arlington County (Va.) commonwealth’s attorney.

$500,000 to fund Jody Owen’s run to become Hinds County, Miss. (Jackson) DA.

$406,000 to fund James E. Stewart’s run to become Caddo Parish, La. (Shreveport) DA.

$392,000 to fund Steve T. Descano’s bid to become Fairfax County (Va.) commonwealth’s attorney.

$275,000 to fund Diana Becton’s bid to remain as Contra Costa County, Calif. DA.

$147,000 to fund Darius Pattillo in his run to become Harris County, Ga. DA.

$116,000 to fund Kim Gardner’s re-election bid as St. Louis circuit attorney.

$107,000 to fund Raul Torrez bid to become Benalillo County (Albuquerque, N.M.) DA.

$89,000 to fund Scott Colom’s bid to become DA of Lowndes County, Miss.

That’s just a partial list, but it surely corroborates Gingrich’s point that Soros “paid for” the outcomes of those elections, notwithstanding Harf’s unsubstantiated denial. In 2018 The Los Angeles Times reported that Soros spent $2,700,000 on California DA races alone, and another $16 million on 17 DA races in other states.

Look How Crazy These DAs Are

San Francisco’s new DA, Chesa Boudin, is a perfect example of the ideological temperament of the candidates Soros has been backing. Boudin is a former translator for the late Venezuelan socialist dictator Hugo Chavez.

He’s also the son of two Weather Underground domestic terrorists who were convicted of murder for their roles in a Brink’s armored car robbery that resulted in the killings of three people. Due to the incarceration of his parents, Boudin was raised by former Weather Underground leader Bill Ayers.

Huge contributions from the deep-pocketed Soros have made it nearly impossible for anyone to compete against his chosen candidates because DA elections rarely involve campaign war chests in excess of a few tens of thousands of dollars. Soros’s millions allow his candidates to bombard voters with propaganda, including commercials that smear Republicans as racists for fighting crime.

What Soros’s DAs Have Done In Office

Now let’s talk about what happens after Election Day, when the Soros-backed candidates start wielding their newfound power. Many of the following names will likely be familiar.

Foxx is well known as the DA who let actor Jussie Smollett escape prosecution after he hoaxed the nation by pretending he was beaten up by two men who allegedly shouted “This is MAGA country” in deep-blue Chicago, Illinois. A special prosecutor assigned to examine Foxx’s conduct in the case said there was “substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures” and determined she was guilty of “making false and/or misleading statements to the public.”

A recent report from the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, moreover, found a 13 percent decline in guilty pleas or verdicts in felony cases and a 39 percent increase in dropped or lost cases after Foxx took office.

If you’ve had the misfortune of hearing Kim Gardner’s name, it’s probably because she’s trying to throw Mark and Patricia McCloskey in jail for defending their home by exercising their right to bear arms when they were threatened by rioters. Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner, along with Baltimore DA Maryln Mosby, threatened in an op-ed to have federal officers arrested if these prosecutors feel they overstep their authority in his district.

Boudin is one of the DAs on this list who refuses to prosecute what he calls “quality-of-life crimes” such as camping in the streets, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, and more. He also recently questioned whether spending money on law enforcement is “the most effective” use of tax dollars. He has also said that policing and incarceration “are tremendously expensive and are failed responses to what we are trying to deal with.”

Diane Becton of Contra Costa County, Calif. filed hate crime charges against David Nelson and Nichole Anderson for painting over a Black Lives Matter mural. Suffolk County, Mass. DA Rachael Rollins, along with Krasner and Boudin, is part of the also-Soros-backed “Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commissions” that team up with far-left activist Shaun King’s “Grassroots Law Project” to advocate for defunding the police. Yes, that’s the same Shaun King who recently called for people to destroy statues and stained glass windows that depict Jesus as white.

Before going on his spending spree in DA races, Soros also made a $50 million donation to the American Civil Liberties Union’s “Campaign to End Mass Incarceration” through his Open Society Foundation in 2014. Much of this money trickled down to local progressive groups who back these types of radical candidates as well.

Without Law and Order, You Don’t Have a Country

After watching the Fox News exchange involving Gingrich, Francis, Harf, and Faulkner, I wondered how anyone who works in the news business could be so uninformed about what Soros has been up to. The left-wing billionaire’s plan clearly operates on the understanding that all politics are local and takes advantage of small-ball local DA races to remake the American justice system — and, by extension, remake all of America into the far-left world of his dreams.

That leap from remaking our justice system to remaking America may seem like a long jump to some, but law and order is the core of America’s existence. Without law and order, you don’t have a country.

If you want to know what the next step is for Soros, it’s a continued expansion of funding for DA races, but also so much more. His recent pledge of $1 billion to endow a network of universities across the nation is part and parcel with his broader effort to promote his far-left ideology among impressionable young people.

Soros calls this initiative “the most important project of my life.” That should deeply concern ordinary Americans everywhere, and perhaps even inspire a backlash of small-dollar donations to fight Soros’s pernicious influence.

I believe that maintaining our freedoms and preserving the Constitution are two pillars of keeping America great, along with upholding the rule of law and properly educating our youth. Soros has a plan to systematically tear down those pillars, and we’re not supposed to talk about it. But we must, and we will.

"Yes, Joe Biden Called Young Black Men ‘Predators’","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden tried to whitewash comments from more than two decades ago at the second and final presidential debate Thursday night, when he denied that he ever called young black men “predators” while shepherding the 1994 Crime Bill through Congress.

“He called them super predators,” President Donald Trump charged. “He said that. He said it … 1994, the crime bill. Super predators.”

Biden immediately denied the claim on stage.

“I never, ever said what he accused me of saying,” Biden said.

During a speech on the Senate floor in 1993 however, Biden warned of “predators on our streets” that were “beyond the pale.”

“They must be taken off the street,” Biden said. “Unless we do something about that cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them born out of wedlock without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing … we should focus on them now … they will, or a portion of them will become the predators 15 years from now, and madam president we have predators on our streets.”

Media fact-checkers flocked to the defense of their preferred presidential candidate, including CNN’s Daniel Dale, a predictable culprit.

Biden never used the phrase ""super predators."" (That was Hillary Clinton.) He did use the word ""predators""; the right scoffs at this fact check, but as @KFILE has explained, ""super predators"" was a specific term with a specific crime-theory meaning Biden didn't endorse. — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 23, 2020

NBC also made a similar fact-check, declaring Trump’s claim “mostly false” while acknowledging Biden’s 1993 comments.

“It was Hillary Clinton, then the first lady, who used the word ‘superpredator’ to advocate for the 1994 crime bill that Biden co-wrote more than 30 years ago,” NBC wrote. “Biden did warn of ‘predators’ in a floor speech in support of his bill, however.”

As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden played a pivotal role in getting the 1994 Crime Bill across the finish line earning the Delaware senator the title “Architect of Mass Incarceration,” by New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker last summer.

Biden’s crime bill was responsible for investing billions of federal dollars into the contemporary prison industrial complex giving Trump, who passed criminal justice reform in 2018 more credibility on the issue than his Democratic opponent less than two weeks before election day.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/22/yes-joe-biden-called-young-black-men-predators/,2020-10-22
"Democrat Rule Is Killing California, And It’s Coming For The Country","Despite likely seeing California Sen. Kamala Harris inaugurated as vice president alongside a Democratic president for whom an overwhelming majority of Californians voted so dutifully, California is looking to be the biggest loser of the 2020 contest. Our state’s most pressing problems, which were unaddressed in the run-up to the election, are getting worse. If California-style government continues to creep across America, as it will if Harris and running mate Joe Biden win, we can expect similar problems to creep nationwide.

COVID sucked the air out of the room in the presidential debates, and in the media in general. However, my home state was never debilitated by the Wuhan virus, which likely hit the West Coast in the early months of this year before spreading through the rest of the country, and never overwhelmed our hospitals.

Our Real Epidemic Is Drug Addiction

The real epidemic we are witnessing on our streets daily and with which so many of us have firsthand experience is the drug epidemic. Corona victims are not falling down dead on our streets, like they did in videos from China; opiate addicts are.

During our never-ending lockdown, drug overdoses in San Francisco reached two a day. For comparison, San Francisco has seen a total of 149 COVID deaths. While nearly all coronavirus patients eventually recover, few druggies do, so they stay on our streets until death, blocking off entire sections of the city and taking over public transportation.

This is by no means a new problem. West Cost cities have been plagued by homeless “encampments,” along with garbage, human waste, and undisposed syringes, for nearly a decade. Over this year, as residents have been ordered indoors, it only intensified. Clueless local officials used the federally sponsored Project RoomKey to house homeless addicts in empty luxury hotels and supply them drugs and booze, but sidewalk shantytowns continued sprawling.

Addicts and Lax Enforcement Fuel Crime

The twin problem of drug addiction is rampant criminality. Drug addiction causes criminality as junkies are looking to feed their habits. Both are traceable to Proposition 47, passed by voters in 2014. The law steeply reduced penalties for law breaking, including drug offenses, most of which are now misdemeanors, punishable by tickets addicts ignore.

Since theft worth less than $900 has also been reclassified as misdemeanor, in the post-47 environment criminals walk into stores and nonchalantly sweep merchandise into large garbage bags. Unable to cover the losses, retailers close, turning formerly lively urban enclaves into blight.

Car break-ins are commonplace, and so are home intrusions. Prosecutors generally don’t take on cases when offenses don’t carry serious penalties, and cops don’t bother arresting criminals they know will walk. Because of the media and political environment, California’s soft on crime policies have not been seriously examined by voters nationwide.

The new generation of George Soros-supported district attorneys (San Francisco’s Chesa Boudin is the poster child here) simply refuse to prosecute crime, including violent offenses like kidnapping and rape of a minor. Crime reporting is down, which is then paraded by supporters of the criminal justice reform as proof that their soft on crime approach is working. Yet anyone who has visited California in recent years knows it to be a lie.

This drug- and lax enforcement-fueled crime wave was unaddressed by this year’s presidential campaigns as Democrats were bowing down to Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Donald Trump pushed his own criminal justice reform. While it’s a fair policy to, for instance, release teens arrested for possession of small amounts of marijuana, this particular situation is not applicable to California, where the substance was decriminalized in 1975.

Excessive incarceration is not our problem either. A fair number of prisoners were released under Prop 47. More were freed a few years later under Proposition 57, which was sold to voters as a law that would allow for parole of “non-violent offenders,” only the offenses in question included categories like rape by intoxication, weapons charges, and so on. Only 23 specific charges made it to the list of violent offenses.

California is moving convicts out of San Quentin, the maximum-security prison that houses death row inmates, and was once home to Charles Manson. A judge required emptying San Quentin of its largely violent criminals due to a COVID outbreak, during which many of its residents died. The prison’s population is older and sicker, so a higher toll should be expected. Yet the state used this instance to empty out numerous prisons and jails, releasing criminals back into the streets even though most of the imprisoned population is young and healthy, and likelier to survive potential infection.

The Drug Epidemic Brought By Border Weakness

Trump’s 2016 signature rallying cry was “Build the wall.” Unfortunately, illegal immigration somehow dropped off the radar in 2020, yet nobody needed to revisit it more than California. We are a sanctuary state for international drug cartels, which are inflicting much of the devastation on our state.

For instance, the drug dealers who brazenly sell fentanyl in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood live in nearby Oakland. They are known to the authorities. Not only there is no effort to deport them, Boudin is refusing to do so on the grounds that they have been trafficked into the country.

Yet nothing is being proposed to stop human trafficking into California, and with Biden’s presumed inauguration we should be asking if these known fentanyl dealers, many of them without an official criminal history because demoralized police officers see no rationale in arresting them, will be allowed to become U.S. citizens through an amnesty.

California Could Learn a Lot from Trump

Because Trump’s economic policies were his strongest appeal during the election, partisan media was not interested in discussing them on the public square. That’s another big loss for my state, because we have much to learn from the Donald.

Although he is no doubt a big spender, the president successfully deregulated economic activity and lowered the tax burden, creating one of the biggest economic booms in history, from which low-income Americans benefited greatly. In the meantime, California’s economy is suffocating under overregulation and high taxes, with the middle class fleeing the state.

In a rare display of defiance, Californians voted for Proposition 22 this fall, which rolled back some of the crippling regulations the legislature imposed on freelancers last year. Assembly Bill 5 destroyed careers and livelihoods, and served as an immediate reminder of the intrusion of the state on agreements between employers and employees.

The effects of AB5 were felt personally and abruptly in a way that, for instance, the overregulation of schools or public utilities is not. Because voters don’t understand how these affect them, most of bureaucracies weighing on the Golden State remain intact.

Ordinary people have no language to talk about their problems. For instance, the “homelessness crisis” is really a drug and mental health crisis, but we continue to discuss it as if it’s an economic one. Similarly, illegal immigrants and criminals are assumed to be victims of white supremacy in a way that, for instance, Americans dying on the streets are not. Unable to speak about our problems, we double down on past failures.

For instance, last week Los Angeles elected the Soros-sponsored and BLM-endorsed District Attorney George Gascon. Gascon, who wrote Propositions 47 and 57, promised to go after cops and to dismantle the gang unit. His election is likely to cause a chain reaction of early retirements and resignations among experienced law enforcement professionals in Los Angeles County — a loss that is unlikely to be easily made up if the voters switch to a serious district attorney in the near future.

Virtue Signaling Will Not Solve These Problems

While Kamala may direct federal money to our near-bankrupt state that took months of lockdown pain to keep economic activity down to ensure a mail-in election, a federal rescue package is unlikely to affect our quality of life: it won’t put the junkies into rehab or punish criminals. Nor will it stop the forest fires, for that matter, or create economic opportunities in an overregulated environment.

It will function as a kind of needle exchange, like the “harm reduction” policy popular with local politicians, except not for the strung-out addicts but for the terminally dysfunctional technocratic machine. Bailouts may keep the state alive in the immediate future, hoping against hope that deep structural problems will magically resolve themselves, but in effect prolonging suffering for everyone.

A one-party state, California is taken for granted by politicians. Californians do not expect special attention from politicians either. I live a stone’s throw away from Harris’s birth town of Berkeley. I didn’t sense any excitement about her around here.

During the primaries I spotted many more Mayor Pete bumper stickers than Kamala gear. And, of course, she dropped out of the race when she polled in low single digits in California. I seriously doubt a single person in the Bay Area outside of the political machine can personally vouch for her, or say that she changed his life in a positive way. That’s considered normal.

Like Kamala, we approach the powers that be on our backs. Californians don’t expect much in return for faithfully voting for their party but the affirmation of leftist ideologies. If we want to improve our material and social well-being, if we want to leave free of fear, if we want our kids to be able to play in a sandbox at a nearby park without being poked by a hypodermic needle, we need to start thinking beyond “Everyone Believes” yard signs, and demand accountability from our politicians.

If Californians can’t master the will to protest-vote for a Republican, they should vote write-in, third party, or boycott elections. We must make our state competitive to force our politicians to abandon their left-wing rhetorical flourishes, and come up with common sense solutions for the problems that make our state unlivable. And the rest of the nation should heed our story.

FBI: U.S. Jews By Far Most Targeted Group In Anti-Religious Hate Crimes,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s newly released hate crime statistics show that Jews, who make up approximately 1.8 percent of the U.S. population, were overwhelmingly the most targeted in anti-religious hate crimes in 2019.

The FBI’s report says 60.2 percent of the 1,715 victims of anti-religious hate crimes in 2019 were targeted based on the offenders’ anti-Jewish bias. This percentage is up from 56.9 percent of victims motivated by offenders’ anti-Jewish bias. The next most frequently targeted group in the anti-religious category are Muslims, at about 13.2 percent of the hate crimes recorded in 2019.

While racial/ethnic/ancestral hate crimes have dropped slightly since 2018, anti-religious hate crimes were up from 18.7 percent in 2018 to 20.1 percent in 2019. In total, the FBI recorded 8,812 victims of hate crimes in the United States in 2019.

Earlier in the year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio came under fire for comments singling out Jewish communities for gathering despite COVID-19 lockdown orders.

“My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed,” he wrote. “I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period.”

My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period. — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) April 29, 2020

De Blasio did not deliver the same threats to any of the people who protested and rioted in the streets following the death of Geoge Floyd, a black man, despite the ongoing pandemic.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also targeted New York Jews, using decade-old photos from a rabbi’s funeral in 2006 to justify singling out the religious community for gathering despite lockdown orders.

“We know religious institutions have been a problem,” Cuomo said during a Monday press conference. “These are pictures from the past couple of weeks. And these are just emblematic. … What did you think was going to happen?”

Cuomo warns that if the Jewish community will not cooperate with the state on enforcing social distancing, services at houses of worship will be prohibited and greater enforcement will be in place on all gatherings. — Jacob Kornbluh (@jacobkornbluh) October 5, 2020

As the New York Times noted in February, “Anti-Semitic violence in the New York area has been more frequent lately than at any time in recent memory, with three people killed in a shooting at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, N.J., and five injured in a knife attack at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, N.Y,” causing more and more Jews to grow anxious about their well-being.

In 2018, the New York City Police Department reported that more than half of the city’s hate crimes were in Orthodox Jew neighborhoods. The Federalist’s New York Correspondent David Marcus noted in 2019, a significant contributor to failing to address anti-Jew violence is the failure to acknowledge that many of those attacking Jews have been black.

Trump’s Flynn Pardon Only Begins The Justice This Nation Deserves,"On Wednesday, President Trump pardoned an innocent man. Just before Thanksgiving, he signed an executive grant of clemency that provided Michael Flynn a full pardon and ended the criminal case against the retired lieutenant general.

Yet justice has not been served. And it may never be served. Justice for Michael Flynn requires something our country no longer possesses: an honest press.

Justice for Flynn requires the public to understand how the Obama-Biden administration, political appointees, career employees, special counsel attorneys, and a federal judge sought to destroy a war hero’s life to wreak revenge on Flynn for his service to Trump—and with a hope that Flynn’s demise would trigger Trump’s destruction. Justice for Flynn requires that those involved in this scandal be the object of public scorn.

The corporate media has refused to tell Americans the truth, so I will. And the damning facts go much beyond the evidence U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen, whom Attorney General William Barr charged with investigating the prosecution of Flynn, discovered. Here are six key aspects of the Flynn case the press buried that expose the travesty of justice heaped upon Flynn.

1. Special Counsel Threatened Flynn’s Son to Extract a Guilty Plea

When President Trump announced he was pardoning Flynn, the media took refuge in Flynn’s prior guilty plea to continue branding Flynn a criminal.

Yes, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with the Russian ambassador. When Judge Emmet Sullivan took over the case after Flynn pleaded guilty, Flynn stood by that plea when Sullivan questioned him.

But pleading guilty to a crime you didn’t commit isn’t a crime, and the evidence the special counsel’s office buried has established that is exactly what Flynn did: He pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in violation of Section 1001 while innocent of the charge.

Lying to the FBI constitutes a crime under Section 1001 only if the person making the statement knows the statement is false and the false statement concerns a material fact. Although in pleading guilty Flynn stated he knew his Jan. 24, 2019, statements to FBI Agents Peter Strzok and Joe Pientka about his conversation with the Russian ambassador were false, in moving to withdraw his guilty plea, Flynn maintained his innocence and professed that he “did not lie to them” and “believed I was honest with them to the best of my recollection at the time.”

An uninformed public is likely to discount such a recantation, especially when the press continues to push the “Flynn twice pleaded guilty” narrative and ignores the since-revealed details explaining why Flynn would plead guilty to a crime he did not commit.

As Flynn tells it, the week before he pleaded guilty, his attorneys at the time, Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, told Flynn that if he did not plead guilty his son, Michael G. Flynn, “could or would face indictment.” Also, on Nov. 30, 2017—the day before he pleaded guilty—Flynn’s former lawyers assured him that if he “accepted the plea, [his] son Michael would be left in peace.”

Flynn’s former attorneys later again reminded him of the threat to his son shortly before he appeared for the first time before Judge Sullivan. “Stay on the path,” his former attorneys counseled Flynn, because otherwise the government would “drag [Flynn’s] son back into the crosshairs.”

The public need not take Flynn’s word about the threats to target his son—emails from his lawyers confirm these facts. “We have a lawyers’ unofficial understanding that they are unlikely to charge Junior in light of the Cooperation Agreement,” one email read.

A second email likewise corroborated Flynn’s claim, while also suggesting prosecutors were intentionally hiding the Flynn Jr. deal to avoid “having to reveal it to other defendants against whom Flynn senior might testify.” Disclosing such impeachment testimony is constitutionally mandated by the Giglio court decision.

“The government took pains not to give a promise to [defendant Flynn] regarding Michael Jr., so as to limit how much of a ‘benefit’ it would have to disclose as part of its Giglio disclosures to any defendant against whom MTF may one day testify,” Flynn’s former attorney explained in another email.

That the Special Counsel’s Office used threats to prosecute Flynn’s son to extract a guilty plea from his father is also evident from the prosecution’s behavior after Flynn fired his Covington and Burling attorneys and hired Sidney Powell.

In a heated exchange between Powell and the lead prosecutor on the Flynn Case, Brandon Van Grack, Powell “informed Van Grack that Flynn would not testify that he had knowingly filed false Foreign Agent Registration Act statements in the government’s criminal case against Flynn’s former business partner, prosecutors added Flynn Jr. as a last-minute witness in that criminal case.” But after adding Flynn Jr. to the witness list, the prosecutors never called him to testify, “suggesting it was a scare tactic to get Dad back in line.”

2. Special Counsel Threats Against Flynn’s Son Were Improper

Not only did the special counsel’s office threaten Flynn’s son to force the elder Flynn to accept a plea bargain, the threats were improper. The public needs to know this fact because many assume the government plays for keeps when facing down criminals, so there is a collective shrug when prosecutors play hardball.

However, while threatening to prosecute third parties during plea negotiations is “not necessarily unconstitutional or even improper, . . . the Supreme Court has cautioned that where plea bargains involve ‘adverse or lenient treatment for some person other than the accused,’ it ‘might pose a great danger of inducing a false guilty plea by skewing the assessment of the risks a defendant must consider.’”

Further, case law stresses that promises of leniency to third parties have “coercive potential,” and that “where the threatened prosecution pertains to those with whom the defendant has familial ties or other close bonds, the threat of coercion is much greater.” For this reason, courts require the government to abide by “a high standard of good faith,” which at a minimum requires probable cause to prosecute a family member, when promising leniency

In Flynn’s case, the evidence establishes the Special Counsel’s Office violated that “high standard of good faith,” most clearly by hiding its promise of leniency to Flynn’s son in an apparent attempt to avoid its constitutional disclosure obligations to other defendants.

Even worse, federal prosecutor Van Grack, who handled the Flynn case both as a member of the special counsel’s team and later after the office closed, signed his name to the plea agreement, after stating “no agreements, promises, understandings, or representations have been made by the parties or their counsel other than those contained in writing herein, nor will any such agreements, promises, understandings, or representations be made unless committed to writing and signed by your client, defense counsel, and the Special Counsel’s Office.”

Van Grack’s representation in the plea agreement of no outside “understandings” cannot be squared with the internal emails summarizing the “gentleman’s agreement” between the Special Counsel’s Office and Flynn’s original attorneys. Van Grack’s assertion also conflicts with what Flynn’s attorneys told him after he signed the plea agreement—that they had “confirmed that the [Special Counsel’s Office] would no longer be pursuing [Flynn’s] son.”

So those condemning Flynn for lying to the court when he pleaded guilty should save their outrage for the special counsel’s office that lied to the court when it represented there were no outside “understandings.” Flynn at least had an understandable reason for lying, which can’t be said for the Special Counsel’s Office.

Not only does the evidence establish bad faith from the Special Counsel’s Office, the utter lack of probable cause to prosecute the younger Flynn rendered the threats improper. First, does anyone really doubt that if the Special Counsel’s Office had probable cause against the younger Flynn it would have indicted him?

Second, the only crime floated by the press as potentially implicating Flynn’s son concerned a supposed violation of the Foreign Agent Registration Act. But there is no FARA case against Flynn’s son—just as there is no case against the elder Flynn. Thus the special counsel’s threats to charge the younger Flynn were improper for this second reason.

3. Flynn’s Guilty Plea Was Invalid

The media and left-leaning pundits who continue to rely on Flynn’s guilty plea as a basis to brand the retired general a criminal are not only ignoring the wrongful threats made to Flynn to extract that plea, but also failing to report that Flynn filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea, which, given the facts of the case, should have been granted.

After Flynn hired Powell, Powell filed a motion to withdraw Flynn’s guilty plea. That motion was still pending when the Department of Justice filed its motion to dismiss the charge against Flynn, based on its conclusion that Flynn did not commit a crime.

Trump’s pardon of Flynn followed Judge Sullivan’s improper refusal to dismiss the charge against Flynn (more on that another day), but if the media is going to rely on the fact that Flynn entered a guilty plea to condemn the man, they owe the public the full facts, including that Flynn filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea based on his actual innocence of the charges.

Further, the public deserves to know that the government’s improper threats to Flynn’s son rendered the guilty plea involuntary. Likewise, the public needs to understand (again, a topic for another day) what the Special Counsel’s Office did, and what Flynn’s former attorneys did—and didn’t do—that led Flynn into entering the plea agreement and entitled Flynn to withdraw the guilty plea.

4. Flynn Did Not Lie to FBI Agents—And They Knew It

Corporate media also continues to report that Flynn lied to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when agents Strzok and Pientka interviewed him on Jan. 24, 2017. Sure, corporate outlets may note that after pleading guilty Flynn has since changed his story and now maintains his innocence, but the coverage ignores the overwhelming evidence establishing not only that Flynn did not lie, but that the FBI knew it—and the Special Counsel’s Office withheld that evidence from Flynn.

Flynn’s attorney, Powell, belatedly obtained this evidence from U.S. Attorney Jensen, which included notes dated Jan. 25, 2017, that stated the FBI assessed that yes, Flynn made false and inaccurate statements, but that agents “believed that Flynn believes that what he said was true,” and that the FBI concluded that Flynn was “largely telling truth as he believed it.”

A typed “Draft Work Product” dated Jan. 30, 2017, was even more explicit, stating that on Jan. 25, 2017, the FBI had “briefed the National Security Division and Office of Deputy Attorney General staff on their interview.” The “FBI advised that they believed Flynn believed what he was saying was true.”

Additional exculpatory evidence came later, when the 302 interview summary of the special counsel’s July 19, 2017, interview of Strzok was declassified. According to the 302, Strzok stated that following the interview of Flynn, he and Pientka “both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying.” Strzok also informed the special counsel’s office that after the interview, they “returned to FBI Headquarters and briefed [Andrew] McCabe and Baker on the interview,” and that “McCabe briefed Comey.”

He and Pientka ‘both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying.’

Strzok’s statement not only exonerates Flynn, it suggests Comey testified falsely to the House Committees on the Judiciary and Oversight during a Dec. 7, 2019, hearing. During that hearing, Comey was asked whether “either of those agents, or both” had told him “they did not adduce an intent to deceive from their interview with General Flynn.” Comey said “no.”

Rep. Trey Gowdy pressed Comey again, asking what Pientka and Strzok had told him about Flynn’s intent to deceive. “My recollection was,” Comey stated, “the conclusion of the investigators was he was obviously lying, but they saw none of the normal common indicia of deception: that is hesitancy to answer, shifting in seat, sweating, all the things that you might associate with someone who is conscious and manifesting that they are being—they’re telling falsehoods. There’s no doubt he was lying, but that those indicators weren’t there” (emphasis added).

Comey added while he had earlier testified before the House Intelligence Committee “that the agents observed none of the common indicia of lying — physical manifestations, changes in tone, changes in pace — that would indicate the person I’m interviewing knows they’re telling me stuff that ain’t true,” “[t]hat notwithstanding, they concluded he was lying.”

Without naming Comey, Attorney General Barr later commented on his statements. After noting that Jensen had served ten years as an FBI agent and 10 years as a career prosecutor prior to his appointment as a U.S. attorney, Barr noted he “found a lot of things that had not come to light before” about the targeting of Flynn.

“For example,” Barr stated, the evidence “showed clearly that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not think he was lying. Now, this was later minimized in testimony as suggesting ‘Well, they meant he didn’t break out into sweat and his eye pupils didn’t contract, that’s all they were saying.’” “No,” Barr declared emphatically. “They were saying he didn’t believe he thought he was lying at the time.”

The special counsel’s team did not inform Flynn of the truth, but instead led him to believe that yes, the agents thought he had lied.

Media has downplayed or ignored several other facts related to this revelation. First, that Pientka did not think Flynn was lying is significant because “we have learned from Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse that, prior to interviewing Flynn, FBI Agent Pientka had attended a briefing with then-candidate Trump and Flynn to assess Flynn’s demeanor.”

The IG report added that Pientka explained that he took “the opportunity to gain assessment and possibly have some level of familiarity with [Flynn],” such as learning “Flynn’s overall mannerisms.” “In this instance it actually proved useful, Horowitz’s report explained, “because [Pientka] was able to compare Flynn’s ‘norms’ from the briefing with Flynn’s conduct at the interview that [Pientka] conducted on January 24, 2017, in connection with the FBI’s investigation of Flynn.”

Pientka’s prior assessment of “Flynn’s demeanor” and his “overall mannerisms” and “norms” makes the FBI agents’ later assessment that Flynn did not lie all the more significant. Yet the special counsel team failed to turn over this evidence to Flynn’s attorneys.

Further, the 302 interview summary the special counsel’s team provided to Flynn’s attorneys before he entered into the plea agreement omitted any mention of the agents’ conclusion that Flynn had not lied to them. Also, before pleading guilty and in urging Flynn to accept the government’s plea offer, Flynn’s attorneys walked him through the 302 in detail.

Flynn pushed back, telling Kelner and Anthony that he did not believe he had lied in the White House interview with the FBI. Flynn reminded his attorneys that during that time period he had “has spoken to representatives of well over thirty countries, many in a single 24-hour period, during that very busy holiday season and presidential transition period.”

The FBI sprung a perjury trap on Flynn during the Jan. 24, 2017 interview.

Even more troubling is what happened next: Flynn asked his “former attorneys to make further inquiry with the [Special Counsel’s Office] prosecutors about whether the FBI agents believed that [Flynn] had lied to them,” as Flynn had heard rumors that the agents had not thought Flynn had lied.

“Mr. Kelner and Mr. Anthony left the room to call the SCO prosecutors” Flynn stated, and “when they returned, they informed [Flynn’s wife] and [Flynn] that they had been told that the ‘agents stand by their statements.” Flynn then decided to accept the plea agreement.

So not only did the government withhold this evidence from Flynn, when directly asked whether the interviewing agents believed Flynn had lied, the special counsel’s team did not inform Flynn of the truth, but instead led him to believe that yes, the agents thought he had lied.

These facts were also buried from the public, as was the evidence that FBI lawyer Lisa Page had wordsmithed the agents’ 302 statement, even though standard procedure calls for the interviewing agents to complete the form.

Another lesser known fact concerns Flynn’s statement to agents during the Jan. 24, 2017 interview that he assumed the FBI knew the content of his conversation with Kislyak. It makes no sense for Flynn to say to Strzok and Pientka, “You know what we discussed on the calls,” only to then intentionally misstate the substance of the conversations.

What does make sense, however, is what later evidence uncovered by U.S. Attorney Jensen established: that the FBI sprung a perjury trap—where the “government questions a witness for the primary purpose of obtaining a statement from him in order to prosecute him later for perjury”—on Flynn during the Jan. 24, 2017 interview.

“What is our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?” the since-retired FBI Counterintelligence Division Assistant Director Bill Priestap wrote in handwritten notes released earlier this year.

The FBI also decided not to show Flynn the transcript of his call with the Russian ambassador, even though that would be the standard procedure.

Additional behind-the-scene details confirm the interview was a set-up of Flynn. For instance, before questioning Flynn, the agents strategized over how to provide the 1001 admonition (a warning given to a target that lying to FBI agents is a federal offense) without alerting Flynn to the real purpose of their questioning. In the end, no warning was given, in violation of FBI policy. The FBI also decided not to show Flynn the transcript of his call with the Russian ambassador, even though that would be the standard procedure, according to Priestap’s notes.

A text message from Strzok to Page further confirms the purpose of the interview was to elicit a statement from Flynn that was false—even if Flynn did not intentionally lie to the agents. “Describe the feeling, nervousness, excitement knowing we had just heard him denying it all. Knowing we’d have to pivot into asking. Puzzle round and round about it. Talk about the funny details. Remember what I said that made Andy [McCabe] laugh and ask if he really said that,” Strzok wrote Page after questioning Flynn.

Added to all of these details was the release two months ago of a statement by FBI Special Agent William Barnett, who worked on the Crossfire Hurricane case and later for the Special Counsel’s Office. Barnett told troubling details about the investigation, including the fact that he was “cut out” of the Jan. 24, 2017, interview of Flynn and only learned that it had taken placed afterward.

Typically, “a line agent/case agent would do the interview with a senior FBI official present in cases concerning high ranking political officials,” notes from U.S. Attorney Jensen’s interview of Barnett read. In his interview with Jensen’s team, Barnett also noted that he and other line agents were excluded from meetings about the Flynn investigation, with former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe personally directing it. Barnett added that an analyst who was “very skeptical of the Flynn collusion investigation” was removed from the investigation.

The interview of Flynn also violated the FBI’s protocols that called for White House counsel to be involved in questioning of members of the administration, which is likely why Comey went “rogue” and sent Strzok and Pientka to interview Flynn without telling then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates. “I was upset that Director Comey didn’t coordinate that with us and acted unilaterally,” Yates would later tell the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Together these facts tell a damning story of the FBI scheming to induce Flynn to make a false statement to FBI agents, which he did, based on an insufficient recall. Then, even while believing Flynn had spoken what he thought was the truth, the Special Counsel’s Office extracted a guilty plea from Flynn while hiding the evidence supporting Flynn’s actual innocence of the charge. The evidence here is plentiful, but it was also hidden by the corporate media.

5. As a Matter of Law, Flynn Is Also An Innocent Man

Not only did Flynn not lie to the FBI, even if he had intentionally made a false statement during the Jan. 24, 2017 interview, he still committed no crime because Section 1001 requires a false statement to be “material” to be criminal. As U.S. Attorney Jensen concluded following an independent review of the case, Flynn’s statements to Agents Strzok and Pientka were not material to any investigation.

In prosecuting Flynn, government attorney Van Grack represented to the court that Flynn’s purported “false statements to the FBI on January 24, 2017, were absolutely material,” claiming that “at the time of the January 24 interview, the FBI was conducting a counterintelligence investigation into whether individuals associated with the campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump were coordinating with the Russian government in its activities to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.”

“The defendant’s conduct and communications with Russia went to the heart of that inquiry,” Van Grack argued, as “[a]ctions such as the defendant’s communications with the Russian Ambassador about U.S. Sanctions could have been indicative of such coordination.”

The evidence withheld from Flynn until recently refutes this entire line of argument and establishes the government’s representations to the court were false.

The evidence withheld from Flynn until recently refutes this entire line of argument and establishes the government’s representations to the court were false: Comey did not send FBI agents Strzok and Pientka to question Flynn because of the counterintelligence investigation into supposed Russia collusion. Rather, as Priestap’s handwritten notes highlight, the goal was clear: “to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.”

The internal communications previously withheld from Flynn’s legal team, including new text messages released in late September 2020, reveal just how ridiculous—and pretextual—the supposed investigation into Flynn was.

These documents establish that on Jan. 4, 2017, the FBI transmitted documentation to close the Crossfire Razor investigation into Flynn because he “was no longer a viable candidate as part of the larger Crossfire Hurricane umbrella case.” Just 20 minutes later, Strzok desperately texted an unknown FBI agent, directing the agent to keep the Flynn investigation open because of a dictate from the “7th floor,” meaning the upper leadership of the FBI.

As Page would later quip to her partner in adultery, Strzok, the “utter incompetence” of the FBI proved to be “serendipitiously good,” as the Flynn case had not been closed and thus, at least on paper, there was an investigative purpose to question Flynn.

But from the text messages more recently dumped in late September 2020, and largely ignored by the press, we now know this was the second time the FBI kept open the Flynn case to justify spying on the Trump transition team and later administration. Several text messages indicating that as early as November 8, 2016—the same day as the 2016 presidential election—the Flynn investigation was to be closed but was later re-opened in early January of 2017.

As The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway and Sean Davis reported, “[t]he new disclosures made by DOJ also show that the FBI used so-called national security letters (NSLs) to spy on Flynn’s finances.” The text messages also indicated “the NSLs were just being used as a pretext by FBI leadership to buy time to find dirt on Flynn after the first investigation of him yielded no derogatory information.”

This was the second time the FBI kept open the Flynn case to justify spying on the Trump transition team and later administration.

“[T]he decision to NSL finances for Razor bought him time,” one agent texted, two weeks after the initial closing documents on Flynn went through. The additional early-December text exchanges showed the agents knew the NSL ploy was a crock: “What do we expect to get from an NSL[?] We put out traces, tripwires to community and nothing.” “[B]ingo,” came the reply, followed by “Hahah this is a nightmare.”

Yes, it was a nightmare—for Flynn and his family.

Not only was the FBI’s continued “investigation” of Flynn a fraud, previously withheld internal documents establish that in attempting to justify the questioning of Flynn, the FBI didn’t even pretend they were doing so because of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into supposed Russia collusion. Rather, the only investigative purpose the FBI team floated to justify the interview of Flynn was the Logan Act.

Priestap’s notes summarizing the meeting the higher-ups in the FBI held the day before the Flynn interview revealed that reality. And now we have FBI Agent Barnett’s statement to U.S. Attorney Jensen that he was instructed to keep the investigation into Flynn “open and investigate Flynn for a Logan Act violation,” further confirming the charade.

Flynn never discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Never. The transcript of Flynn’s call with Kislyak establishes that fact beyond doubt.

While behind the scenes the FBI pretended the Logan Act justified their questioning of Flynn, the Special Counsel’s Office and holdover prosecutor Van Grack didn’t even dare to cite that “antiquated and most assuredly unconstitutional law” as the basis for the continued investigation of Flynn. Instead, Van Grack misrepresented to the court that Flynn’s statements were material to its investigation into Russia collusion because Flynn’s “communications with the Russian Ambassador about U.S. Sanctions” might have indicated coordination.

And in this statement we have another huge problem with the government’s entire case against Flynn: Flynn never discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Never. The transcript of Flynn’s call with Kislyak establishes that fact beyond doubt.

Yet in the Statement of Offense filed with the court on Dec. 1, 2017, by the Special Counsel’s Office, Van Grack attested that on Dec. 29, 2016, “FLYNN called the Russian Ambassador and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. Sanctions in a reciprocal manner.” Van Grack then signed the statement of offense, “stipulat[ing] and agree[ing]” that the facts detailed in the Statement of Offense were “true and accurate.”

The facts were neither true nor accurate. Again, Flynn never discussed sanctions with Kislyak.

Now, Flynn did discuss the expulsions of Russian diplomats with Kislyak, but the expulsions and sanctions were two entirely separate issues. And here we have another great irony in this case: The Special Counsel’s Office, with its hordes of lawyers and FBI agents and access to the transcript of Flynn’s call with Kislyak, was confused about what Flynn and the Russian ambassador discussed, yet Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team charged Flynn with lying to the FBI when Flynn didn’t remember the same details a month after the call, without access to a transcript, and when that call was one of several Flynn took on a daily basis with foreign officials.

6. Flynn Was a Tool to Get Trump

So why did the Special Counsel’s Office charge Flynn when he didn’t lie to the FBI, the FBI agents didn’t think he lied, and even if they had been false the statements were immaterial to any legitimate investigative purpose?

FBI Agent Barnett told U.S. Attorney Jensen the answer: “the Special Counsel Office pursued Flynn simply as a means to ‘get Trump.’” But Americans never heard the answer because a dishonest corporate media buried the story—just as they buried the truth that Michael Flynn is an innocent man.

DC Police Investigating ‘Black Lives Matter’ Sign Burning As Potential Hate Crime,"The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of Washington, D.C. is investigating a “Black Lives Matter” sign burning that occurred at pro-Trump and “Stop the Steal” protests on Saturday as a potential hate crime.

“The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating this offense as potentially being motivated in whole or in part by hate or bias. The designation can be changed at any point as an investigation proceeds and more information is gathered,” a press release from the department read.

MPD seeks suspects in a Destruction of Property offense that occurred on 12/12/20 in the 900 blk of 11th St, NW. MPD is investigating this offense as potentially being motivated by hate or bias.

While the MPD said the event appeared to be “motivated … by hate or bias,” prosecutors have the freedom to decide if they will litigate it as such.

MPD, Crime Solvers of Washington, DC, MPD, the FBI Washington Field Office are offering rewards totaling $3,000 “for information which leads to arrest and indictment of suspects in this case.”

Video footage from The Daily Caller Reporter Shelby Talcott shows a group of “Proud Boys and Trump supporters” gathering around the banner, which appears to have been torn down from Asbury United Methodist Church and dousing it in a type of fuel before lighting it.

Going Soft On Crime Has Turned Seattle Into Another American Wasteland,"“Seattle no longer feels the need to stop anyone from doing anything for any reason, at any time. The most stunning city in America is dying, all right.”

So begins “The Fight for the Soul of Seattle,” a 90-minute documentary produced by KOMO News, which for years has reported on Seattle’s pervasive drug problems and associated perils. The local news station, which premiered the feature last weekend, produced a similarly themed broadcast entitled “Seattle is Dying” last year that received more than 10 million views and several regional film awards.

Over the last 10 years, Seattle has experienced a dramatic increase in crime tied to rampant addiction and homelessness. For example, the Seattle Police Department reported a 50 percent increase in calls related to life-threatening emergencies, assault, and burglary, as well as an 80 percent increase in calls for domestic violence. In 2020 alone, the murder rate was double the average of the past decade.

Through investigative reporting that mixes in testimony from citizens, city officials, and even addicts, the film lays out its central thesis: There exists a “philosophical divide” when it comes to governing Seattle, with city leaders on one side and failed citizens on the other. Unless these politicians change course and shift from their misguided compassion to real solutions, these epidemics will escalate and ultimately destroy the Emerald City.

CHAZ: A Symbol of Seattle’s Decay

Perhaps the most significant demonstration of Seattle’s stark divide was in the city’s response to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, also known as CHAZ or CHOP, a six-block stretch that was overtaken and declared independent by local activists amid this summer’s Black Lives Matter protests. In a move that garnered national attention, the City of Seattle instructed police to cede control of the area, which included a police precinct as well as homes, businesses, and citizens suddenly left to fend for themselves.

City officials outwardly touted the zone as a quaint block party where people sang around bonfires and distributed free kebabs. Mayor Jenny Durkan suggested CHAZ would bring about a “summer of love,” and city councilmembers cheered with celebratory selfies.

Those grounded in reality, however, recognized the truth: The zone bred lawlessness and violence. “In eight days, there were five shootings in the CHOP area, with six victims,” KOMO reported. “There was a rape and various assaults and beatings and buildings set on fire.”

Still, the city refused to step in until it was too late. On June 20, 19-year-old Lorenzo Anderson was shot and killed. Police couldn’t clear the area, and first responders were too late. A week later, 16-year-old Antonio Mays Jr. was killed. Police did not arrive until five hours after the shooting.

Even after the zone’s dissolution, violence and protests have continued largely unabated. In August, activists tried to cement shut a police precinct and set it ablaze with the express intent of trapping officers inside to die. Looting and rioting have all but destroyed the city’s retail core, contributing to the closures of more than 140 businesses, from big-name department stores such as Macy’s and Columbia to iconic local businesses such as Bergman Luggage and Zanadu comics.

The Failed ‘Compassion’ of City Leaders

How did Seattle get here? Look no further than the City Council, which has aided and abetted this rising criminality by crippling the Seattle Police Department. “The institution of policing itself must be dismantled,” Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda said during one meeting earlier this year. Councilmember Lorena Gonzales agreed, saying, “Now is the time to divest from the police department.”

True to their words, the council disbanded the SPD’s Navigation Team, which partnered with social workers to engage the homeless and clear the encampments that pervade the city. They later voted to slash the SPD budget by 20 percent, prompting layoffs and the resignation of Chief Carmen Best.

“The overriding goal is to impose social justice as opposed to criminal justice,” posits one Seattle judge in the film, and City Attorney Pete Holmes has led the charge. Since taking office in 2010, Holmes has adopted a policy of diversion, partnering with the Department of Public Defense to pressure Seattle’s judges into upholding a catch-and-release policy wherein repeat offenders are not sentenced or held accountable, but directed to social services or let go altogether.

Under Holmes’s direction, the city has effectively legalized stealing and has opted not to prosecute nearly all crimes that fall beneath a felony conviction. This “hands-off” approach sounds loving in theory, but in practice it has allowed many violent offenders, some with upwards of 75 convictions, to roam free.

Seattleites Have Been Hoodwinked

While Seattle is famously leftist, residents did not ask for this. Although elections are often a choice between far-left and even further left, nearly all major city leaders campaigned on a tough approach to crime and advocated for more police as recently as last year.

My district’s council representative, Dan Strauss, told the Seattle Times that he supported adding officers as well as establishing an entirely new precinct in North Seattle. Andrew Lewis, another councilmember, admitted during his campaign that “we don’t have the staffing numbers to have effective community policing strategies that deter the kinds of crimes of opportunity that are prolific.”

As soon as the political winds blew the other way, however, the council changed its tune. Councilwoman Lisa Herbold, for example, previously backed a plan to add 200 officers to the force, yet this year she pledged to defund police and most recently sponsored a proposal that would expand “duress” as a legal defense to include symptoms of addiction, mental illness, or poverty.

If passed, the measure would help a criminal evade conviction by simply blaming his or her crime on a drug problem or financial need, for example. As former public safety adviser, Scott Lindsay notes, “Over 100 different crimes listed under the Seattle municipal code would effectively be nullified,” including assaults, harassment, trespassing, and even cyberstalking and sexual exploitation.

Dear Seattle, It’s Time to Intervene

The events of this year have brought to the fore Seattle’s preeminent failing: It has mistaken nonintervention for compassion and has tolerated addiction, crime, and homelessness to the point of cruelty. As former addict Ginny Burton warns, leaving addicts unsupported and expecting them to make rational choices for themselves is its own form of insanity. “As a society,” she says, “we’re loving people to death.”

The documentary mentions a notoriously dangerous stretch of Third Avenue in downtown Seattle, which sees hundreds of assaults per year and has three times the crime reports of anywhere else in the city. For two years, I used a bus stop on this block for work, and every single day I witnessed a plethora of illegal activities: people dealing drugs, shooting up heroin, selling stolen goods, defecating on the sidewalk, and violently harassing passersby.

Several of my coworkers have been physically assaulted walking to work, and the Starbucks beneath our office is the victim of frequent theft and vandalism. One memorable afternoon, a group of us looked across the street to see two homeless people openly fornicating on a park bench, yet we didn’t even find it shocking. Why would we? These crimes are now ubiquitous in nearly all Seattle neighborhoods.

The fight for the soul of Seattle, it seems, is not between left and right, nor between the government and the people. It is between those who prefer to look away and those who see this crisis for what it is. Let’s hope the latter wins.

"News Reporting On Crime Isn’t Racist, It’s Essential","Among the many things 2020 has helped clarify is that journalism, particularly the journalism practiced by the corporate media, is in bad shape. From the media’s coverage of impeachment (remember that?), to the presidential election, to the pandemic and the riots and everything else, it has become painfully obvious that the establishment press isn’t interested in journalism as such, but in woke political activism and race hustling.

So no wonder the very smart journalists at Harvard’s Nieman Lab want to “defund the crime beat” because reporting on crime is apparently now racist.

That’s the gist of a recent piece published as part of Nieman’s series on “predictions for journalism 2021.” It’s not so much a prediction as a shoddy argument, though, and it opens with the blanket claim that “Crime coverage is terrible.”

It’s racist, classist, fear-based clickbait masking as journalism. It creates lasting harm for the communities that newsrooms are supposed to serve. And because it so rarely meets the public’s needs, it’s almost never newsworthy, despite what Grizzled Gary in his coffee-stained shirt says from his perch at the copy desk.

Haha, get it? Grizzled Gary is old-school in a bad way, untutored in the finer points of woke journalism, and although he might not be personally racist, he supports crime coverage that serves “three powerful constituencies: white supremacy, law enforcement, and newsrooms—specifically a newsroom’s bottom line.”

Employing prose better suited to a graduate seminar on critical race theory than a newsroom, authors Tauid Chappell and Mike Rispoli go on to argue that because crime beat reporters often rely on the police for basic information when reporting crime stories, such stories can’t be trusted because the police can’t be trusted. In their minds, the crime beat is a nexus of greedy news media owners and racist cops. But this is of course a caricature unconnected to the reality of actual newsrooms.

What Chappell and Rispoli miss, maybe because they’ve never covered a crime beat themselves, is that most reporters don’t just regurgitate what police tell them. They talk to families, lawyers, witnesses—as many people as they can to verify the facts and get a clear picture of what happened, usually on a tight deadline.

I know a little about this because I was once a crime beat reporter. My first job in journalism was at my hometown newspaper in southcentral Alaska, and like most cub reporters I was given the cops and courts beat.

It was a good beat for rookies because it was good training. You had to gather facts quickly, ask questions on the fly, and produce copy against a deadline. It could also be monotonous. Most days I would drive to one of two local police stations or the state trooper post and read through incident reports for the “police blotter” section, mostly just cases of DUIs, petty theft, and assault.

But sometimes the monotony paid off and I found a real story (which is part of why news outlets have beat reporters at all). One morning, I came across a longer report. State troopers had arrested a couple on charges of kidnapping and multiple counts of felony assault. It turned out their victims were their five children, three girls and two boys, aged 6 to 15, all of them adopted. The couple had been foster parents to all of the children, and at one point was collecting $3,400 from the state to care for them.

In the process of reporting the story, what I discovered shocked and sickened me—and in fact shocked the entire state. The couple had been running what amounted to a torture camp for their adopted children—beating them, locking them in cages, chaining them to trees outside for days on end, depriving them of food.

The case triggered an investigation of the state’s Office of Children’s Services, which had been responsible for vetting and approving the couple as foster parents and allowing the adoptions to go through. It also triggered a lawsuit, which the state settled in 2014, paying $1 million to one of the abused boys but admitting no wrongdoing.

I mention all this because the outlets that first broke the story—my own local paper and the paper in Anchorage—did so because lowly beat reporters had been leafing through police incident reports as part of their unglamorous daily grind.

Beat reporting, in other words, is an important part of journalism. Reporters covering a beat might understandably get bored with it sometimes but they also become experts on their beat, developing sources, building relationships, and most importantly, being there to catch news that might otherwise go unreported. This is especially true of city hall reporters, who are often the only people covering otherwise mind-numbing municipal hearings that can have huge consequences for residents of a city or town.

As local newspapers wither and die across the country, beat reporting is dying out, too. This is bad for actual journalism but good, I guess, if your goal is something other than actual journalism. Chappell and Rispoli, for example, work for a media nonprofit called Free Press, an entity whose self-described social justice mission involves “uplifting the voices of people of color in the media,” and “reimagining local journalism.”

The journalism they’re reimagining, though, isn’t the kind that will simply report news in the public interest, let alone catch major stories that would otherwise go unreported. It’s the kind of journalism that would rather lecture the public about racism and confirm boilerplate woke pieties. As a vision of what American journalism should be, it’s pretty dismal. But as a prediction for where corporate journalism is headed in 2021, it’s probably right on the money.

Radical Democrats Are Turning Minneapolis Into A Violent Wasteland,"The world witnessed in the streets of Minneapolis this spring and summer the feature presentation after many increasingly violent coming attractions, created, produced, and distributed by a one-party, radical left government.

If you want to know what the real-time self-destruction of a city looks like, Minneapolis offers the perfect model. This is no Detroit-esque collapse prompted by the degeneration of an industry-dependent metropolis. This is the willful push down the path of ruin of a city burgeoning with opportunity and rife with promises of the American Dream. It is suicide.

Downtown’s ghost-town feel is taking a dystopian turn as empty streets are being taken over by a resurging homeless population openly using drugs and increasingly aggressive. The mentally ill are left to similar fates, often found huddled in bus shelters.

A decline in police and mental health resources compounds the impending disaster as winter deepens and shelters fill. This is a city in which some of the most recognizable companies make their national and regional headquarters: Target, General Mills, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Xcel Energy. They have the resources to ride out the lockdowns, but the corner hot-dog stand, skyway mini-mart, and corner bar likely don’t.

The disease plaguing the streets of Minneapolis’ north side and the areas around Chicago Avenue and Lake Street is less about COVID and more about the consequences of what Fyodor Dostoyevsky asks of man in “Notes from the Underground,” “But why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos?” For a far-left Minneapolis City Council at war with its police force and local citizens yet maintaining control due to leftist activism and special interests, the answer may be in the blind devotion to the radical belief of constantly burning and building into the unattainable utopia they so hubristically believe they can create.

This idea has been building for some time. After Jamar Clark was killed by police in Minneapolis in November 2015, three weeks of protests ensued, including a freeway shut-down, rallies, and sit-ins at City Hall and the Fourth Precinct police station.

These were organized by the newly formed group Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar (TCCJ4J), an organization connected with the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (NAARPR), a Marxist group allied with Angela Davis and the Black Lives Matter organization. They culminated in the resignation of MPD Chief Janeé Harteau at the request of the Democratic Party mayor of Minneapolis, Betsy Hodges, in 2017.

Any lessons that could have been learned were repeatedly and effectively dismissed by civic leaders, government officials, and radical counter-community groups as insufficient to counter what they believe is an inherently racist system. City government, which is wholly controlled by Democrats, simply moved the deck chairs on this sinking ship at the behest of radical groups using intimidation tactics to encourage not justice and reform, but to disband the police department.

As the leadership vacuum in the city erased fortitude in the name of justice, violent rioters, looters, and opportunists sought their fortunes amid the helpless businesses in their paths. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey sacrificed the Police Third Precinct building, let the roving mob reduce the city to a smoldering pile of ashes, then engaged the equally inept governor in a game of finger-pointing to evade his responsibility to a community suffering from shell-shock.

Although seemingly improbable, the situation in Minneapolis has declined since the riots, at least for the citizens held hostage by the smug arrogance of the people charged with acting in their best interest. The city earned the nickname “Murdereapolis” during its crime spike in the mid-‘90s. Instead of looking to successful policies used to counter that crime wave—increasing the number and presence of law enforcement officers for several months—the Minneapolis City Council wants to do the exact opposite.

In June, the council forwarded a proposal to the city’s charter commission to give voters a chance to eliminate the funding requirement for the police department. That proposal would have allowed the city to defund and dismantle the police and create a new Community Safety and Violence Prevention department. The commission tabled the proposal for a later date.

Meanwhile, homicides in Minneapolis reached 77 on just one day this month and a murder rate, according to AH Datalytics, up more than 78 percent relative to 2019. Violent crime is also at record levels, and property crime, robberies, theft, and carjackings have all increased substantially as well.

Final national murder update of 2020: Murder up 36.7% in 57 agencies with data through at least September (though most have data through November). Murder up in 51 of 57, 37 of 58 agencies reporting murder up more than 30%. Spreadsheet here: https://t.co/vEhKHuFNrY pic.twitter.com/5HgVmwGmDS — Jeff Asher (@Crimealytics) December 29, 2020

Despite pleas from citizens held captive in their own homes and speaking out through community groups like Lisa Clemons’s A Mother’s Love Initiative, the radicals on the City Council use race to perpetuate a culture of victimhood to advance their agenda, instead of finding ways to work with community groups and the police to solve problems. Now, eight residents are suing the City Council and Frey, arguing they violated the city charter’s requirement to staff approximately 743 officers for the 425,000-person city.

Since May, roughly 150 of approximately 800 MPD officers have quit, retired, or taken disability or personal leaves. The shortage prompted Police Chief Medaria Arradondo to request hiring officers from other jurisdictions. He met skepticism and a severe budget shortfall that ironically has resulted in the City of Minneapolis paying officers to retire.

To add to the frustration of a city desperate for an end to the chaos and for leaders to increase public safety and heal the city, in an Orwellian-named “Safety for All Budget Plan” the council cut $8 million from the mayor’s 2021 police budget.

The mayor had proposed 888 officers, a number already reduced by the city’s budget woes, but the city only funded an average of 770 officers for 2021. For a city in crisis, this makes as much sense as trying to put out a fire with a can of gasoline. The only thing this plan will extinguish is any hope for the people left suffering daily violence in their neighborhoods.

A city reeling from a summer of chaos and violence and serving as a laboratory for radical, power-mongering autocrats is a case study in how a city commits suicide. Just don’t phone the police. There might not be anyone to answer the call.

"Legalizing Drugs, Opening Border Will Only Worsen U.S. Addiction Crisis","As the nation prepares for the incoming Biden-Harris administration the new president promises will be “the most progressive in history,” many drug policy practitioners wonder with trepidation what this will mean for the country’s drug crisis.

Record levels of methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl, not to mention surging tonnage of cocaine and black market marijuana, are pouring across our borders at the hands of ruthless Mexican drug cartels, directly fueling ever-increasing overdose deaths and crime. So leftists’ stated objectives and record on drugs and crime should worry all Americans.

We can get a preview of the new administration’s more “nuanced” counterdrug approach by examining “The Biden Plan to End the Opioid Crisis” from the campaign. It doesn’t look promising. Long on therapeutic programs and short on reducing drug availability through border security and targeting drug trafficking organizations, it boldly declares that “Biden will tackle this crisis by making sure people have access to high quality health care.”

It also proudly calls for an incomprehensible $125 billion in additional spending to “make prevention, treatment and recovery services available to all,” which will accomplish little more than expanding the already bloated government-sponsored compassion industry. Bowing to the far left wing of the party, the Biden plan also promises to “reform the criminal justice system so that no one is incarcerated for drug use alone”—a debunked myth.

Virtually no one goes to prison for simply using drugs, especially at the federal level. According to a 2015 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, only about 16 percent of our state prisoners are there for drug offenses—nearly all for distribution. Drug possession accounts for only 3.6 percent of the total. Federally, nearly all drug offenders (99.5 percent) are serving time for major trafficking.

The incessant cry from the radical left (and often the libertarian right) that “the war on drugs has failed” has lately been destructively amplified with demands to “defund,” or “abolish,” or even “f-ck the police.” Their misguided and malicious charges that U.S. law enforcement professionals are the principal perpetrators of “systemic racism” and “mass incarceration” reveal a breathtaking ignorance about what is required to maintain safety and order on the mean streets of modern America.

Such reckless slogans by the far-left wing of the Democrat Party have been matched with equally reckless action. From House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s repeated attempts to legalize marijuana at the federal level—most recently by passing the MORE Act in the House of Representatives on Dec. 4—to Oregon decriminalizing the possession of even heroin and methamphetamine at the state level, to Seattle sponsoring “safe-injection sites” for heroin users across the city, such catastrophic actions mainly serve to demonstrate how enlightened, sophisticated and caring leftist leaders are in their approach to the drug war.

Attempting to excuse or medicalize the entire drug crisis, while vilifying the police for “filling our prisons with drug users,” not only makes the problem worse, but undermines the ability of our criminal justice system to reduce the predatory behavior of individuals and organizations that seek to prey upon our fellow citizens for profit.

To argue that the drug problem should be solved therapeutically, not criminally, simply because it involves the “medical” problem of addiction, ignores the role that drug availability plays in developing and expanding new markets. Would one make the same argument in attempting to deal with the trafficking of child pornography by pursuing only treatment and prevention programs for the addicted?

Few remember that when President Nixon declared his “war against drugs” in 1971, his principal weapon in our national struggle was actually drug treatment. Recognizing the need to reduce the alarming rise of drug use in our society, Nixon increased drug treatment funding eight-fold within two years, consuming nearly two-thirds of our total federal drug control budget.

But the president—and the country—came to learn the limitations of government’s ability to affect behavior solely through therapeutic means. Without the ability to compel drug users into long-term treatment, most attempts at drug treatment failed miserably and repeatedly—an outcome that largely continues today.

Landmark research from Boston University in 2006 and detailed in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment put the mean number of drug treatment episodes at 6.9 times over a six-and-one-half-year period. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health published findings in 2010 which revealed that more than 90 percent of opioid users tragically returned to their drug use following treatment, most within one week. That’s why they call it a “chronic, relapsing condition.”

So, too, with drug prevention. Drug policy expert Mark Kleiman from New York University has written that, although we so want to believe in its efficacy (after all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure) “the hard scientific evidence concerning drug prevention” has shown completely “underwhelming results.” He further notes, “Even the best prevention programs have only modest effects on actual behavior, and many programs have no effect at all on drug use.”

We have learned through experience that, although drug prevention and treatment programs must continue to be made available and improved upon through evidence-based practices in order to help at the margins, government’s role—not that of society-at-large, but government—can make the greatest positive impact by reducing drug availability. That is, interdicting drug shipments and arresting, prosecuting, and imprisoning drug dealers.

In fact, over the long-term, given the continuing limited success of treatment and prevention programs, drug enforcement may be the most effective, and compassionate, anti-drug program available to us today.

It has been perplexing to see former senator Biden denounce the 1994 Crime Bill—one he helped draft, and that received overwhelming support from the Congressional Black Caucus and the African American community—to pander to radical, anti-law and order groups demanding the dangerously unrealistic nullification of our police.

The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 was a direct response to the explosion of crime and violence that accompanied the crack scourge across the country in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, one that incontrovertibly caused homicide rates in most of our cities to intolerably spike to record levels in 1993. That is, until now.

Thanks to a deadly combination of sentimental, i.e., “woke,” ideologies that excuse criminal behavior, combined with new and ever-more potent and addictive drugs flooding into our communities, homicide numbers are breaking new records across the land this year.

Final national murder update of 2020: Murder up 36.7% in 57 agencies with data through at least September (though most have data through November).

We didn’t treat or prevent our way out of the crack epidemic. Those programs helped, but we gained the upper hand by enforcing legitimate and reasonable state, federal, and international laws against illegal drugs.

From multilateral efforts targeting cocaine labs in South America, to enhanced Caribbean interdiction operations, right down to taking back our communities from the violent gangs and dealers who constituted the foot soldiers of the cartels, it was our collective national will to do what was necessary, however distasteful to some, to rescue our society from catastrophe. One can only hope we can muster such a will again, or the consequences will be dire.

Defunding The Police Will Mean More More Pain For The Poor,"In Philadelphia in January, 25-year old Milan Loncar — a recent Temple University graduate and husband to be — was walking his dog when he was brutally gunned down in the streets of Philadelphia, the victim of an armed robbery that he did not resist. He died while still holding the leash of his rescue dog.

The gunman had a violent criminal history and should have been in jail the night of Loncar’s murder, but he had been released on reduced bail just two weeks prior. Due to the crack work of Philadelphia’s Finest, the 20-year old habitual criminal was apprehended within hours of the crime. But what if the police were no longer on the job?

We should anticipate more senseless crimes like this in the days ahead fueled by radical public policies that call for defunding law enforcement and eliminating cash bail. The proponents of these policies envision a utopian state in which criminals repent, victims forgive, and we all merrily sit around the community campfire singing “Kumbaya.” The reality is likely to be far different.

The left has gained the power of the White House as well as of Congress. Their new Wild West is upon us. Buckle up, it’s going to be a rough ride.

Economic Concerns

Defunding and otherwise reducing law enforcement is likely to have profound, reactive effects across society.

Homeowners are unlikely to be passive in protecting themselves, their families, and their property. They can be expected to expeditiously fill the vacuum. This means an increased number of armed individuals with limited training in gun safety.

Not only is this likely to result in more accidental fatalities, but such individuals are likely to be less judicious than law enforcement in the use of lethal force. Hence, it is unrealistic to believe that defunding law enforcement will lead to a decrease in the number of avoidable fatalities.

Defunding law enforcement should be expected to increase the number of individuals engaged in criminal behavior because this reduces the cost of such behavior. Criminals can reasonably expect a lower likelihood of being apprehended and successfully prosecuted for their crimes. Eliminating cash bail only exacerbates this problem. The result is a perfect storm of more crime, fewer police officers, and an increased number of poorly trained gun owners, all of which can be expected to increase the number of avoidable deaths.

To the extent that there are economies of scale in provisioning law enforcement (the average cost of law enforcement decreases with the quantity of law enforcement supplied), defunding the police is likely to raise the overall cost of supplying a given level of community protection. This higher cost is likely to translate into fewer resources dedicated to providing community protection.

Defunding law enforcement will result not only in a decrease in the number of police officers on the job but a decrease in their wages and salaries. Factors tend to flow to their highest rates of return. The more proficient law enforcement personnel will be attracted to the higher wages and better working conditions prompted by the increased demand for private security.

Less proficient law-enforcement personnel will have fewer outside opportunities and therefore will remain on the job. The result is fewer Joe Fridays and more Barney Fifes. Hence, defunding law enforcement is likely to lead not only to a decrease in the overall number of police officers but a decrease in the average proficiency of police officers. This will cause more avoidable deaths that will trigger an increase in taxes to pay for costly litigation, financial settlements, and higher rates for liability insurance.

Defunding law enforcement is precisely the opposite of what the nation needs. Compensation for law enforcement should increase to offset the increased risk and decreased job satisfaction. Police officers are also subject to a higher likelihood of criminal charges as a result of community sentiment turning against them and a new wave of leftist prosecutors that impose more exacting standards for the use of lethal force.

In facing a violent criminal, police officers face something of a “Hobson’s choice.” If they act too slowly, they risk their own life, and if they act too quickly they risk the unjustified death of the suspect. The litigation, both civil and criminal, that follows in this latter case limits their career opportunities in the best state of the world and their freedom in the worst. All of this for a median annual salary of less than $58,000.

The record number of law enforcement retirements over the past year is a testament to this new reality. In New York City, retirements are up 75 percent, disproportionately among the most experienced officers and detectives. This does not take into account an alarming 200 percent increase in law enforcement personnel that have filed for retirement and are awaiting pension board decisions.

Concerns have also been raised that there are too many “bad apples” in law enforcement. Even if this were true, you don’t secure higher-quality apples by paying less for them. If you want more proficient law enforcement, pay them more, not less. Tasked with the impossible, law enforcement deserves our respect, not our derision.

Public Policy Concerns

It is difficult to envision how a public policy of defunding law enforcement could pass an objective cost-benefit test given the multitude of adverse effects that it is likely to engender. Any policy change should be evaluated based on economic efficiency and social equity. The policy of defunding law enforcement fails on both metrics

The adverse economic effects associated with defunding law enforcement are only exacerbated by their disparate, community-wide impacts. Higher-income households can be expected to take prompt action to mitigate the increased risk to their families and property that results from defunding law enforcement. This may take the form of increased use of private security, either at the individual household or neighborhood level.

Lower-income households will not be as fortunate. They will have little choice but to fend for themselves or bear the brunt of the unavoidable increase in crime.

Insurance rates can be expected to rise in lockstep with the risk of theft and property damage, assuming that insurance is even available given the high risk of loss. It should therefore not be surprising that the lower-income communities are where we will see the largest percentage decrease in property values and the highest percentage increase in insurance rates.

Defunding law enforcement is a highly regressive public policy precisely because of its grossly disparate, adverse impacts. The highest costs will be borne by the most economically disadvantaged communities.

The number of avoidable deaths is likely to increase due to fewer and less-proficient police officers on the job and an increased number of firearms in untrained hands. This is why policymakers must consider both the first-order and the second-order effects of defunding law enforcement.

I do not question that in select cases social workers and mental health professionals may be able to diffuse the severity of a situation that the presence of law enforcement might only aggravate. These benefits, which have yet to be rigorously quantified, must be balanced against the greater risk of placing these social workers and mental health professionals directly in harm’s way with law enforcement responsible for their safety.

To Do No Harm

Every just society has a solemn responsibility to continuously and objectively reevaluate when lethal force by law enforcement is warranted. Any disparities in the use of such force that cannot be explained by differences in crime rates across minority and non-minority subgroups should be rigorously scrutinized and corrective action taken.

Nonetheless, defunding law enforcement is a radical and myopic policy that fails any objective cost-benefit test and is found wanting on social-equity grounds.

Defunding law enforcement will not only cost more lives, increase crime, and lower the overall standard of living, but it will also disproportionately harm our poorest communities that lack the resources to insulate themselves from its harmful and likely tragic consequences. The guiding principle for policymakers is no different than that for physicians under the Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/28/defunding-the-police-will-mean-more-shootings-higher-taxes-and-more-pain-for-the-poor/,2021-01-28
The Constitutional Case Against Late Impeachment,"Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial is underway in the Senate. The proceedings mark the first time in American history that a president has been impeached twice. The effort to impeach Trump is controversial, in part, because he is no longer president. The House voted to impeach Trump on January 13, when he was still in office. But it waited until January 25 to deliver its article of impeachment to the Senate, when he was no longer in office.

The Trump impeachment trial therefore raises the question of whether the Senate can convict Trump now that he is no longer president; now that he is a private citizen and, therefore, no longer subject to House impeachment in the first place.

It is essential to distinguish between “trial” and “conviction” in assessing the Senate’s proceedings’ constitutionality. This is because the Constitution requires the Senate to hold a trial whenever the House sends its impeachment articles. When that happens, the Senate organizes itself in a trial posture to consider the articles and dispose of them somehow (i.e., by acquittal, conviction, or dismissal). In other words, the Senate cannot adjudicate charges outlined in the impeachment articles and decide how to dispose of them without organizing itself to hold a trial. The question here is how the Constitution allows the Senate to depose of impeachment articles when the official that the House impeaches is no longer in office.

LATE IMPEACHMENT

“Late impeachment” refers to the idea that the Senate can convict government officials after they leave office. For example, many constitutional law scholars assert that “the Constitution permits the impeachment, conviction, and disqualification of former officers, including presidents.” While such claims appear to imply that the House may vote to impeach private citizens who previously served in office, the “late” in “late impeachment” typically refers to the timing of the Senate’s impeachment trial. An impeachment is therefore considered to be late if the Senate trial occurs after an impeached official leaves office.

Scholarly proponents of late impeachment base their claim that the practice is constitutional on “the text and structure of the Constitution, the history of its drafting, and relevant precedent.” Brian C. Kalt – a law professor at Michigan State University and the leading authority on late impeachment – makes a case for the practice’s constitutionality in a 2001 law review article. In that article, Kalt groups the evidence supporting late impeachment into five categories: the Constitution’s text and structure; pre-constitutional impeachment practices in Great Britain and America; delegates’ deliberations at the 1787 Federal Convention; state ratifying debates; and historical practice after the Constitution’s ratification.

But the evidence in each of these categories does not support claims that late impeachment is constitutional. The following analysis reviews the evidence in two categories: the Constitution’s text and the delegates’ deliberations at the 1787 Federal Convention. Evidence in the other three categories will be reviewed in future pieces.

THE CONSTITUTION’S TEXT

The case for late impeachment rests, at bottom, on the ambiguity that its proponents perceive in the Constitution’s text. In short, they claim that late impeachment is constitutional because the Constitution does not prohibit it explicitly. For example, many constitutional law scholars emphasize the fact that “nothing in the provision authorizing impeachment for removal limits impeachment to situations where it accomplishes removal from office.” And Kalt argues that “the text of the Constitution places several significant limitations on the impeachment power, but it never explicitly authorizes nor explicitly forbids late impeachment.”

This perceived ambiguity makes it possible for late impeachment proponents to read the practice into the Constitution while claiming that the case for it is straightforward. (Note: Kalt, in a refreshing illustration of scholarly integrity, concedes that the evidence supporting late impeachment is itself ambiguous.) By emphasizing the Constitution’s ambiguity (whether real or imagined), proponents of late impeachment shift the debate over the practice from what the Constitution permits based on concrete evidence to what it must allow based on their own inferences and reasoning.

This may be a useful negotiating tactic. But it does not help determine whether the Senate can convict a former president. It also is not an accurate description of the Constitution’s impeachment provisions and the process that led to their creation.

IMPEACHMENT 101

The Constitution gives the House “the sole Power of Impeachment” (Article I, section 2, clause 5). “Sole Power” here means that the House has the exclusive power to initiate the impeachment process by impeaching a specific individual and adopting articles of impeachment against him or her. The Senate cannot hold an impeachment trial if the House does not act first under the Constitution.

The Constitution also defines which individuals the House can impeach (Article II, section 4). Specifically, it stipulates, “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” In other words, the House can impeach the president, vice president, and all “civil officers.”

The Constitution gives the Senate “the sole Power to try all Impeachments” (Article I, section 3, clause 6). “Sole Power” here means that the Senate has the exclusive power to hold an impeachment trial. The Chief Justice must preside over that trial if the person impeached is the president. And two-thirds of senators present (67 assuming 100 senators are present) are needed to convict a president, vice president, or civil officer of the United States.

While the Constitution gives the Senate “sole Power to try all Impeachments,” it explicitly limits what senators can do at the end of the trial (Article I, section 3, clause 7). Specifically, it limits the Senate’s judgment to “removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.”

The Constitution limits the president’s pardon power by specifying that it shall not apply to impeached individuals. And it distinguishes impeachment proceedings from criminal trials. It stipulates that impeached officials “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law” (Article I, section 3, clause 7). It further distinguishes between impeachment trials and criminal trials by specifying “the Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury” (Article III, section 2, clause 3).

THE IMPLICATIONS OF AMBIGUITY

Proponents of late impeachment argue that the Constitution does not rule out the practice so that they can infer that it authorizes the practice indirectly. For example, Kalt assumes – incorrectly – that “the Constitution establishes that the House and Senate have the main responsibility for construing the breadth of their own impeachment powers.” He contends that this is because the House and Senate “are given the sole powers to impeach and try impeachments, and they are also given the authority to make their own rules for their proceedings.

Kalt does not acknowledge, however, that the Senate’s current rules do not authorize it to convict former officers. And he fails to mention that the Constitution’s plenary grant of rule-making power to the House and Senate (Article I section 5, clause 2) does not empower them to use that power to violate or contradict the Constitution by circumventing its list of people subject to impeachment.

The Supreme Court underscored the relationship between Congress’s rule-making power and the Constitution in the 1892 case, United States v. Ballin. In that case, the Court conceded that House and Senate majorities are free to adopt rules. But that power was not unlimited. Justice David Brewer pointed out that while “the Constitution empowers each house to determine its rules of proceedings,” the House and Senate cannot, by their rules, “ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights.”

In other words, late impeachment must be authorized by the Constitution directly because it gives the federal government the power to impeach and convict people who are not listed in Article II, section 4. This would not be the case if Article II, section 4 included “former officials” in the list of officials subject to impeachment.

Late impeachment proponents also contend that the practice is permitted because the Constitution allows the Senate to remove impeached officials from office upon conviction and disqualify them from holding future office. For example, in support of late impeachment, constitutional law scholars argue that “the Constitution’s impeachment power has two aspects. The first is removal from office, which occurs automatically upon the conviction of a current officer. The second is disqualification from holding future office, which occurs in those cases where the Senate deems disqualification appropriate in light of the conduct for which the impeached person was convicted.” These scholars reason that the Constitution’s “impeachment power must be read so as to give full effect to both aspects of this power.”

But there is no evidence that the Constitution empowers the Senate to choose removal from office or disqualification from holding future office at the end of an impeachment trial when it renders judgment. How Article I, section 3, clause 7 is written affirms the view that disqualification is derivative of removal. Its reference to “disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States” represents the dependent clause in the sentence. Put differently, disqualification is not an independent clause in the judgement power that can stand apart from removal. Suppose proponents of late impeachment were correct that disqualification is not derivative of removal and that the Senate has full recourse to both when rendering judgment in an impeachment trial. In that case, the Senate could keep an impeached official in office but vote to disqualify that official from holding future office.

PROBLEMS OF SCOPE

Late impeachment proponents also have a scope problem. Nothing in their case for the practice limits its scope to government officials and former government officials. Kalt dismisses this argument, countering that the definition of the word “impeachment” limits its scope to public officials and former public officials.” He argues that “the impeachment power is inherently limited by the bounds of the definition of the term ‘impeachment’ itself, and those bounds do not include impeaching wholly private citizens. They do, however, include late impeachment.” Without citing any evidence to support his distinction between “wholly private citizens” and former officials (or “technically private citizens”), Kalt argues that “wholly private citizens” were “pursued through the regular criminal process, or through attainder, but not through impeachment.” He notes that “when the newly independent states wrote their constitutions, they made this limitation clear. The single exception to this was that former public officials – technically private citizens at the time of trial – were impeached for prior public actions.”

The problem with Kalt’s argument is that the documentary record does not support his conclusions regarding the constitutionality of late impeachment. Kalt does not identify any evidence in the Constitution’s text that expands the impeachment power’s scope to cover private citizens/former government officials. Nor does he cite evidence that it does not cover private citizens once if the scope is expanded. Kalt’s argument also undermines his claim that impeachment’s definition limits its scope. For example, the definition of impeachment in Great Britain in the 1780s included private citizens. Kalt refers to the English practice as “the ultimate foundation of American impeachment” and cites Americans’ familiarity with that practice as evidence indicating their tacit support for late impeachment. But if Kalt is correct, Americans would not understand the definition of impeachment to exclude private citizens.

Of course, Americans rejected much of the English impeachment practice after they won their independence. But they did not then adopt a standard definition of impeachment. The procedure was defined and implemented differently in the constitutions of the newly independent states. For example, Delaware’s Constitution of 1776 authorized government officials’ late impeachment up to 18 months after they left office. Virginia’s 1776 constitution also authorized late impeachment. In contrast, New York’s Constitution of 1777, Massachusetts’ Constitution of 1780, and New Hampshire’s Constitution of 1784 allowed government officials’ impeachment when they were in office. And Maryland’s Constitution of 1776 did not provide for the impeachment of its chief magistrate.

THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787

Proponents of late impeachment cite delegates’ deliberations at the 1787 Federal Convention that drafted the Constitution as evidence of the practice’s constitutionality. But a review of those deliberations does not produce the evidence to substantiate their claims. Instead, the documentary record reveals that the delegates considered impeachment and removal to be two sides of the same coin and that they believed one could not happen without the other. This undermines the claims of late impeachment proponents that impeachment and removal were separate phenomena.

While the delegates agreed that impeachment equaled removal (and not late impeachment when removal from office was no longer operative), they disagreed over which government officials should be subject to impeachment/removal. Their deliberations on that questions, as well as the evolution of the draft Constitution’s impeachment provisions more generally, do not “suggest that late impeachment was accepted,” as Kalt claims.

THE VIRGINIA PLAN

The delegates first discuss impeachment in the context of the Virginia Plan, which Edmund Randolph (Virginia) introduced to the convention on May 29. Among its provisions, the Virginia Plan established a national judiciary and gave it jurisdiction to decide “impeachments of any National officers.” Notably, the Virginia Plan did not stipulate that the new government’s chief magistrate/president was subject to impeachment. This is because the delegates distinguished between “National officers” and the president at this stage in their deliberations. And they disagreed on the question of presidential impeachment at this stage in the convention’s proceedings.

This distinction is evident in the plan that Charles Pinckney (South Carolina) presented after Randolph presented the Virginia Plan. Pinckney’s plan stipulated that the president “shall be removed from his office on impeachment by the house of Delegates & Conviction in the Supreme Court” (Article 8). It separately gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction to determine “impeachments of Officers of the United States,” including “Ambassadors & other public Ministers” (Article 9).

William Paterson (New Jersey) also distinguished between “National officers” or “Officers of the United States” and the president in the plan of government that he presented to the convention on June 15. His New Jersey Plan stipulated that the president was to be “removable by Congs. on application by a majority of the Executives of the several States.” The plan did not stipulate that government officials other than the president were subject to impeachment and removal from office. Alexander Hamilton (New York) likewise presented another plan of government to his fellow delegates on June 18 that applied impeachment to government officials differently.

PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT

The delegates’ deliberations on June 2 provides evidence that the Virginia Plan’s impeachment power did not initially apply to the president and that the delegates distinguished between “national officers” and the nation’s chief magistrate. John Dickinson (Delaware) and Gunning Bedford, Jr. (Delaware) tried to amend the Virginia Plan to make the president “removable by the national legislature upon request by a majority of the legislatures of the individual states.” The convention rejected an effort to strike “upon request by a majority of the legislatures of the individual states” from the Dickinson-Bedford amendment by a vote of 7 states to 3. The convention then rejected Dickinson-Bedford amendment by a vote of 9 states to 1.

After the delegates agreed to make the president ineligible to serve more than one term in office, Hugh Williamson (North Carolina) and William Richardson Davie (North Carolina) proposed that the president be “removable on impeachment and conviction of mal-practice or neglect of duty.” The convention adopted the Williamson-Davie amendment by a vote of 6 states to 4.

Kalt identifies the Williamson-Davie amendment vote as evidence of the delegates’ tacit support for late impeachment. That is, he argues that it demonstrates that the delegates distinguished between impeachment and removability. Kalt also infers tacit support for late impeachment (despite a lack of evidence) based solely on the four states that opposed the Williamson-Davie amendment- Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Kalt asserts, “It is readily inferable…that while the Virginia and Delaware delegates opposed the idea of removing a sitting President by impeachment, they would not have objected to late impeachment of the President.” Kalt notes that Pennsylvania’s constitution allowed late impeachment and speculates “its delegates may have felt the same way as Virginia and Delaware.” But Kalt does not provide evidence for his inference. Nor does he explain why Maryland – a state that did not provide for its chief magistrate’s impeachment – voted against the Williamson-Davie amendment along with Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

The documentary record for June 2 does not support Kalt’s contention that “it is readily inferable…that…the Virginia and Delaware delegates opposed the idea of removing a sitting President.” Delegates from Delaware and Virginia, in whose behavior Kalt finds evidence of tacit support for late impeachment, underscored the importance of impeaching (and removing) sitting presidents. They also emphasized the connection between impeachment and removability.

For example, Dickinson (Delaware) argued that “it was necessary…to place the power of removing somewhere.” Dickinson acknowledged that he “did not like the plan of impeaching the Great Officers of State.” But he conceded that he “did not know how provision could be made for removal of them in a better mode than that which he had proposed.” Dickinson also proposed making the president subject to removal while in office.

George Mason (Virginia) and James Madison (Virginia) each stressed the importance of removing a sitting president by impeachment. In response to Roger Sherman’s (Connecticut) contention “that the National Legislature should have the power to remove the Executive at pleasure, Mason argued that “some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as by the corruptibility of the man chosen.” Contrary to Kalt’s inference that Virginia’s delegates opposed removing a sitting president by impeachment, Mason’s remarks reveal that the Virginian opposed only “making the Executive the mere creature of the Legislature.” In other words, Mason opposed giving Congress the power to impeach/remove a sitting president. He did not oppose the very idea of removing a sitting president.

Madison was likewise concerned that the impeachment power’s design made the president dependent on Congress. He feared “that it would enable a minority of the people to prevent ye. removal of an officer who had rendered himself justly criminal in the eyes of a majority.” William Pierce (Georgia) noted Madison’s concern in his notes of that day’s debates. He recorded Madison as saying, “it was far from being his wish that every executive Officer should remain in Office, without being amenable to some Body for his conduct.”

At this stage in the proceedings, the draft Constitution included two impeachment provisions. First, it stipulated “that a national Executive be instituted…to be removable on impeachment and conviction of mal-practice, or neglect of duty. Second, it stipulated “that the jurisdiction of the national Judiciary shall extend to…impeachments of any national Officers.” The delegates unanimously affirmed their support for the second provision on June 13. However, the convention revisited the first provision on July 19 when Gouverneur Morris (Pennsylvania) objected to making the president “impeachable.” Morris argued, “this is a dangerous part of the plan. It will hold him in such dependence that he will be no check on the Legislature, will not be a firm guardian of the people and of the public interest.” Morris concluded, “If [the president] is to be a check on the Legislature let him not be impeachable.” Morris’s objections here do not imply that he tacitly supported late impeachment, a point that he makes clear in the following day’s debate

THE PINCKNEY-MORRIS MOTION

Proponents of late impeachment like Kalt cite the debate over Pinckney and Morris’s effort to strike “to be removable on impeachment and conviction” from the draft Constitution as evidence of the practice’s constitutionality. Kalt contends, “This debate was really not about impeachment – it was about removability. The clause that Pinckney was trying to eliminate provided that the President was ‘to be removable,’ not that he be impeachable.’ National officers were generally impeachable; the issue here was, as Pinckney put it, whether the President (whose term was otherwise definite and limited) ought to be ‘impeachable whilst in office.’ In other words, Pinckney arguably presupposed the possibility of late impeachment, and was concerned only with whether ‘regular’ impeachment was acceptable as well.

But Kalt provides no evidence that Pinckney “presupposed the possibility of late impeachment.” And a review of the debate on July 20 highlights several problems with Kalt’s reasoning. First, the draft Constitution provided that national officers and the president be removable by impeachment in separate provisions. This is because the delegates distinguished between national officers and the president in their deliberations on the Constitution’s impeachment provisions and some disagreed on whether to adopt presidential impeachment in the first place. Consequently, the Virginia Plan’s original impeachment provisions did not subject the president to impeachment and removal on conviction.

Acknowledging this distinction highlights the second problem with Kalt’s reasoning. If successful, the Pinckney-Morris motion would have eliminated presidential impeachment from the draft Constitution altogether. It would not have subjected the president to the general impeachment process originally authorized in the Virginia Plan as Kalt argues because that process only applied to national officers. And it would not have authorized late impeachment.

Third, Pinckney makes clear in the subsequent debate over his motion that he was opposed to the legislature impeaching the president because it would give it undue influence over him. In this context, late impeachment – according to its proponents – would do the same thing in Pinckney’s mind as so-called regular impeachment. Both would give the legislature influence over the executive.

Fourth, the delegates’ remarks in the debate over the Pinckney-Morris motion contradict claims that they tacitly supported late impeachment. Delegate after delegate stressed the importance of making the sitting president subject to impeachment “whilst in office.” For example, Davie (North Carolina) argued that if the president “be not impeachable whilst in office, he will spare no efforts or means whatever to get himself elected. For that reason, the North Carolinian “considered this an essential security for the good behavior of the Executive.” James Wilson (Pennsylvania) concurred with Davie on the “necessity of making the Executive impeachable whilst in office.”

Morris’s halfhearted defense of his motion with Pinckney (Morris would shortly change his mind on the question of presidential impeachment) indicates that a desire to sanction late impeachment only was not his motivation for trying to strike presidential impeachment (which is good for Morris’s sake because his effort would not have accomplished that goal). Morris argued that the president “can do no criminal act without Coadjutors who may be punished [i.e., national officers]. In case he should be re-elected, that will be sufficient proof of his innocence. Besides, who is to impeach? Is the impeachment to suspend his functions. If it is not the mischief will go on. If it is the impeachment will be nearly equivalent to a displacement and will render the Executive dependent on those who are to impeach.” Morris here reiterates his concern as it related to the consequences of making the president impeachable by Congress. It makes one branch of government dependent on another branch. These concerns are not alleviated entirely by making the president impeachable after he leaves office. As such, the central motivation of the Pinckney-Morris effort to strike presidential impeachment is incompatible with the logic underpinning the case for late impeachment.

Kalt further misreads the delegates’ deliberations in his analysis of Mason’s contribution to the debate over the Pinckney-Morris motion to strike presidential impeachment. He notes, “Madison quoted Mason as speaking of the right of impeachment being ‘continued,’ as opposed to it merely being ‘available.’ This suggests that to Mason, the issue was whether impeachment would be suspended during the President’s term, or instead would be continuous. The word ‘continued’ makes little sense if the only options were either impeachment in office or none at all. In other words, Mason appeared to presuppose late impeachability.”

Such reasoning is not supported by the documentary record. Mason acknowledges in the debate on July 20 that the question raised by the Pinckney-Morris effort to strike presidential impeachment was whether “the right of impeachment” would be in the Constitution, not when it would be exercised. “No point is of more importance,” Mason argued, “than that the right of impeachment should be continued.” Mason uses “continued” here in the straightforward context of keeping the provision authorizing presidential impeachment in the draft Constitution (i.e., continuing it). Mason opposed the Pinckney-Morris effort precisely because he wanted the impeachment provision they targeted to remain in the draft. Mason asked his fellow delegates, “Shall any man be above Justice? Above all [the president] be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice? When great crimes were committed he was for punishing the principal as well as the Coadjutors.” Mason then reveals that he thought the president ought to be impeachable whilst in office, not after he leaves office. “Shall the man who has practices corruption & by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment, by repeating his guilt?” “Repeating his guilt” here refers to a president practicing corruption to win re-election and, by extension, remain in office. At no point in the debate does Mason indicate support for late impeachment. He is concerned solely with impeachment in office, which is why he opposed the Pinckney-Morris motion to strike presidential impeachment.

Other delegates echoed Mason. For example, Benjamin Franklin (Pennsylvania) “was for retaining the clause [on impeachment] as favorable to the executive” because it protected [the president] from violence. “What was the practice before this in cases where the Chief Magistrate rendered himself obnoxious?” Franklin asked his colleagues. “Why recourse was had to assassination in wch. He was not only deprived of his life but of the opportunity of vindicating his character. It wd. be the best way therefore to provide in the Constitution for the regular punishment of the Executive when his misconduct should deserve it and for his honorable acquittal when he should be unjustly accused.” Franklin’s sober assessment of the role assassination had played throughout history and his support for impeachment as a better alternative to it indicate that he did not believe that late impeachment would achieve the same goal as regular impeachment. As Franklin put it, individuals in power are assassinated by people who want them out of power. By that same logic, late impeachment does not operate the same way in this context because it operates on private individuals.

Still, Pinckney remained unpersuaded on the question of presidential impeachment. He “did not see the necessity of impeachments.” And he believed that impeachments “ought not to issue from the Legislature who would in that case hold them as a rod over the Executive and by that means effectually destroy his independence.”

In contrast, Madison thought “it indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the Community agst. the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limitation of the period of his service, was not a sufficient security. He might lose his capacity after his appointment. He might pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to foreign powers…In the case of the Executive Magistracy which was to be administered by a single man, loss of capacity or corruption was more within the compass of probable events, and either of them might be fatal to the Republic.” Here, Madison acknowledges that he is concerned with presidents in office, not out of office.

Echoing Pinckney, Rufus King (Massachusetts) argued that “under no circumstance ought [the president] to be impeachable by the Legislature. That would be destructive of his independence.” King contended that impeachment only made sense when the person subject to impeachment “held his place for life, and was not periodically elected.” Note that life tenure precluded the option of late impeachment altogether, suggesting that King did not secretly think of late impeachment when he heard the word impeachment.

At this point in the debate, Morris – Pinckney’s original partner in the effort to strike presidential impeachment altogether – announced that he had changed his mind on the issue. “He was now sensible of the necessity of impeachment, if the Executive was to continue for any time in office…The Executive ought therefore to be impeachable for treachery; Corrupting his electors; and incapacity were other causes of impeachment…he should be punished not as a man, but as an officer, and punished only by degradation from his office.”

LAST-MINUTE CHANGES

The draft Constitution’s impeachment provisions remained unchanged until the Committee of Detail reported its work to the convention on August 6. The Committee’s report gave the House “the sole power of impeachment” but stipulated that the Supreme Court try impeachments of the president and “Officers of the United States.” The report also limited judgment in impeachment cases to “removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honour, trust or profit, under the United States.” Finally, the report stipulated that impeached officials were “liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law.”

Still, many of the delegates remained unpersuaded that the Senate was a good place to try impeachments. Reflecting that concern, the delegates agreed to submit the impeachment provisions to a Committee on Postponed Matters at the end of August.

The Committee on Postponed Matters reported two provisions related to the impeachment power on September 4. One stipulated, “the Vice President shall be ex officio, President of the Senate, except when they sit to try the impeachment of the President, in which case the Chief Justice shall preside.” Another one stipulated, “the President…shall be removable from his office on impeachment by the House of representatives, and conviction by the Senate, for treason or bribery, and in case of his removal as aforesaid…the Vice President shall exercise those powers. And it required an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present to convict an impeached official.

Delegates were ultimately persuaded to transfer jurisdiction to try impeachments to the Senate because the president nominated the members of the judiciary and, therefore, could have an undue influence on what those members ruled in an impeachment trial. The delegates also believed that it would be inappropriate for the Supreme Court to try impeachments of government officials and then subsequently try criminal cases against the same individuals after they left office for acts related to their initial impeachment. Morris observes, “A conclusive reason for making the Senate instead of the Supreme Court the Judge of impeachments, was that the latter was to try the President after the trial of impeachment.”

And still, Pinckney remained opposed to presidential impeachment, in part because the draft Constitution empowered the Senate – which now tried impeachments – to select the president when no candidate had the required number of votes to win outright. In such circumstances, the draft Constitution’s impeachment provisions “makes the same body of men which will in fact elect the President his Judges in cases of an impeachment.

WARREN HASTINGS

Kalt and other proponents of late impeachment point out that the delegates referenced the ongoing English impeachment trial of Warren Hastings (a late impeachment) during their deliberations. Specifically, Mason references Hastings during a larger debate among the delegates over the types of behavior that they should designate impeachable offenses. Mason asked his fellow delegates, “Why is the provision restrained to Treason & Bribery only? Treason as defined in the Constitution will not reach many great and dangerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of Treason. Attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be Treason as above defined – As bills of attainder which have saved the British Constitution are forbidden, it is the more necessary to extend: the power of impeachment.”

Kalt infers that Mason’s remarks are supportive of late impeachment because the Hastings’ trial occurred after he left office. “If aspects of the Hastings case – such as the fact that Hastings was out of office – were seen as unacceptable, it would be surprising if Mason would have used it as an example of a good impeachment, and then more surprising if this attracted no dissent. Conversely, if the Hastings case was seen as an appropriate model, the fact that Hastings was out of office surely must have registered.”

But Kalt’s inference here – widely repeated by scholars and politicians alike – is not supported by the documentary record. It is instead based on speculation. That speculation downplays, if not ignores, the fact that Mason referenced Hastings as an example of what the delegates should consider impeachable offences to be, not when impeachment trials should occur.

In other words, Mason was not recommending secretly that his fellow delegates secretly authorize late impeachment by not including it in the Constitution (the late impeachment claim). This is also evident in the amendments that Mason offered to the draft Constitution at that point to expand its definition of impeachable offenses. Notably, Mason did not reference late impeachment in his amendments, the first of which proposed adding “maladministration” to the list of impeachable offenses.

Madison worried that Mason’s effort to add “maladministration” to the list of impeachable offenses upset the balance of power between the president and Congress. “So vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.” Madison’s reference to an impeached official’s time in office being subjected to the Senate because of Mason’s amendment underscores the fact that Mason’s reference of Hastings had nothing to do with late impeachment. The delegates were concerned about the impact of Mason’s amendment on government officials, not private citizens (or former government officials). And Morris thought the debate over Mason’s amendment was insignificant because “an election of every four years will prevent maladministration.” In response to these concerns, Mason substituted “other high crimes & misdemeanors” for “maladministration,” which the convention approved by a vote of 8 states to 3.

On September 14, John Rutledge (South Carolina) and Morris revisited the impeachment issue by proposing “that persons impeached be suspended from their office until they be tried and acquitted.” Contrary to the claims of late impeachment proponents, the Rutledge-Morris motion presupposed that impeached officials were in office at the time of their impeachment and trial. While the convention rejected the motion by a vote of 8 states to 3, their effort provides additional evidence that the delegates thought of impeachment only in the context of government officials. They did not think that former officials were subject to impeachment, much less private citizens. According to Madison, “The President is made too dependent already on the Legislature, by the power of one branch to try him in consequence of an impeachment by the other. This intermediate suspension, will put him in the power of one branch only – They can at any moment, in order to make way for the function of another who will be more favorable to their views, vote a temporary removal of the existing magistrate.”

THE TAKEAWAY

A review of the Constitution’s text and the delegates’ deliberations at the 1787 Federal Convention raises significant questions about the case for late impeachment. It demonstrates that the reasoning of late impeachment proponents is not supported by the documentary record – at least in these two categories. It also yields evidence that suggests late impeachment is not constitutional.

Lies About Sicknick Are Just Beginning Of Democrats' 'Truth Commission',"Democrats’ calls for an indefinite commission to investigate the non-leftist Capitol riot should prepare you for another multi-year Russia collusion hoax-style narrative with intricate webs of players, evidence, and lies.

One of the key facts in this accelerated use of police powers against Democrats’ political opposition is the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick. As Tristan Justice explained Monday, Democrats used Sicknick’s death in the aftermath of the riot to help construct their narrative of murderous Trump-supporting thugs attempting an “insurrection.”

Five people died related to the Jan. 6 violence, including Sicknick. Three died of “medical emergencies,” not violence. One, Ashli Babbit, was a rioter shot by police as she attempted to enter the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol. Sicknick’s is the only death that could directly implicate the rioters in “murder.”

We can expect that the lies and coverups that already have occurred related to his death will be magnified across every other fact related to these events. This possibly comprises a major purpose of the “9/11 commission” Democrats are demanding, if their history of running this play with every single major “investigation” since the Obama years is any indication (Russiagate, Benghazi, Fast and Furious, Brett Kavanaugh, Ukraine, Crossfire Hurricane, impeachment one, impeachment two, Hunter Biden, you name it). They have squandered more than enough public faith for no one to believe their claims until they stop systematically and compulsively lying for political gain.

As Byron York notes, this is already happening, giving the lie to Democrats’ pretense they care about finding the truth: “significant parts of the Capitol riot are now shrouded in official secrecy. And the existence of multiple investigations will only make that worse, giving officials an excuse not to speak publicly because there is an active investigation going on.”

It is absolutely impossible that authorities, including those who performed the autopsy, didn’t know very early on that the story being spread over and over by the media — that Sicknick was killed with a fire extinguisher by a pro-Trump mob — was false. — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 11, 2021

In this environment of constant manipulation of facts to control public perception, truth becomes all the more important to seek and find. This is another reason the truth about Sicknick’s death matters.

For truth’s sake, therefore, we must recognize there is a difference between dying of a heart attack or of an adverse reaction to pepper spray versus being bludgeoned to death by murderous rioters wielding a fire extinguisher. Laws recognize such distinctions by providing different degrees of culpability for those accused of homicide, from manslaughter to premeditated murder.

The law recognizes such degrees of criminal activity because they matter. Justice means fitting the punishment as closely as possible to the crime committed. This requires establishing exactly what the crimes were, and were not. Truth thus serves justice, because it forms the basis for administering justice.

This is why there is such an erosion of justice in our nation: Because there is constant, purposeful, politically motivated untruth. Until the lies are restrained, injustice will reign.

Among other things, I asked Capitol Police how many firearms were confiscated at Capitol riot, and whether any rioters fired any guns. Got no answer. (Also asked about Sicknick death; no answer on that, either.) https://t.co/x1sRThss9E https://t.co/97JZzEtxBV — Byron York (@ByronYork) February 16, 2021

According to the DOJ, the zip ties were left sitting on a table that one of the intruders happened to randomly encounter. The falsity of the initial ""zip tie"" narrative was the now-discredited suggestion that they indicated some kind of premeditated mass kidnapping plot https://t.co/lPeM6WL70w — Michael Tracey (@mtracey) February 16, 2021

Justice also includes in its meaning equality in application — that no matter who someone is, how much money he has, who he knows, or what he believes, he will be treated the same as someone who has committed a generally equal infraction both by the law and those whose duty it is to apply that law faithfully.

Now, regardless of how Sicknick died, the riot appears to be a factor. Establishing the extent of that relationship matters to his family and to justice. Anyone who chooses to participate in mob violence is culpable for the eventual outcomes of such an idiotic decision, which can include many unintended evil consequences such as triggering heart attacks.

This standard, however, if equally applied, would make Black Lives Matter partially culpable for the murder wave with mostly minority victims that swept U.S. cities amid their violent political pressure to get police to retreat from their jobs. It would make BLM culpable for attempting arson at historic icons near the White House and repeatedly firebombing federal buildings.

An equal-justice nation would consider a group that operates across state lines and openly calls for the overthrow of the U.S. government to be worthy of a federal investigation that you bet your buttons would be happening if the group expressed right-wing sentiment. An equal standard of justice would mean that local, state, and federal authorities employ equal fervor in finding and charging the thousands of leftist rioters who blanketed the nation with violence in 2020 as they are aiming at non-leftist rioters, rather than bailing out and refusing to charge leftist rioters while working overtime to find the non-leftist ones.

The vice president of the United States helps bail out rioters and then has the gall to help lead a party that insists anti-government riots at a Republican rally are “insurrection” while she calls anti-government riots at Democrat rallies “brilliant” and a “mark of a real democracy.”

It is plain to anyone with eyes to see that in this nation justice is not being equally applied. If people don’t think this is a problem, they are part of it.

Kamala Harris’s support for obvious injustice is not by any means an anomaly. It is openly supported by all her party’s prominent leaders, including those in media. Their appetite for using this violence to smear and destroy nonviolent political opponents and the rights and legal procedures that protect all of us — such as our freedoms of association and speech — can only be described as hellish.

The Trump trial is over but local, state & federal investigations continue. There might be a 9/11-type commission. News organizations continue to investigate. And @realBobWoodward is working on a book on Trump’s final days in office. Bottom line: we are going to learn a lot more. — Wolf Blitzer (@wolfblitzer) February 15, 2021

Our nation clearly has a massive problem with equal justice under the law. It is a problem that many of our political leaders refuse to see and indeed seem deeply invested in making much, much worse. This is exemplified by the rush to declare and seek to investigate not only those who committed crimes on Jan. 6 but also any peaceful person in a MAGA hat as a potential “domestic terrorist” or “insurrectionist.”

This is what is happening right now before our eyes. In a Jan. 27 bulletin, Joe Biden’s Department of Homeland Security issued a “national terrorism advisory” that relates “domestic terrorists” to people who have concerns about COVID lockdowns, illegal immigration, and the 2020 election’s integrity:

Throughout 2020, Domestic Violent Extremists (DVEs) targeted individuals with opposing views engaged in First Amendment-protected, non-violent protest activity. DVEs motivated by a range of issues, including anger over COVID-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results, and police use of force have plotted and on occasion carried out attacks against government facilities.

Remember, “violent extremists” is the term the Obama administration used instead of “terrorists” in policy documents and public briefings. They were trying to telegraph delicacy and nuance about Islamism, a delicacy and nuance Democrats clearly don’t care to convey or even consider about Trump-supporting Americans.

Remember: the original 9/11 Commission stripped people the government labels “terrorists” of many key rights, such as allowing them to be held in indefinite detention. Many of our remaining rights might not survive another 9/11 Commission, especially with people who hate our nation and its Constitution running the show.

These people are openly criminalizing verbal disagreement with their politics while decriminalizing violence that supports their politics. They are openly proclaiming that speech is violence for Republicans, and violence is speech for Democrats. These people have no morals, they only want power, and your God-given rights and historic freedoms are in their way.

BREAKING: @SpeakerPelosi says the nation requires a 9/11 Commission-style investigation into the Trump Coup – and she’s right.

This situation is deeply dangerous and utterly untenable. It is an open provocation to further violence. Every single American should utterly refuse to get into this mental cattle car.

To only punish the crimes of one political side while allowing the other political side to openly commit crimes without punishment is injustice. Anyone who supports this state of affairs, tacitly or directly, supports injustice.

Anyone who supports this level of systematic injustice has disqualified himself from holding any position of leadership in this nation. Anyone who is a leader worthy of his or her duties will work to ensure equal justice in this nation instead.

‘Murder Among The Mormons’ Is A True-Crime Masterpiece,"As the true-crime boom rolls along, even prestige projects are falling into easy traps. They’re padded with unnecessary filler, doing in 10 episodes what should take five. They’re repetitive or too familiar. The twists are predictable. Not “Murder Among the Mormons.” In three fast-paced episodes, the new Netflix series unravels an unthinkably twisted web with refreshing artistry.

It’s almost impossible not to binge. In fairness, “Murder Among the Mormons” has the benefit of telling an incredible true story. Nevertheless, unpacking the complex narrative in a way that’s not only digestible but edge-of-your-seat intriguing is a feat. To do that without getting bogged down in filler and resisting the temptation to indulge in distracting tangents is even more impressive.

That is to say, “Murder Among the Mormons” should be used as a how-to guide for the many true-crime documentarians fielding green lights amid the genre’s explosion. The story is fresh. The series is lean and organized. It really stands out among the glut of true-crime content we’re drowning in right now.

With good access to the people involved, “Murder Among the Mormons,” a BBC Studios production from “Napoleon Dynamite” director Jared Hess and Tyler Measom, chronicles the 1985 Salt Lake City bombings. The story’s national prominence is wildly disproportionate to its intrigue, folding religion and greed and genius into a stranger-than-fiction cocktail, which is available to stream on March 1.

The series cleverly follows the direction of the police investigation, bringing viewers on a journey just as frustrating and dizzying and shocking as the one that played out in real time four decades ago. There’s some well-executed misdirection. B-roll is effectively blended with old footage and new interviews. It can be difficult to keep all the suspects straight, although that’s inevitable with a story like this. But even as it tackles tangled details, “Murder Among the Mormons” will never lose your attention.

Without fail, the series manages to reveal information at just the right pace to build to an extraordinary crescendo, keeping viewers guessing and then exposing the truth with fascinating on-camera insights from involved parties. It’s not flashy or trying to reinvent the wheel, it’s just a great execution of the format.

The heightened demand for true crime, which was spiking even before the pandemic, is generating a lot of great investigative work that holds criminals accountable and gives victims a platform. But in the frenzy, even the best of these docuseries can feel bloated, padding the content to hit an episode quota that could be cut in half, sometimes by exploring tangential storylines that serve mostly to add confusion. “Murder Among the Mormons” does its story justice, exposing the depths of man’s depravity to powerful effect.

Biden Opens Borders As Media Hides Info About Illegal Immigrant Crime,"To reverse former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, President Biden is working with Democrats in Congress on “sweeping immigration legislation” that includes an eight-year path to citizenship for an claimed estimate of 11 million illegal immigrants. Such drastic reform must be supported by facts, which are hotly debated, and even purposely withheld.

Democrats’ sunny population estimation falls in line with the Pew Research Center’s assessment that 10.5 million illegal immigrants resided in the United States in 2017. The Federation for American Immigration Reform alternatively estimates that 14.45 million illegal immigrants reside in the United States as of 2020.

Much information about illegal immigrants is unknown, including their rate of additional criminality and overall cost burden for taxpayers, which FAIR assesses at $133.7 billion each year. While the Cato Institute estimates illegal immigrants are between 26 and 41 percent less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans, FAIR concludes instead that illegal immigrants are three times more likely to be incarcerated than citizens and legally present immigrants. To be able to refine and even assess the accuracy of such claims, better information is needed.

Yet as Democrats rush amnesty and think tanks clash, legacy media and judicial organizations in charge of providing truth and justice sometimes obscure facts about illegal migrants’ crimes besides breaking immigration law in the growing number of sanctuary states and cities. Consider a case study: the suppression of details about the drunk-driving illegal immigrant who killed Detroit native Gerard “Gary” Kuras in December 2018 in Michigan’s Wayne County, a sanctuary jurisdiction.

Pertinent Facts Go Missing in Detroit

On Dec. 9, 2018, while driving under the influence, 28-year-old Rony Cesar Reyes-Euceda struck 69-year-old Kuras with his pickup truck, causing Kuras to “fl[y] up into the air,” according to a witness. Reyes-Euceda then drove away from the scene. When police were able to stop him, the intoxicated offender threatened to kill the responding officer’s family, Officer Tabitha Sears of the Detroit police testified at the trial, according to a local news outlet.

On Aug. 12, 2019, Reyes-Euceda was sentenced to 59 months to 20 years in the Michigan Department of Corrections for operating with a suspended license, failing to stop at the scene of an accident, and driving under the influence. At his sentencing, Reyes-Euceda admitted fault and apologized for the accident with the aid of a translator.

Local Detroit station Fox 2 News reported the above elements of Reyes-Euceda’s crime, and his punishment, in its online reporting. During a local television broadcast at 6 a.m. on Aug. 13, 2019, the station added another key fact, according to people listening in: Reyes-Euceda is an illegal immigrant from Honduras.

Outside of Twitter, however, no online information I could find confirmed Reyes-Euceda’s status, so in August 2019, I sought proof. When I called the Fox 2 newsroom to learn the information missing from their reporting, the man who answered the phone abruptly hung up on me.

I reached out to law enforcement sources. Although they would not confirm that Reyes-Euceda was illegally inside the United States, they did provide further details. Sources said his crash occurred at 2:48 p.m. on a sunny day, and that Michigan State Police found that Reyes-Euceda’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .221, nearly three times the legal limit of .08.

The same sources confirmed that Reyes-Euceda had previously been charged with operating while intoxicated in Dearborn on Nov. 5, 2016. He entered a guilty plea, and received a sentence of one day in jail, and 24 months on probation. Reyes-Euceda was still on probation from his charge in Dearborn when the fatal crash occurred. At the time, he was driving without a license, and was ineligible to receive one.

Next, I contacted the judge who tried Reyes-Euceda’s case. I left multiple messages expressing interest in the court documents from his trial. She never responded. Finally, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official confirmed that Reyes-Euceda is an “unlawfully present citizen of Honduras.” Prior to his deadly accident, the official stated, “ICE had no prior contact with Reyes-Euceda.”

The Hidden Costs of Criminal Illegal Immigrants

Detroit media and officials’ unwillingness to publicize Reyes-Euceda’s immigration status seems likely to result from a desire to shield the sanctuary city from national debate. After Trump’s January 2017 executive order denied federal funds to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, Detroit vacillated over whether it is a sanctuary city, a “welcoming city,” or neither.

The Center for Immigration Studies considers Detroit’s Wayne County a sanctuary city. Detroit is not the first city to have its sanctuary status come under scrutiny due to the actions of an illegal migrant who commits additional crimes.

The city of Virginia Beach, Va. found itself at the center of national debate over sanctuary policies in 2007, when drunk-driving illegal immigrant Alfredo Ramos killed 17-year-old Alison Kunhardt and 16-year-old Tessa Tranchant by running into their stopped car at a traffic light. The Virginia Beach Police Department had enacted a “sanctuary policy” in 2005 that prevented officers from asking for the immigration status of those charged with misdemeanor offenses.

Ramos, whose BAC was .24 at the time of his fatal crash, had been convicted of three previous alcohol-related misdemeanors in Virginia Beach before killing Tranchant and Kunhardt.

The actions of migrants who commit crimes in addition to illegal entry have effects beyond the county and state lines where their other crimes occur. In many state facilities, federal dollars issued via the Department of Justice’s State Criminal Alien Assistance Program cover at least a portion of illegal immigrants’ incarceration costs.

Given that the state of Michigan applied for and received SCAAP funding in 2019, it is likely that Americans across the country will pay a portion of the more than $36,000 annual cost of Reyes-Euceda’s 59-month to 20-year prison sentence.

Jailing Criminals Allowed to Remain Is Expensive

$244 million in SCAAP funding was allocated in 2020. This represents a tiny proportion of the overall annual cost to incarcerate illegal immigrants.

In 2018, investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson dissected Government Accountability Office data about criminal illegal immigrant detentions between 2011 and 2016. She found that 730,000 illegal immigrants had been arrested 4.9 million times for 7.5 million offenses during the period.

Allegations included “more than 1 million drug crimes, a half-million assaults, 133,800 sex offenses and 24,200 kidnappings…33,000 homicide-related offenses, and 1,500 terrorism-related crimes.” During that period, federal taxpayers spent $2.5 billion per year to imprison criminal illegal immigrants in local, federal, and state facilities.

The Pew Research Center estimates that illegal immigrants make up 3.2 percent of the U.S. population. In 2009, FAIR estimated an average of 5.4 percent of inmates in state and local facilities were illegal immigrants. In 2018, the Department of Justice reported that 26 percent of federal prisoners were “known or suspected aliens.” The Biden administration has censored the term “alien” and others from ICE’s lexicon.

Democrats’ pursuit of amnesty must be driven by facts, but where illegal immigrants are concerned, facts are hard to come by. This is particularly true in sanctuary states and cities, where the criminality of illegal immigrants can be deliberately obscured. It is reprehensible when media and judicial figures choose self-preservation over truth and justice, because illegal immigration affects all Americans.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/02/biden-opens-borders-as-media-and-governments-hide-details-about-illegal-immigrant-crime/,2021-03-02
Biden's Pick For Civil Rights Head Peddled Jussie Smollett Hoax,"President Joe Biden’s top pick to lead the Department of Justice’s civil rights division peddled the Jussie Smollett hoax on Twitter, criticizing anyone who questioned the black, gay actor’s falsified hate crime in 2019.

“Jussie Smollett subjected to a racist and homophobic attack. 2 white men wearing ski masks attacked him, put a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him and as they yelled slurs. Prayers to @JussieSmollett for a speedy recovery from this hate crime,” Kristen Clarke tweeted shortly after the alleged incident.

“To be clear — This is a BAD move by the Chicago Police Department. This is NOT how you treat survivors of a hate crime. Stop demonizing survivors and casting doubt on their claims if you want communities to trust that you will take #HateCrime seriously. @StopHateProj,” she wrote.

“Prosecutors use their discretion every day. But when a duly elected Black prosecutor, Kim Foxx, uses her discretion to move on from the Jussie Smolett [sic] matter, it’s a different story. A special prosecutor is brought in to undermine her power,”

Most Child Predators Receive Only Probation In Minnesota,"America is in the midst of a sex-trafficking crisis, fueled by the internet and pervasive and increasingly violent pornography. Trafficked persons are often children, many of whom come from broken families and the foster care system.

But a large part of trafficking goes unaddressed in the national media — predators who produce and trade child sexual abuse imagery (child pornography). These predators have massive “collections” that depict the rape and torture of prepubescent children, including infants and toddlers.

Many of these predators are actively abusing children, and all of these predators are a clear and present danger to young people. Because of this, most Americans assume authorities lock these predators away in the interest of public safety.

But the public would be wrong to assume America is tough on child predators. In many states, a large chunk of these predators receive only probation. Instead of thinking of the crime in terms of protecting children, the system focuses on predators and sees them as suffering an illness.

Of these bad states, and in a country that is generally too lax on the issue, Minnesota is arguably the worst. Indeed, the story of Minnesota highlights the need for national action.

In Minnesota, predators convicted of criminal sexual conduct (likely a contact crime) against a child victim under the age of 13 receive probation at least 50 percent of the time. Predators in Minnesota trading in violent and sadistic child sexual abuse imagery — depicting the rape and torture of prepubescent children — receive probation more than 80 percent of the time. In the last five years, Minnesota gave probation an astonishing 75 percent of the time for crimes of producing child pornography.

It’s so bad in the state that demoralized police officers and investigators say they have little hope of placing predators in prison unless the feds get involved. But federal resources are stretched, and there is a huge incentive for federal prosecutors to focus on gun and drug crimes.

The Backstory

In 2016, a report paid for by an outside group revealed Minnesota’s frightening statistics on prosecuting child sex crimes. Republican State Rep. Matt Grossell, also a former law enforcement officer, began to author bills to address the problem. The bills were ignored by Republican leadership in the Minnesota Senate.

Fast forward to 2019, when the Republican Senate leadership, led by Senate number-two Warren Limmer, finally authored a bill that raised the maximum penalties for enhanced crimes involving child sexual abuse imagery — enhanced crimes were defined as material involving a child under the age of 13, or if the predator was a repeat offender. The obvious problem at the time was that raising the maximum penalty does nothing in a state that presumes probation for more than 80 percent of these convictions.

Somewhere in the drafting process, a provision was taken out that would have allowed the public to better track the sentences given by their elected county attorneys (despite general apathy in the state, some prosecutors have better records than others). The bill also asked the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission — a body that sets sentencing rules for courts — to examine the matter further.

The MSGC report was released in early 2021. The MSGC finally changed the presumptive sentence to prison for producing child pornography, but only if the victim is 12 or under or if the predator is a repeat offender. Yet a small majority — all appointed by the state’s Democratic governor — declined to change the presumption from probation to prison when a predator is caught possessing and trading in child rape and torture imagery.

To excuse the status quo, the MSGC majority complained about the cost of added prison beds (about $36,000 per year per person), which ignores the current cost of rehabilitation programs and law enforcement resources used to (attempt to) monitor the hundreds of predators released on probation. The MSGC also cited a study that supposedly claimed low recidivism for “internet offenders” but ignored the study’s own authors, who cautioned that they were only measuring offenders who were caught a second time.

The MSGC then cherry-picked a handful of other states to compare against, but even against these states, Minnesota has a bad track record: far greater use of probation, and a far lower amount of prosecutions per capita (meaning many predators are evading detection and prosecution). In the end, the MSGC flat-out admitted that compared to all other states examined, and possibly to the rest of the country, Minnesota is the only state to give probation to the vast majority of predators.

Finally, the MSGC admitted that the materials the predators who receive only probation posess are massive “collections,” which depict the rape and torture of young children — flying in the face of certain Minnesota lawmakers’ concerns that persons would be prosecuted for “clicking on the wrong thing.”

Republicans to the Rescue?

Because of the MSGC inaction and obfuscation, Senate GOP leadership crafted SF 1457, coauthored by longtime GOP Sens. Warren Limmer and Mary Kiffmeyer. The bill was heard in the Judiciary and Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee, chaired by Limmer, on Mar. 8, 2021.

SF1457 would specifically direct the sentencing guidelines to finally presume prison for the crime of enhanced dissemination of child abuse materials — when the predator is a repeat offender or a child under 13 is the victim. While the penalty would be slightly increased, enhanced possession crimes — which again involve predators with “collections” of infant and toddler rape videos and images — will still result in probation.

Because of this, SF 1457 likely does nothing to address the state’s problem. Prosecutors can often charge either possession or dissemination for each predator they encounter. As mentioned above, Minnesota vastly overuses charges of possession. For example, Oregon charged possession 92 times and dissemination (distribution) 260 times, while Minnesota charged possession 427 times and dissemination only 32 times.

In plain math that means if the last five years of data is indicative on a go-forward basis, the Minnesota GOP bill would potentially affect roughly 4 percent of the convictions for trading in violent child sex abuse imagery, resulting in at most 20 more predators being given short prison sentences during the next five years. More than 80 percent of predators would still receive probation.

Given the nature of these materials (see pages 34-37 of the MSGC’s report), and the active threat to children posed by these predators, that is unacceptable. Proponents of SF 1457 might say that Minnesota prosecutors will begin to charge more for dissemination instead of possession, but that asks the public to wait another five years to see if the problem is corrected.

SF 1457’s authors may also believe it is the only bill that could pass a Democrat-controlled House. Two of the three Democrats on the committee — Ron Latz and Sandra Pappas — voted against SF 1457. Latz said he was “comfortable” with the status quo.

But that’s just this author’s most charitable guess for the rationale of SF 1457. Behind the scenes, GOP senators worry about the cost of putting all the predators behind bars — about $6 million per year. To put things in perspective, in 2015 the state Senate got a $90 million office building, which has maintenance costs of $2 million per year.

When GOP senators were contacted about SF 1457’s shortcomings, no replies were received after the specific question was asked: “Do you have any concerns about 1457 given it only [presumes prison for] dissemination?” because “in the last five years, Minnesota charged possession 427 times and dissemination 32 times.”

The Solutions

A better response at the state level is to copy federal laws, which carry mandatory minimums. That’s exactly what a bill, HF 229, authored by two members with law enforcement experience, intends to do. But the bill is not allowed a hearing by the Democrat House and ignored by Senate GOP leadership.

At both the state and federal level, more funding for the Internet Crimes Against Children taskforces is needed — compared to the drug war and other federal boondoggles, the ICACs are extremely underfunded. A state-level solution is Alecia’s Law, which sets up a dedicated funding stream for ICACs.

Overall, a national fight is in order, which should replace the drug war in terms of scope and federal attention. Federal prosecutors need greater incentives to go after predators instead of focusing on easier convictions involving drugs and guns. More dedicated law enforcement is needed, preferably a new organization separate from the politically distracted FBI.

But overcoming political apathy is hard and the status quo is extremely depressing. Even the federal government doesn’t take a serious approach to protect our children and keeping predators away from the public. Congress spends only about $30 million per year on the ICACs, out of roughly $85 million spent overall for child-rescue programs, which includes the quasi-governmental National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

In the end, the mess in Minnesota highlights the dysfunction of America’s political system. Politicians worry about the cost of protecting children, but waste loads of money elsewhere. Minnesota Democrats oppose a reform that will put maybe 15-20 predators away during the span of five years, and on short prison sentences. The Minnesota GOP could run on getting tough and win elections. Yet they opt for a tinker-around-the-edges approach, which maintains the status quo of probation for dangerous predators.

The one consolation is that voters are currently unaware of Minnesota’s record on these crimes and would likely find the state’s actions and inactions extremely troubling. In response, now, more than ever, the country needs a party that answers these concerns. It remains to be seen, however, if the Republican Party will evolve to fit the bill.

Washington Post Accuses Trump Of A Crime Based On Fabricated Quotes,"On Jan. 9, The Washington Post published a bombshell report about what President Trump reportedly said on a phone call to the Georgia elections investigator. The headline was “‘Find the fraud’: Trump pressured a Georgia elections investigator in a separate call legal experts say could amount to obstruction.”

A few days ago, on March 11, the Post quietly changed the headline and added this correction to the top of the story:

Correction: Two months after publication of this story, the Georgia secretary of state released an audio recording of President Donald Trump’s December phone call with the state’s top elections investigator. The recording revealed that The Post misquoted Trump’s comments on the call, based on information provided by a source. Trump did not tell the investigator to ‘find the fraud’ or say she would be ‘a national hero’ if she did so. Instead, Trump urged the investigator to scrutinize ballots in Fulton County, Ga., asserting she would find ‘dishonesty’ there. He also told her that she had ‘the most important job in the country right now.’ A story about the recording can be found here. The headline and text of this story have been corrected to remove quotes misattributed to Trump.

Suffice to say, the original story was impactful. “The president’s attempts to intervene in an ongoing investigation could amount to obstruction of justice or other criminal violations, legal experts said, though they cautioned a case could be difficult to prove,” reported the Post story.

The conclusion a sitting president may have committed a crime is still in the corrected story, even though that conclusion was initially at least partly based on fabricated quotes. While they didn’t directly cite this Post story, Trump’s alleged pressuring of Georgia officials was eventually cited by House Democrats in the impeachment articles against Trump. A few weeks later, House Democrats would cite the article and its fabricated quotes on page 10 of their impeachment brief, as well as highlight the article and its fake quotes in oral arguments during the televised impeachment trial.

Even accurately reported, the story may have been newsworthy or unflattering to Trump, but there’s a huge difference in criminal intent between a frustrated and addled Trump asking an investigator to look into fraud he genuinely believes is real versus pressuring the investigator to invent it. For what it’s worth, now that the investigator on the phone call has been identified, she has told local news “she did not perceive any pressure from the president’s call.”

A correction two months after the fact, when the story has already played a significant role in shaping perceptions of political events, seems wholly inadequate. The headline on the Post’s follow-up story is given an anodyne headline: “Recording reveals details of Trump call to Georgia’s chief elections investigator.”

Originally, the fabricated quotes were sourced to “an individual familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the conversation.” What has been revealed about how the story was reported makes the Post’s reporting look worse, not better:

The Washington Post reported on the substance of Trump’s Dec. 23 call in January, describing him saying that Watson should ‘find the fraud’ and that she would be a ‘national hero,’ based on an account from Jordan Fuchs, the deputy secretary of state, whom Watson briefed on his comments. In fact, he did not use those precise words. Rather, Trump urged the investigator to scrutinize Fulton County, where she would find ‘dishonesty,’ he said. He also said, ‘whatever you can do, Frances, it would be — it’s a great thing. It’s an important thing for the country. So important. You’ve no idea. So important. And I very much appreciate it.’

While both men are nominally Republicans, Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — Fuchs’ boss — were publicly at each others’ throats. In fact, the Post story acknowledged as much saying, “The president is furious with both Raffensperger and [Georgia Governor] Kemp, who have refused to echo his claims that the election was rigged.”

Revealing the source of the quotes shows the Post had cause for more scrutiny, not less. According to the chairman of the Georgia Republican party, “The Secretary of State’s office secretly recorded the conversation, mischaracterized its contents to The Washington Post and then attempted to delete the recording. It was recently discovered in a laptop ‘trash’ folder as part of an open records search.”

In fairness to Post reporter Amy Gardner, “The White House did not respond to requests for comment,” and if they had responded, perhaps they could have swatted down the story. The Post also took the inexplicably rare step of burning their anonymous source here so she could be held accountable. But in the end, neither of these things makes this Post story any less of a journalistic travesty.

In sum: The Washington Post anonymously printed fabricated quotes they knew were from a second-hand source in the office of a political enemy, couldn’t confirm the quotes with additional sourcing, still attributed them to the sitting president of the United States, used those quotes as a basis to speculate the president committed a crime, and the Democratic party would later repeatedly cite the bogus article when attempting to impeach Trump for “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

But wait! It gets much worse. Several other major media outlets — including NBC, ABC, USA Today, PBS, and CNN — “confirmed” the fabricated quotes from the Post’s anonymous source by, get this, citing their own anonymous sources.

Granted, I got a journalism degree more than 20 years ago, when it was merely a suspect profession rather than total Calvinball. But had I floated this sequence of events as a hypothetical to one of my professors in an ethics class, this would have been considered the media screw-up of the century.

Alas, not only is this going to pass without any consequences, we are inured to this behavior from the media. The Post did this at the tail end of a Trump presidency defined by years of the media repeatedly being debased by sources who used credulously granted anonymity as a cloak to pass off dodgy information, enrich themselves, or, ironically enough, sow doubt about the results of the 2016 election. It’s not exactly puzzling why the Trump White House may have stopped returning reporters’ calls.

Whether or not the mistakes above were intentional, this kind of thing has become so commonplace and reckless that intent is almost functionally irrelevant. With near universality, all these damning media screw-ups run in one political direction. It’s a shame New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn’t try and kiss any of those grandmothers he killed, otherwise the media may have been obligated to cover his deadly policies.

Even setting aside the overwhelming partisanship of the media, just as a matter of power dynamics, this all prompts a disturbing question for readers: If these are the journalistic standards used to cover the president or, say, a Supreme Court justice — do you know what happens when ordinary citizens get unfairly accused of wrongdoing by the media and don’t have the resources to fight back? You end up unemployed and washing dishes to eke out a living.

Increasingly, elements of the right are arguing the media’s incentives are now aligned with information warfare, not mere “bias.” The media is too arrogant to understand what increasing hostility means for them and the country, never mind that the growing levels of misinformation breaking into the mainstream are a direct consequence of diminished trust in the corporate media. When you can’t trust the dominant media, people start looking for information elsewhere.

A whole school of liberals and Never Trump adherents think media criticism is some kind of cop-out or distraction from the problems of Trump or the right more generally. But for the left, the media itself is their “cop-out.” In the end, the key difference between the right’s conspiracies and the left’s conspiracies is that the latter get a lot more air time and column inches. “Q will install Trump as emperor” rightly gets mocked and pitied, but “Trump treasonously colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election” gets mythologized at worst, rationalized at best.

Trump’s shortcomings may be monumental, but the idea he is somehow responsible for the abandoning of basic ethical standards in the institutions that opposed him is absurd at this point, never mind that political opposition is not the media’s vocational responsibility. In that respect, it’s too awkward for the press to confront the truth that Trump’s rise was symptomatic of extant distrust in media; he was not the father of that distrust.

Regardless, Trump’s not president anymore. Thanks to a surfeit of gobsmacking media behavior these last four years, many on the right are still arguing about the role media dishonesty played in his defeat. (Or in the case of one Politico editor, taking credit for censoring accurate news of his opponent’s corruption.)

With Trump gone, we are still stuck with a media that regularly reports things that aren’t true, let alone wholly fabricated as part of some political operation, and this misinformation plays a major role in shaping political and world events. They will then claim they are accountable because two months after the fact, and long after perceptions were hardened, they ran a correction on an anonymously sourced report they never should have run in the first place.

As alarming as all this is, in a disinformation climate such as the one we are currently living in, what happened with the Post’s correction is a rarity. Think for a second about all of the anonymously sourced stories you’ve read in recent years. Now realize it’s the dishonesty and manipulation that doesn’t get exposed that should scare you.

Philadelphia’s Violent Crime Rate Is Spiking Thanks To Failed Leftist Political Agendas,"Democratic Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and city officials acknowledged the city is on track for a record number of homicides, shootings, and confiscated guns this year, following months of Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots.

“It makes me absolutely sick to know that so many Philadelphians have suffered these preventable deaths,” Kenney said at a press conference Wednesday. “It’s painfully clear that we must take new approaches.”

According to new data from the Philadelphia Police department, homicides are up 30 percent in 2021 year-to-date. There have been 412 nonfatal shooting victims, whereas there were 258 last year. In total, 690 individuals have been arrested for illegal firearms compared to 355 last year. African Americans accounted for 86 percent of the shooting victims.

The city will now be holding bi-weekly briefings for the public that will be streamed on Facebook Live. The violent crime increase in Philadelphia can partially be attributed to Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner, who upheld a court diversionary program titled Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition that gives violent criminals a second opportunity to be released after a probationary period.

Krasner received $1.7 million from billionaire George Soros in 2017 in his election campaign. The Krasner campaign and Soros PAC spent about $1.9 million, which pales in comparison to the second-highest campaign money spent by Michael Untermeyer.

Soros notably invested $220 million in Black Lives Matter and other “racial equity” groups in July. He is also a backer of the Minnesota Freedom Fund that bailed out rioters and looters in response to the death of George Floyd. Krasner has come under fire for his controversial past of suing the Philadelphia Police department 75 times and calling law enforcement “systemically racist.”

“In 2020, when Philadelphia was ravished by radical left organizations like Black Lives Matter and criminal opportunists who rioted, looted, and torched police cars, District Attorney Larry Krasner failed to hold the perpetrators accountable,” nearby Montgomery County Commissioner Republican Joe Gale, who is currently running for governor in the Commonwealth told The Federalist.

“The Philly DA is clearly more concerned with placating progressives and furthering his political agenda than maintaining law and order. This toxic attitude of indifference is why Philadelphia suffered nearly 500 homicides and over 2,200 shootings last year,” Gale said.

“We don’t give up. We don’t give in,” said Kenney in January. “We are determined to save lives and create peace. We will turn the page on this dark chapter in the history of our city, and we will write the new book together. I vow to be with Philadelphians every step of the way as we take on this challenge.”

In June, Kenney dropped his prior proposal to increase police funding, and instead vied to slash budgets.

“We think we can police better and make sure we put the resources in the departments that can affect change and make the situation in our neighborhoods better,” he said this summer. “We want to approach this open-mindedly, but some of these things have to happen.”

Cities across the country experienced notable shootings and homicide increases this summer, with as much as 265 percent in Atlanta, 130 percent in New York City, 250 percent in Los Angeles, and 525 percent in crime increases in Seattle.

At the 2020 presidential debate in September, then-President Trump harped on the corruptness of Philadelphia.

“Bad things happen in Philadelphia,” Trump said, “bad things.”

“We are all responsible for what goes on here. This is our community and these are our children,” said Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/17/philadelphias-violent-crime-rate-is-spiking-thanks-to-failed-leftist-political-agendas/,2021-03-17
Left Claims To Care About Asian-Americans While Discriminating In School,"Last Tuesday, eight people were murdered in three Atlanta-area spas, and six of the victims were Asian females. Although authorities say it is premature to determine a racial motive and the current evidence indicates the 21-year-old white male perpetrator was motivated by sexual addiction, legacy media immediately took to speculating about a racial motivation.

The New York Times acknowledged “it was not clear whether there was a racial motivation” then took to describing Asian-American hate incidents, citing the organization Stop AAPI Hate funded by the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University.

CNN employed a comparable doublespeak. “Investigators said it was too early to say whether the crime was racially motivated, and instead pointed to the suspect’s claim of a potential sex addiction,” says a CNN report on the incident. But the same article described anti-Asian sentiments in U.S. history and referenced Stop AAPI Hate’s claims about hate crimes. The article also cites the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.

A few days after the shooting, ABC backed the ill-supported narrative. It cited The Page Act of 1875 — a bill to restrict Chinese women from emigrating to the United States — and described anti-Asian discrimination in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Philippine-American War. Where is the correlation?

Left-wing activists and politicians have also heralded the speculative rallying cry. On Monday, hundreds of #StopAsianHate supporters protested in Atlanta. Democratic Georgia Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff spoke, as did others like state Rep. Bee Nguyen — the first Asian-American Democratic to hold office in the state.

“We stand resiliently in defiance of hatred and murder,” Ossoff said. “This is Georgia. This is love. This is compassion. This is the best of us and this is what defines the people of our state and our nation, not those who kill or scapegoat or engage in racism or hate speech or hate crimes.“

Notwithstanding that the corporate media and their leftist allies are willing to push any and all narratives without proper evidence, there is something important to remember here. While the left virtue-signals about Asian discrimination and seems to believe that being the loudest shows the most solidarity, it is also the left that has categorically discriminated against Asian Americans for decades through affirmative action policies.

Walk Down Memory Lane

Back in 1996, vice-chancellor Jerry Kang at the University of California-Los Angeles described affirmative action as having a “double-edge” that has justified “negative action” against Asians. Kang, who graduated from Harvard University, is certainly no conservative; he lectures on implicit bias throughout the country and is the founding vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion at UCLA.

Nonetheless, Kang’s hypothesis was firmly rejected in the academic world. In the eyes of the woke ivory tower, the “internal instability” he described of institutions denying the “right to equality” was not the proper way to champion equitable outcomes.

Through the lens of equitability, institutions operated by the left have aimed to determine that some races deserve admittance, while primarily Asians and whites do not. In the process of seeking to “level the playing field,” much the opposite has been happening for years. The playing field is no longer a playing field at all. It is a laboratory for politically motivated administrators to play God.

“There is definitely racism against Asians, just as there is racism from every color against every other color. I don’t buy the media’s attempt to carry a white supremacy narrative into this fact, because Asians have to face racism from (and are racist against) whites and blacks. The solution has to be to reduce the role that color plays in our discourse on all sides because it literally ‘colors’ our ability to understand the true facts behind this crime and other crimes,” said Kenny Xu, the author of the upcoming book “An Inconvenient Minority: The Ivy League Admissions Cases and the Attack on Asian American Excellence.”

In 2018, a study from the Center for Equal Opportunity found that elite colleges and universities routinely discriminate against Asian American applicants due to affirmative action quotas. It found that Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were “capping” Asian acceptance rates in the same way that schools capped Jewish people rates in the 1920s. The study notes:

At both MIT and Harvard there seems to be a limit or ‘ceiling’ on how many Asian American applicants are to be admitted. If there were no such ceiling, both MIT and Harvard would probably enroll a significantly larger number of Asian American applicants,’ the study notes. ‘As it is, some of those applicants may conclude they were rejected on account of their race. That would be discrimination, certainly as a matter of fact, and most likely in a way that is not consistent with the constraints on such discrimination that the Supreme Court has established.

Linda Chavez, the founder and chairman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, said that “Too many Asian Americans applying to elite schools are discriminated against on account of their race.” Since 1995, her organization has published dozens of studies on racial and ethnic discrimination in admissions processes to schools. Many of the research evidently stems from the racial quotas that leftist administrators champion, which has slashed meritocracy.

In August, the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Yale University discriminated against both Asians and whites in undergraduate admissions. The DOJ probe found that Yale violated Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in its using of racial or national origin information to produce a multi-step, non-meritorious admissions process.

“For the great majority of applicants, Asian Americans and whites have only one-tenth to one-fourth of the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials. Yale rejects scores of Asian American and white applicants each year based on their race, whom it otherwise would admit,” the DOJ noted.

“There is no such thing as a nice form of race discrimination,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. “Unlawfully dividing Americans into racial and ethnic blocs fosters stereotypes, bitterness, and division.”

But while these studies and probes reveal affirmative action means systemic racism against Asian Americans and whites, the left continues to champion affirmative action. Biden’s Jan. 26 executive order to make “more concerted efforts to address hate crimes and harassment against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders” is broad jargon that Asian-American activists deem hollow.

“I think the executive order was just a form of pandering to the Asian-American community,” Issac Yi of the Young Asian Pacific American Leaders told The Washington Free Beacon.

Hypocrisy Runs Deep In Washington, D.C. Inc.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department rolled back the Trump-era Yale lawsuit affirmation in February under Biden’s lead “in light of all available facts, circumstances, and legal developments.” The DOJ dismissed a thorough two-year investigation that showed black students with the same academic qualifications as Asians were as much as eight times more likely to be admitted.

Roger Severino, former director of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump, said this was highly unusual.

“The DOJ can’t rewrite history. What they were trying to do, which was highly unusual, was to withdraw their notice letter which had the factual findings that showed Yale was engaging in outright racial balancing to the detriment of Asian Americans,” Severino told The Federalist. “It’s highly unusual to reach back in time and to dispute the factual findings of your career professionals. This is what should be seen as a very ideologically motivated departure from standard practice.”

“I do acknowledge that there is a significant amount of discretion at DOJ as to what cases they’re going to pursue,” Severino added. “But that’s different than revoking findings of facts. The facts are the facts.”

Aside from the controversial legal theory that the Biden administration’s DOJ has championed, the corrupt media is gaslighting us all on this issue. While The Washington Post has a long history of publishing material claiming that Asian-discrimination no longer exists in education — and ignoring brutal affirmative action standards — it now claims solidarity over unsupported motives of the lone gunman in Atlanta.

The New York Times, which likewise backed discrimination against Asians in a 2017 report, is now publishing article after article claiming a moral high ground, in addition to identifying supposed discrimination.

Asians have been discriminated against for decades because of the left’s immoral affirmative action policies, spurred by diversity racial quotas. But seldom do the Democrats recognize their own catastrophic failures, instead of pinning them on white supremacy or white people as a whole.

“White supremacy and hate are haunting Asian Americans,” ran a headline in CNN on March 18. “Asian Americans are the latest victims of white supremacy,” an article in The Hill declared on March 20. “… Racism, misogyny, & white supremacy are a threat to all communities, and we must call out the targeted, violent attacks on our AAPI neighbors,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., tweeted on March 17.

“To our asian neighbors, family, and friends,” tweeted freshman Rep. Cori Bush D-Mo., “… We will dismantle white supremacy alongside you.”

The hypocritical left ought to spare us their sanctimony about Asian discrimination in the Atlanta shooting. If the evidence shows it is true, fine. Any good-hearted person will denounce any form of racial discrimination. But until a racial motivation is established by evidence, do us all a favor, Washington, D.C. Inc.: Perform a little introspection on your own actions.

Left Claims To Care About Black Lives While Abandoning Them,"On August 27, 2020, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both candidates at the time, responded to the shooting of Jacob Blake by talking about the constant fear black Americans live with due to systemic racism. Details of the case, specifically the fact that Blake was armed with a knife, were still developing at the time.

The news of Blake stood in stark contrast to the public response to a mass shooting that had occurred just two weeks prior in Biden and Harris’s backyard. More than 20 black people, including an off-duty police officer, were shot at a party in Washington, D.C. on August 9, 2020.

There were no statements by Biden or Harris. Outside of an article on CNN there was almost no national attention paid to the shooting at all. The Washington Nationals baseball team canceled a game in support of Blake but didn’t even send a single tweet about a brazen act of violence that happened minutes from its stadium.

These incidents reflect one of the most important rules of modern politics: black lives matter much more to the left when threatened by white perpetrators than by black ones.

Concern Is Not Colorblind

Consider the case of Jazmine Barnes, a 7-year-old black girl who was fatally shot in Walmart parking lot in Houston. Police initially believed the suspect was a white man in his 40s. Those original reports led Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, attorney Lee Merritt, and a number of celebrities and civil rights activists, like Shaun King, to declare the tragedy a hate crime.

A few days later the police caught two black suspects and charged them with capital murder. No celebrities corrected their initial statements and the man they accused of the crime took his own life seven months later.

Jazmine Barnes is no anomaly. Between January and September of last year, more than 400 children, mostly black and Hispanic, were killed in street violence. There is a lot of talk about racial disparities in the prison system, but the reality is that those disparities, which are caused by violent crimes, not drug crimes, are driven by fact that 13 percent of the population accounts for half of the homicides in the United States.

I’m sympathetic to communities and politicians who don’t want to increase the number of black men in prison or provide fodder for racists who think black people are inherently violent. There are no virtues or vices inherent to any skin color or ethnic group. Anyone who thinks otherwise hasn’t seen the data on who commits most child sex crimes.

At the same time, the safety of law-abiding black Americans across the country is more important than trying to change the minds of ignorant people who don’t suffer the consequences of violent crime in their neighborhoods.

Many Parts to the Problem

It is impossible to address this phenomenon without being honest about the self-serving political, economic, and cultural interests that perpetuate it. Democratic politicians are reluctant to do anything that can be perceived as critical of their black constituents. They also see the terrible price people like Hillary Clinton and Biden paid politically for supporting tough-on-crime legislation like the 1994 crime bill and have decided it is easier to focus on access to guns and systemic racism.

The party’s support structure plays a large role in selecting which black lives matter as well. Each viral incident creates a seamless coordination between corporate and social media outlets that replay videos on an endless loop, politicians who make speeches condemning systemic racism, corporations that issue statements about the importance of diversity, intellectuals who finally get to cash in on their pseudoscientific racial theories, and education administrators who turn the latest social justice cause into curricula and school resources.

That type of efficient operation illustrates a mature industry in which black suffering is the raw material, fear and division are the main products, and more power for the key stakeholders is the bottom line. That sounds harsh, but how else do you explain the speed with which we went from discussing qualified immunity and chokeholds after George Floyd’s death to demands for more diversity on corporate boards, books on white fragility, pancake syrup logos, NBA jerseys with “Love Us” printed on the back, and media mega-deals for Black Lives Matter co-founders?

Solutions Start With Honesty

Street violence can’t be fixed overnight, but progress can be made over time through a renewed focus on families, faith institutions, and a culture that promotes the sanctity of life. As a Christian father, my goal is to help my children understand that their inherent worth and dignity comes from being created by God, not what they look like or what other people think of them.

Young men who fire guns recklessly into crowds neither see the value in their lives nor the lives of others. Liberal politicians have acted as if more programs are a replacement for strong families, but the government is an unfaithful husband and a chronically absent father. Its resources are stretched too thin and its attention is too transactional to replace what families lose when dads are absent.

Getting the left to value black lives regardless of what is threatening them will also take time. Initiatives like Voices of Black Mothers United are needed to bring attention to the impact of violent crime on families and communities across the country.

We need brave community leaders and everyday citizens to ask their elected officials, whether mayors or congressional members representing large cities, why white supremacy is treated as a national issue while crimes against their actual constituents are rarely addressed from their bully pulpit.

Democrats took their performative activism to a new level in 2020, whether by kneeling in Kente cloth in the Capitol or through public art projects to troll the former president. By contrast, President Trump’s Operation Legend initiative seized more than 2,600 guns and made more than 6,000 arrests, including 467 for homicide, across nine cities between July and December 2020. Considering the fact that only about 60 percent of homicide cases are closed nationally, a rate even lower when black victims are involved, Operation Legend was a government response that actually saved lives.

It is easier for the left to evoke the injustice of Emmett Till’s murder after a white woman harasses a black bird-watcher in Central Park than it is after two separate mass shootings in Chicago, whether outside of a funeral in 2020 or a party in 2021. The predictable cadre of black pundits, academics, and media personalities who pen op-eds and make cable news appearances for the former are conspicuously silent after the latter.

The reason is quite clear. They have decided that race-hatred is worse than self-hatred. It’s time to speak honestly about that. Just because these people have decided to live with it doesn’t mean the rest of us have to lie about it as well.

"If Democrats Want To 'Stop Asian Hate,' They Must Stop Decriminalization","Two of California’s most progressive cities, Oakland and San Francisco, have seen a string of attacks against Asian Americans in recent months. For California Democrats, the response to this crime wave is not to punish criminals and protect law-abiding citizens, but to to the exact opposite.

A controversial crime bill now going through the Democratic-led California legislature is seeking to decriminalize robbery from a felony to a misdemeanor. The bill is sponsored by Democrat Senator Nancy Skinner, whose district covers from East Bay to Oakland, where Asian Americans have experienced increased attacks.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, “since the start of 2021, at least 32 Asians have been assaulted or robbed in the Bay Area.” Look at just a few of the most recent crimes here:

Oakland, April 2, 2021, four people robbed two Asian seniors in front of their house. Fortunately, the couples’ son was home, and he chased the robbers away by waving a machete.

Oakland, April 1, 2021, robbers tied an Asian couple in front of their 7-year-old daughter and brutally beat the husband before stealing the couple’s life savings.

Oakland, March 9, 2021, a 75-year old Asian man, Pak Ho, was robbed and knocked to the ground by 26-year old Teaunte Bailey during Ho’s morning walk. Ho died two days later. Bailey has a criminal history dating back to 2012, including multiple felonies in Oakland, and only last month was he involved in an arm-robbery in San Francisco.

San Francisco, February 23, 2021, three people robbed and cruelly beat up a 67-year-old Asian American man in a Laundromat. The suspects were arrested, and they were wanted in connection to multiple auto burglaries in the area.

Oakland, February 10, 2021, in broad daylight, two young men attacked a 71-year-old Asian lady by” knocking her to the ground before yanking her purse so hard the strap breaks off.” The old lady is bruised and still has body aches.

It is in the wake of these events that Sen. Skinner introduced SB- 82 to decriminalize robbery. Under existing California law, robbery is a felony and is punishable with prison time. SB-82 would turn robberies from a felony into a misdemeanor called petty thefts, as long as the economic value of the loss is under $950 and the crime doesn’t involve weapons or cause the victim severe injuries.

Under SB-82, the penalty for petty theft would be six months to one year in county jail, a $1,000 fine, or both. Offenders would qualify for a diversion program, a rehabilitation program that allows the offender to avoid conviction and, in some jurisdictions, avoid a criminal record.

SB-82 is also designed to be retroactive. It would change and reduce the criminal penalty for even those already convicted of robbery and are currently serving jail time.

Under SB-82, some of the recent robbery cases I just mentioned, including the robbery of the senior Asian couple and the robbery of the 71-year-old Asian woman, would all be reclassified as petty theft. Since SB – 82 is retroactive, many of the 961 strong-arm robberies in the city of Oakland will be reclassified as petty thefts. Those perpetrators will receive much lighter sentences than they would under current law.

Skinner justified her new crime bill in the name of achieving social justice because she regards a felony charge of robbery and the punishment that comes with it as unfair to certain racial groups. In truth, like so many other woke initiatives Democrats have been promoting, all SB-82 will end up doing is to hurt people of all races who don’t enjoy the privileged life Skinner does.

Politicians like Skinner should have learned from their last disastrous crime reform bill. In 2014, voters passed the notorious Proposition 47, which reduces penalties for specific drug and property crimes such as drug possession, theft, and shoplifting.

Among other things, Prop 47 more than doubled the amount a suspect could steal before facing a felony from $450 to $950. Prop 47 also “allows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for reduced sentences.” The Democrats in California marketed Prop 47 as a “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act.” Many voters bought the lie and passed the measure with a wide margin.

But since Prop 47’s passing, neighborhoods and schools in California have become less safe. Car burglaries, shoplifting, other theft, and criminal activities have surged in the state. A study by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California concludes that the jump of these crimes results from fewer arrests and a more lenient criminal sentence, mandated by Prop 47.

California cops on the street don’t need a study to tell them that Prop 47 is to blame for rising crimes in their district. The Police Chiefs Association tried to sponsor legislation that would amend Prop 47, adding a felony for serial theft with a value of $250 below the pre-Prop 47 limits. The Californian Democrats not only defeated this sensible legislation, but now want to make the criminal law even more lenient by changing any theft up to $950 from a felony to a misdemeanor. Should SB-82 pass, the crime rate will only go up.

Not surprisingly, SB-82 has already drawn intense criticism from law enforcement agencies and Asian American community in Skinner’s district.

On its Facebook page, the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office said SB-82 will treat violent crime with “barely a slap on the wrist.” It went on to say that SB-82 “would allow criminals to beat someone to steal their property, and as long as they didn’t use a weapon, break any bones, or cause great bodily injury, it will be a misdemeanor. Do they even care about victims in Sacramento?”

Asian American organizations outraged about the bill staged a protest in Oakland’s Chinatown. Carl Chan, president of the Chinatown Chamber, believes SB-82 will “reward those who commit crime and punish the victims.” Given that the Asian American community is already on edge about the rising crimes against their community, Alan Auyeung of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce said the bill’s timing shows politicians are “tone deaf” of the community’s concern.

Democrats who claim to stand with the Asian American community against hate crimes are the same ones who will vote to endanger Asian American victims and fail to protect those most vulnerable. They continue to spread lies that the rising crimes against Asian Americans result from “white supremacy” and former President Trump’s rhetoric on the coronavirus, even though most crimes against Asian Americans in recent months were committed by non-white perpetrators who were going after property.

Although many Asian Americans are beginning to see through Democrats’ empty rhetoric, lies, and dangerous policies, a majority of Asian Americans still keep showing up for the Democrat party at ballot boxes. In 2012, President Barack Obama won 73 percent of the Asian-American vote, exceeding his support among Hispanics (71 percent) and women voters (55 percent).

In 2016, 79 percent of Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters supported Hillary Clinton. The 2020 presidential election result shows that although Trump made inroads with AAPI voters by winning 34 percent of AAPI votes, most AAPI voters still supported the Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Biden.

SB-82 should serve as the latest wake-up for Asian Americans in California. We need to ask ourselves: why are we voting for a party that doesn’t see us as equal to other racial groups and is willing to impose laws and regulations that harm our interests and safety, all in the name of social justice and equity? For Asian Americans, our political awakening must begin at the ballot box if we want to keep our families, elders, and community safe.

You’re Not Antiracist If You Hide Crimes Due To The Perpetrators’ Race,"In the wake of a follower of black nationalist leader Louis Farrakhan murdering a Capitol Police officer this month, corporate media outlets are declining to connect his actions to his extremist beliefs. This appears to be becoming the standard for such cases. A look at the deeper ecosystem of media and narrative construction helps explain why.

In response to an Andrew Sullivan article about the recent Atlanta killings in which he noted black Americans are overrepresented in FBI hate-crime offender data, the Daily Kos’s David Neiwert informed the world that using per-capita rates in discussions on black criminality is a “favorite statistical manipulation” by white nationalists, including incarcerated mass murderer Dylann Roof.

The use of “as a percentage of the population” crime numbers to suggest blacks are more likely to be criminals is a favorite statistical manipulation of white nationalists, especially the whole “Color of Crime” crowd that inspired Dylann Roof.https://t.co/iIAI1Tk6bz — David Neiwert (@DavidNeiwert) March 21, 2021

Neiwert attempted to support his point by linking to a report he authored while at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) a few years back and posting: “White people are by far the demographic most likely to commit hate crimes.”

He is indeed right: Whites do commit the majority of hate crimes in America (53 percent of them); far more than do blacks (23 percent). Of course, without acknowledging that whites are 60 percent of the population and blacks 12, this doesn’t illuminate a whole lot.

Neither did a report of Neiwert’s from 2017, in which he downplayed Islamic terrorism cases from 2008 to 2016 because they were less frequent than white, right-wing ones (63 cases versus 115). By failing to adjust for U.S. population differences, though (3.5 million versus 237 million), Neiwert kept from readers that, by his own count, Muslims were 38 times more likely than whites to commit a domestic terrorist act.

Neiwert, a veteran, award-winning journalist, surely knows all this. He also knows that whites in America likely don’t commit 53 percent of all hate crimes.

Since he has written detailed reports burrowing into the U.S. Department of Justice’s statistics on this issue for the SPLC, Neiwert is no doubt aware the agency lumps Hispanic offenders in with white ones when reporting its “white” offender rates—something they curiously don’t do for the victim category. Considering Hispanic general crime rates are higher than that of whites, it’s likely the 53 percent attribution is inflated in relation to whites.

But what’s more important about the episode is the trend it helps reveal: Long-time “antiracist” advocates, like Neiwert and the SPLC, unmasking themselves as the kind of racists they supposedly decry. It’s a trend that seems to grow more alarming by the week.

Take the SPLC’s recent decision to stop labeling anti-white, black separatist organizations as “hate groups.” The organization didn’t name the groups they delisted, but the article features a picture of Farrakhan and quotes him. They reasoned: “While these groups can be virulently anti-white, this prejudice does not represent the same threat as white supremacy in America.” So, suggests the long-time “civil rights” advocate, it’s okay to be anti-white, even virulently so.

Elsewhere, they admonished the FBI’s supposed “false and misleading contention regarding threats from Black separatists… [because such groups express] valid anger against very real historical and systemic oppression.”

From Black Panther violence in the post-civil rights era, the Nation of Islam’s “Zebra Killings” in 1973 (in which more than 50 white people are believed to have been killed), or the black Muslim “D.C. Sniper” who admitted trying to kickstart a race war; to the recent antisemitic murders by the Black Hebrew Israelites and the extreme violence linked to Black Lives Matter: all of this points to the FBI’s monitoring of black nationalist developments having a pretty firm basis in reality.

Before this, black nationalist groups on the SPLC’s hate-group list had been growing four-fold since 2000, outnumbering white ones on a 2-to-1 basis. Most would find this surprising, considering the attention devoted to ethno-nationalist groups from the mainstream media and the SPLC is nearly always on whites only.

Other “anti-hate” groups can be just as racially discriminatory. Take the SPLC’s partner in Canada, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. Twice its leaders have been forced to admit that, despite their general antiracism mandate, it really is only white people they’re after.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is another “civil rights” advocate that’s curiously racially selective. In 2019, Business Insider published a scathing report about the group’s fraudulent hate-crime reporting—which, they concluded, is intended solely to scaremonger—appropriately comparing them to “ultranationalists” who like “cherry-picking statistics.”

Specifically, when the report’s authors scrutinized the ADL’s tally of more than 600 “extremist violence” incidents between 2009 and 2018 (a tiny number considering 3,300 violent crimes take place in America daily), it found that only 200 could be credibly tied to extremism. While this alone was a big enough indictment against the ADL and the journalists who parrot them, Business Insider failed to highlight another big finding: the source of the inflation.

Among the ADL’s four categories of violence—Islamist, left-wing, right-wing, and white supremacist extremism—researchers found that the first two were more or less accurate; 85 of the 88 Islamist incidents checked out as properly labeled, as did 24 of the 26 leftist ones. Where the ADL was inflating things was almost entirely in the “white, right-wing” areas.

As the researchers noted, among the 300 incidents of right-wing extremism during this period, when reviewed, only 131 were found to truly fit the bill. White supremacist extremism was even more inflated: just 57 incidents of the 199 claimed by the ADL credibly had such a motivation.

That the ADL’s “hate inflation” fell only on whites and right-wingers; that the spirit of scrutiny apparently grips the SPLC when reviewing some racial agendas but not others; and that people like Neiwert pass over basic facts to pursue anti-white narratives can be summed up in one word: bigotry. It should be called out as such by conservatives and independents whenever they see it.

Deep State Mouthpiece Retaliates Against Staffer Who Uncovered Russia Collusion Hoax,"A frequent media mouthpiece for the intelligence community who published the classified leak that launched the Russia collusion hoax is retaliating against the senior government official who debunked it.

In a meandering Washington Post column, first mocking the idea of a “deep state” before repeatedly and effusively praising it for its work thwarting the will of the elected government, David Ignatius uses anonymous sources to attack Kashyap Patel for exposing misbehavior by intelligence officials, holding them accountable, and mostly for the crime of behaving as if the duly elected President Donald Trump, not unelected bureaucrats, was the real head of the executive branch of government.

Ignatius is a Mouthpiece

David Ignatius has been used for decades as a conduit for anonymous intelligence officials to spew their claims, no matter how erroneous, partial, or unsubstantiated those claims are. And he doesn’t mind being so used. For example, after the anonymously sourced claims he helped peddle to launch the Iraq War were found to be false, he said, “Personally I don’t much care if the U.S. reports about weapons of mass destruction prove to be imaginary.”

In the last year alone, he pushed the fake news about Russia paying bounties for American soldiers in Afghanistan. He pushed the anonymously sourced Atlantic claim — disputed by more than a dozen on-the-record and first-hand sources, contemporary weather reports, government documents, and other sourced information — that Trump avoided paying respects at Aisne-Marne cemetery in France because he hated soldiers.

As the corporate media and its Big Tech allies aggressively censored legitimate news about Biden family business engagements with foreign adversaries, Ignatius aided the effort, claiming a nameless “Eastern European expert in digital forensics” who examined some Hunter Biden laptop documents “told me he found anomalies — such as American-style capitalization of the names of ministries — that suggest fakery.” Not even the Biden campaign itself made such a claim.

Most notably, when intelligence operatives couldn’t get even otherwise credulous Washington Post reporters to run with their absurd suggestion that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn may have violated an obscure and never-used 1799 law called the Logan Act by doing the expected and prudent thing of talking to a Russian ambassador as President Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor, they had no trouble getting the columnist Ignatius to regurgitate their spin on the criminal leak of classified information about those phone calls. Ignatius’ complicity was a key component driving the continued investigation of Flynn by his political opponents and launching the hysterical belief among many on the left that Donald Trump had won in 2016 by being a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the election. It and follow-up regurgitations from the intelligence community also helped secure the expensive and cumbersome Special Counsel probe that caused the Trump administration so much pain. It turned out that not a single American was found to have colluded with Russia to steal the election. Nevertheless, Ignatius clings bitterly to the conspiracy theory.

“He has ruined his reputation by being a purveyor of left-wing gossip,” former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell said of the Post opinion writer. Ignatius promotes unsubstantiated, left-wing rumors that more often than not turn out to be information that is wrong, partially wrong, or unverified bits of raw intelligence that lack context, other former intelligence officials say.

Political Retaliation Against Kash Patel

As a senior staff member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Patel was responsible for much of the work debunking the conspiracy theory that arose out of the criminal leak of classified information to Ignatius, a crime that was never really investigated and certainly never prosecuted. The people Patel exposed worked with liberal journalists to attack him for years.

The Daily Beast had a source, anonymous of course, calling him Devin Nunes’ “Torquemada,” in the early days of his work. The New York Times also singled him out for abuse for his work exposing the Russia collusion hoax that they had pushed. The attacks always use anonymous sources. (Incidentally, the best thing about the Times attack was when it strongly suggested Patel’s hockey team “The Dons” — named for legendary Canadian hockey announcer Don Cherry — was actually named in honor of Donald Trump.)

Now, Ignatius’ anonymous sources claim that it is Patel who is “facing” an investigation by Department of Justice officials for “possible improper disclosure of classified information.” It’s impossible to know if such a potential investigation is real or just another one of the made-up claims that Ignatius is always eager to peddle.

He doesn’t say that Patel is “under” investigation, but “facing” one. He claims this potential investigation would be something that arose out of a complaint from an “intelligence agency,” but it’s impossible to know if that’s true or just something being said for the purpose of another Russia collusion hoax-style operation. One intelligence official said that while anyone can start an investigation, if Patel’s enemies had a legitimate claim against him, some evidence would have been provided. Ignatius provides no substantiation for the claim. But at least he didn’t accuse him of violating the Logan Act!

Like all of Ignatius’ other work, it’s labeled “Opinion,” something that bothers Blake Hounsell, a managing editor at Politico, and prominent Twitter journalist Yashar Ali. Hounsell called it an “impressive display of reporting.” It’s a weird thing to say about something absolutely riddled with errors, as this piece is.

To take just one example, Ignatius claims that Patel was “a senior adviser to acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell and his successor, John Ratcliffe, helping lead their efforts to remove senior career intelligence officers.” In fact, Patel was never an adviser, senior or otherwise, to Ratcliffe. And Ratcliffe never removed any senior career intelligence officials when he was Director of National Intelligence. But other than the complete lack of accurate information in the sentence, an “impressive display of reporting” indeed!

As one former intelligence official told me, “Like everything that David Ignatius writes, it’s so false it seems intentionally false. It’s hard to tell if he’s a bad reporter or a bad person or both.”

Ignatius also regurgitates previous false reporting about Patel’s investigation of the since-debunked Christopher Steele dossier. He asserts that Patel went to London to engage in hijinks to track Steele down on a “quixotic hunt.” In fact, Patel, who was in London on separate intelligence committee business, merely stopped by the address for Steele’s attorney as found in public court documents and left a card saying that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence would like to interview his client. Steele’s attorneys quickly ran to the media and other Democratic operatives to spin an alternate and more dramatic, but less factual, version of events.

BlueAnon on the March

Much ink has been spilled about “QAnon” — an umbrella term for a set of conspiracy theories including one that “Trump would not actually leave office as scheduled but would declare martial law, announce mass arrests of Democrats and stop Mr. Biden from taking office,” according to the New York Times. So it was pretty weird when Ignatius put forth that very same conspiracy theory, with Patel as the central figure!

As with so many other still-mysterious aspects of the Trump presidency, there’s a riddle at the center of Patel’s many activities. Beyond the basic goal of advancing Trump’s personal agenda, was there a larger mission? Was there a systematic plan, for example, to gain control of the nation’s intelligence and military command centers as part of Trump’s effort to retain the presidency, despite his loss in the November 2020 election?

Ignatius is just asking questions! Questions about whether Kash Patel was QAnon! It’s difficult to characterize how insane the question is. Ignatius never returns to this ridiculous speculation that Patel was trying to overthrow the government, he just chucks it out there and moves on. Despite its lack of substantiation, CNN contributor Garrett Graff seems to agree, saying the country came close to a “literal coup” and how the guardrails against it nearly broke.

The article goes through Patel’s work as senior counsel for Rep. Devin Nunes on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence as it exposed wrongdoing in the Russia collusion hoax, with the National Security Council as the senior director for counterterrorism, as senior adviser to acting DNI Grenell, and as chief of staff for acting defense secretary Christopher Miller. It also claims a role Patel never had, the aforementioned imaginary position with Ratcliffe.

Ignatius relies exclusively on snippets from anonymous sources to bash Patel, an easy accomplishment given their anonymity and the fact that Patel was involved in efforts to reform the massive bureaucracy. Ignatius alternates between describing Patel as a genius mastermind and ineffective.

Before describing Patel’s story as an “American immigrants’ dream,” he describes Patel as New York-born (though he gets the city of his birth wrong). He claims that “One top Pentagon official saw Patel as a direct threat to lawful government” but nothing in the story supports this. To the contrary, it shows that Patel was trying to implement the policies of a lawfully elected president, and unelected appointees and bureaucrats were trying to stop him because they thought they knew better.

A Stunning Admission that Nunes was Right

Ignatius quietly and briefly admits that “Patel sometimes hit pay dirt,” citing his report on the FBI’s abuse of its application to spy on the Trump campaign, later vindicated by the Department of Justice Inspector General’s report and the guilty plea a former FBI lawyer filed for falsifying information used to apply for warrants.

It’s a stunning admission for a Washington Post writer to make, since the paper could not have been more hostile to the work of those who exposed the malfeasance. The paper ran an op-ed from the former deputy director of the CIA, calling on bureaucrats to do everything in their power to keep the American people in the dark about the abuse of Trump campaign affiliate Carter Page’s civil liberties. Once the abuses did come to light, Philip Bump, a Post employee who does not know where babies come from, said that the release of the completely flawed wiretap applications actually made the Nunes memo “even less credible” than it already was. And that’s quite the claim from the Bezos newspaper since when it came out, Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman screeched that it was a “joke and a sham.” Aaron Blake suggested that the problems and surveillance abuses outlined by the memo were “fatally” flawed “conspiracy theories.”

“The trumped-up charges and cherry-picked evidence of the Nunes memo discredit the House majority. Republicans who should know better, starting with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), have enabled this assault on independent law enforcement and accelerated the GOP’s disgrace,” harrumphed the entire Washington Post editorial board in a piece headlined “The Nunes memo continues to backfire.”

A “nothingburger” exclaimed the Post’s Michael Cavna, before showing cartoons that also showed the “Nunes memo backfired.” Bezos’ Post could not have been more invested in the messaging. “The Nunes memo is looking like a bust for Trump,” Blake wrote. Blake also wrote a piece disparaging the “6 tortured arguments” Republicans were making about FISA abuse.

It’s hard to keep that line of propaganda going after the failure of Special Counsel Mueller to find a single American colluding with Russia to steal the 2016 election, after the Inspector General Horowitz wrote 400+ pages outlining the abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court by the intelligence community, and after a lawyer pleaded guilty to falsifying information as part of the process. But the begrudging admission is still remarkable for what a complete turnabout it is from the Post’s previous line about FISA abuse.

Much of Ignatius’ lengthy piece is about how intelligence officials fought efforts to release more information about the Russia collusion hoax. While the information would have been helpful to those who had exposed the failings and malfeasance of the Russia collusion hoax, it apparently would have brought great embarrassment to the intelligence community, including at least one key official who fought its release.

Releasing Classified Info While Claiming Someone Else Did

The article includes massive amounts of details on a successful rescue mission by SEAL Team Six. While Ignatius’ version of the event and analysis of same is wrong in key respects, such as completely misidentifying the problem caused by some top officials always looking for ways to not do what Trump directed, the bigger issue identified by multiple officials was the level of detail that was publicized by the Post. It was their view that if the story contained truth, it was an inappropriate level of detail to be revealed outside of a classified setting. And that’s particularly noteworthy considering that the purpose of the story was to assert that Patel was under investigation for inappropriate handling of classified information.

Praising the Deep State

Ignatius writes, with grave concern, that Trump’s more loyal political appointees were “motivated partly by a desire to restrict the intelligence agencies’ power, and partly to deliver on Trump’s promise to end overseas wars.” First off, how telling that Ignatius thinks it’s bad to restrict intelligence agencies’ power to abuse the civil liberties of American citizens and to meddle in presidential elections and administrations. Secondly, how telling that Ignatius thinks it’s bad — although he’s been quite open about this — to end overseas wars even decades after they’ve been won.

The general perspective is reminiscent of Lt. Col. Alex Vindman launching what became the first impeachment of Trump for the crime of not following “the interagency consensus.” Vindman and some of his fellow bureaucrats had a particular idea about how to do foreign policy with Ukraine and Trump disagreed with him. That so concerned Vindman that he began talking to others — including the ostensible whistleblower — to stop the president from running the foreign policy of the country in a manner at odds with, well, the interagency consensus.

Ignatius writes of the concerted effort to keep Americans from learning about the origins of the Russia probe and other problems with the intelligence community’s Russia collusion hoax, that “Haspel’s apparent crime was that for months she had been resisting efforts by Trump and Patel to declassify the information he had gathered for Nunes back in the 2018 report.” In fact, resisting orders from the president is a perfectly legitimate reason for a president to want to replace her.

After beginning the column by mocking the idea of a deep state, then writing an entire column about how awesome the deep state is, Ignatius concludes:

The truth is that for all the roadblocks these aides put in Trump’s way, he had the authority as commander in chief to do what he wanted in national security: declassify and release documents, hire and fire people, direct agencies to take actions he wanted. Facing resistance from courageous officials who sought to protect the government, Trump in many cases simply backed down. As bad as this story was, in other words, it could have been much worse.

Ignatius ends by unambiguously praising appointees and bureaucrats for thwarting the elected president’s will. That’s a story that doesn’t just sound bad, but worse than many feared.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/22/deep-state-mouthpiece-retaliates-against-staffer-who-uncovered-russia-collusion-hoax/,2021-04-22
Hawley Stands Alone In Opposing Asian Hate Crimes Bill Citing Government Overreach,"Republican Sen. Josh Hawley was the only senator to vote against legislation introduced by Democrat Sen. Mazie Hirono which seeks to condemn and punish anti-Asian American hate crimes in the U.S., specifically those stemming from what Democrats have labeled as racist COVID-19 characterizations.

The bill would expand funding for states to report crimes and would designate a Justice Department official to evaluate COVID-motivated hate crimes.

“It’s too broad. As a former prosecutor, my view is it’s dangerous to simply give the federal government open-ended authority to define a whole new class of federal hate crime incidents,” Hawley said in a statement to The Federalist on Thursday.

Democrats like Hirono hailed the bill as an incentive for the federal government to make “informed decisions” about biases against Asian Americans even when “people’s hearts and minds” won’t change. Hawley, joined by other Republicans, expressed concerns that the legislation was too broad and susceptible to government overreach.

“Hugely broad … it mandates all this data collection in expansive categories that the federal government will collect … the power to define crimes, incidents, going forward. It seems hugely open-ended,” Hawley said when he voted against advancing the bill.

Hawley on why he voted against proceeding to Hirono's hate crimes bill: ""Hugely broad…it mandates all this data collection in expansive categories that the federal government will collect…the power to define crimes, incidents, going forward. It seems hugely open-ended"" — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) April 15, 2021

When it came time to vote on the bill, however, Hawley was the only senator to reject it. Sens. Marsha Blackburn, Amy Klobuchar, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Tina Smith abstained from the vote while others such as Sen. Ted Cruz appeared to flip from formerly criticizing Hirono’s bill as a Democrat “messaging tactic” to suddenly supporting it.

“[The legislation] is not designed to do anything to prevent or punish actual crimes. It is instead a Democratic messaging vehicle designed to push the demonstrably false idea that it is somehow racist to acknowledge that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan, China and that the Chinese Communist Party actively lied and suppressed information about the outbreak, allowing it to become a global pandemic,” Cruz said last week before introducing an amendment to pull federal funding from universities that discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions processes.

Even after Senate Democrats blocked Cruz and Kennedy’s amendment, however, the Republicans voted yes to move forward with passing the legislation and toss it over to the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives where it is likely to pass.

"Hemingway: More Than Police Reform, We Need Media Reform","Federalist Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway discussed the uptick in violent crime nationwide on Fox News this Monday, saying we “need media reform” to more adequately tell the truth about policing “and what the real problems are with crime.”

“Less than having a police crisis in this country, we have a violent crime crisis in this country,” Hemingway said. “What’s happened in that last year since Democrats decided to not do police reform is that violent crime has gone up in all of the major cities — or all but one of the major cities, like the top 60 cities.”

Hemingway discussed how the increases in violent crime across the nation more deeply affect poorer areas, instead of places elites live.

“You’ve seen a 33 percent increase in homicides, upticks in arson, and rape, and robbery. These are things that affect people in low-income communities, precisely the communities that we are told people care about,” she said.

The media has continually lied about policing and not provided a fair rationale for the increases in crime, Hemingway noted.

“It’s been a decade of the media really telling lies about the state of policing in this country, and what the real problems are with crime in this country,” she said.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/27/hemingway-more-than-police-reform-we-need-media-reform/,2021-04-27
Why The Senate’s Anti-Asian Hate Crime Bill Is Political Theater,"In response to the rise of anti-Asian crimes, the U.S. Senate passed an Anti-Asian Hate Crime bill by a 94 to 1 vote. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, the bill’s lead sponsor, said passing the legislation sent a “solid message of solidarity that the Senate will not be a bystander as anti-Asian violence surges in our country.” Yet a close examination of the bill raises the uncomfortable question of whether the effort will do anything meaningful to prevent anti-Asian hate crimes, as promised.

Essentially, the bill creates a position at the Justice Department to “facilitate the expedited review of hate crimes.” The bill also requires the U.S. attorney general to issue guidance to state and local law-enforcement agencies on how to “establish online reporting of hate crimes or incidents,” collect data, and raise public awareness about hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To its credit, the bill does address some known issues regarding anti-Asian hate crimes, such as historically poor data collection and the tendency among many Asian Americans not to report crimes to law enforcement due to a desire not to cause trouble with the authorities. Better data collection and reporting will give law enforcement a better understanding of the scale of the problem and provide them insights.

Still, data collection and reporting come after crimes have taken place. As Asian Americans currently face an increase in violent crimes, we need a solution now. Especially for the sake of our elders, we need to not have to worry about being pushed, kicked, robbed, or even murdered when walking out of a bank, strolling down the street, or sleeping at home at night. Unfortunately, the Senate bill does nothing to address the safety concerns Asian Americans have.

One of the bill’s most significant drawbacks is to define all recent crimes that target Asian Americans as COVID-19 related hate crimes. Although there is some evidence that verbal harassment and physical assaults against Asian Americans have happened due to COVID-19 fears, COVID-19-related hate doesn’t explain all violent crimes against Asian Americans since last summer.

For example, COVID-19-related hate doesn’t explain the rape and murder of Ee Lee in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the robbery and murder of 75-year old Pak Ho in Oakland, California; and the mass shooting in Atlanta, Georgia that took the lives of eight people, including six Asian women. Since last year, the rise of violent crimes against Asian Americans has corresponded to the increase of violent crimes against Americans of all races nationwide.

The FBI crime data for 2020 show murders surged 25 percent — the most significant single-year increase since 1960. The Major Cities Chiefs Association reports that “63 of the 66 largest police jurisdictions saw increases in at least one category of violent crimes in 2020, which include homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.” This worrisome trend continues in 2021, as the number of violent crimes in major cities continues to rise, and a few police chiefs expect it would outpace last year’s numbers for some major cities.

Some leftists reluctantly admitted that America’s high crime rates are mainly due to the lack of policing. Since last summer, activists, leftist media, and leftist politicians have spread anti-police rhetoric and called to “defund police.” Subsequently, budget cuts and personnel reduction of some police departments have created a hostile environment for law enforcement, leaving many police forces demoralized. As a result, policing engagement fell.

Data shows violent crime rises as police retreat. For example, the New York Police Department reportedly made 38 percent fewer arrests from June to December 2020, while the city saw its homicides increased 58 percent during the same period. Chicago saw a similar trend. As Chicago’s police made 53 percent fewer arrests from June 2020 to February 2021, murders rose 65 percent in the city during the same period.

The city of Milwaukee, where Lee was raped and murdered last year, saw a 98 percent increase in murders as the city laid off 120 police officers in 2020. After Portland’s leftist Mayor Ted Wheeler defunded the city’s police department by $12 million and slashed three police units, murders increased 255 percent, and shootings jumped 173 percent.

What will make all Americans, including Asian Americans, who live in major U.S. cities feel safe right now is an increase in preventative police engagement. Yet the Senate bill failed to address this obvious point.

Right after the bill passed, in New York City someone struck 61-year-old Yao Pan Ma and repeatedly stomped on his head. Ma is in critical condition and struggling for his life. This despicable incident shows the Senate bill does little to reduce actual violent crimes presently facing Asian Americans and their neighbors.

Another big flaw of the bill lies in the fact that its sponsor and her Democratic Party colleagues refuse to address the discrimination elite universities have perpetrated against Asian students. No other issue has caused Asian American parents and their children more anxiety than the fear of losing equal access to quality education. Such fear and anxiety are caused by critical race theory’s divisive rhetoric and actions, which Democrats perpetuate instead of opposing.

Due to the relative overall success of Asian Americans, critical race theory treats Asian Americans as “whites by adjacency,” even though there is a wide wealth gap amongst Asian Americans. Critical race theory activists have argued that elite high schools and colleges are not “diverse” enough because Asians are “overrepresented.” In truth, the Asian American population is an incredibly diverse group of people linked to more than 19 different countries containing several dozens of languages.

Yet critical race theory activists have been pushing for lower admission standards and the removal of difficult entrance exams to top high schools. Instead, they seek to rely on race-based admissions in both elite high schools and colleges, all in the name of achieving an equitable outcome for other minority groups.

Many Asian Americans see such an attempt to limit their children’s access to quality education as an unjust exclusion of their children’s participation in the American Dream. That’s why the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York called critical race theory “today’s Chinese Exclusion Act” and “the real hate crime against Asians.”

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, sought to address this “real hate crime against Asians” by proposing an amendment to the anti-Asian hate crime bill. His amendment called to “prohibit Federal funding for any institution of higher education that discriminates against Asian Americans in recruitment, applicant review, or admissions.” Ultimately, his amendment failed when the Democrat majority in the Senate voted “no.”

It’s such an irony that an anti-Asian hate crime bill fails to address “the real hate crime against Asians.” In reality, the Democratic Party’s selective outrage about crimes against Asian Americans is more about advancing a political agenda rather than addressing the genuine concerns and fears of Asian Americans.

The passing of this Anti-Asian Hate Crime legislation may make senators from both parties feel good about themselves. But for the majority of Asian Americans, this bill amounts to nothing but hot air. We don’t feel any safer, and we are still anxious about our children’s future.

'Bail Reform' Shows Democrats Don't Care About Racism Against Jews,"What’s more important to leftists: Stopping hate crimes or pursuing “equity” rather than equality? The latest fallout from New York state’s infamous “bail reform” law has given us the answer. Even left-wing groups like the Anti-Defamation League that spend most of their time highlighting instances of hate and raising huge amounts of money from donors who believe they are threatened by extremists continually prioritize their relationships with activists over defending public safety.

Recent events in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, New York illustrated that nothing, not even an alarming spate of hate crimes directed at synagogues, could shake the leftist’s conviction that racial politics must be defended at all costs — even if that means letting someone who terrorized a community walk free.

Leftist politics was on the rise even before the death of George Floyd brought the Black Lives Matter movement and ideas like critical race theory to the political mainstream. The notion that our societal goal should be “equity” — a term used to overturn the notion that society should treat men and women as individuals rather than as members of a racial group — has given new impetus to measures designed to throw out practices that can be represented as somehow disadvantaging minorities even if it was not the result of racial discrimination.

One such example was the decision of New York’s legislature to pass a so-called “bail reform” law that ended cash bail as well as most instances of pre-trial detention. The measure was based on the idea that requiring bail for those awaiting trial led to far too many people being stuck in jail. Such people, who were innocent until proven guilty, were unable to buy their way out of jail by posting a bond assuring authorities they would show up for their day in court.

The fact that many of those facing that dilemma are poor, black Americans convinced many on the left the system had to be changed. But while this effort may have been well-intentioned, its proponents were guilty of being so focused on creating more equity that they ignored why civil societies have criminal justice systems: to protect innocent citizens from criminals.

The passage of New York’s bail reform law in 2019 led authorities to essentially empty the jails of those being held without bail in anticipation of the implementation of the new law. The result? Most of those stuck in jail were repeat offenders, and when released, they went back to committing crimes.

New York City’s police commissioner rightly attributed the resulting surge in violent crime to the new bail law. Yet left-wing groups like the Legal Aid Society reacted by saying no one should “draw any conclusions” from, for instance, the fact a man allowed to go free while awaiting trial on other criminal charges then attempted to rape a woman in the subway.

The overwhelming majority of those affected by that crime wave were, of course, minorities whose neighborhoods were made less safe. But leftist advocates of “equity” weren’t interested. Throughout 2020, especially after the death of Floyd, they focused their attention and efforts on demonizing the police as targeting black Americans even though the evidence debunks their claims.

The timing was also particularly troubling because it coincided with a spree of antisemitic crimes as Orthodox Jews were largely targeted by black American assailants in the greater New York area. Indeed, one such perpetrator, a woman named Tiffany Harris who had been jailed repeatedly for committing assaults against Orthodox Jewish women, was freed again and again.

Left-wing advocacy groups, however, claimed New Yorkers were obliged to ignore each such instance of the law enabling violent criminals. While some politicians spoke of the need to change the law, they were beaten back by smears their concern for crime victims was racist fearmongering.

The specter of Willie Horton — the criminal whose crimes committed while on weekend furlough were highlighted by Republicans during the failed 1988 presidential run of Michael Dukakis — still hangs over a Democratic Party obsessed with dubious allegations of racism, especially in New York, where leftist radicals hold veto-proof majorities.

Ultimately, the bail law had terrible consequences because it didn’t give judges the right to keep violent criminals in jail. As New Yorkers were just reminded, the same applies to those who commit hate crimes.

Last month, Jews in the Riverdale section of the Bronx were forced to endure a wave of violent attacks on their synagogues. Between April 23 and 25, seven different late-night incidents occurred in which an individual later identified as Jordan Burnette, a 29-year-old black American, threw rocks shattering windows and doors of several synagogues. In one instance, he was confronted by volunteers who turned out to defend their shul and he threw rocks at them before fleeing.

When he was finally caught and arrested, a judge was forced to let him go free. Yet Jews know that when those who commit hate crimes are allowed to attack Jewish targets with impunity, the result is what has already happened in France.

In the days after Burnette’s release, the Anti-Defamation League, which continues to pose as a defender of the Jewish community against antisemitism, said nothing about the case. Since Burnette’s release, both the group and its CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, found time to publicly advocate for Facebook to continue its ban on posts from former President Donald Trump and to falsely claim American police were engaging in “systemic racism” against black Americans.

Although they routinely depict Jews as under siege from hate crimes, the ADL and Greenblatt were mum about the way those who committed such crimes have benefited from bail reform. Why? Burnette is not the kind of antisemite who interests the ADL.

Had Burnette instead been a right-wing extremist, the ADL would have likely trumpeted their concerns about the attacks on synagogues. They would have disingenuously linked these crimes to Trump and given Greenblatt fodder for more lectures about white supremacists in which he analogized the shattered glass of Riverdale synagogues to the 1938 Nazis Kristallnacht violence.

President Joe Biden, who last week claimed “white supremacy is terrorism,” might have denounced it too. But since Burnette didn’t fit into that scenario, both Biden and the ADL were silent about a Jewish community being terrorized and then having to endure the sight of their assailant sent back out onto the street.

Leftists have sacrificed public safety on the altar of critical race theory and maintaining alliances with folks like race-baiter Al Sharpton. Doing so doesn’t merely tie them to radical causes that undermine law enforcement and falsely label America as an irredeemably racist nation. It also leads them to treat attacks on Jews as something to be minimized or ignored to avoid having to confront the consequences of their ideological choices.

“Bail reform” hasn’t just endangered New Yorkers — it exposed the left’s willingness to dismiss antisemitic hate crimes as less important than their devotion to extremist politics.

Philadelphia Rewards Crime With More Votes For Lax District Attorney,"Far-left Democrat incumbent District Attorney Larry Krasner in Philadelphia won the district attorney primary Tuesday evening despite the uptick in violence this past year in his city due to lax law enforcement he’s fomented.

Krasner beat out Carlos Vega, a Democrat supported by law enforcement. Krasner won by 30 points and is thought of as a favorite to win reelection in November in the Democrat stronghold over Republican attorney Charles Peruto Jr. Philadelphia’s Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 fleshed out a lot of money to try and get Krasner out in the primary.

“There is a clear link between Krasner’s election and an uptick in violent crime which has caused certain Philadelphia neighborhoods to descend into shooting galleries reminiscent of the late ’80s as far as crime rates,” Albert Eisenberg, a Philadelphia-based political consultant with knowledge of the Vega campaign, told The Federalist. “Our police chief, a progressive black woman, has said as much — the police are arresting people and confiscating guns in record numbers, yet successful prosecutions of violent crimes and gun charges are plummeting.”

Philadelphia has been marred by a drastic increase in violent crime. Over the past year, there were more than 2,200 shootings, 500 of which ended up being fatal. The National Guard was summoned in October in response to rioting. Back in March, Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney and city officials acknowledged Philadelphia is on pace to have record crime rates.

“It makes me absolutely sick to know that so many Philadelphians have suffered these preventable deaths,” Kenney had said at a press conference. “It’s painfully clear that we must take new approaches.”

Krasner first took office in 2017. He received more than $1.5 million from billionaire leftist George Soros, and his campaign and the Soros Political Action Committee spent close to $2 million. Last summer, Soros dumped money into Black Lives Matter and similar groups aimed at pushing Marxist “racial equity.” The district attorney has sued the police department in Philadelphia 75 times and peddled in “systemic racism” terminology to describe law enforcement.

“In 2020, when Philadelphia was ravished by radical left organizations like Black Lives Matter and criminal opportunists who rioted, looted, and torched police cars, District Attorney Larry Krasner failed to hold the perpetrators accountable,” Montgomery County Republican Commissioner Joe Gale, who is running for governor in the state, told The Federalist previously.

Kenney slashed police budgets last summer as well and got rid of a proposal to provide more funding to police. “We think we can police better and make sure we put the resources in the departments that can affect change and make the situation in our neighborhoods better,” he said at the time. “We want to approach this open-mindedly, but some of these things have to happen.”

Former prosecutors in the city have long been critical of the district attorney. In 2017, 11 individuals who used to work in the district attorney’s office penned a letter referring to Krasner as “a radical candidate with no experience prosecuting crime.”

In 2020, 86 percent of murder victims in the city were black. Krasner prosecuted a mere 49 percent of illegal gun arrests, according to city data. Protect Our Police, a PAC, fought hard to try and get Krasner to lose in the primary. The group made informative videos and took in donations.

“I believe there is a winning coalition to be found in cities among disaffected, mostly working and middle-class people, against policies that are branded as progressive but result in a huge uptick in violent crime,” Eisenberg added.

153 ex-prosecutors signed a letter last month pleading with voters to vote for Vega. The prosecutors said they are “not defined by any political ideology but by a desire to see a better, fairer, safer city, and we hope you agree that it is time for a change.” An estimated 36 of the signees stopped working at the district attorney’s office under Krasner’s leadership, including Vega. Some were terminated by him during his first week.

The Left's Insane Call To 'Defund The Police' Led To Murder And Mayhem,"It’s been one year since last summer’s George Floyd demonstrations took over America’s cities, and in these last 12 months, police officers have left those respective cities’ police forces in droves. Some were forced out due to budget cuts while others are voluntarily retiring or moving to neighboring police departments. The city of Seattle has lost more than 260 officers in the last 18 months, nearly 20 percent of the entire force.

Not surprisingly, the exodus of police officers has corresponded with a surge in crime. In 2020, Seattle diverted almost 20 percent from its police budget and saw a 61 percent increase in homicides, the highest number in 26 years.

This correlation is certainly not limited to the Rain City. Major cities across the country, where feckless mayors and extremist city councils have hacked away at police budgets, have experienced increases in violent crime and soaring 911 response times. The far left’s “defund the police” agenda is doing nothing to combat so-called systemic racism and is instead endangering cities, with the most devastating effects among minority communities in inner-city neighborhoods. The White House is blaming guns for the uptick in violence, sidelining Democrats’ responsibility for their anti-police rhetoric and refusal to oppose leftist political violence in the past year.

Seattle’s war on its police force erupted out of nowhere last June. In 2018, the mayor’s office praised the Seattle Police Department as “one of the leading departments in our nation” with “advanced best practices in crisis intervention and tactical de-escalation.” In August that year, the Seattle Council unanimously confirmed Carmen Best as police chief, making her the first black woman in Seattle’s history to serve in the role.

Ahead of the 2019 holiday season, Best and Mayor Jenny Durkan jointly announced a 20 percent increase in winter patrols to “enhance public safety for Seattle residents and visitors.” As recently as February 2020, Durkan lauded Seattle’s Police Department as having “hired the highest percentage of people of color in its history.”

Then within days of Floyd’s death, Durkan and leftist council members were already turning the tables on their own police department. Weeks of riots and clashes with police resulted in the expulsion of the Seattle Police Department from the East Precinct at the direction of Durkan herself, the barricading of a six-block area of the downtown Capitol Hill neighborhood, and the establishment of the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (“CHAZ”, subsequently renamed “CHOP”).

Durkan humiliated herself by insisting that the unlawful occupation was really just a “block party” and that the occupiers were in fact patriots. When President Trump justifiably called on both Gov. Jay Inslee and the mayor to stand up to the anarchists and restore law and order, Durkan ludicrously tweeted that Seattle was “fine” and not to be “so afraid of democracy.”

As Durkan’s “summer of love” unfolded, her warped view of the democratic process entailed multiple shootings, two homicides (both victims were black teenagers), one attempted rape of a deaf woman, and extensive property damage within CHOP. Black Lives Matter thugs spent weeks holding the city hostage to an egregious list of demands by marauding neighborhoods, intimidating residents and public officer holders, and defacing public property. Residents in the police chief’s own neighborhood were targeted by aggressive demonstrators.

Amidst this pressure, and due to the total lack of consultation that preceded police department budget cuts, Best resigned, the first of many police officers to protest the city’s lack of support. Most disturbing is the frustration expressed by Best, and conveyed in the interview with CBS, that city leaders are interfering with the police department’s responsibility to provide for adequate public safety.

In addition to the spike in murders and a 36 percent increase in shooting victims, three-quarters of whom were people of color, 911 response times are revealing a disturbing trend. Average response time for priority 1 and 2 emergencies, including homicides, robberies, and assaults, more than doubled last summer.

Although response times fell somewhat for the remainder of 2020, they have been steadily climbing during the first quarter of 2021. Median response times across all five police precincts for both priority 1 and 2 emergencies remain above those reported in 2019. Residents inconvenienced by break-ins have had to wait even longer.

Outside of Seattle, the call to defund, reimagine, and abolish the police is having a similarly disastrous impact. The data is overwhelming in cities where leftist councils caved to social and political pressure and arbitrarily defunded police departments.

The Minneapolis City Council kicked things off by cutting almost $8 million from the policing budget, an improvement on its original unanimously approved proposal to eliminate the city’s police department. Minneapolis saw a 105 percent increase in shootings, a 70 percent increase in homicides, a 537 percent increase in violent carjackings, and lagging emergency response times in 2020. Within a few months the city decided to cough up $6.4 million to hire more police officers.

New York City slashed a massive $1 billion from its police budget and saw a 97 percent increase in shootings. Portland took a $16 million slice out of its police budget and so far in 2021 has seen the homicide rate soar by a whopping 1,900 percent compared with the same period in 2020. Portlanders have become increasingly frustrated by slow and unreliable responses to 911 calls.

Despite the “anti-racism” rhetoric, defunding the police mostly hurts black and minority Americans in vulnerable, urban neighborhoods, where criminal violence is already the main problem. Black Americans between the ages of ten and 43 die of homicide at 13 times the rate of white Americans. Carving out millions from police budgets means fewer officers, less police presence, longer wait times, and less training.

Not surprisingly then, defunding the police lacks popular support among minorities. A Gallup poll found that 81 percent of black people and 83 percent of Hispanics want to retain or increase local police presence. A Huffington Post survey similarly found that defunding the police has poor public support across all demographics.

Presumably, Americans of all ages, races, and political persuasions are not on board with local law enforcement being outsourced to private security firms, rival gangs, and domestic terror groups, which is inevitably what happens when the government cannot or will not perform the crucial function of safeguarding the safety of its citizens.

Every day people implicitly understand what German sociologist Max Weber was getting at when he identified the state as claiming the “monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force.” If not, the state cannot play its role as enforcer of law and order, which impedes basic public services as well as the regulation of economic activity. The condition that emerges is anarchy.

Certainly, it seems extraordinary that Democrats at all levels of government would persist in undermining law enforcement when these radical and unpopular policies are ruining cities, exacerbating violent crime, facilitating Bolshevik-style terror and destruction, and worsening conditions for blacks and minorities. Whatever their motives, mayors and city councils in places like Seattle that continue their ideological war on police are ruining iconic cities and betraying the residents they were elected to serve and protect.

The Biden-Harris Migration ‘Fix’ Would Throw Good Billions After Bad,"The journey of Central American migrants to the U.S. border — a perilous trip across thousands of miles of mountains and deserts — starts in places like the dry corridor in western Honduras.

Many of the region’s 1 million small farmers still live in adobe huts with no running water and suffer acts of humans and nature. Corrupt Honduran officials have invested too little in stabilizing or modernizing the region, allowing violent gangs to extort families. Recent droughts and hurricanes have created widespread hunger.

“It’s been one crisis after another,” says Conor Walsh, the Honduras representative for Catholic Relief Services in Tegucigalpa, the capital. “Many people have already migrated and others are evaluating whether they can stay on their farms.”

These longstanding problems throughout Central America are driving the current crisis on the southern U.S. border, where more than 170,000 migrants arrived in March in search of jobs and asylum. As the Biden administration grapples with this mounting surge, it’s also proposing a $4 billion long-term plan to attack the root causes of migration — corruption, violence, and poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

The initiative is as ambitious as it is familiar. Presidents as far back as John F. Kennedy have pursued similar aims only to come up short. Joe Biden himself ran the troubled Central America initiative during the Obama administration. It encountered the same obstacles that have stymied past U.S. efforts — governmental leaders and business elites who resist good governance and anti-corruption reforms to protect their own interests, according to a study by the Wilson Center, a policy research group in Washington.

‘You Have to Create a System of Accountability’

Consider Honduras, a showcase of government criminality. President Juan Orlando Hernandez’s election in 2017 was tainted by fraud. He is now under investigation by U.S. prosecutors who have brought a string of cocaine smuggling cases against prominent Hondurans. Members of the National Congress in Tegucigalpa have a habit of embezzlement, thereby robbing citizens of funding for health care, education, and jobs.

Nonetheless, U.S.-funded programs have struggled to make a difference in a nation in which government is a big part of the problem. Catholic Relief Services, for one, has helped boost the corn and bean yields and income of thousands of subsistence farmers in the Honduran dry corridor, offering a glimmer of hope. But a lack of roads, electricity, and credit for farmers means that only a sliver of them benefit from the technical aid. As a result, an unprecedented 47 percent of families in the dry corridor that stretches across Central America are moderately to severely food-deprived, according to an alarming 2017 United Nations study.

Now comes Biden’s crack at the region. He’s tweaking the U.S. aid playbook in hopes of a better outcome. The administration says fighting corruption is now the top priority since nothing will change until elected officials stop stealing and the governments become more accountable to citizens. Countries will have to meet stricter conditions, such as adopting governance reforms, before receiving aid, and officials face the threat of financial sanctions and revoked visas. The proposed $4 billion strategy, the biggest ever for the region, gives the administration some added leverage.

Vice President Kamala Harris heads the strategy team, which includes White House aide Juan Gonzalez and Ricardo Zuniga, the special envoy to the region. Zuniga was born in Honduras and both men worked on Western Hemispheric affairs in the Obama White House. In March, they traveled to the region and had “very frank discussions” with leaders about transparency, good governance, and anti-corruption, said one administration official.

The Treasury Department followed up those talks with sanctions in late April against Felipe Alejos Lorenzana, a Guatemalan Congressman, and Gustavo Adolfo Alejos Cambara, a former official. They reportedly facilitated payments to lawmakers and judges to try to interfere with the appointment of magistrates and protect against corruption prosecutions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“You have to create a system of accountability that goes after the very corrupt elements within these governments,” added Steven Dudley, co-founder of InSight Crime, which investigates organized crime in Latin America. “The people Biden put in place have the experience and ideas, but the bridge between that and actually doing something is long.”

Failures of the Past

The get-tough diplomacy is already hitting resistance. In early April, Zuniga visited El Salvador to press the case against corruption. But President Nayib Bukele, miffed over criticism from a State Department official about his commitment to the rule of law, refused to meet with the envoy.

The snub would be familiar to a long line of presidents who have stumbled in the region. Since 1960 administrations have strategically deployed about $24 billion in foreign aid to Central America and the Caribbean.

During the Cold War years, aid was meant to reduce poverty to build support against leftist movements in El Salvador and its neighbors. It didn’t work. When the decades-long civil wars in the region finally ended in the 1990s, peace did usher in a long stretch of economic growth and declining poverty rates. In the ensuing decade, as drug trafficking and gang violence soared, the George W. Bush administration took its turn in Central America. It sent assistance to combat crime. But the programs lacked coordination and had a limited impact, according to another Wilson Center report.

The Obama administration had bigger ambitions. It expanded on Bush’s security initiative by adding governance and economic programs. The $2.4 billion “strategy for engagement” for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras began in 2014 and included 370 projects to make local officials more accountable, reduce crime and create jobs. In an op-ed supporting the strategy, Vice President Biden praised the nations’ commitment to reform and even met with President Hernandez at the White House in 2015 — an endorsement that proved too bullish.

After five years, the Government Accounting Office was blunt in its assessment of the projects that were mostly run by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Those reviewed by GAO achieved only 40 percent to 70 percent of their own technical targets, such as the number of police officers trained. Officials didn’t even bother to evaluate most of the projects or whether they helped improve governance, security, and economic opportunity.

When the biggest wave of migrants in more than a decade hit the U.S. border in 2019, the Trump administration pulled the plug on the Obama root cause strategy. USAID, now run by Samantha Power, a former envoy to the U.N. under President Obama, didn’t provide a spokesperson to comment for this story despite several requests.

Honduras: Corruption Juggernaut

Biden, who now has a second chance to get it right, faces his biggest test in Honduras. Its economy, which was once dominated by exports of coffee and bananas to the United States, has produced a number of ultra-wealthy clans resistant to the idea of cleaning up corruption.

Miguel Facusse, whose nephew served as president of Honduras, became rich from palm oil production and consumer products. But his legacy is tainted by accusations from human rights investigations that his security forces were involved in deadly clashes with small farmers over their claim to land in the region where his plantations operate.

As the economy became more service-oriented, former Vice President Jaime Rosenthal made a family fortune estimated in 2015 at $690 million from banking, telecommunications, and other businesses. But before his death two years ago, Rosenthal was indicted by U.S. prosecutors for participating in a money-laundering scheme with Honduran drug traffickers.

Honduras emerged as a cocaine transshipment point between South America and the United States a few decades ago. The 2009 coup in Honduras that ousted President Manuel Zelaya opened the door to more trafficking. Zelaya, a Liberal Party politician, had raised the minimum wage by 60 percent and defended the land rights of small farmers. Even more worrisome to business leaders like Facusse was that Zelaya had become cozy with leftist despots in the region and pushed to amend the constitution in an apparent attempt to extend his own presidency.

Zelaya’s ouster by the military led to a period of internal tumult, forcing the National Police to focus on restoring order, often violently cracking down on protesters. By 2015, 90 percent of cocaine coming to the United States passed through Central America, with Honduras as the major hub. More recently Hondurans have developed labs to produce cocaine, extending its tentacles in the economy, according to a report by InSight Crime.

Harnessing the Experience of Nonprofit Groups

Today, President Hernandez tops a list of Honduran politicians, military, and police officers who are under investigation or have been convicted of operating what seems like a state-sponsored drug cartel, according to the U.S. prosecutors. They say in 2013 Hernandez, who was then in Congress and campaigning for the presidency, got access to millions of dollars in cocaine from a murderous trafficker. In return, the politician allegedly told the trafficker, who was convicted in a U.S. court in March, that the military and attorney general would protect his operation. The president has repeatedly denied any involvement in trafficking.

The president’s brother, former congressman Tony Hernandez, was involved in every aspect of the cocaine trade. The end game was political power. He funneled millions of dollars in profits into National Party campaigns for three presidential elections, including the two his brother won in 2013 and 2017, prosecutors say. Tony Hernandez was handed a life prison sentence in March.

The Biden administration points to the silver linings in the dark clouds of the region’s recent history. In the last five years, an effort to root out political corruption made remarkable progress before it was quashed. In 2016, large street demonstrations over the looting of at least $300 million from the public health care system — a small amount of which found its way into Hernandez’s first presidential campaign — forced the president to set up an anti-corruption commission in partnership with the Organization of American States. The United States embraced the move with funding and political support.

The commission’s quasi-independence — it was led by Peruvian prosecutor Ana Maria Calderon Boy and others from outside Honduras — keyed its initial success. The commission set up a new unit of vetted prosecutors within the national government. It went on to reveal an embezzlement scam that later allegedly implicated more than 350 politicians, including President Hernandez, according to the Wilson report. Amid the scandal, he essentially disbanded the commission last year — a decision that brought condemnation from a bipartisan group of U.S. House leaders.

The Biden administration now aims to set up a new anti-corruption group as its main weapon. This time even more independence will be crucial if it’s to work. Zuniga, the special envoy, had discussions with nonprofits in Central America that want to form a U.S.-backed civil society commission. It would draw on the expertise of these groups in exposing corruption and operate outside the reach of national governments to shut it down. But local prosecutors would still have to pursue the cases.

“Instead of creating another commission that the governments can kick out, the United States can support nonprofits that have years of experience doing this work,” says Kurt Ver Beek, co-founder of the Association for a More Just Society in Honduras, who joined the talks with Zuniga. “We will make the corruption cases public and, along with the United States, pressure the governments to bring charges.”

Purging the Police

The U.S.-backed effort to reform the National Police also got off to a promising start five years ago. The police served as a tool for cocaine smugglers, who easily exploited lowly paid officers with payoffs for dirty work. “Officers hijacked cars from citizens, dealt drugs for gangs, and lent out their services as hitmen,” according to a 2016 report by Ver Beek’s ASJ, the Christian nonprofit, which received funding from the State Department.

The revelation in 2016 that top police officials organized the assassination of Honduran’s anti-drug czar finally forced President Hernandez and Congress to set up another commission. Two ASJ leaders joined the group, which moved quickly to purge a remarkable 5,000 tainted and inexperienced beat cops and top officials — including six generals — equaling a third of the entire force.

The purge was a watershed moment showing that Hondurans could topple a fortress of criminality. But four years later drug smugglers are beginning to penetrate the police again, forcing good officers to choose whether to take a bribe or a bullet. “Traffickers tell cops, ‘I’ll kill you if you don’t help me, or take a bunch of money,’” says Ver Beek, a Cornell University-trained sociologist. “So they take the money.”

American agencies funded other projects such as community policing to reduce crime in Honduras, which a decade ago had the highest murder rate in the world. In her congressional confirmation hearing, Power, Biden’s new USAID administrator, pointed to the agency’s record of crime-fighting in the country as a bright spot to build on. “In districts where USAID had programming aimed at curbing violence, there was a drop in homicide rates,” she told senators in March. “That is encouraging.”

However, extortion of businesses by criminal gangs — a major driver of migration — may be getting worse. Gang members approach small businesses, such as barbers, food merchants and taxi drivers, and demand a small monthly payment that keeps going up until the owner can no longer pay it and flees. Hondurans refer to extortion as a “war tax,” which victimizes as many as half of all small businesses, Ver Beek estimates.

Struggling to Create Jobs

While officials pilfer public funds and gangs drive businesses to close, it’s no wonder that half of the Honduran population remains almost locked in poverty. The high rate hasn’t improved much over the last decade and is twice the level of neighboring El Salvador. As the Obama administration learned, foreign aid alone can’t do much to help kids escape this poverty trap.

USAID’s Future Employment program had ambitions in 2016 to train 7,500 at-risk youth in Honduras and place half of them in jobs to lure them away from gangs. The program struggled to find enough recruits in tough neighborhoods and enough employers willing to take a chance and hire them. Then the Trump administration cut off funding for projects across the three countries. By the end of 2019, fewer than 1,000 participants had found some employment, mostly in retail, in the year following training, according to a USAID evaluation.

While they certainly benefited from a job in the short term, their prospects of upward mobility are dim without more support from the Honduran government. For instance, the country has a federal minimum wage law that’s set above the poverty line and could help close the inequality gap. But almost half of employers ignore it and the government does little to enforce it, academic studies show.

“We have not produced the same kind of results that I’ve pointed to when it comes to physical security and crime,” Power said of USAID’s economic programs. “Hopefully we can begin to make a dent.”

Power could start by changing the way her agency runs projects in places like Honduras, nonprofit veterans believe. Aid experts have criticized the agency for hiring U.S. and international contractors to administer most of the program funding. The setup marginalizes local organizations that better understand on-the-ground issues and misses an opportunity to develop local advocates to push for reforms, says Sarah Bermeo, who specializes in foreign aid in Central America at Duke University.

“U.S. contractors are certainly overused compared to their ability to deliver results,” Bermeo says. “There is certainly room to improve outcomes by increasing the involvement of local groups in the design and implementation of AID-financed efforts.”

Meanwhile, migrants from Central America are streaming to the U.S. border. The increase that began a year ago has accelerated under Biden, threatening to top 1 million this year, the highest total in more than a decade. Biden’s root-cause strategy won’t change anything at the border in the short run. Advocates say progress will be incremental at best and measured in decades, not years.

“It’s going to be difficult but not impossible for the administration,” says Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. “The U.S. investment has to occur over decades for there to be a real change.”

AOC: We Can Lower Incarceration Rates If We Stop Building Jails,"New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a press conference Thursday the U.S. should “stop building” jails if we want to reduce the inmate population.

“It is not acceptable for us to use jails as garbage bins for human beings. We need to treat people and see them as human,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “If we want to reduce violent crime, reduce the number of people in our jails, the answer is to stop building more of them.”

“The answer is to make sure we actually build more hospitals, we pay organizers, we get people mental health care,” she said. “It’s to support communities, not throw them away.”

The press conference took place in New York City with Democrats Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Jamaal Bowman.

Rather than condemning the spike in violent crime across the country, Ocasio-Cortez seemingly romanticized a society with no laws. In the last year, U.S. homicides increased by 33 percent, and 63 of the 66 largest police jurisdictions experienced an uptick in a minimum of one violent crime category.

Meanwhile, the left continues to rail against law and order by calling for the defunding of law enforcement agencies. Rep. Ilhan Omar and Democrats called for Biden to reject federal contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in March.

Don’t Believe Leftist Lies About Judge’s End To California’s Gun Ban,"On Friday, a federal judge struck down California’s assault weapon ban in Miller v. Bonta. In the nearly 100-page opinion, District Court Judge Roger Benitez dissected post-Heller Second Amendment jurisdiction, while scrutinizing the state’s claimed justification for banning ownership of so-called “assault weapons,” before enjoining enforcement of several sections of California’s Assault Weapons Control Act (AWCA). Yet for 30 days Judge Benitez also stayed the execution of the declaratory judgment and permanent injunction to allow the named defendant, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, to appeal.

In striking down California’s “assault weapon” ban, which criminalizes the possession of various semi-automatic weapons based on their appearance, features, or ability to hold a magazine with more than 10 rounds of ammunition, Judge Benitez conducted a thorough review of controlling Second Amendment precedent and analyzed the hefty evidentiary record. He began with Heller, in which the Supreme Court noted the Second Amendment’s guarantee of the right to bear arms extends to firearms commonly owned by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, as opposed to weapons predominately used only in military settings.

Judges Ignoring Supreme Court Gun Protections

The Heller test, Judge Benitez noted, is a “hardware test,” but since Heller, the federal appellate courts have ignored this simple holding and created an array of various standards under which to judge the constitutionality of laws regulating firearms. Before applying the two-prong test the Ninth Circuit invented, though, Judge Benitez laid out how California’s law would fare under a straightforward application of Heller. In the process, he revealed some statistics of which most Americans are likely ignorant.

“Modern rifles have become immensely popular in the United States. Even in California, despite being banned for 20 to 30 years, according to the State’s own evidence, there are 185,569 ‘assault weapons’ currently registered with California,” with another 50,000-plus assault weapon registrations backlogged. Nationally, while possession of an “assault weapon”—rebranded “modern rifles” in the opinion to separate the emotive response from the rationale—is legal in all but six states, “modern rifles are ubiquitous.”

“In 2018 alone (the most recent year with data), 1,954,000 modern rifles were manufactured or imported into the United States,” the statistics show, while “[o]ver the last three decades, 19,797,000 modern rifles have been manufactured or imported into the United States and the numbers have been steadily increasing,” and [a]lmost one-half of all rifles (48%) produced in 2018 were modern rifles.” Benitez provided more details before crystalizing his point by noting that in 2018, more than twice as many modern rifles were sold than Ford F-150s.

Even By Ninth Circuit Rules, a Ban Is Unconstitutional

Under the Heller test, this record establishes the unconstitutionality of the ban on assault weapons, Benitez concluded. However, being bound by Ninth Circuit precedent, Benitez continued to consider the constitutionality of California’s law under that appellate court’s two-prong test. In his analysis, Benitez bypassed the strict scrutiny standard, noting in passing the law would fail that test as well, to apply the “intermediate scrutiny standard” created by the Ninth Circuit.

Under that standard, a law affecting the right to bear arms is constitutional if the government proffers an “important” governmental purpose, and its “fit” of the law to the objective is reasonable. “As always, the State’s objective with these laws (i.e., to reduce gun crime) passes the first prong of the test,” Judge Benitez wrote, noting that reducing gun crime is a very important objective. But after a detailed analysis, the court concluded California’s assault-weapon ban lacked a reasonable “fit” to that goal.

Benitez observed “the ‘assault weapon’ epithet is a bit of a misnomer. These prohibited guns, like all guns, are dangerous weapons. However, these prohibited guns, like all guns, can be used for ill or for good. They could just as well be called ‘home defense rifles’ or ‘anti-crime guns.’” He added that in criminalizing certain firearm features, California branded as “assault weapons” “certain shotguns and pistols, and (recently) guns that are neither rifles, nor shotguns, nor pistols.”

He also stressed initially that that since 1989, when California first passed its Assault Weapons Control Act, the understanding of the Second Amendment has changed substantially. At that time, the California legislature focused on a firearm’s value only “for sports and recreation,” but as the Supreme Court in Heller and McDonald made clear, “individual self-defense is ‘the central component’ of the Second Amendment right.”

Thus, in adopting the ban on “assault weapons,” “the California Legislature neither mentioned a modern rifle as a means of self-defense, nor did the core Second Amendment right appear to have been any part of its consideration. The formal legislative findings say nothing about self-defense.”

Ignoring the Protective Uses of Guns

California’s continuing lack of respect for an individual’s right to self-defense resounded throughout the arguments the state attorney general made in the district court. In arguing for the constitutionality of the ban, Bonta ignored the countervailing interest of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families. Instead, the state portrayed the assault weapons ban as a panacea to mass shootings. Since “assault weapons” are so accurate and allow for the discharge of multiple bullets, they prove ideal for mass shootings, the state argued.

But this rationale, Judge Benitez established in his opinion, ignores that, “in the self-defense context, which seems to be more common, taking accurate shots at attackers is vitally important for the innocent victim.” Thus, “[w]hile the state ought to protect its residents against victimization by a mass shooter, it ought also to protect its residents against victimization by home-invading criminals,” the district court judge stressed.

California, however, seems to view armed citizens defending themselves differently than the Founders did, with Benitez noting that “the State’s litigation stance is more like the view recently expressed by a police chief in Oakland, California: we do not want victims to arm themselves; we want them to be good witnesses.” “Of course, a dead victim is a lousy witness,” he added.

Yet, as Benitez detailed in his opinion, “there is clear evidence that AR-15 rifles are and have been used for self-defense.”

For example, in one case an AR-15 was used in Florida by a pregnant wife and mother to defend her family from two armed, hooded, and masked home intruders. As soon as the armed intruders entered the back door of her home, they pistol-whipped her husband — fracturing his eye socket and sinus cavity. Then they grabbed the 11-year-old daughter. Before they could do any more harm, the pregnant wife retrieved the family AR-15 from a bedroom and fired, killing one of the attackers while the other fled. It does not require much imagination to guess what would have happened next if the wife and mother did not have the firearm, or if she had emptied the AR-15’s magazine before the attackers had fled.

Benitez also found the evidence failed to support the state’s purported rationale, because “a less accurate rifle in the hands of a mass shooter may very well result in different victims, but not necessarily fewer victims.” Also, contrary to the California legislature’s prediction in 1989 that “an assault weapons ban would eliminate or reduce mass shootings[,] it has not turned out that way.” Instead, “mass shootings with assault weapons continue to occur at the same average rate as before the ban.”

Guns Don’t Cause Crime; Criminals Do

In fact, as Judge Benitez exposed, the California attorney general’s assertion “that modern rifles are disproportionally used in crime” is not supported by the evidence. On the contrary, at the time the Supreme Court handed down the landmark Second Amendment decisions, “81% of firearm-homicide victims were killed by handgun.”

The opinion also eviscerated the studies California relied upon as evidence of the use of assault weapons in mass shootings. For instance, in one study an expert defined a “gun massacre” “as a shooting event resulting in at least six deaths and where at least one assault weapon was discharged.” “The definition,” Benitez explained, “almost creates a tautology along the lines of assault weapons are used disproportionately in assault weapon events.” That study and another, Judge Benitez stressed, wrongly focus on mass shootings, as opposed to crimes in general.

Even then, Benitez found the evidence established that “assault rifles were not the predominant type of weapon used” in mass shootings. “In fact, according to a recent study, handguns were the most used type of firearm in mass shootings (32.99% of mass shootings); rifles were used in only 8.25% of mass shootings.” “That may come as a surprise to the public that is constantly told that assault weapons are often used in mass shootings,” Benitez added.

In short, the court found the prohibited features that under the law “convert” a firearm into an illegal “assault weapon” “do not change an AR-15 rifle from a benign weapon into an ‘incredibly effective killing machine.’” Here, Benitez highlighted a short video entered into evidence in which “two AR-15 type rifles were fired repeatedly and reloaded with a detachable magazine at a target. One rifle had all of the prohibited features prohibited by [California’s law]. The other rifle was a ‘featureless’ California-legal variety of AR-15 rifle. The results were remarkably similar. Each rifle fired at approximately the same speed and accuracy. Any difference was hardly noticeable.”

While the state argued this similarity in performance established the ban did not interfere with the plaintiffs’ Second Amendment rights because they could just purchase the “featureless” AR-15 rifle, in reality this evidence showed the ridiculousness of the California law. The ban on “assault weapons” does nothing but create a false sense that the government cares and can prevent the horrifying scenes of mass shootings.

On the Way to the Supreme Court

Bonta and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have vowed to appeal Benitez’s decision. With the appeal destined for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, reversal seems certain, either by a three-judge panel or later in an en banc hearing before 11 judges of the leftist court. The Ninth Circuit, however, merely serves as the stepping-stone for the ultimate destination of the Miller case: the U.S. Supreme Court.

Although so far the Supreme Court has steadfastly refused to hear appeals from other circuits concerning the constitutionality of “assault weapon” bans, the justices’ hands-off approach to Second Amendment cases has recently changed. For the first time in more than a decade the high court recently agreed to hear a Second Amendment case in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Corlett. That case concerns the constitutionality of New York’s concealed-carry licensing scheme that, in essence, limits the right to keep and bear arms to citizens’ homes.

Getting Miller to the Supreme Court will be equally important, as that case concerns much more than the question of the constitutionality of “assault weapon” bans: It squarely presents an issue dividing the circuit courts, the appropriate standard for reviewing laws that affect Second Amendment rights. Here, Benitez’s 94-page opinion provides a perfect primer for Americans seeking to understand both the law and the fallacies pushed by politicians and the press to justify infringements on Second Amendment rights.

Corporate Press Lies to Help Democrats

Although Benitez’s detailed analysis of Second Amendment jurisprudence should serve as the more important takeaway from Friday’s decision, as coverage of the decision has already shown, when guns are involved, the narrative and public opinion prove key. That same coverage proves a second corollary: When guns are subject, the left-leaning press serves as a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party.

“Federal judge overturns California’s ban on assault weapons and likens AR-15 to Swiss Army knife,” a CNN headline read, parroting Newsom’s talking point. “This judge compared the AR-15 – a weapon of war that’s used on the battlefield – to a Swiss Army Knife [and that comparison] completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this weapon,” the embattled California governor said in a press release.

Bonta likewise ignored the depth of the nearly 100-page opinion to intone “there is no sound basis in law, fact, or common sense for equating assault rifles with swiss army knives — especially on Gun Violence Awareness Day and after the recent shootings in our own California communities,” in a news release issued shortly after the opinion dropped.

CNN added to its coverage the statement from activist Fred Guttenberg, who lost his daughter in a shooting in 2018: “My daughter is in a cemetery because a Swiss Army Knife was not used, because it was an AR-15. If a Swiss Army Knife were used, my daughter and most of those other kids and adults would be alive today.”

The Washington Post, USA Today, and virtually every legacy outlet ran the same spin. And spin it was because Judge Benitez’s opener, noting that “like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment,” provided but a simple illustration of a minor point the long-time federal judge made later: that merely because a civilian rifle has characteristics that are useful in the military “does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded for self-defense.”

Bodies Kill More than Guns Do

But instead of delving into Benitez’s reasoning, the corrupt media constructed a Swiss strawman to torch, ignoring both the federal judge’s analysis and the many press-peddled urban legends about “assault weapons” Benitez countered. In fact, most of the media ignore the larger point Benitez made concerning knives, namely that murderers use knives much more often than they do any kind of rifle.

“Federal Bureau of Investigation murder statistics do not track assault rifles, but they do show that killing by knife attack is far more common than murder by any kind of rifle,” Benitez noted. In fact, “[i]n California, murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle,” with California seeing 252 people murdered with a knife in 2019, compared to “34 people were killed with some type of rifle – not necessarily an AR-15.” “In 2018,” he continued, “the statistics were even more lopsided as California saw only 24 murders by some type of rifle. The same pattern can be observed across the nation.”

These statistics, and the fact that “a Californian is three times more likely to be murdered by an attacker’s bare hands, fists, or feet, than by his rifle,” Judge Benitez noted, show that “news media and others” who portray our nation as “awash with murderous AR-15 assault rifles,” push hyperbole. Still, “facts matter,” the George W. Bush appointee stressed. But apparently not to Second Amendment deniers who caricatured Benitez’s opinion instead of reporting the facts and the law underlying his ruling.

Trump Slams Democrats For Crime Surge: They ‘Hate Our Country’,"Former President Donald Trump spoke at the North Carolina Republican Party State Convention on Saturday and ripped Democrats for policies leading to lawlessness and disorder.

“As we gather tonight, our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes. Crime is exploding, police departments are being ripped apart and defunded,” the former president said. “Can you believe that? Defund? Is that good politics, defund our police? Number one, it’s bad for our country, but think of it, defund our police. You know, I’ve long said they’re vicious, they’re violent, they, in many cases, hate our country, and they have bad policy.”

The homicide rate surged last year, with a 41 percent increase in New York, 30 percent in Los Angeles, 55 percent in Chicago, and 59 percent in Phoenix, to name a few. According to the New York Times, the United States exceeded 20,000 murders in 2020, the first time in 25 years the country has experienced that many in a single year.

At least 47 people died amid the Black Lives Matter and Antifa rioting last summer, and cities burned. In Portland, where rioters set fire to a federal courthouse, there was an estimated $2.3 million in damage. The riot damage from only May 26 to June 20 in 20 states across the country amounted to the most expensive manmade damage in history at $1 to $2 billion — and in some cities, rioting continued through the summer. Meanwhile, the left backed proposals to defund police departments.

Trump also said Democrats “stick together,” but the GOP will succeed in the 2022 midterm elections. He noted how he received the most votes out of any incumbent in history, surpassing Barack Obama, who set the record in 2012 over Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney.

“Now, the bad news from our standpoint, they stick together,” Trump continued. “They don’t have some of the people like we have, where they go on their own and they do what they have to do. They stick together. And that’s the one thing they have. They stick together. But their policy is so bad and we’re going to have a tremendous 2022, just like we did, frankly, 2020. Think of it. More votes than any sitting president in the history of the United States by far. We had a great election. Bad things happened, but we had a great election.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/07/trump-slams-democrats-for-crime-surge-they-hate-our-country/,2021-06-07
Hate Crimes Against Catholics Are Multiplying (But The Left Doesn't Want To Talk About It),"If you’ve been trapped in an airport, incarcerated abroad, or in some other way been forced to watch CNN over the past few years you may have heard that America is suffering from a surge of “hate crimes.”

A lot of these hate crimes are fake: Nooses that turn out to be garage pulls, bleach attacks that were staged, graffiti that turned out to have been left by the supposed “victim” herself. But there are real hate crimes that take place in America, and the best way to tell they’re real is that the press isn’t talking about them — or isn’t talking about them honestly. But while few may know it, over just the past six weeks America has seen a vicious spate of hate crimes targeting Catholics in the United States.

In the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, a vandal hopped the fence surrounding St. Athanasius Church, toppled a beautiful wooden crucifix, shattering it, and then for some reason burned an American flag.

In the nearby Windsor Terrace neighborhood, in the peaceful garden of a church administrative building, a statue of the baby Jesus in his mother’s arms was beheaded.

A week before that, in San Diego, California, three of the century-old stained glass windows in Sacred Heart Catholic Church were shattered, but the vandal wasn’t done: A statue of a kneeling St. Juan Diego, the first indigenous American saint, was decapitated with a stolen fire extinguisher and a dozen other windows were smashed.

One day before that, back in Brooklyn, a statue of Fr. Jerzy Popiełuszko, a Polish martyr beaten to death in 1984 by Communist authorities for daring to stand for freedom, was spray-painted with anti-Polish messages and covered in trash. It wasn’t the first time it had been attacked: In 1990, a vandal spray-painted on the names of Stalin and Lenin, two butchers of the Christian faithful.

On the night of May 2, at St. Charles Borromeo Church in Waltham, Massachusetts, a statue of Christ was decapitated in its church garden.

The Catholic Action League of Massachusetts said when they first started tracking anti-Catholic attacks in the Bay State five years ago, there was about one a year. Since then, they have steadily increased. In the past year, there have been 15 attacks — just in Massachusetts.

In March, there were attacks in Boston, Fort Worth, Texas and Spokane, Washington. In February, in Youngstown, Ohio, Floyds Knobs, Indiana, Denver, Colorado and El Paso, Texas. In January, a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe — the patron of the Americas and a very important image particularly across Latin America — was shot six times at Houston’s Queen of Peace Catholic Church, there was a graffiti and arson attack on a cathedral in Toledo, Ohio and vulgar Marxist messages scrawled on St. Patrick’s in Manhattan. All told, in the past year there have been at least 67 anti-Catholic attacks nationwide.

The term “hate crime” gets used too often these days. More often enough than not, if you hear the term “hate crime” you can rightly assume it’s an attention-seeking fraud by the loudest “victim” in the room, be they a student at Harvard or an actor in Hollywood.

So why use the term at all? Because the above are crimes committed with the intention of instilling fear among Catholics: To let us know that the Church is not welcome here, to let us all know that Christianity — in its oldest and most visible institution — is not welcome here, and to let you know that God and beauty and morality and freedom and dignity and God’s faithful are a target in your community.

But it’s not just about vandalism and wanton desecration: There’s an even darker aura emanating from our nation’s halls of power. In 2017, when future Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was first nominated to the Court of Appeals, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein complained that “the dogma lives loudly” within her.

In 2019, President Donald Trump nominated Brian Buescher for a federal court seat. Buescher was, and is, a member of the Catholic men’s organization the Knights of Columbus, and to Sen. Mazie Hirono and then-Sen. Kamala Harris, that made him an extremist, unwelcome in American life.

Harris peppered Buescher with questions about the group. Was he aware, she asked, that the Knights of Columbus are opposed to abortion? Was he aware, she asked, that the Knights of Columbus think marriage involves one biologically male-at-birth man being bound to one biologically female-at-birth woman? Was. He. Aware. That the Knights of Columbus believe in the teachings of the Catholic Church, unchanged for millennia?

According to Hirono, these teachings were “extreme positions” unworthy of a federal judge to hold. Presumably, that means that any sincere Catholic is unfit for any office. And in this new United States that the left is building, that is exactly the case.

It’s especially sinister that this is happening while supposed Catholics hold the nation’s highest offices. Last summer, an Antifa mob in San Francisco ripped down a statue of St. Junipero Serra. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who calls herself a Catholic, ignored the incident. “I’m trying to save the world from coronavirus,” she said when asked on the Feast of St. Serra about the attacks on the religion she pretends to believe and in the district she pretends to represent. Three days later, another mob in Sacramento, California toppled another statue of Serra.

Who was Junipero Serra? He was a missionary who, in the 18th century, traveled from California to Mexico City by foot to plead the case of the American Indians and to protest their mistreatment by Spanish soldiers. It was a perilous journey he took, there and back, to aide a suffering people he dedicated his life to helping.

Pelosi likely knows this. Rewind just a few years, and there’s a photo of then-Speaker of the House John Boehner, Rep. Steve Scalise, and Pope Francis reflecting in front of a Vatican statue to this great man. Who’s standing right next to them in deep reflection? Then-Vice President Joe Biden and then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

But now, back in power, Pelosi is happy to indulge teenagers, man-children and violent, anti-Catholic bigots who are happy to commit targeted and hateful destruction while claiming it’s all for the benefit of distant indigenous peoples they claim to represent. Neither she nor now-President Biden are hapless bystanders — they’re among the most powerful people in the world.

Trump wasn’t Catholic and never much pretended to be a devout man, but when Catholics were attacked, and when the Christian church across the street from the White House was set ablaze, he spoke up loudly, he stood up to the hateful masked thugs, and he gave leave for enforcement to do the same.

Biden says he’s a Catholic but seems to care about attacks on Catholic symbols and Catholic officials as little as he cares about Catholic beliefs. Search online for then-candidate Biden’s harsh condemnation of the desecration of St. Serra’s statue, its toppling, and the threats to return to break into the church and scatter the saint’s remains into the Pacific Ocean. The only thing you’ll find if you search this is his picture looking solemn for the Vatican photo-op in 2015.

“The devil has changed his tactics,” Msgr. Charles Pope, a Capitol Hill priest and one of the archdiocese’ three exorcists, said in late 2020. “He’s no longer hiding in the shadows.”

It’s a frightening thought, but isn’t surprising. Since 2016, influential members of America’s elite in politics, media, entertainment and business have excused and even encouraged violence in America, and under this elite cover, anti-Christian attacks have multiplied and spread.

Satan isn’t afraid right now, and why would he be? Evil is taught so freely in our society it’s celebrated and those who stand up for innocent life, traditional marriage, the family, man and woman, and Christianity are hated. It makes sense that they’re hated, too: When you live in darkness so long your eyes get used to it, the light burns.

It’s sad, because when people are in need, when legal or illegal immigrants need help, when our communities are suffering from homeless and drugs and hungry, and when people are victimized by bigotry, Catholics are — and have long been — on the the front line.

When Catholic leaders have marched against violence and hate and hunger, politicians have been proud to walk with them. When the clergy gives communion during Mass, politicians have been eager to be seen in line. After all, they like the photos such opportunities provide. But when churches are desecrated, when believers are humiliated, when The Washington Post came after a local D.C. priest for tending his flock during lockdowns, those same politicians lick their fingers, put them in the air, and decide to keep quiet.

"To Prompt Less Policing, Black Communities Need More Married Fathers","Father’s Day is a time to appreciate the role fathers play in training the next generation, and then-presidential candidate Barack Obama used his national platform to do so in a memorable speech 13 years ago.

“Of all the rocks upon which we build our lives, we are reminded today that family is the most important,” Obama said. “And we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation.”

In the speech, Obama also addressed poverty, crime, incarceration, and poor educational achievement in the black community — and looked to the home for both the root cause of those issues as well as the solution.

He presented statistics that children who grow up without a father are “five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of school, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.” Obama challenged black men to live up to the responsibilities of fatherhood and demonstrate examples of excellence and hard work within an intact family unit.

But just a few years after Obama’s speech, the predominant narrative is that pushed by the proudly Marxist Black Lives Matter organization with its shameless antipathy towards the traditional family and especially fathers.

“We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement,” a now-removed page on the Black Lives Matter website said, “by supporting each other as extended families and ‘villages’ that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.” It’s painfully obvious that any mention of fathers is missing.

The family unit — father included — is the basic building block of society, providing the primary method for teaching children moral values, self-control, and responsible adult behavior. It’s also the long-term solution to preventing crime far more effectively than BLM’s plan to abolish the police.

To solve the crises of crime, incarceration, poverty, and education, we must rebuild the “rock of the family” with strong fathers, as Obama called for. America needs a rebirth of family values and responsible fatherhood.

But instead, Black Lives Matter minimizes black fathers. Rather than look to families for social change, BLM calls for the murder of police officers, justifies looting as slavery reparations, and is linked with most of the more than 600 riots that caused an estimated $2 billion in property damage last year. Its goals and those of its affiliate organizations include abolishing the police and prisons, ending capitalism, and disrupting the Western nuclear family.

The destructive influence of Black Lives Matter has made things worse, not better. Violent crime has skyrocketed in cities implementing BLM’s “defund the police” agenda and where police departments have retreated before rioting mobs. In 2020, the number of black homicide victims increased by more than 1,100.

The real violence epidemic in black communities is not systemic police racism — as BLM would have you believe — but crime. In 2018, police shot and killed 996 people, of whom 209 were black. The same year, there were 14,123 murders in the United States. Over half, or 7,407, of those were black victims. Of single-victim, single-offender situations, at least 89 percent of black victims were killed by black assailants.

In 2020, 15 unarmed people killed by police were black and 21 were white. Those 15 deaths of unarmed black people by police equal only 0.17 percent of the estimated 8,600 deaths of black people by homicide in the same year. Police actually prevent the deaths of black Americans — the reason 81 percent of black Americans want the same number or more police in their communities.

Black Americans, particularly young men, commit violent crime at a rate much higher than their proportion of the population. The black population of the United States is 13 percent, but black offenders committed 52 percent of all homicides between 1980 and 2008.

Obama identified the right source, of both the problem and the solution. Black communities not only have some of the highest rates of violent crime, they also have the highest rate of children born to unmarried mothers — 69 percent overall, and higher in many inner-city neighborhoods.

The crisis of fatherless families is not unique to the black community. The out-of-wedlock birth rate is 52 percent among Hispanic Americans. At 28 percent, the illegitimacy rate among white Americans is higher than what Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed among black families in 1965 when he predicted catastrophic social consequences.

As Obama noted, the effects of fatherlessness on children is devastating. Eighty-five percent of youth inmates, 71 percent of all high school dropouts, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children did not have a father at home. If we truly believe black lives matter, we must separate myth from reality and speak the truth about why so many are being lost.

3 Ways The Left’s Hatred Of Women Shows Up In Transgender Ideology,"Everyone knows the political left disdains men — at least, white heterosexual men who aren’t confused about their sex. But it also has a serious misogyny problem. For all the trumpeting of women’s rights, leftist policies frequently demean, disempower, or even endanger women.

Women are expected to shoulder burdens not imposed on men, all to promote what’s touted as a greater public good. Besides, is there anything more dismissive and denigrating of women’s value and humanity than referring to them as “menstruators,” “birthing units,” or “uterus owners”?

1. Transgender Policies Erase Women

Much of the left’s misogyny arises from the sudden “transgender” contagion. Trans-accommodating policies have real victims, in addition to the ultimate victimization of the gender-dysphoric. Usually if not always, those other victims are women.

When biological males compete on women’s and girls’ sports teams – as happens in Connecticut high school track competitions – female athletes find themselves “on the sidelines instead of the podium.” If these girls are deprived of not only the thrill of victory but also college scholarships, the trans lobby argues, it’s a price they should be willing to pay for the male athletes’ idea of justice.

Other accommodations of the trans cult endanger women’s physical and psychological health. The institutional left insists trans-identifying males must be allowed into private female facilities such as restrooms and locker rooms, over the objections of women and girls. Obviously, a predator could easily feign a trans identity to gain access to such spaces.

Beyond that danger, women have a basic, self-protective unwillingness to expose their bodies and privacy to any random man, regardless of his intent. As numbers for sexual assaults are alarmingly high and sex trafficking is on the rise, is it really sensible to teach girls male nudity in their presence is normal?

The issue isn’t limited to bathrooms. President Biden plans to force federally funded women’s shelters to admit biological males, and California now allows male prisoners to transfer to women’s prisons even with no surgical procedures.

Leftist lawmakers apparently can’t grasp the problems with such a policy. British officials couldn’t either, but now the Ministry of Justice “has revealed inmates who identify as transgender are responsible for a rate of sexual attacks that is exponentially higher than their proportion of the population of women’s jails and prisons.”

In response, the left thinks these snowflake women should simply get a grip. As the Charlotte Observer argued during the North Carolina “bathroom bill” controversy, the problem lies with women’s irrational fears (typical females, always getting hysterical about something). “The battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort – with blacks sharing facilities, with gays sharing marriage,” the Observer chided, “then realizing that it was not nearly so awful as some people imagined.” Attitude adjusted, problem solved.

2. How Celebrating Prostitution Hurts Women

What about the standard leftist position on prostitution? Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proudly touts her support of “sex work” as “real work.” In Baltimore, Philadelphia, and most recently in Manhattan, district attorneys have announced they’ll no longer prosecute prostitution.

Pimps in those locales are popping champagne corks. Far from Julia Roberts being paid to attend swanky parties with Richard Gere, the reality is starkly different. Anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of prostitutes (usually women) are estimated to be “pimp-controlled.” And working for a pimp isn’t exactly an empowering experience.

One expert on the effects of prostitution testified “prostitutes are often so financially and psychologically dependent on their pimps that they are unable to leave even when they are beaten.” She further described the most common ways the relationship ends: “the prostitute becomes pregnant, goes on welfare, turns to more serious kinds of crime, commits suicide, or dies at the hands of a customer.” I am woman, hear me roar.

3. When a Rape Is ‘Just a Rape’

An egregious but little-understood illustration of the left’s anti-woman mindset is the prosecution of so-called “hate crimes.” Dr. Tina Trent, a scholar who has written extensively on what she calls the “hate crimes industry,” explains how white, heterosexual women are quietly and systematically excluded from the category of hate-crime victims – even when violently raped, perhaps raped and murdered, and even when the perpetrator made clear he was motivated by hatred of women.

The FBI lists rape as a hate crime, but in reality, rape is usually only prosecuted and recorded as one when the victim is a transgender male or a racial or other minority. In one case Trent describes, a black man who raped nine women was charged with only eight hate crimes because the ninth victim was white rather than Asian or Hispanic.

Trent reported in an email interview that during her research on hate crimes and rape, more than one law-enforcement official told her when the rape victim is “just a woman,” the prosecution will be just for rape, not a hate crime with an enhanced penalty. “This extra-legal interpretation of hate crime statutes, which appears nowhere in the actual text of any of these laws,” Trent said, “has remained consistent across all states and the federal government’s prosecutions of hate-crime rape for more than two decades now.”

Why marginalize women in this way? First, as Trent explains, because there are “too many rapes,” recording them in the hate statistics would overshadow the (frequently less severe) offenses based on race, gender identity, etc. that it’s politically opportune to highlight.

Second, counting rape as a hate crime could unacceptably alter the demographics of hate criminals. The left’s narrative that only whites commit hate crimes is disrupted when rapists of many races show up in the statistics. So the simple solution is to exclude most rapes and rapists from the data.

This begins primarily in the training of police and prosecutors. “Bias statutes are so vague,” Trent says, “an unprecedented industry of ‘trainers’ and ‘educators’ has sprung up to explain to prosecutors and police precisely what these laws are supposed to mean.” And these state and federally-funded trainers, like the Human Rights Council, the NAACP, and the Anti-Defamation League, make it clear rape of “just a woman” isn’t included.

Women’s Rights Are Old News

All these examples illustrate at best a lack of concern for women and at worst actual contempt. But premier women’s organizations are largely silent. The only prominent group that dares challenge the leftist narrative on any of these issues is the Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF), which vocally opposes elevating the desires of trans-identifying men over the rights and safety of women. By contrast, the National Organization for Women (NOW) trumpets its support for all things trans, never mentioning the harm done to real women.

In the left’s hierarchy of victims, women simply don’t rank as highly as sexual and racial minorities. Having succeeded in making their version of women’s “rights” mainstream, leftists have moved on to new frontiers. Women are now expected to yield some of their rights and even their dignity to new victims, new narratives. After all, they’re just women.

Obama Policing Task Force Member Blames Cops For Democrat-Induced Crime Surges,"MSNBC contributor Brittany Packnett Cunningham, who was appointed in 2015 to serve on President Barack Obama’s “Task Force on 21st Century Policing” and is a major defund-the-police activist, claimed on-air that the crime surge is “the fault of the police.”

“Defunding the police is not just about taking money out of an institution that continues to prove ineffective,” Cunningham said. “It’s also about refunding the people.”

“The police haven’t been defunded,” Cunningham continued. “You actually look at the 50 largest cities, law enforcement spending as a share of the general expenditure in each of those cities actually rose slightly from 13.6 percent to 13.7 percent, and many of the cities that have talked about removing that money, like Minneapolis and Seattle, they’ve actually paused or slowed how they were thinking about moving that money. … So this rising crime is not the fault of the movement, it’s actually the fault of the police.”

Cunningham’s claim that law enforcement has not been defunded is false. Dozens of cities moved to slash budgets after the death of George Floyd last year, leading to lawlessness and disorder. Minneapolis, for instance, cut $8 million from its budget in December, and New York voted in August to pull $1 billion from its budget.

In fact, the 50 largest cities in America slashed budgets by more than 5 percent this year. While it is true that many cities have reversed course, such as Seattle and New York, damage had already been done as anti-police rhetoric dominated Democrat talking points, with left-wing leaders, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris, even condoning lawlessness. Preliminary 2020 FBI data indicates homicides increased by 25 percent. In Chicago, homicides increased by 56 percent and in Atlanta by 58 percent.

As the Wall Street Journal noted in a May report, after the rise in crime, “In the nation’s 20 largest local law-enforcement agencies, city and county leaders want funding increases for nine of the 12 departments where next year’s budgets already have been proposed. The increases range from 1% to nearly 6%.”

“In Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed, the city cut $8 million from the department last year, only to restore $6.4 million to hire new officers amid mass retirements and rising crime,” the report also stated.

Cunningham has been a major advocate for defunding police. She claimed on MSNBC a few weeks ago that cutting budgets is “giving us the opportunity to reenvision and reimagine what public safety looks like in our communities.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/22/obama-policing-task-force-member-blames-cops-for-democrat-induced-crime-surges/,2021-06-22
Biden Pledges To Take Away Guns As Violent Crime Surges,"President Joe Biden tried to justify his newest gun control pledge by claiming that Americans don’t have the weapons they would need to “take on the government” anyway.

“Those who say the blood of Patriots, you know, and all the stuff about how we’re gonna have to move against the government,” Biden said during a Wednesday press conference. “If you think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.”

Biden’s comments follow the introduction of a new White House crime prevention plan focused on imposing strong gun control measures on Americans as violent crime surges in the U.S., especially in Democrat-led cities.

“The gun lobby wants you to believe that cities that have the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence … don’t believe it,” the president claimed without evidence.

The Democrat continued his anti-gun pledge by claiming that his administration is “not changing the Constitution, we’re enforcing it” by working to keep firearms that fire dozens of rounds out of Americans’ hands.

“No one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100 rounds, unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something,” he said.

Biden claimed that his plan “doesn’t affect responsible gun owners or 2nd Amendment rights” and that “it helps keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them in the first place,” but the Democrat and his administration have been very transparent about their intentions to ban high-capacity magazines and ban assault weapons such as AR-15 pistols.

In April, Biden announced multiple executive orders set on combatting what he called a “public health crisis” and “international embarrassment” of gun violence in the United States. During his screed against firearms, Biden made multiple false claims about background checks. During his joint address, Biden also falsely claimed that former President Bill Clinton’s ban on assault weapons contributed to the decline in gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years.

“A ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds … we beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years,” Biden said.

‘Defunding The Police’ Is Ridiculous. Here’s How To Do Real Police Reform,"By the time I heard a local activist leader shout that he had brought a group of protesters outside my house to make my children, wife, and neighbors “uncomfortable,” I had mostly given up on the idea that meaningful systemic changes would come out of the movement sparked by the brutal murder of George Floyd.

I am an African American man who grew up in rough neighborhoods in Dallas during the most violent period of our nation’s history. Before I became mayor, I had successfully pushed for police accountability measures and expanded educational opportunities during my nine years in the Texas legislature. I was raising two black boys in America (and have added a daughter since then). I was horrified by the death of George Floyd. And Eric Garner. And Philando Castile. And Tamir Rice. And Michael Brown. And on and on.

But like many of my fellow mayors across the country, I had become the enemy because I didn’t believe in slashing the budget of our police department — which had already shrunk by hundreds of officers during the previous five years — amid staggering increases in violent crime in Dallas.

The movement, which began with bipartisan support and captured hearts and minds across the country in a way I had never before seen, was hijacked by elitist and extremist talk of “defunding” or “dismantling.” The loudest voices eschewed common ground and common sense, opting for sloganeering and an air of insatiability that repelled rather than persuaded. Many positive changes, including better use-of-force policies, came out of the movement, but many other opportunities have been squandered.

It didn’t have to be that way. And it still doesn’t.

Cities and states can implement programs now that provide for equity, improve policing, and make us less reliant on law enforcement to solve every social ill. And the federal government could support these ideas through a 21st-century crime bill. Whereas the 1994 Crime Bill centered on punishment, a new plan could focus on prevention and policing.

Now is the time to take action in a comprehensive way. Violent crime is up across the country, and underserved communities and minorities are disproportionately the victims. They deserve safety and justice. During the pandemic, I was a member of the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice, and we collected data that showed aggravated assault rates in the United States increased 7 percent, gun assault rates went up by 22 percent, and homicides spiked by 24 percent. In Dallas, the numbers were even higher.

Police can help stop violent crime and bring criminals to justice. Over and over, defunding activists claimed that police only show up after a crime is committed — an absurd notion that suggests all crimes are just one-offs and that there is no such thing as repeat offenders and no need for detectives.

There are bad people in this world. Maybe some people could have been saved and still can be once they are in the criminal justice system. But once they victimize someone, they must be stopped. That’s why we need police, and why defunding — whatever it means — is a mistake. We also need solutions that reduce our dependence on law enforcement and prevent crimes from occurring in the first place.

Here is how we can fight crime and make our police departments better and more responsive.

Demand and develop crime reduction plans. Every city’s police chief should have an annual strategic plan to reduce violent crime and to engage the community. This may seem simple, but when I became mayor in June 2019, it became apparent that the police brass of the ninth-largest city in the country simply didn’t have a comprehensive crime-reduction plan. I had to demand one.

That also meant that policymakers had nothing on which they could base resource allocation decisions and had no real way to assess accountability or let their constituents know what steps were being taken or why. Accountability must start at the top.

Offer competitive pay for police. Simply put, you get what you pay for. Policing poses many potential dangers for both suspects and the police, and the pay isn’t always commensurate with the risks and skills required to do the job.

In 2019, we supported market-based pay increases in Dallas after years of losing some of our best young officers, whom we paid to train, to growing suburban cities with salaries that were $10,000-$15,000 a year more than what we offered. If we want good community policing, we must set high standards and pay accordingly.

Improve accountability measures. Those who can’t meet those expectations need to find other work. The stakes are too high. A civilian police oversight board can be an important way to hold our police officers accountable.

We have enhanced ours in Dallas and hired a monitor to help review cases and recommend policy changes in line with evolving community expectations. We also need to double down on body cameras, which have allowed prosecutors, grand juries, juries, and the public to cut through the noise and see issues more clearly.

Expand training for police officers. Those cameras also give police something that has been used for decades in sports: game film. Video is an important training tool. And training must be intensive.

Police are expected to think like lawyers, criminologists, psychologists, and athletes. No police department worth its salt should be adhering to only the minimum prescribed state standards as they exist now. Boost the requirements, give the best available training, and correct mistakes.

Address environmental factors that cause crime. In August 2019, I formed the Mayor’s Task Force on Safe Communities to make recommendations for policies that could reduce crime without the involvement of law enforcement. After reviewing policies in some other cities, the Task Force recommended improving lighting and remediating blight in high-crime areas.

Crime tends to exist where criminals believe no one is watching and that no one cares. We need to eliminate havens for violence. We have begun implementing these recommendations through our newly formed Office of Integrated Public Safety Solutions, and the early returns have been promising. Cities should move swiftly on place-based crime reduction strategies that don’t involve law enforcement.

Provide counseling services, early and often. My Task Force on Safe Communities also recommended two policies aimed at changing behaviors: implementing social and emotional learning (SEL) curriculum in schools and employing violence interrupters in targeted neighborhoods. Both programs are meant to help people learn to deal with conflict in nonviolent ways.

We recently hired Youth Advocate Programs to run a violence interrupter program, and other cities have started similar programs. And Dallas ISD has expanded its SEL program, which has produced positive results.

Handle mental health calls the right way. Police are not equipped well enough to deal with mental health emergencies. In Dallas, we have created and expanded our RIGHT (Rapid Integrated Group Healthcare Team) Care program, which deploys mental health professionals to calls, accompanied by police. Other cities have similar programs. They are worth the cost and help cities deal with their most vulnerable residents in a caring and understanding way.

Create and expand summer jobs programs. These programs are primarily meant to give young people some money and teach them life and job skills. But they also help reduce crime. One federally funded 2017 study showed that New York City’s Summer Youth Employment program participants were 17 percent less likely to be arrested during the summer and 23 percent less likely to be arrested for a felony. In Dallas, we are scaling up my summer jobs program for youth called Dallas Works and hope to see similar results.

These are real solutions that do not require defunding or dismantling anything. They are about building for a better future.

They also reflect the on-the-ground reality that mayors deal with every day. We know very well that public safety is our residents’ top priority. We know that our residents must feel safe to thrive and that they want to be able to call 911 and get an appropriate response when they’re in a crisis. We can’t expect people to strive for the American dream if they can’t sleep safely and comfortably. And we can’t expect people to feel safe if they don’t have trust in our police officers to correctly respond to difficult situations.

The status quo isn’t working for many people. It’s not working for crime victims or for the victims of police brutality. We can and must do better for them and for our children. And in this country that has seen too many divisions, we must do it in a way that brings people together.

The White House Know Its Police And Border Policies Are About To Crash,"Something strange is afoot in the party of Jefferson. With the Democrats still spinning after the collapse of their election bill — and progressives furious with the White House’s seeming lack of commitment to that effort — the president has already pivoted, announcing a plan to tackle the violent crime wave besetting American cities.

And the vice president? She’s on her way to the border, 91 days, two countries, and countless laughs after it was first assigned by the boss.

Some might notice that cracking down on rampant crime and tackling a crisis at the border were not topics of discussion when now-President Joe Biden and now-Vice President Kamala (briefly) shared a debate stage two years ago. In fact, it was quite the opposite, littered with jabs and brags about who was more anti-cop or more open-border. So what gives?

If you get your news from Democrats or their palace guards in corporate media, you might think the White House was forced into this by wicked Republicans and dastardly conservative media.

“Republicans, led by former President Donald Trump, are… attempting to pin the rash of violence on the White House, even though increases in gun violence happened during the previous administration,” Politico claimed, as if their readers can’t remember a full year of Democratic defund-the-police schemes.

“Conservative media outlets are carrying a steady stream of foreboding headlines highlighting the rise of year-over-year shootings and homicides,” they added, for good measure.

“Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to the U.S.-Mexico border this week,” Politico opened another article, “amid an unrelenting chorus of criticism from Republicans over her failure to visit there.”

“Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki even said during Wednesday’s press conference, citing the GOP’s pushback on a Democratic social-workers bill.

Of course, none of the above scribes actually think Republican Party pressure is the reason for this about-face, and even Psaki is smart enough to look embarrassed to try the talking point, nearly walking it back right away.

They all know that the only real reason a political party shifts focus so dramatically from its goals to issues it wishes it could avoid is terrible internal polling: numbers coming back predicting election disasters, battleground states looking dicey, voters across the country responding negatively.

People don’t admit it when this is the reason (unless they’re Don Lemon, who leaked CNN’s internal polling and is a special person), but it’s the same thing we saw when Democrats reversed course on last summer’s deadly riots and the ongoing lockdowns.

And we saw it in real time in New York City, the liberal capital of the East, when on Tuesday a former New York Police Department captain who promised to tackle crime and put more cops on the streets came in first place in the mayoral election and is likely on the path to victory.

How’d he pull it off? “His message,” the Intelligencer reports, “almost singularly emphasized fighting crime (the top issue among all Democratic voters)… He campaigned on increasing the NYPD’s budget and presence on the streets after many candidates initially embraced ‘defund the police’ rhetoric following citywide protests against the police last summer.”

Primary elections are about as trustworthy a poll as you can get, and Democrats are finally listening. But here’s their quagmire: They don’t have a single solution. Both the crisis at the border and the crisis in the cities are the direct results of their policies of dropping enforcement of crime in both places, and what do Biden and Harris want to do in response? Crack down on gun-store owners and fix the economies of Central America.

Lofty goals, both, but it wasn’t a gun-store owner who dragged two young parents from their car and executed them in the street over the weekend or shot 52 other people in the city of Chicago alone. Unless there’s been the largest single one-year increase in gun store owners illegally selling handguns since the country started keeping such records in the 20th century, it doesn’t explain what The Washington Post called “the largest single one-year increase in homicides since the country started keeping such records in the 20th century.” Bullets don’t fall from the sky, and undermining and punishing and demoralizing police isn’t consequence-free.

While grueling poverty once trapped Central Americans in Central America, with increased wealth came increased access to internet, cell phones, and the money needed to pay criminal cartels to smuggle humans. While a roaring economy would undoubtedly severely curtail illegal immigration, Harris’s ability to create one here or there approaches zero, despite her best efforts, leaving enforcement of America’s border laws the only immediate salve.

The Democratic Party is careening for a collision with reality, and voters are catching on. Their ability to reverse several planks of the new left and avoid the crash, however, looks near-impossible.

How Turning Over Cops To The Federal Government Backfired On Seattle,"When Seattle’s City Council voted unanimously to cut millions of dollars from its police budget amid the uproar over the murder of George Floyd, it ran into an unlikely roadblock: the federal government. U.S. District Judge James Robart ruled that the city couldn’t defund its own police department without his permission.

The judge was acting under the mandate granted him by a 2012 consent decree put in place after John T. Williams, a native American woodcarver, was shot four times by a Seattle police officer in 2010. The killing was ruled unjustified. The consent decree — a sort of civil plea bargain — was one of several with police departments across the country arranged under pressure from the Obama Justice Department as it sought to end alleged civil rights abuses by police in cities from Baltimore to Cleveland to Ferguson, Mo.

And now, after being sharply curtailed by the Trump administration, consent decrees are back. In one of his first major actions as President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland in April rescinded the Trump policy limiting them. Days later he announced an investigation into Floyd’s death, which is expected to result in a consent decree with Minneapolis.

That raises the question: Do consent decrees work? Do they help or hinder police in providing public safety? Do they protect citizens from abusive police practices?

The Surrender of Local Control

The answer is necessarily subjective, in part because it’s hard to isolate the factors affecting crime and policing. Still, it seems clear that the record of consent decrees is mixed at best, and the surrender of local control, as in Seattle, may have a good deal to do with it.

Seattle has seen a marked increase in violent crime between 2013, the first full year its cop shop came under consent decree, and 2020. There were 52 homicides in 2020, compared with 19 in 2013. The total number of violent crimes rose by nearly 25% over that time. The increase in violent crime holds even accounting for the growth in Seattle’s population over the last decade.

Los Angeles, on the other hand, showed improvement, according to researchers from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. After nearly a decade under a pre-Obama consent decree, according to the researchers, “The quality of service to residents is higher, the perception of the LAPD as fair has risen, and the use of force is down.” The LA consent decree was finally lifted in 2013.

The judge overseeing the Ferguson decree — imposed after the 2014 police killing of a young black man, Michael Brown — said at a “status conference” last year that “things have not gone as quickly as we had hoped and as the Consent Decree anticipated, but I believe that great progress has been made.”

A study of the Baltimore police by the American Civil Liberties Union was less positive about results of the decree imposed after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in police custody. Aggressive cops “get caught and they pretend to go into reform mode,” said one lawyer interviewed for the report. Soon “people forget about it and they do it again.”

This month, the head of Cleveland’s police union blamed that city’s consent decree for growing gun crime and other lawlessness. “The homicide rate is up crazy,” union president Jeff Follmer said. “[H]ow about let the police do their job and maybe some of these numbers go down?”

Follmer might be onto something: The loss of local control, a defining characteristic of consent decrees, means that one of the fundamental responsibilities of local government is handled at a distance. Do police departments improve under federal control? Do citizens get the sort of policing they think is best for their communities? One might consider the recent experience of the Seattle Police Department, as effectively presided over by Judge — and de facto Police Commissioner — Robart.

Critics of consent decrees say the court-governed agreements hinder reform by taking responsibility away from democratically elected officials, whether a given decree has to do with law enforcement or any other issue, such as environmental regulations or the provision of special education. With authority in the hands of unelected, unaccountable judges, monitors, and commissions, change can take years, even decades — if there is change at all.

A Seattle Case Study

Seattle’s consent decree did indeed establish a Community Police Commission, whose membership was supposed to be “representative of the many and diverse communities in Seattle, including members from each precinct of the City, police officer unions, faith communities, minority, ethnic, and other community organizations, and student or youth organizations.”

But it turns out that diverse membership does not a democracy make. Community representatives do not bear the same burdens as elected leaders. And their power relative to the judge is still limited, which may be an understatement. “The Commission’s reports and recommendations,” the consent decree promises, “will be posted to the City’s Website.”

David Schoenbrod, a professor at New York Law School, and co-author of the book “Democracy by Decree,” an influential critique of “What Happens When Courts Run Government,” argues that authority must be tied to representation. “The way democracy is supposed to work,” he told RealClearInvestigations, “is for key policies to be made by elected officials. They are responsible.”

Advocates for consent decrees, by contrast, argue that “local police departments can’t reform themselves,” as Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law, put it in the Los Angeles Times. “Bring on the feds.”

Bring on the feds they did in Seattle, but in practice, the feds may well halt reform — cementing long-standing police practices, and hindering lawmakers’ ability to make timely changes.

The federal investigation into Seattle’s policing that resulted in its consent decree was led by a U.S. attorney, Jenny Durkan. She came from a prominent political family in Washington state described as West Coast Kennedys. Durkan’s federal Department of Justice experience and political ambitions came together when she successfully ran for mayor of Seattle in 2017, trumpeting her role in putting the Seattle Police Department (SPD) under the consent decree. “Durkan’s tenure as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington,” the Seattle Times wrote in an election season profile, “is the cornerstone of her campaign.”

But the city arguably paid a price for the consent decree Durkan helped secure, and then ran on – the city lost control of its ability to respond to crises involving its police department. Years of training in “Use of Force Principles,” and “Weapon-Specific Policies” mandated by the decree left law enforcement unprepared for the protests and riots of last summer. Local officials were appalled at the SPD’s use of tear gas, “blast balls” and other crowd-control weapons, and last July the Seattle City Council voted 9-0 to ban them.

The council also took up the call to “defund the police,” voting to shift millions of dollars out of the police budget. Mayor Durkan opposed the action, but the lawmakers overruled her veto. And yet, they were stonewalled. It was not police who found themselves hobbled by federal oversight. Instead, the uniformly liberal city council was. It was repeatedly blocked in its efforts to defund the police and limit the weapons that could be used for crowd control as a consequence of the consent decree.

When Seattle copped to a consent decree rather than fight the DOJ’s determination that its policing was discriminatory, violent, and unconstitutional, its police department found itself answering to Judge Robart. (Judge Robart would become nationally known for halting President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending immigration from terrorism-linked countries.)

Judge Robart declared Seattle couldn’t make changes to policing in the city without his permission, even though he admitted he might not have been an infallible expert on the issues: “I can’t tell you today if blast balls are a good idea or a bad idea,” Robart said in July 2020, “but I know that sometime a long time ago I approved them.” This matter of expertise alone is one of the problems with consent decrees.

“Last summer we asked the court to maintain the consent decree in the face of outsized police response to mostly peaceful protests,” councilmember Lisa Herbold recently wrote in a newsletter to her constituents. Now “we are faced with a consent decree that is a barrier to passage of policy regulating the use of weapons like blast balls and tear gas.” The consent decree had also become a barrier, Herbold said, “to the Council fulfilling our commitment to reduce [the Seattle Police Department’s] budget to hold them accountable.”

Judge Robart went still further. He not only blocked lawmakers from implementing policy reforms, but dressed them down for not recognizing his authority. “I have some rather harsh words for the City Council over the last six months or so,” Robart declared this past February. “I think they have lost sight of the fact that the 100 paragraphs in the consent decree are not 100 paragraphs. They are not even commitments. They are obligations, orders from this court of things that will be done,” Robart said. “And when they decide to take matters into their own hands in contravention of the Consent Decree, then they drag me into a situation that I don’t want to be in, which is telling them, ‘No, you can’t do that.’”

RealClearInvestigation submitted questions to Judge Robart about his control over Seattle police operations. A clerk replied: “Judge Robart does not respond to media inquiries on active matters before the court.” That may be a reasonable judicial policy, but it also means an individual governing a big city police department might go years without taking questions on how he’s doing the job.

According to Seattle’s consent decree monitor, Antonio Oftelie, the important thing is that local governments abide by the terms of their commitments. If “budget cuts erode the ability of the City to meet its basic obligations, the city may fall out of compliance with the consent decree,” Oftelie told RealClearInvestigations.

Adrian Diaz, who became Seattle’s new police chief in September, made it clear he embraces the consent decree. In February, Diaz declared that the SPD had collaborated in developing the ongoing monitoring plan under which the department’s adherence to the consent decree would be judged. He made it clear that he answered to federal authorities: “This plan formalizes SPD deliverables.”

Not Consent of the Governed but of the Government

But where does federal authority leave room for local lawmakers’ preferred policies to be tested? “Defunding” the police may be a good idea; it may be a terrible idea. But without responsibility for the outcome, legislators don’t have to answer for their role in the policy chosen. With judges dictating policy, Schoenbrod says, accountability is lost. Elected officials can say “The court made us do it.”

Michael Morley, professor at Florida State University College of Law, contends that — consistent with Seattle’s experience — consent decrees tend to entrench one or another set of policies and stifle change, rather than spur reforms. Such decrees in effect represent the consent not of the governed, but of the government.

Morley told RealClearInvestigation that state and local “government entities enthusiastically embrace decrees because the decrees guarantee spending.” Rather than being punitive, consent decrees often lead cities to increase the budgets of problem departments, spending millions on training and new technologies. The targets of consent decrees, Morley said, regularly use the agreements to secure and protect resources.

As for Seattle Mayor Durkan, her tenure having been a muddle, she announced she will not seek reelection in November. But she doesn’t blame her lame duck status on her entanglement with the consent decree. While Mayor Durkan’s office did not answer questions from RealClearInvestigations, she applauded, in an open letter to the Attorney General, his decision “to rescind the Trump Administration’s limits on consent decrees”. Even though the decree she had imposed on Seattle thwarted democratic decision-making and accountability in the city, Durkan declared such decrees had been “critical to creating new policies, more training, new investigative oversight, new civilian oversight, and more transparency in data and reporting.”

But not more democracy.

"Amid Surging Crime Rates And Murders, Oakland City Council Votes To Defund Police","Despite recently receiving $190 million from the Biden Administration, the City Council of Oakland, California voted Thursday to defund their police department by almost $18 million. The city’s crime rates have skyrocketed, seeing a 90 percent increase in murders, 88 percent increase in carjackings, and 70 percent increase in shootings all in the last year.

Sixty-five lives have been lost, and 1,300 robberies have been recorded, yet, the city redirected police funds toward the Department of Violence Prevention, “with the intention of improving public safety” via alternate means.

On Monday, the Department of Violence Prevention’s chief was interrupted during an on-camera interview by an attempted armed robbery. The department’s chief was being interviewed on the steps of Oakland City Hall, when they were attacked. The suspects remain outstanding.

Rather than help police officers confront Oakland’s growing crisis, the city plans to fund the employment of “violence interrupters” and “community ambassadors.” This redirection of funds will increase police vacancies, leading to slower emergency response times.

Despite receiving $190 million from the Biden admin, Oakland’s city council voted last week to cut $18 million from the police. In March, Oakland’s Democrat mayor praised the Defund the Police movement while touting new federal funds. There goes @PressSec‘s new talking point! — Chad Gilmartin (@ChadGilmartinCA) June 29, 2021

The Anti Police-Terror Project applauded the city’s reallocation of funds, but Oakland Mayor Libby Shaaf pushed back.

“[The new budget],” she said, “cuts 50 police officers who respond to Oaklanders’ 911 calls and enforce traffic safety. It also cuts much-needed future academies, which will significantly reduce police staffing and delay response to Oaklanders in their time of crisis.” Shaaf added that the budget “will force [Oakland police] officers to work even more overtime shifts, which are expensive and unsafe for officers and residents alike.”

Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong strongly condemned the new budget. “Today we find ourselves in a crisis,” he said. “[C]rime is out of control in the city.” It doesn’t make sense to defund the police, he argued.

“[One of our city leaders] referred to [the crime surge] as a ‘bump in the road,’ a ‘speed bump’” Armstrong said. “[W]ell for me, those speed bumps are 65 lives so far this year, victims who have suffered at the hands of violence, whether it’s shootings, robberies, carjackings, [or] sexual assault. All of these crimes are not speed bumps. These are people.”

“Far too often in these meetings, we are talking about numbers, we are talking about money and cost,” Armstrong continued. “I don’t know what the cost of a life is, but I know not having resources makes our city less safe. It concerns me that we would ever consider that to be a bump in the road.”

Armstrong pleaded for City Council to take the suffering of Oakland’s residents seriously. “[T]hese are true people,” he reminded them. “These are people who lost their lives in this city. […] When I go to scenes and I meet with mothers and family members, they’re not talking about numbers, they’re talking about their children.”

Armstrong soon became so overtaken by grief that he fell into silence. Breathing heavily, he tried to prepare himself to continue. “Saturday night, I went out to a scene of a young man that lost his life. And a lady yelled out the window, ‘Do something about it!’” he recalled. Armstrong desperately wants to “do something” about his city’s crime surge, but he says that he and his colleagues aren’t being given the support they need.

“Without the resources, it makes it challenging to make Oakland safe, and more families find themselves dealing with trauma,” Armstrong argued.

"After Slashing Police Budget, Majority Of San Francisco Residents Now Want More Police","A new poll shows a majority of San Francisco residents think it is time to increase police presence in areas affected by high rates of crime.

The annual San Francisco Chamber of Commerce report found 76 percent of residents want more police in high-crime areas, and 80 percent believe crime has accelerated. Polling was done by EMC Research from May 25 to 31, and respondents affirmed this sentiment “across gender, age, ethnicity, party affiliation, and neighborhood, and homeownership status.”

250 registered voters were polled. 60 percent of respondents agreed the city ought to keep funding law enforcement academies and 88 percent indicated homelessness has grown worse. The city had the sixth-highest number of homeless residents in 2020.

San Francisco, a reliably left-wing stronghold, has been gripped by the “defund the police” movement. Democrat Mayor London Breed announced a plan last summer to slash $120 million from the police and sheriff’s department budget.

However, after a major crime surge last year that resulted in a 36.7 percent increase in killings and a 753 percent increase in car break-ins at the police department’s primary station, Breed seemed to regret her decision. The mayor unveiled a plan in May to increase police in high-crime neighborhoods.

“To sustain the Community Ambassadors’ efforts for the longer-term, the Mayor is including funding in her two-year budget proposal, including $5 million in the first year and $3.8 million in the second year, while UC Hastings has dedicated $3 million in State funding,” a city press release stated. “Working together in partnership with the Mayor’s administration, UC Hastings has sought and received the support of Governor Newsom, who has included in his May Revision budget proposal an allocation of $3 million over three years to fund Urban Alchemy’s services contiguous to its campus.”

Still, the money approved to be cut from the budget will go toward the “underserved Black community,” a broad term to be understood as taking the form of police being instructed not to respond to non-criminal complaints and conduct “anti-bias” training.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/29/less-than-a-year-after-slashing-police-budget-majority-of-san-francisco-residents-now-want-more-police-presence/,2021-06-29
Chicago Mayor Lightfoot Says 'Crime Is On The Decline' While It Surges,"While data shows nearly 200 more people have been shot this year in Chicago than last year at the same time, Democrat Mayor Lori Lightfoot claimed during a Friday press conference that “crime is on the decline.”

This year in Chicago, 1,587 people have been shot, according to the most recent data from the Chicago Tribune. Likewise, records obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times indicate a surge in violent crime. Last week, the Sun-Times reported that Chicago has seen 317 homicides compared to 302 at the same time last year. Chicago had 775 homicides in 2020, according to data compiled by the Sun-Times, a 55 percent spike from a year prior. Still, Lightfoot has attempted to conceal this reality to the public and tell them the opposite.

“All of our major indices show a decline in our crime, and our homicides and our shootings year over year are down,” the mayor said on Friday.

A reporter asked whether “off-the-charts violent crime in the City of Chicago” is leading to business closure and what Lightfoot thinks about the notion she has “lost control of the city.”

“The premise of your question, which is it’s chaos everywhere, the fact of the matter is, sir — which you also didn’t point out, but I will so we get this straight — is we’re actually seeing a decline in homicides and shootings, yes sir,” Lightfoot replied.

This past weekend was Chicago’s bloodiest of the year, with shootings leaving 63 people injured and three dead, in the state that became the first to abolish cash bail in February. On Monday, Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown told reporters at a press conference that criminals are being let loose and are then committing additional crimes. Brown also said illegal firearms are leading to the crime spike.

“The answer is too many guns, too many illegal guns in the wrong hands, and too little consequences for illegal gun possession,” Brown said. “Number two, too many violent offenders released back to our communities here in Chicago. And too little consequences, ultimately, for violent offenders who are arrested, charged, and brought before the courts.”

Even though Brown laid out why Chicago is being ravaged by crime, President Joe Biden aligns with the Lightfoot camp. The White House unveiled a plan last week to supposedly curb violent crime but blamed gun laws and not enough job opportunities for minorities.

Just as the White House claimed a trip to Guatemala would address the “root causes” of the flow of migrants through the U.S.-Mexico border, it invoked the same rhetoric with domestic crime.

“This strategy implements preventative measures that are proven to reduce violent crime, and attacks the root causes — including by addressing the flow of firearms used to commit crimes,” the White House said.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/30/chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-says-crime-is-on-the-decline-while-it-surges-in-her-city/,2021-06-30
"Lockdowns, Crime, And Climate Hysteria: Our Three Biggest Disasters","Did lockdowns take more lives than they saved? It’s an important question. Earlier this month, the Rand Corporation and the University of Southern California, working on behalf of the National Bureau of Economic Research, released a working paper to ascertain just that.

Most casual news consumers might not have heard about it, and that’s not surprising because here’s what they found:

We find that following the implementation of shelter-in-place policies, excess mortality increases. … We failed to find that countries or U.S. states that implemented [shelter in place] policies earlier, and in which [shelter-in-place] policies had longer to operate, had lower excess deaths than countries/U.S. states that were slower to implement [shelter in place] policies. We also failed to observe differences in excess death trends before and after the implementation of [shelter in place] policies based on pre-[shelter in place] COVID-19 death rates.

There you have it: Following lockdowns, “excess mortality increases.”

In 2020, nearly every American in the world had to endure a month or more of shelter-in-place orders depending on where he lived. In states like New York and California, oppressive policies lasted for months after the literal lockdown ended. In Ireland and other parts of Europe, lockdowns have just tentatively begun to end. In Australia, they’re still ongoing.

Through it all, people, businesses, and communities were destroyed because some public health “experts” were dead-certain this was needed to save lives. The predictable irony is they weren’t saving lives at all — just making you miserable and poorer in return for nothing.

The past year should be a humbling experience for humanity, or at least our leaders. We were faced with a problem that didn’t come with an answer at the back of the book, and we flunked it.

Why did we fail? The answer is a vice the ancient Greeks understood well: Hubris. Our leaders believed that nature could be controlled from a government office, and that humanity could be micromanaged like a particularly large game of “SimCity.”

When the virus was still limited in scope, they demanded the borders stay open and the flights keep flying. Then they told everyone to go out and party for the Chinese New Year. In Italy, people were told to hug a Chinese person to prove they weren’t a racist.

When the virus was still far off, they dismissed measures that could stop it as unnecessary or bigoted, and somehow being proven wrong only made them more confident. Once the virus broke containment and spread everywhere, there was no talk of reasonable mitigation: Instead, we were going to stop this virus in its tracks with overwhelming force.

In the end, we didn’t crush the virus, but we did crush a lot of ordinary people.

Over our history, we’ve gotten pretty used to this kind of hubris. It’s the arrogance that believes common sense and time-tested policies can be thrown out as leaders chase utopias. It’s the arrogance that makes men think they can shape the economy and tax and spend without inflation.

It’s the arrogance that makes men think they can install a republic in countries that lack a middle class or a Western and Judeo-Christian tradition of individual liberty. It’s the arrogance that makes men think they can maintain a republic in a West that’s gutted its middle class and banished its Western, Judeo-Christian moral code.

It’s the arrogance that causes people every generation to decide they won’t be held back by dusty old wisdom and tradition, and it’s the arrogance we see playing out every day on our city’s streets, where violent crimes threaten citizens’ lives and property.

Believe it or not, 70 years ago society had mostly figured out crime. They knew to be quick, efficient, and consistent in punishing criminal acts; to never cede territory to gangs; to never let breaking the law become the norm; and to never let dangerous mobs destroy at will.

Then social reformers got ideas: They decided the system was too punitive, too biased against the poor, so they started to tinker. Few still remember, but from 1950 through the early 1970s America’s criminal justice system outside the South became one of the most lenient in the world.

According to the most recent data, Sweden and Denmark both have 68 prisoners per 100,000 people. In 1972 Massachusetts had 32 prisoners per 100,000 people. Illinois had 50. Even New York state, fresh off the race riots of 1967 and the Martin Luther King assassination riots the following year, had only 64 prisoners per 100,000 people. That same year, New York City had almost 1,700 murders, yet the state had fewer people in prison per capita than Sweden does today.

America was lenient on crime, so crime exploded. It took decades to undo the damage, and required expanding police forces and building a much larger prison system than the one reformers had wanted so badly to dismantle in the 1950s, but it worked: Crime rates fell and our cities became livable again.

Instead of studying this lesson, our leaders want to make all the same mistakes of half a century ago, and last year they gave it a trial run. We saw what happened: Shootings exploded, murders went up 20 percent or more. In spite of it all, our policy makers are only getting bolder — and no amount of failure deters them.

When our leaders set out to solve the virus, they instead wrecked our children and teenagers in school, closed sports and glued already-addicted children to screens, delayed the studies of college students, and retarded the life-skills and development of young people entering the job market. They rolled out tests for their welfare-for-everyone plans, hobbled business owners in hiring people back, and hooked a large part of a generation on massive handouts.

They used judges’ benches to take over elections and decreed ridiculous pro-fraud, anti-enforcement rules. They forced our sick and our elderly to die alone so they wouldn’t get COVID, refused our right to bury and mourn our loved ones, sent sick patients into nursing homes then barred children from holding mom’s hand while she slipped away.

They arrested church leaders, closed temple doors, and enthroned a new moral leadership under Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control. They sold their efforts as neighborly affection and caring, but did neighborhoods and communities become more caring? Or did vicious, suspicious and frightened people begin to call police and report on banned activity?

Just as with any system, there are winners and there are losers: Grandma didn’t get a funeral but the activists and Democratic politicians got to attend three for George Floyd. Worshipping God had to go virtual, but activists and rioters worshipping critical race theory and its new martyrs packed our streets, ransacked our cities, looted and burned our already struggling businesses, and killed dozens of innocent people.

Jeff Bezos and his friends got a whole lot richer and a whole lot more powerful.

As we now know, all of the tyranny and sadness and suffering and hubris brought us absolutely nothing but more tyranny, sadness, suffering, and hubris. They didn’t control disease — how could they? But if it can be believed, all that was not their craziest plan for America: Having completely failed to control disease, they’ve set their sights (and their newly enthroned scientific bureaucracy) literally higher — on the global climate.

It’s the perfect crisis, so large and global in scope that fixing it requires empowering government bureaucrats totally and perpetually — and giving them absolute mastery over the direction of our lives from the cradle to the compost heap.

President Joe Biden’s administration set about this new agenda right away when he took office, and began by trying to unilaterally halt all new oil and gas leases in America, canceling a whole sector of the U.S. economy for “climate.” They rejoined the Paris Climate Accords and are pledging to cut America’s carbon emissions 50 percent below 2005 totals by 2030 — a number their activists already claim isn’t enough to save the planet.

In The New York Times last week, Ezra Klein hosted a round table with several thinkers about what is to be done. Sci-fi novelist Kim Stanley Robinson said the oil industry will have to be abolished totally and completely. Scientist Saul Griffith said that our notions of property and ownership will have to die to save the planet. Democracy itself might have to go.

In a 2019 essay for Foreign Policy, Cambridge University professor David Runciman said, “Democracy is the planet’s biggest enemy,” and suggested that an authoritarian Chinese one-party system might be the only one capable of tackling climate change. The New York Times’ Tom Friedman has pondered much the same: A one-party system with people like Friedman and Runciman in charge.

We’re told that maybe even the very idea of what it is to be human has to change for the climate. A video from 2016 that went viral last week shows bioethicist S. Matthew Liao speculating that maybe we can get humans to stop eating meat if we forcibly engineer all of them to have a meat allergy.

The famous economist Friedrich Hayek saw communism and Nazism, and he saw a connection between their schemes and so many others, including those that were obviously evil and those that seemed more benign and good-intentioned. He called it “the fatal conceit:” the idea “that man is able to shape the world around him according to his wishes.”

It’s no different from the sin identified by the Greeks, the Christians, and the Founding Fathers. Hayek, like those before him, knew it was wrong, and he knew it was deadly. Like those who came before him, he was right — then and now.

Persecution Of Jack Phillips Shows 'Hate Crime' Laws End Free Speech,"Jack Phillips, a smiling grandfather from the Denver suburbs, is about to face the tenth year of unceasing high-stakes lawfare against his religious convictions. His only ambition was to combine his visual and culinary artistic talents in a business that serves Jesus, the Master. Masterpiece Cakeshop, with its artist’s palette logo, makes this clear.

But on July 19, 2012, a couple walked into his shop who would unleash the opening salvo of nine years of belligerent litigation. Colorado did not allow same-sex “marriage” at the time, but it had recently inserted the language of sexual orientation and gender identity into its 1957 civil rights law. Armed with their relationship certificate from Massachusetts, the leftist lobby behind this same-sex couple would soon see how powerful a weapon this bias-crime law was.

The first charge was filed in September 2012. It was argued all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where Masterpiece Cakeshop narrowly prevailed on June 4, 2018. Immediately, however, Autumn (formerly Adam) Scardina — who had been bombing Phillips with absurd email requests for months — filed a new charge, demanding he decorate a cake with transgender messages.

Within nine months, this case was dismissed by the Colorado Commission on Civil Rights. Without delay Scardina, an activist lawyer, sued in a private capacity. Last week, a Colorado judge leveled a $500 fine against Phillips. The amount is symbolic. The real game is the ongoing lawfare.

Once an artist puts his art on the market, do customers have the right to compel him to use those talents to convey any and every message? Can a consumer compel a Muslim artist to paint a mural that blasphemes Allah? Can an atheist be forced to create lyrics that glorify God? Can a Christian be forced to deny the deity of Christ?

The legal precedents preventing one person from forcing another to speak against his will are long-established and unassailable. So those prosecuting people like Phillips resort to legal contortions that twist the issue into something else. These contortions are three-fold.

Attacking Free Thought By Isolating the Target

First, they need to divide and conquer. So they single out conservative evangelicals as the targets of choice. Denying that secularism is also a religion, they pretend only conservative Christians have a religious conscience, ignoring Muslim bakers who share Masterpiece’s stance and bakers who have refused to bake Bible cakes.

Thus leftists have repeatedly targeted one of the very smallest of roughly 12 dozen bakeries in Colorado. This makes a mockery of equal treatment under the law, and it’s intended to minimize opposition by isolating the target from the support of those who share a common interest.

Atheists, agnostics, and non-evangelicals of all stripes should consider the cost of their silence on this issue. Even if the baker wins on the narrow grounds of “sincerely held religious belief,” it obliterates the underlying right of every citizen to speak his mind.

What if you simply think some politically correct idea is absurd? Should you be prohibited from acting on your belief simply because you lack a “religious” motive? If the First Amendment’s right to “free speech” is only valid when it is an “exercise of religion,” constitutional protections are denied to the non-religious. That should trouble everyone.

Minimizing Religious Convictions

Not only does the grievance machine swallow up free speech into the category of religious exercise, it narrows the question further. Invoking the constitutionally problematic Supreme Court decision from Employment Division v. Smith (1990), anti-free speech activists assert governments can infringe on the free exercise of religion so long as the infringement has “general applicability.”

Smith created such a furor Congress responded with the near-unanimous passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Yet today’s enemies of free speech despise RFRA and circumvent it whenever activist judges allow.

When Masterpiece won its case before the Supreme Court three years ago, the court left Colorado’s “Anti-Discrimination” Act (CADA) in force, simply objecting that the Colorado Civil Rights Commissioners had directly insulted Phillips’s faith in their proceedings. If the commission had stuck to approved talking points and refrained from voicing their bigoted opinions in a public meeting, the court might have upheld their religious infringements.

In like fashion, Chief Justice John Roberts recently penned a majority opinion upholding the religious freedoms of Catholic Social Services in Philadelphia, but not because the city forced religious institutions to act contrary to their core doctrines. Rather, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia hinged on a clause in the city’s policy that might allow for arbitrary exemptions. In so doing, the court telegraphed that if the city had only trampled religious freedom with no exemptions, their discrimination could pass constitutional muster.

Redefining Speech

The third tactic of the judicial assault on free speech is to reframe speech as an “action.” In Wyoming, we saw this contortion in the case of Circuit Court magistrate Ruth Neely. The Wyoming Supreme Court acknowledged her speech was constitutionally protected by both the Wyoming and U.S. constitutions. But the 3-2 majority nevertheless punished her speech under the bizarre claim that her words discussing marriage outside of court constituted a punishable act.

A similar twist was employed against Masterpiece Cakeshop. The bakery demonstrably serves all customers without discrimination. Phillips demonstrated plainly, under oath, the sole reason for denying one specific request was because he would not be exploited to personally express an idea alien to his understanding.

The judge in last week’s ruling even acknowledged the cake shop’s argument “that they did not decline Ms. Scardina’s request because of her transgender identity, but rather because of the cake’s message.” Nevertheless, through tortured logic, he decreed that he understood the cakeshop employees’ thinking better than they did.

Even ‘Victories’ Are Chipping Away Freedom

This is why so-called “bias-crime” and “hate-crime” legislation is so dangerous. It appoints non-elected judges, bureaucrats, and activist lawyers to read minds. With sole discretionary power to decide what a person is thinking, they can manufacture thought crimes.

The incessant lawfare against Masterpiece Cakeshop was enabled by the insertion of ambiguous bias-crime language into Colorado law. Many legislators who supported this change had no idea how it would be used as a cudgel to make a public example of an unknown baker.

If Masterpiece Cakeshop has accomplished nothing else, it has blown away the smoke of ignorance and made clear the caustic effect of “bias-crime” legislation. Such laws dissolve every constitutional protection they encounter — not only the free exercise enjoyed by religious people, but free speech for all.

Masterpiece’s never-ending saga should be read as a cautionary tale. The ambiguities inherent in bias-crime legislation are intentional. The goal is to destroy free speech not by winning discrete battles, but by winning a war of attrition. Now you know.

"When Stores Close Due To Rising Crime, Urban Blight Is Back","Six Target stores in San Francisco are adjusting their times, opening hours later and closing hours earlier to try to curtail soaring theft.

They join Walgreens, which has closed 17 stores over five years in direct response to criminal activity. Last month, a video went viral of a hooded and masked man riding his bike into a San Francisco branch of the chain, loading a trash bag with merchandise, and riding back out — past a powerless security guard and two others filming on their phones.

Early Monday evening, at least nine men and women smashed cases and stripped shelves in San Francisco’s high-end Neiman Marcus store, fleeing with a fortune in designer handbags. The brazenness is out of control, is goaded on by the normalization of masks, and is directly enabled by district attorneys and other politicians.

The Golden City is joined by nearby Sacramento and Los Angeles, where retail crime has spiked, but across the country as district attorneys from Massachusetts to Missouri to Texas have declared they won’t defend citizens from theft, the story has gone much the same.

While it’s insane that crime is so severe and law enforcement so nonexistent in a prosperous city that businesses must close their doors early or shut them entirely, there’s more in store. Far more ominous than a sign of how bad things have gotten, darkened windows and shuttered doors reveal just how much worse things are going to get.

In Washington, D.C., the Columbia Heights neighborhood struggled for years, mired in death, drugs, and the gangs that dealt freely in both. In 2004, when I moved to the city, it was changing but progress was slow. When our first group of friends moved there we knew when visiting that we would be unable to get a taxi to bring us home at the end of the night.

Then, after fighting to slowly bring commerce and foot traffic back, the neighborhood celebrated the opening of a Target superstore in 2008. The move, said then-Mayor Adrian Fenty, was “both the catalyst and the capstone to an unprecedented economic resurgence in Columbia Heights – where nearly $1 billion worth of new housing, retail and office space has moved through the development pipeline since 2001.”

Progress was sluggish but continued. There were robberies and murders, and even a gang war in the nearby projects, but the city worked to keep the remaining crime out of the papers because business was booming, condos were going up, and people were moving in.

In response to a retail rival’s possible move to the city, Target opened a grocery store in 2010, pushing along competition in a city where neighborhoods with high crime are also neighborhoods with no grocery stores. While activist reformers try to blame discrimination, in a business with slim margins, theft means bankruptcy. In Columbia Heights, things were safe enough to grow — and rich and poor alike benefitted.

Just as opening a retail business or a restaurant works to revitalize a neighborhood, a closure is a deathly sign of decline. While bright windows, visiting shoppers, and neighborhood jobs bring safety, vacant retail, with its boarded-up windows, graffiti, uncleaned sidewalks, and ugliness brings crime.

A University of Southern California study found that even with temporary closures, “The area immediately around a closed restaurant experienced an increase in property crime and theft from vehicles.”

“Furthermore,” the authors wrote in a Harvard Business Review article, “this increase in crime disappeared as soon as the restaurant reopened.”

There aren’t a lot of studies on this important matter, but our understanding of it goes back decades.

The elites of urban planning didn’t take the criticism well, when Jane Jacobs released her 1961 classic, “The Death And Life Of Great American Cities,” dismissing the author as a simple “housewife” uneducated in their schemes. Undeterred, one concept she famously developed was the “eyes on the street” theory of crime prevention, where she suggested mixed-use neighborhoods bring safety and vibrancy to city living.

Jacobs saw that those parks surrounded only by office buildings became a destination for criminals when the offices closed for the night and everyone with a legitimate reason to be there went home. She compared these with parks in mixed-use neighborhoods, where the diversity might include early morning coffee shops, offices, retail, homes, and the evening’s bars.

Mixed-use neighborhoods saw people on legal business at nearly all hours, and she saw the safety and vibrancy that brought with it. You could have all the pretty parks you like, she found, but in the end it is the neighborhood that confers “the boon of life and appreciation” on them — not the other way around.

Her critics pointed out that she didn’t have any degrees in urban planning, and that was true: She was a reporter, wife, and mother raising her three kids with her husband in the city. But Jacobs didn’t need a degree from some college to look out her window, see if it was safe or not, and observe why. She was right, and along with “broken windows theory” and a number of others, hard-headed reformers beat back the elites and made American safe again — for a time.

More than 50 years later, over-credentialed activists and politicians once again say they know better, and tell us our neighborhoods will be more just and “equitable” if we don’t enforce laws. Now business owners are telling those politicians they’ll need to close their doors. Residents are left to feel the pain of both the crime and the closures. The boon of life and appreciation is suffocating.

Crime begets crime begets crime, and changes to enforcement and prosecution policies are entirely to blame. In nearby Oakland, where murder is up 90 percent in the past year and car-jackings up 88 percent while the city council continues to cut police, city leaders dismiss the surge in crime as “a bump in the road,” but for the people who live there, strive to work there, and try to not be murdered there, it’s more than that. As with Jane Jacobs, you don’t need a degree to know it.

Rising crime is a direct threat to our towns, our neighborhoods, and our families. Already in great American cities, urban blight is setting in. We’ve down this path before for virtually the exact same bleeding-heart reasons, and we lived through the tremendous pain it brought. We cannot let it happen again — unless we do.

Yet Another UChicago Student Was Brutally Murdered By A Stray Bullet,"One of my University of Chicago peers was viciously murdered on Thursday by a stray bullet on a Chicago Green Line CTA elevated train. Like countless other UChicago students, Max Lewis was traveling home after his summer internship downtown, when a bullet came through the train window and struck him in the neck. Lewis passed away after being taken off life support on Sunday. He was 20 years old.

As a rising junior at the University of Chicago, Lewis was excelling. Reading about Lewis’s life, he sounds like the type of person we all hope to be—full of joy, surrounded by friends, and excited for his promising future. He was living in Chicago for the summer to complete a prestigious investment banking internship.

Lewis didn’t have to work in person, but he was such a friendly, dedicated individual that he chose to make the trek downtown. His young life was senselessly cut short when his train ride home was interrupted by yet another Chicago shooting.

According to the police, Lewis was not the intended target of the attack. The case is still being investigated, and no arrests have been made.

""We were crying with the families of other victims of gun violence a the hospital. This is another senseless loss."" University of Chicago student Max Lewis was shot and killed by a stray bullet on the CTA Green Line. More from his loved ones at 5 &6 @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/DOfV560tNk — Megan Hickey (@MeganHickeyTV) July 5, 2021

""He loved working hard for other people because he was so damn selfless. And he never wanted people to thank him for what he did,"" said one friend of Max Lewis. https://t.co/PvQwOoJRA8 — Chicago Sun-Times (@Suntimes) July 6, 2021

“Max was a talented student and beloved campus leader and friend who will be greatly missed,” UChicago stated in a university-wide email. “He was pursuing a double major in economics and computer science, treasurer of the Promontory Investment Research RSO, president of the fraternity AEPi, and actively involved in the student community on campus.”

When reflecting on the loss of his friend and fraternity brother, Zachary Cogan rightly slammed Chicago’s inexcusable violence. “This happens all the time in Chicago,” he emphasized to the Chicago Sun-Times. “It needs to end.”

Cogan wasn’t exaggerating. Lewis is the second UChicago student this year to have his bright future cut short by a deadly shooting in Lightfoot’s lawless city. After receiving a bachelor’s degree at Peking University and a master’s at the University of Cambridge, Yiran Fan was a fourth-year Ph.D. at UChicago. He’d spent his life traveling the world to pursue academics, only to be gunned down in a South Side parking garage in January. He was 30 years old.

Chicago Violence Is Out Of Control

Violence consumes Chicago. During the Fourth of July weekend, more than 90 people were shot in the city, including a 6-year-old girl and her mother, two police officers, and a group of six individuals. Between late Friday afternoon and Monday evening, at least 16 people were murdered in shootings, while two were “fatally stabbed.”

The list of victims is long. A member of the National Guard was murdered in Chicago while leaving a house party. At a mere 19 years old, he was on temporary leave from his basic training, before he was murdered in cold blood. “He was fighting for our country,” his sister said. “He comes to Chicago, and he gets killed in the streets.”

Four children under the age of 14 were also injured in shootings. A 67-year-old man died after being stabbed on a CTA bus. Meanwhile, the city became even more volatile, as “hundreds of young people and Chicago police officers flooded the Loop on Sunday, sometimes clashing while fireworks exploded and some dumpsters caught fire.”

Lightfoot’s city is falling to pieces, but she refuses to effectively address the problem. During a recent press conference, she made the absurd assertion that Chicago “crime is on the decline.”

“All of our major indices show a decline in our crime, and our homicides and our shootings year over year are down,” she claimed. This is such a blatant lie that it’s offensive Lightfoot thinks her fellow Chicagoans are dumb enough to fall for it. We aren’t.

According to NBC News, Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown says “Homicides are up by 5 percent and shootings are up by 17 percent this year compared to the same period last year.” As of mid-June, the Chicago Sun Times reports that 195 more people have been shot in Chicago in 2021 than in 2020, reaching a total of 1,587. This count doesn’t include the 90-plus victims like Lewis who have been viciously attacked since then.

Brown also says criminals are being released and—wait for it—committing more crimes. Imagine that: when Lightfoot fails to hold criminals accountable, they’re emboldened to keep terrorizing her city.

My Leftist Peers Still Want to Abolish the Police

As if leftist radicals’ response to Chicago’s surging crime rates couldn’t get any dumber, members of my university’s incoming student government plan to “work toward the disarming, defunding, and abolition of [the University of Chicago’s Police Department (UCPD)] by amplifying the work of groups such as CareNotCops.”

As a majority black and Hispanic police force, the University of Chicago’s Police Department (UCPD) is the “primary police agency” on UChicago’s campus. If it weren’t for the bravery and dedication of the UCPD, I wouldn’t be safe crossing campus, and my parents wouldn’t allow me to live in the city.

CareNotCops, in contrast, is an extremist campaign dedicated to eradicating the UCPD. Among other endeavors, it’s self-described as “demand[ing] that UChicago end their continued harm on the South Side of Chicago by abolishing the UCPD.”

Last August, CareNotCops staged a week-long occupation outside Provost Ka Yee Lee’s house. Using a megaphone, one of the occupation’s organizers led a group chant, shouting “racist -ss cops.” CareNotCops also organized a January teach-in to discuss eradicating the police. And the campaign continues to promote hatred toward law enforcement. During a May retreat, more than 200 students and community members gathered to “creat[e] art.” Such “art” included a large sign that said, “Cops off campus, cops off earth.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CPY1StchBh4/

Unsurprisingly, the CareNotCops social media accounts are active, but they’ve failed to mention Lewis’s death. Apparently, our peer’s demise doesn’t fit their narrative.

Chicagoans Deserve Better

The tragedy, of course, is that Chicago isn’t just Lightfoot’s city. Nor is it the playground for another CHAZ-inspired fairytale gone wrong. Chicago is home to almost three million Chicagoans, including me.

This home is jeopardized when our incompetent mayor fails to keep criminals off the streets and lies to her constituents. “CareNotCops” exacerbates the problem by prioritizing hateful, childish sloganeering over law and order.

I’ve ridden the CTA countless times. When my friends and I board the train, we shouldn’t fear that we’ll be murdered by stray bullets. When we sit down on the bus, we shouldn’t worry that we’ll be knifed to death. That’s absurd.

Thanks to the incompetence of Lightfoot, this lunacy has become a reality. And if CareNotCops and my incoming student government representatives succeed in defunding the UCPD, the violence will continue to soar.

Beyond my parents and younger brother, UChicago is the only community in which I’ve ever felt truly at home. But, a home is not a home when you’re terrified for your life. Lightfoot and the CareNotCops organizers should be ashamed of themselves. Our city deserves so much better.

In Lewis’s honor, his fraternity launched a GoFundMe to raise money to transport his friends to the funeral in his hometown of Denver, Colorado. The remainder of the funds will go toward charity.

“Max was an intelligent, caring, compassionate member of the UChicago community and a dear friend to many,” the GoFundMe page reads. “He is known amongst friends, peers, and classmates for his kindness, goofiness, grit, impeccable work ethic, and most importantly, his unfailingly genuine soul.” Speaking for the entire community, the page says Lewis “will be sorely missed.”

WATCH: Anti-Police Protesters Disrupt Families Mourning Victims Of Violent Crima,"Video footage shows white, police-hating protesters disrupting black families mourning their dead at a police-sponsored “Stand up for a Safe Oakland” rally in Oakland, California on Saturday. According to the clips, the mourners were infuriated at being infiltrated by radical outsiders.

Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong organized the “Stand up for a Safe Oakland” rally in response to Oakland’s surging crime, because he and his community “cannot sit silent anymore.” During the rally, Oakland residents gathered at Lake Merritt’s Amphitheater to mourn lost community members, as well as to demand an end to the city’s rising violence.

Rather than join Armstrong’s rally, the “Anti-Police Terror Project” held a separate event with community groups on Saturday (though the group claims it made its plans prior to learning of Armstrong’s).

Meanwhile, protesters simultaneously disrupted the event organized by Armstrong. Lee Fang and AntifaWatch say these protesters were members of Antifa, though a spokesman for the Oakland Police Department was unable to confirm whether this was the case or not.

“Surreal moment in Oakland. About 200 mostly black families rally with police to call for an end to the epidemic of gun violence. Mothers at the stage mourning recently murdered children. In the back, less than a dozen mostly white antifa protesters assembled to jeer them,” Investigative journalist at the Intercept, Lee Fang, tweeted.

AntifaWatch reported that “Several #Antifa, who appear to be all white, showed up to ‘protest’ by drowning out mostly black speakers who were naming and remembering homicide victims.”

The protesters held signs with messages like “F-ck OCP” and “Quit your job, kkkop!,” as they shouted with local community members who were gathered to mourn their lost neighbors.

“A white privilege is standing here! You think you have a right to be here — you don’t have a right to be here!” an Oakland resident shouted at the protesters. “Not when black children are dying in the street everyday!” a second woman agreed.

Supporters of the event vehemently pushed back against the protesters’ suggestions that police are the villains. The mourners didn’t want to condemn police officers. They wanted to promote law and order.

“We’re talking about right now. What do you have against safety in Oakland? What do you have against stopping the violence?” a mourning Oakland resident asked the protesters.

“Why are you trying to disrupt something that’s trying to be positive? […] We’re trying to save our people!” the same Oakland resident continued. “We’re trying to save our people!” he repeated. “You are not our people! Get the f-ck out!”

""Black children are dying in the street every day."" ANTIFA: ""Yeah, at the hands of the police."" ""NO!"" ""That's a lie. There are not hundreds of people dead at the hands of police this year."" ""We're trying to save our people. You are not our people. Get the f*ck out!"" https://t.co/bXFgq3sRPf — Vince Coglianese (@VinceCoglianese) July 12, 2021

Armstrong’s event came as crime in Oakland continues to surge. Armstrong himself recently reported that his city is experiencing an approximately 90 percent increase in murders, 70 percent increase in shootings, and 88 percent increase in carjackings.

His goal in facilitating the event was to inspire a multi-pronged approach to fighting crime. Attendees marched from the amphitheater to the location where eight individuals were shot on Juneteenth. And the event included a coffin display with 71 white flowers, representative of the 71 members of the Oakland community who have been murdered in Oakland so far this year. Most of the attendees also wore white t-shirts with the phrase “#SAFEOAKLAND.”

“We continue to see shootings every night in the city,” Armstrong said. “It is time we come together and we unite behind reducing gun violence in the city of Oakland.”

“There are people in our community who don’t feel safe. There are seniors in our community who cannot come out at night. There are young, African-American men and Latino men that are at risk in our city. We have to come together; this is not about politics, this is about saving lives,” Armstrong continued.

Armstrong recently made headlines when he slammed Oakland’s City Council for defunding the police department by nearly $18 million. Since money has been diverted from the police budget to “social services aimed at violence prevention,” he says the community needs to become more actively involved in crime reduction.

Oakland resident Carol Wyatt agreed, saying her city “cannot move past the burials, the memorials and the wakes.” “Gun violence is our community’s longtime pandemic,” she lamented.

“We need your help — we need everyone’s help — because we want this to be the safest Oakland that we can possibly make it,” Brenda Grisham said. Her 17-year-old son was shot and murdered in Oakland in 2010. Grisham says “It’s on all of us to build a safer city.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/12/anti-police-protesters-disrupt-black-families-mourning-victims-of-violent-crime-in-oakland/,2021-07-12
Why Communism Should Be Tried For Its Crimes Against Humanity,"Cubans have been marching in the streets for freedom, chanting “Libertad!” and demonstrating by the thousands that they’ve had enough of the sham called communism. They know economic disaster and political repression come with that territory.

Yet today we’re peering through Alice’s looking glass as we watch these events unfold. Everything is backwards. Elites in the U.S. government, media, and Big Tech seem to be taking the side of the communist authorities who are clamping down on the protests, Soviet-style. Some journalists and Twitter have spun the idea that Cubans are taking to the streets mostly because of a desire for more awareness of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Please.

There’s always hell to pay whenever you allow too much power into the hands of too few people. That’s the story of communism, in a nutshell. It’s a totalitarian system in which a little clique of elites has absolute power to dictate to everybody what they may say, how they may act, what goods and services they may receive, and with whom they may associate. In a word, communism is state-run slavery.

The elites who push it stop at nothing to maintain their power. So it shouldn’t surprise us that communist regimes have murdered 100 million people in the twentieth century. That’s probably a gross underestimate, but you get the picture. It’s summed up well in Professor R.J. Rummel’s opening words to his book, “Death by Government”: “Power kills; absolute power kills absolutely.”

It’s tragic that the free world has never held the lethal ideology of communism accountable for its crimes against humanity. Worse, the ideology is making a comeback, mindlessly promoted and celebrated, often by American youth who have never been taught to know better.

Identity politics (especially in the form of critical race theory,) mob rule, and censorship enforced by Big Tech in America today are the same tools communist regimes have always used to enforce their utopian schemes. If more of us recognized the ideology as the murderous perversion that it is and understood how its tools pave the path to oppression, we’d be more vigilant. But how might we build such awareness?

We Need a Nuremberg Trial for Communism

The whole world united to discredit National Socialism immediately after World War II. In a trial in Nuremberg, Germany in 1946, Nazis had to answer for their horrific crimes against humanity, which resulted in the deaths of 11 million people, including six million Jews. Yet despite more than 100 million murders, the victims of communism have never come together in a similar condemnation of communism.

This failure may stem in part from mixed messages the public got from the original Nuremberg trials themselves. The allied powers of World War II—including the Soviet Union—served as prosecutors at Nuremberg. That meant a communist nation could pretend at Nuremberg to stand with the West for human rights, even though its methods of “governance” were virtually indistinguishable from those of fascists: a harsh surveillance culture, no free expression, a war on private life, gulag camps for political prisoners, mass killings of minorities. Don’t forget, either, that Joseph Stalin was aligned with Adolf Hitler for the first two years of World War II.

Nor have the crimes of communist China ever been called to account. Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution resulted in the brutal deaths of tens of millions of Chinese. Although many today see China as a sort of state capitalist/communist hybrid, all of the communist tools and techniques to suppress political opposition and repress cultural minorities remain in place there.

Slave labor and concentration camps remain. Speech is strictly controlled. A sophisticated social credit system controls every aspect of life of every private citizen in China. Nor have communist regimes, including those of pre-1989 Eastern Europe, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela, been held accountable for their crimes against humanity.

And in the West? Powerful apologists throughout the world, especially in media, academia, the corporate world, and Big Tech have enabled the cover-up of such crimes. This, in turn, has led to the rise of far-left sentiments in the United States and the West, unchecked by recognition of communism’s crimes.

The Case for a Nuremberg for Communism

Vladimir Bukovsky (d. 2019,) a preeminent leader of the Soviet dissident movement, was the driving force for putting the ideology of communism in a Nuremberg-like dock for the whole world to judge. He felt for decades that all needed to witness such an accounting for communism’s horrific crimes and genocides.

Bukovsky himself suffered 12 years as a political prisoner confined to psychiatric prison-hospitals and gulag prison camps in the Soviet Union. His 1976 deportation to the West, arranged through a prisoner exchange, brought him the freedom to publish his book, “Judgment in Moscow: Soviet Crimes and Western Complicity.”

Bukovsky’s initiative for a Nuremberg for Communism lay fallow until Renato Cristin, a philosophy professor at the University of Trieste, proposed they write an appeal and petition that could be circulated throughout the world, to leaders, journalists, and concerned citizens alike. Bukovsky signed on to the initiative they intended to launch on November 9, 2019, the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. But Bukovsky died suddenly just two weeks prior.

Their appeal emphasizes that, unlike the trials of individual Nazi officials at Nuremberg in 1946, the ideology of communism itself must be put on trial. This is not because most of the biggest players of the 20th century, such as Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and their top-level cohorts are long dead. Indeed, dictators today wear their mantles.

But, unlike the situation with the Nazis, communism has had more than 100 years to march through our institutions worldwide. Few understand that communism, just like fascism, fights for total control over all human beings and their private lives. As Bukovsky stated, it is “a cancer on the body of the human race.” And it’s gone unchallenged for too long.

Today we are faced with a “New Iron Curtain,” an internal front, or an internal split within the West itself. This “brings the enemy of the West right into our institutional, cultural, and even our mental world, disrupting us, weakening us” and creating chaos in order to generate power vacuums it can then fill.

The New Iron Curtain comes to us in the form of political correctness, identity politics, mob rule, and nonstop propaganda on the internet, all of which serve to manipulate every individual emotionally and psychologically. Communism’s warfare today is at least 90 percent psychological. And most people are not psychologically equipped to engage with this onslaught, especially vulnerable youth who are targeted with the full alliance of its “progressive” column in the West.

What Would a Nuremberg for Communism Look Like?

Even though a trial couldn’t be a courtroom drama like the one that took place at Nuremberg in 1946, the toxins spread by communism need an equally deep reckoning that clarifies what the ideology does to people and how it destroys lives and freedom. In short, we need a moral renewal.

To do that, Bukovsky and Cristin see a public “trial” for communism that might be developed along three closely related tracks of action, in which all could participate in some way. We might call those tracks reflection, investigation, and condemnation.

First, the world must reflect on how communism has affected our lives and how it marched through all of our institutions, infiltrating them with its intolerance for freedom. We would need to examine how communism subverted education, the media, courts, the arts, popular culture, legislatures, psychiatry, the corporate world, the military, churches, and more.

Second, a legal and historical line of argument would have to methodically examine communism’s specific crimes against humanity. Historians and legal scholars would document the crimes and the costs in human lives.

The list of communism’s atrocities is long. It includes the deliberate starving of about seven million peasants under Stalin’s forced collectivization in the winter of 1932-33 and the wholesale reign of terror Mao unleashed during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976.) Everyone ought to hear witnesses who verify what happens in Communism’s legacy of gulags, slave labor camps, and psychiatric prison-hospitals.

Third, there must be political and institutional work in which legislative bodies of nations condemn the ideology of communism on moral grounds. The European Parliament actually passed such a resolution in September 2019, historically equating communism with National Socialism. Predictably, leftists were aghast. But this is the sort of work that must persist. Resolutions condemning communism could be generated at various levels of government worldwide, including by states and municipalities, just as has been done in recognizing the Armenian genocide. Corporations and other entities could add their voices as well.

Can any of this happen? Many outlets for this work could be used, including events, conferences, papers, and legislation, and each track builds on and supports the others. People who have survived communist regimes could help through their vocal support and determined action. High-profile media and cultural figures speaking out could also make an enormous difference. Of course, you can help too, by signing the appeal.

But, whether we pursue this “Nuremberg appeal” or not, we have no choice but to try to make such a public reckoning happen. We are in a war today that we must fight and win if we want to live in a world in which freedom is preserved.

A Reckoning Could Help Us Wake Up from Wokeness

The fact that apologies for Communist China have become radical chic in America should alarm us. Some of the biggest offenders include the NBA, America’s corporate media, Nike, Disney, and tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, et al. They are joined by the Democrat Party and its media lackeys.

Their support for that regime serves to promote the imprisonment of the Uighur population in concentration camps. Nike, for example, has a supply chain that’s interwoven with Uighur slave labor in China. Apologists cooperate with China’s censorship policies, boost the Chinese government’s oppression of religious minorities, and aid China’s clampdown against freedom in Hong Kong.

But hopeful signs are visible also. We should be heartened to see survivors of communist systems warning Americans that the toxic ideology they escaped is now at our doorstep.

Xi Van Fleet, a mother who lived through the nightmare of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, recently warned the Loudoun County, Virginia school board about critical race theory. It’s the same sort of coercive thought reform she saw used in that reign of terror to divide people, characterized by “struggle sessions,” the use of concepts like “white privilege” to sow social distrust, and intense social pressure to conform or be canceled.

We should also find encouragement in Arizona’s recent legislation that would have victims of communism tell their stories in public schools. This would greatly balance today’s one-sided narratives hostile to America, narratives meant only to serve the social engineering agendas of educrats and the media. American children would learn what it’s actually like to live under totalitarianism.

All Americans need to learn what is at stake. Communism is not a harmless ideology that simply claims to work for equality and justice. It’s a deceptive front that aims to abolish all private life along with private property. The deep truth is that in communism you personally become the private property of the state.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/16/why-communism-should-be-tried-for-its-crimes-against-humanity/,2021-07-16
Why Is Violent Crime In DC Soaring? The Reason Is One Muriel Bowser,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Our town’s baseball team made national news this weekend — but it wasn’t for a win. Video, aired across the country, showed players and fans running for cover and diving into dugouts with their friends and families.

Gunshots, we quickly learned, had been fired outside, wounding three, including a fan. At that moment, they had echoed throughout the stadium and seemed to some to have come from inside.

As fans streaked out, a man in a sportscar took advantage of the situation, doing donuts in the middle of the busy intersection. Police were nowhere to be seen.

We need serious help down here. As if the shooting wasn’t enough, this idiot is doing doughnuts down in @TheYardsDC , with police mere blocks away. #anc6d07 #navyyard @DCPoliceDept @charlesallen pic.twitter.com/Y41h8OlsvZ — Edward Daniels (@EdwardDaniels) July 18, 2021

It was a national embarrassment for Mayor Muriel Bowser, the most progressive mayor in the District of Columbia’s history and, relatedly, the person who has overseen the total reversal of our hard-fought, declining crime rate.

The Nationals’ game was by far the most widely seen incident, but it was not remotely the saddest day of our city’s weekend. The night before, a shooting in a poor and largely black neighborhood just across the river, Congressional Heights, left a six-year-old girl dead. She’d been walking home with her parents and her older sister when people passing by in a car opened fire. When it was over, her mother lay wounded next to her daughter, along with three others.

Pictures posted by her family show a big, broad smile and braided hair just like her grandmother’s. It’s near impossible to hold back tears when you see her beautiful, innocent, young face.

Crime in this neighborhood has exploded as well. The overgrown and neglected park nearby was no longer a family-friendly place, and playing children had been replaced by drug users and other criminals. Pleas to the city to clean up the neighborhood had gone unheeded. The morning after the shooting, all that changed, and a local woman recorded truck after truck of city crews descending on the park to clean it up for the news cameras.

“So the city wants to act like they’re doing something when the cameras are about to come to the neighborhood?” she asked, narrating the video. “They have dump trucks, they have all the city people cleaning up the park. We’ve been asking for going to clean up this park this whole time and they want to send somebody now because the news is coming.”

I walked up to the site where the 6 year old was murdered and I saw the @USDOI @NationalMallNPS cleaning up the park ONLY because the Mayor and tv cameras are coming!!! @MayorBowser THIS IS ALL UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP!! Y’all! We need to hold them accountable!! Vote her out!!! pic.twitter.com/zzAyHxXEcu — Dougie Fresh ⚜️ (@IrshQtip) July 17, 2021

“Let [Bowser] do her press conference in the filth we live in everyday!!!” a local member of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission tweeted.

Just as in other Democratic cities across the country, violent crime in the nation’s capital is rising dramatically. The trends, worrisome to begin with, have accelerated as progressive voters and politicians have decriminalized drugs, abided public camping, done away with bail, closed public schools, and launched a concentrated attack on their own police officers.

The combination has thoroughly crushed cop morale, and today D.C. police complain of accelerated retirements and terrible recruiting leading to grueling overtime and undermanned shifts and patrols. One neighborhood police officer told us the city council had actually refused to open positions at the police academy.

And why would someone join the force right now? Why wouldn’t officers retire early? Ask nearly any cop you know from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and they’ll tell you don’t do it. “I told my son not to follow in my footsteps,” one longtime Cape Cod drug officer told me. “I couldn’t wait to retire.”

Meanwhile, the corporate media that worked to get these progressive politicians elected and then cheered their “police reforms” is completely perplexed. “Mayors,” The Washington Post claims, “see few options for regaining control.” Really?

That’s a lie, of course: It’s obvious how to regain control. There hasn’t been a spike in bad guys who own gun stores, as President Joe Biden claims, and bullets don’t fall from the sky anyway. There are causes, and one that adds to everything else going wrong is the refusal of politicians and woke U.S. attorneys to prosecute criminals.

This spring, for example, the city in its wisdom decided to empty a women’s shelter in Chinatown and replace it with a shelter for men. Obviously, crime increased dramatically while public sanitation plummeted. When the local community complained, police made arrests and order returned. But then a surprising advocate for criminals and public disorder hit the scene: U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Channing D. Phillips.

“At a local ANC meeting this past month, police representatives informed us that despite their success in arresting those who have been dealing hard narcotics to the homeless men at the shelter, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for D.C. is refusing to prosecute the cases for lack of resources/evidence,” Father Vincent De Rosa, a local Catholic priest and advocate for the poor, wrote to parishioners.

Further, it was suggested that lack of political will among our local D.C. leaders makes it impossible for the [D.C. police] to activate necessary resources to build stronger cases against the dealers with evidence that even the federal authorities cannot ignore. I hope you will prayerfully consider writing to the US Attorney’s Office for D.C., urging them the prosecute those who would prey on the weakest and most needy among us. Our city’s Herculean efforts to improve housing and reduce homelessness should not be hampered by the presence of narcotics among the homeless.

The story checks out. While riots rocked D.C. for the entirety of Donald Trump’s presidency, starting on his first day in office, hundreds and hundreds of violent participants were let go by prosecutors unwilling to do their duty.

Instead of prosecuting, this summer the mayor dedicated the public road in front of the White House — some of the most valuable and visible commercial real estate in the world — to Black Lives Matter, the organization responsible for much of the 2020 rioting. Unsurprisingly, businesses suffered as the square became a squalid home for garbage and drugs. Completely expectedly, order suffered as the square became a launching pad for riots against the White House and its guests.

Lafayette Park is not alone. Public homeless tent encampments are everywhere in D.C., filling our parks and making a mockery of our public green spaces. Union Station is overrun with junkies and violently insane people.

In D.C. today, women passing these camps have been especially targeted with harassment. It’s common now for our college-aged interns to report screams, swears, and projectiles hurled their way just outside their dorm — on a main thoroughfare of the city, mere blocks from the Capitol.

It’s not just drug addicts and rioters who escape prosecution. Earlier this month, three teenage girls tased a man in an attempted car-jacking. One of the girls was 12, one was 14 and one was 16. The police are only pursuing charges against the 12-year-old (who used the Taser) over the violent attack and invasion. The older girls, who almost undoubtedly put the child up to it and who took part in the crime, walked away.

They almost might as well have. Even when D.C. claims to “throw the book” at violent juvenile criminals, it’s a joke. When two teenage girls brutally murdered an elderly immigrant trying to feed his family, crushing his head against a pole while stealing the car he used for his livelihood (and showing more concern for their missing phone than the murdered man), they got “the maximum sentence.”

Want to know what that was? They’ll be released when they’re 21.

“Welcome to Washington, D.C. where violent crime permeates everything.” the city’s police union tweeted Sunday morning. “It is a tragedy that elected officials won’t let us do our jobs.”

In response, the city’s chapter of Black Lives Matter called the head of the union “a raging right wing extremist leading a campaign to fight for cops to keep brutalizing and killing black people and then blaming it those black people while being unable to stop the violence they fuel.”

And on July 12 — the same day the city and its prosecutor decided not to pursue charges against those 14 and 16-year-old car-jackers — Mayor Muriel Bowser went to the White House to ask the president for his help in solving violent crime in D.C.

Really? We’re to believe “mayors see few options for regaining control” of the cities they run?

Her voters might think differently.

D.C. 911 Dispatch Faces Staffing Crisis Amid Surging Violent Crime Spree,"Washington D.C.’s 911 center is faced with a severe staffing shortage as violent crime surges in the nation’s capital.

Last week, only 50 percent staff availability led the emergency agency’s interim director, Cleo Subido, to implement mandatory overtime, as first reported by STATter911.

“We are committed to following the rules and being transparent about it,” Subido wrote to employees. “Anything that gets in the way of us improving performance, treating each other with respect, providing our responders and constituents with the care they deserve, or meeting the objectives of our mission — I will handle without delay.”

(2) With the exception of @AugensteinWTOP no news media is covering DC 911's crisis where:

• 911 can't meet minimum staffing because half the work force isn't available

• Only 35% of staff vaccinated

• Part of the work force defies orders in place to better manage 911 (more) pic.twitter.com/dITlFSw4Ol — Dave Statter (@STATter911) July 23, 2021

The staffing shortage is a product of employees on a combination of family leave, personal leave, and sick leave, causing a crisis in the emergency department unable to meet its goals of public safety.

Subido however, also took issue with employees slacking on the job.

“Currently, the District is paying us for 12 hours and we are plugged into the radio for less than seven hours for the most part,” she wrote.

The email comes as crime is on the rise in D.C., with homicides in 2021 already outpacing 2020, a year which had already hit a 16-year high.

On Thursday evening, terror struck a popular neighborhood in northwest D.C., when a drive-by shooter injured two, according to Fox News, and sent those nearby running for their lives.

https://twitter.com/rawsalerts/status/1418369651466244105?s=20

By Thursday, police data shows the District has seen 106 homicides, eclipsing last year’s number at the same point by one. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered the policy department “to use any overtime necessary” to meet the challenge posed by rising crime rates.

Today, I notified the DC Council that I have directed @DCPoliceDept to use any overtime necessary to meet our public safety needs. #SaferStrongerDC pic.twitter.com/PC34246THi — Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) July 19, 2021",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/23/d-c-911-dispatch-faces-staffing-crisis-amid-surging-violent-crime-spree/,2021-07-23
"Amid DC Violence, Black Community Leaders Rally To Protect Each Other","In the same spot where 6-year-old Nyiah Courtney was shot and killed two weeks ago, 100 black men gathered to hold their community accountable.

“The responsibility of the safety of this community is on the people who live in this community,” said Advisory Neighborhood Commission 8C Chair Salim Adofo.

The event “100 Black Men for Peace and Empowerment” called on strong black men to lead an effort to organize and support their community. On Saturday, the group went door-to-door in Southeast Washington, D.C., handing neighbors pamphlets with information about work development programs, how to pay back rent, and where to receive mental health help. The group also called for an end to gun violence and helped clean trash off the streets.

“When we can see black men doing some positive things in the very community in which they live, we can start to change the way people view their neighborhoods. We should be neighbors opposed to, ‘Oh, those are just people who live there,'” Adofo said.

Building bridges between neighbors is an effort to rebuild communities, Adofo said. With rising crime rates in predominately black neighborhoods and community members’ growing suspicion of law enforcement, many violent crimes go unreported. Adofo wants to change that.

Violent crime has skyrocketed in cities supporting Black Lives Matter’s “anti-police” narrative. In 2018, there were 16,214 murders in the United States (with one chart reflecting 14,123 total murders that year), about half of which were black victims. Of single-victim, single-offender situations, about 89 percent of black victims were killed by black assailants, as The Federalist reported. Despite making up only 13 percent of the population, black Americans committed 52 percent of all homicides between 1980 and 2008, according to the Deparatment of Justice.

In a recent letter, Mayor Muriel Bowser linked D.C.’s spike in killings to court failures, which D.C. Superior Court Judge Anita Josey-Herring denied. While court systems have been operating at a slower pace due to the pandemic, homicide rates in Washington, D.C., have been steadily increasing for years.

The city is experiencing a severe staffing shortage at the D.C. 911 dispatch, which fields calls relating to violent crime. This shortage is a product of employees on a combination of family leave, personal leave, and sick leave — and, according to the emergency agency’s interim director, Cleo Subido, who implemented mandatory overtime, it’s also a product of slacking.

“Currently, the District is paying us for 12 hours and we are plugged into the radio for less than seven hours for the most part,” Subido wrote.

With apathy, poor leadership, understaffing, and crime on the rise, including 106 homicides this year in the District, people like Adofo are turning inward to combat violence.

“This is on us as a community,” Adofo said. “We want to make sure that we can get the resources to the people that are in the most need so that we can stop the gun violence.”

Bedford: Cities' Refusal To Crack Down On Violent Crime Is Killing People,"Federalist Senior Editor Christopher Bedford said leftist officials refusing to crack down on the spike in violent crime in American cities will inevitably lead to more suffering and harsher policing.

“This is getting out of control,” Bedford explained. “It’s spilling out of the poor neighborhoods. It’s spilling out of the places that are far outside where the white liberals and their allies, or whatever else you want to call them, live, and into the Nationals ballpark, and into attacking senators. It‘s out of control.”

If this upward trend in crime continues, Bedford noted, others, such as Former California Democrat Sen. Barbara Boxer, who was assaulted and robbed in Oakland on Monday, will suffer.

“Thank God the senator is okay because she’s an 80-year-old woman now getting punched in the back and robbed. In the city of Oakland, you have carjackings up 90 percent, murders up 20 percent. And at the same time that the Biden administration sent $190 million to the city of Oakland to help it out, they cut $18 million from their police force. Their police chief is out there begging and saying, ‘I know these people who are being gunned down.’ The City Council called them speed bumps and just things that were going to get in the way.”

Even when police chiefs in Oakland and Washington, D.C., speak out about the difficulties they are having with cracking down on crime, their cries for help seem to fall on deaf ears of those who continue to lobby for the release of criminals and softer sentencing.

“The recidivism rate for them involving violent crime is through the roof and they’re being released within days,” Bedford said. “We’ve gotten rid of bail. We’ve gotten rid of harsh sentencing. We’ve gotten rid of a willingness to enforce the law here in Washington, D.C., and across the country. In the 1950s, the 1960s, we were the softest country in the West on crime. Because of that, crime spiked. We ended up with a bigger criminal justice and a bigger prison system that the activists have ever tried to reform in the first place.”

""We've gotten rid of bail. We've gotten rid of harsh sentencing…In the 50s, 60s we were the softest country in the west on crime. Because of that crime spiked.

Despite voters’ desires to put “crime prevention and safety and more police at the absolute top of their list of things,” some cities are slower to act than others, leaving vulnerable people in their wake and the potential for “excesses” in criminal punishment.

“We know how to solve this. We solved it after the ‘50s in the ‘60s. We solved it in this country. We had one of the safest countries in the West because of that, but that came with harsh policing. I think we’re going to see a return,” Bedford said. “If we don’t turn it around sooner than this, then I worry that we’re going to see some of the excesses that we saw in crime and punishment in the ‘90s because people get so fed up and so angry that they end up hurting innocent people in the round-up of criminal abusers.”

"Former Sen. Barbara Boxer Assaulted, Robbed In Crime-Ridden Oakland","Amid an uptick in crime rates and a decision to defund the city’s police department by nearly $18 million, a former senator was assaulted and robbed in Oakland, California, according to a Twitter post on her account. The attack came an hour after police representatives said in a news conference they would take a hard stance against worsening crime.

Former California Democrat Sen. Barbara Boxer, 80, was allegedly pushed in the back and had her cell phone snatched on Monday in the Jack London Square area of Oakland. The neighborhood is located about six miles from where the city’s professional baseball team plays, as reported by The Hill.

“Earlier today former Senator Barbara Boxer was assaulted in the Jack London Square neighborhood of Oakland,” the post reads. “The assailant pushed her in the back, stole her cell phone and jumped in a waiting car. She is thankful that she was not seriously injured.”

Oakland Police confirmed there was a robbery on the 300 block of 3rd Street at close to 1:15 p.m. but have not named Boxer directly yet. The police said the victim was “approached by a suspect” who “forcefully took loss from the victim, and fled in a nearby waiting vehicle.”

The Oakland Police Department’s robbery section is taking up the investigation, and authorities are offering up to $2,000 for any intel that would lead to an arrest. Oakland law enforcement said in the conference just prior to the assault that the city’s criminals are “ruthless” and “aggressive.”

In June, the City Council of Oakland voted to slash its police budget by nearly $18 million after the Biden administration sent the city $190 million in COVID-19 relief dollars. Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong recently indicated there has been a 90 percent increase in homicides, 88 percent increase in carjackings, and 70 percent increase in shootings in the last year.

“Without the resources, it makes it challenging to make Oakland safe, and more families find themselves dealing with trauma,” Armstrong said in a June press conference.

Armstrong organized a crime victims rally in early July that brought together hundreds of black families. Videos that circulated on social media, however, showed alleged Antifa members crashing the protest and clutching signs reading “F-ck OCP” and “Quit your job, kkkop!”

“We are seeing far too many people being arrested by our officers, going jail, and coming right back out and committing those same crimes in our community. There has to be some level of accountability,” Armstrong said on Monday.

Boxer announced in 2015 that she would not run for reelection. She was first elected to Congress in 1983.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/27/former-sen-barbara-boxer-assaulted-and-robbed-in-oakland-after-police-vow-to-crack-down-on-surging-crime/,2021-07-27
What To Make Of Biden’s Latest Call For Banning Guns,"Last week, asked what he planned to do about crime, Joe Biden said “I’m the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a senator, to make sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea (that) you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon, whether it’s a nine-millimeter pistol or whether it’s a rifle, is ridiculous. I’m continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things.” Any gun can fire 20 shots, of course, and Biden has never been articulate, so it would be fair to assume that he meant “fire 20 shots without reloading.”

Online, a disagreement about what Biden meant ensued between House Republicans and PolitiFact. But before getting into that, three things should be noted. First, as has often been the case during his political career, in this instance Biden lied. The legislation Biden bragged about—Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s, D-California, gun and magazine “ban” of 1994-2004, imposed as part of Biden’s 1994 crime bill—didn’t “eliminate” any guns.

The “ban” didn’t apply to the possession of guns already owned. On paper, it banned the importation of semi-automatic firearms it defined as “assault weapons,” but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) had already done that in 1989, as ordered by President George H. W. Bush, with the blessing of Bush’s “drug czar,” Bill Bennett.

Feinstein’s ban applied to the manufacture of such firearms, but unintentionally allowed manufacturers to keep making the firearms in modified form. As a result, during the “ban,” Americans bought almost three-quarters of a million newly made AR-15s, and no telling how many rifles of similar orientation.

Six months after the “ban” took effect, in a CBS “60 Minutes” segment titled “What Assault Weapons Ban?,” reporter Lesley Stahl called 1994 “the best year for the sales of assault weapons ever.” Frustrated, Feinstein told Stahl, “There is no question that I would have preferred to see an outright ban on the possession of semi-automatic assault weapons in America” and “if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t there.”

Second, since 1989, Democrats’ federal gun- and magazine-ban legislation, the first of which was introduced by purported communist Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Arizona, has defined such magazines as any that can hold 11 or more rounds of ammunition. Therefore Biden was trying to mislead, saying he wanted to ban guns that can fire “20” or more shots.

Third, while firearms that Democrats call “assault weapons” are used in only 2-3 percent of murders (compared to about 30 percent of murders without firearms of any type), no use of a gun in crime is grounds for banning it, because the right to keep and bear arms is constitutionally protected and, as the Supreme Court said in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), “the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.”

Besides, as the late Jeff Cooper, considered the founder of the modern defensive handgun technique, said in “The Art Of The Rifle,” rifles “may be used by evil men for evil purposes, but there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles.”

While there is nothing in the legislative history of the Second Amendment to support Heller’s claim that the right to arms includes only such arms as are “in common use” for legitimate purposes, AR-15s, comparable rifles, and handguns that can use magazines that hold 11 or more rounds are the firearms most in common use for such purposes today. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Kolbe v. Hogan (2017), said “in 2012, the number of AR- and AK-style weapons . . . was more than double the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold, the most commonly sold vehicle in the United States.”

However, for the record, violent crime, which began declining several years before Feinstein’s “ban” was imposed, continued to decline as purchases of those firearms in particular, and firearms generally, increased. And since the “ban” expired in 2004, Americans have bought millions more AR-15s, comparable rifles, semi-automatic pistols, and hundreds of millions of magazines that hold 11 or more rounds for those firearms. Also, until Democrat officials stopped prosecuting rioters and began defunding police departments, the U.S. murder rate had declined.

Who’s Right About What Biden Meant?

In response to Biden’s statement, House Republicans, overlooking that Biden said he supported banning rifles that can fire 20 or more shots, said on Twitter, “Biden says he wants to ban handguns.” “Handguns” could be interpreted as meaning “some handguns” or “all handguns,” so PolitiFact assumed the latter and said Republicans’ claim was “false.” It added, “Biden doesn’t want to ban handguns, Biden wants to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. . . . The most popular handguns would face no restrictions under Biden’s policies.”

Adding to the confusion, two conservative websites quoted Biden without including his first sentence, with which, it could be argued, he put the remainder of his statement in the context of “assault weapons.” Both websites, like the Republicans, ignored Biden’s claim relative to banning rifles.

PolitiFact was particularly wrong in claiming Biden’s policies would have no effect on the most popular handguns. The most popular handguns today are those that use detachable magazines, detachable magazines are integral parts of firearms designed to use them (like a gas tank is to a car), firearms that can use detachable magazines can use ones of any size, magazines of 11 rounds or more are made for most of them, and magazines of 20 rounds are made for many of them.

It’s Not News That Democrats Want to Ban Guns and Magazines

In the 1800s, Democrats imposed state laws designed to prevent blacks from being armed. In 1934, a Democrat Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who threatened to pack the Supreme Court and threw Japanese-Americans in internment camps) imposed the National Firearms Act. In 1968, a Democrat Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson (who campaigned for universal gun registration and gun owner licensing) imposed the Gun Control Act, which, among other things, prohibited a firearm dealer from selling a handgun to a young adult, prohibited a dealer from selling a handgun to a resident of another state, and limited the importation of firearms to those the BATFE considers “generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes” (emphasis added).

In 1974, thinking they had momentum and seeing the opportunity to rake in cash by sending fundraising letters to hoplophobic leftists, anti-gun activists formed the National Coalition to Ban Handguns and the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH, later renamed Handgun Control, Inc., or HCI). In 1975, NCCH called for “a ban on the manufacture, sale, and importation of all handguns and handgun ammunition,” and in 1976 advocated a law “to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.”

Into the 1980s, both groups campaigned in particular for a ban on compact handguns which, at the time, typically held six or fewer rounds of ammunition. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, of Chappaquiddick infamy, and Rep. Peter Rodino, D-New Jersey, introduced the necessary legislation.

In 1991, a future president of HCI told the New York Assembly’s Committee on Codes, “There is no reason why a legitimate gun owner needs to have a clip (sic) capable of holding more than six rounds, and thus I would suggest the banning of clips (sic) that hold more than six rounds.” Coupled with a ban on compact handguns holding six rounds or fewer, a ban on magazines holding more than six rounds would have begun to look a lot like a ban on handguns.

Two years later, even six rounds was too many. In 1993, Feinstein told the Senate, “I intend to add an amendment that would exempt semi-automatic bolt action (sic) shotguns and bona fide hunting rifles whose clips (sic) don’t exceed three rounds.”

DC 911 Dispatch Says It’s Hiring Amid Slacking Staff And Surging Crime,"After a leak indicated last week that Washington, D.C.’s 911 dispatch center is facing an extreme staffing shortage while crime surges across the city, the deputy mayor for public safety and justice told The Federalist the department is requiring overtime and hiring new employees.

“Over the coming weeks, the agency will institute mandatory overtime and focus emphasis on base operational requirements including plug-in times, call accuracy, and chain of command, an approach rooted in ensuring that residents and other callers receive the most timely and appropriate response possible,” Chris Geldart, who oversees 911, 311, corrections, and public safety in D.C., said in a statement.

Only 50 percent of the staff were available to work two weeks ago. This led to the emergency agency’s interim director, Cleo Subido, introducing mandatory overtime.

Dave Statter first obtained an email Subido had sent to her staff, in which she said, “We are committed to following the rules and being transparent about it. Anything that gets in the way of us improving performance, treating each other with respect, providing our responders and constituents with the care they deserve, or meeting the objectives of our mission — I will handle without delay.”

While the shortage of available staff is due to employees on personal leave, sick leave, and family leave, Subido also had blamed staffers for being slackers. Geldart told The Federalist that the Office of Unified Communications (OUC) plans to hire new personnel next month and focus on more hiring initiatives in the coming fall.

“Next month, OUC will onboard ten new call-takers, which will also help to lessen impact during high-absence periods, with additional recruitment efforts coming in the fall,” the deputy mayor said. “OUC remains committed to answering the call in times of crisis and we will continue to work with 911 operations staff and supervisors to ensure they are well-trained and ready to assist.”

There have already been more homicides in D.C. this year than the last, and 2020 marked a 16-year high. Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Wednesday a plan to hire 170 police officers, requesting the City Council provide $11 million. The Council voted to defund the police by $15 million last year.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/29/dc-911-dispatch-says-its-hiring-amid-slacking-staff-and-surging-crime/,2021-07-29
Fight Or Flight? Do Not Surrender Chicago To Its Villains,"Chicago is a city rife with villains, but its people are good. And they’re deserving of the safety that law and order provide.

As a rising senior at the University of Chicago, I’ve lived in the Hyde Park neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side for the past three years. Concerned parents of prospective UChicago students often ask me whether it’s reasonable to entrust their children to my community. No matter how I respond, my “answer” is burdened with guilt.

The guilt is two-fold. The first wave of guilt stems from the idea that I might be turning others away from my second home, that I might be dissuading scholars from an institution that has pushed me further as a human being than I ever thought possible, that I might contribute to an exodus of residents that would impoverish my neighbors.

When the second wave of guilt hits, it’s just as powerful as the first. I’m terrified that, by encouraging others to join my community, they might be put in harm’s way. I fear that, like Max Lewis, my future peers might be gunned down on the Chicago CTA train, or that, like Yiran Fan, they might be viciously murdered in a South Side parking garage.

I fear for the safety of my friends and classmates, as well as my own. And I feel for my parents, who worry deeply about where I choose to call home.

Yet I return to the city, over and over again. I refuse to surrender its streets to violence and bloodshed. When forced to choose between fight or flight, there’s only one option: good Chicagoans—of which there are many—must not abandon our city. And we owe it to ourselves and our community to demand that Chicago do better.

How Bad Is It Really?

Chicago’s official website says, “Mayor Lightfoot’s pledge is to make Chicago the safest big city in America.” Clearly, that’s not happening under Lori Lightfoot’s failed leadership. Chicagoans are dying, and platitudes don’t save lives. If anything, they’re an offensive distraction from the community’s suffering.

As of July 26, Chicago’s own statistics show that the city’s aggravated assault victimizations are up 14.4 percent, total shooting victimizations are up 9.7 percent, and vehicular hijacking victimizations have surged 44.6 percent. The Chicago Tribune adds that more than 2,000 Chicagoans have been shot this year, while more than 360 have been victims of homicide.

For a rough comparison, consider that 1,833 Americans were killed in action in Afghanistan between late 2001 and 2014, averaging 141 deaths per year. In a shorter time span, 4,724 Americans were killed in Chicago between 2011 and 2019, averaging a staggering 525 deaths per year.

Chicago’s 2011-2019 statistics are horrible, but since Lightfoot assumed office on May 20, 2019, the Tribune’s metrics show the city’s homicide rate has gotten even worse.

Criminals Are Terrorizing My Neighborhood

My own neighborhood is not immune to these trends. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the University of Chicago Police Department (UCPD), my campus is relatively fortified (it has to be, in order to maintain tuition-payers). But UChicago is not an island—nor should it be.

My peers and I are inextricably tied to our surrounding South Side community. As UCPD’s crime bulletin illustrates, violent crime and property crime rates are surging in most of the department’s patrol area, which encompasses the Hyde Park, Kenwood, and Oakland neighborhoods, as well as sections of Woodlawn.

To put this area’s crime surge in perspective, UCPD responded to an attempted vehicular hijacking in its patrol area on July 20. Just two days after that, both Chicago Police and UCPD officers “responded to a call of a person shot off-campus in [an] alley.” Upon arrival, they found one victim who’d been shot in the head, while a second had been shot in the arm. They classified it as an aggravated battery.

Four days after that, CPD and UCPD yet again “responded to calls of shots fired off-campus.” Upon arrival, they found a parked vehicle that had been shot up, although it was luckily unoccupied. Just a day after that, three armed robberies and an aggravated vehicular hijacking were reported to UCPD.

In case you lost track of the timeline, all of these crimes were reported in the span of eight days, between Tuesday, July 20 and July 27. So that’s just about one week of horrific crime (albeit a particularly egregious one). Clearly, lawlessness is rampant.

There Are People Behind the Numbers

After two of my peers were murdered in Lightfoot’s city, a 73-year-old veteran named Keith Cooper was beaten to death outside my local CVS on July 14. Cooper was walking toward the pharmacy when an assailant allegedly snuck up behind him and stole his car keys. As Cooper screamed for help, the prosecutor said a second assailant beat Cooper in the head, while the first assailant pushed him in the chest.

The attackers couldn’t figure out how to get in Cooper’s car, so they fled. Meanwhile, their victim fell to the ground and stopped breathing. The attempted carjacking failed, but it cost Cooper his life.

The murderers didn’t jump Cooper in the middle of some abandoned strip mall. Just the opposite: in Lightfoot’s lawless city, they were emboldened to kill their elderly victim in a busy parking lot in broad daylight on 53rd Street, just blocks from campus.

One of Cooper’s alleged murderers, Frank Harris, had already pleaded guilty to a prior vehicular hijacking. In case it couldn’t get worse, Assistant Public Defender Robyn Hayns told CWB Chicago that Harris is a paid employee of “GoodKidsMadCity,” a group of radicals dedicated to abolishing the police.

As Cooper’s horrific demise shows, there are human beings behind every crime statistic.

Rage, Rage, Against the Dying of the Light

As Americans, we’re often outraged at each other, our institutions, and ourselves. But if we set aside the performative hysteria and politicking, some issues transcend hollow activism. My neighbors getting murdered in Chicago’s streets is one of them.

Every day, Chicago’s brave police officers defend our streets. They put their lives on the line to protect us, and they are forever deserving of our gratitude. But while first responders clean up innocents’ blood and law enforcement pursues the perpetrators, they alone cannot heal our city.

Too often, we become desensitized and complacent toward violence. We read the latest headlines about our city’s crime, only to move on with our days. We assume the violence will only touch others, and we wait for “the experts” and career politicians to remedy our community’s pain. This mindset needs to change.

Rather than wait on the failed leadership of Lightfoot and her partisan peers to “fix” our city, local leaders and next-door neighbors need to unite to seek solutions. Unlike Chicago city officials, we don’t have bodyguards. We have more to lose than political capital, and we need to fight back.

The standard we’ve set for our city is unacceptable. And my phrasing is intentional, because the entire community sets the tone, not only for what we’re willing to permit, but for what we’re willing to suffer. And Chicagoans have quietly suffered for far too long.

As a community, we need to work toward, and vote for, better. Only then may we overthrow the villains who terrorize our streets.

New Virginia Group To Recall Law-And-Order Flouting Soros Prosecutors,"As violent crime shreds our nation’s capital, next-door neighbor Northern Virginia is incubating its own anti-law-and-order haven, thanks to three district attorneys more interested in dramatic Democrat talking points than prosecuting criminals. A new organization is rising up to boot them out of office.

Virginians for Safe Communities, a 501(c)4 organization that launched Monday morning and aims at advocating for public safety and highlighting the pitfalls of leftist prosecutors, is leading the charge to remove Steve Descano, Buta Biberaj, and Parisa Dehghani-Tafti from their posts as district attorneys of Fairfax, Loudoun, and Arlington Counties, respectively.

Each of these social justice prosecutors, technically called “commonwealth’s attorneys” in Virginia but functionally local district attorneys, was elected in 2019 after campaigning on radical changes. They promised to get away from the death penalty, end cash bail, restrict their cooperation with immigration officials, and drop prosecutions for possession of marijuana.

2019 was also the Virginia election year in which Democrats took over the state legislature for the first time in decades. Descano, Biberaj, and Dehghani-Tafti all defeated much more traditional prosecutors in their Democratic primaries, no doubt thanks to George Soros’ involvement.

Through his political action committee, Soros, a billionaire and megadonor known for trying to dye America deep-blue by bankrolling radical candidates in local races, reportedly spent almost $2.1 million on ads, mailers, and polls in the primary and general election to get the three Virginia leftists elected. In Arlington County, for instance, the Soros-backed Dehghani-Tafti ousted Commonwealth’s Attorney Theo Stamos, who had been in that post for more than 30 years.

“Make no mistake these radical prosecutors are not an organic movement, they were picked, trained, and financed (very handsomely) to push an agenda,” Sean Kennedy, president and chairman of Virginians for Safe Communities, told The Federalist. “For too long, the pro-public safety forces have been in retreat in the face of this onslaught. Now, we stand and fight back.”

Other Soros-aligned political action committees have deployed similar tactics with much success, getting social justice Democrat prosecutors elected in Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, and elsewhere. Although its targets are in the D.C. suburbs, Virginians for Safe Communities speaks to other locales too.

“Our message goes beyond Northern Virginia,” Kennedy continued, noting that law-abiding taxpayers across the whole country “expect our leaders to keep us safe in our communities. Those who can afford to hide behind gates and guards have no business undermining our public safety and justice system on a whim.”

The Northern Virginia candidates weren’t bluffing. True to their word, the prosecutors set their leftist agendas in motion. They eliminated cash bail, looked the other way on drug crimes (including remarkable leniency for a man accused of bringing 50 pounds of marijuana and 400 cartridges of hashish oil into the country through Ronald Reagan International Airport), failed to uphold victims’ rights, and dropped precursor cases, which can be vital to maintaining community safety, such as drunk driving, domestic violence, and cruelty to animals (something Descano’s office tried to walk back after backlash for not caring enough about Fido).

“These prosecutors were elected as the chief law enforcement officers of their counties — not lawmakers,” Kennedy said. “If they wish to rewrite the Virginia Constitution or enact statutory changes, run for the House of Delegates. They are not permitted, nor will they be allowed, to make law based on their own whim and political feelings. We are a nation and Commonwealth of laws, not men.”

Descano has also been accused of withholding exculpatory evidence, known as a Brady violation, in the case of Fairfax County Police Officer Tyler Timberlake, something the policeman’s defense attorney said has been a pattern for the commonwealth’s attorney.

“I have a great deal of concern regarding the reliability of and appearance of the misrepresentation of statements made by the Commonwealth to a circuit court judge as it relates to exculpatory evidence,” Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Brett A. Kassabian said of the Timberlake case, calling Descano’s conduct “disturbing.”

A different judge had previously rebuked Descano for a different Brady violation, wherein he didn’t turn over exculpatory evidence related to an 18-year-old defendant in a first-degree murder case.

“Virginians for Safe Communities is committed to telling the truth about these so-called progressive prosecutors and holding them accountable to the people of the Commonwealth,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy said his team are working to recall the three radical prosecutors by way of petitions, in keeping with Virginia law, and statements of cause, which function like indictments. State law requires that the petition be signed by registered voters who live in the officeholder’s jurisdiction equal to 10 percent of the number of votes cast in the last election for the office being recalled.

If the petitions are accepted, the prosecutors will have a right to trial by jury. Because the commonwealth’s attorney usually represents the state in Virginia recall cases, but the prosecutors would be the subject of removal in this case, the judge would instead appoint a special attorney to represent the state. Both parties have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court following trial court.

“Their policies and misconduct endangers the safety of Virginia families and shakes public confidence in the justice system,” Kennedy said of Descano, Biberaj, and Dehghani-Tafti. “Every Virginian deserves to feel safe in their home, at school, and on our streets.”

Polls show Americans feel the same way and are more concerned with law and order than leftist extremist rhetoric. According to a YouGov poll from the end of May, 49 percent of those surveyed identified “violent crime” as a “very big problem,” with 35 percent more saying it’s a “somewhat big problem.” Respondents were also more worried about crime in their communities than police brutality against minorities, by 48 percent to 38 percent.

Furthermore, 57 percent of respondents blamed “the racial justice movement” for increases in violent crime, with 32 percent of those polled saying law enforcers aren’t tough enough on offenders, compared to only 27 percent believing they’re too tough on criminals.

Many Americans are fed up with the left-wing imposing its extreme policies, especially in Virginia. Look no further than angry parents seeking recalls of radical school boards over critical race theory and equity initiatives in Loudoun County, or the disastrous police reforms of 2020 that ushered in a year of unrest and led to a 47.9 percent increase in the number of officers who left the Richmond Police department. Another organization, Stand Up Virginia, is also looking to help oust the egregious commonwealth’s attorneys.

A concern for law and order promises to be a key force in November elections, and Virginians for Safe Communities is one manifestation of backlash against the extreme leftist prosecutors of Fairfax, Loudoun, and Arlington Counties.

"Washington's New Laws Handcuffing Police Will Increase Crime, Chaos","Washington state just reimagined policing with sweeping so-called “police accountability” bills that went into effect this week. Led by anti-police activists enabled by allies in the Democrat-controlled legislature, the consequences of these dramatic changes will be worse than you can imagine. And Democrats don’t seem to care.

Police use of force is now strictly limited. Car chases and tear gas are almost entirely banned. Chokeholds are now forbidden, requiring officers to use more lethal tools at their disposal. Some bills even conflict with others.

“The challenge is — I’m going to be very frank — the laws were written very poorly, and the combination of them all at the same time has led to there being conflicts in clarity and in what was intended versus what was written,” Kent Police Chief Rafael Padilla told ABC News.

New Restrictions on Use of Force and Vehicle Pursuit

HB 1310 dictates only three scenarios where officers may use force. The most significant shift mandates officers can only use force when “probable cause” exists for an arrest.

Before the changes, “reasonable suspicion” was the standard. That is, police lack concrete evidence for an arrest but there is a reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain the suspect because officers think they committed a crime. The bar for probable cause is much higher because it requires some kind of concrete evidence (eyewitness affirmation, a confession, discovery of a warrant if the suspect gives his name, etc.).

The instances when police can use force are now to make an arrest, prevent an escape, or protect against an imminent threat of bodily injury to the peace officer, another person, or the person against whom force is being used.

HB 1054 severely restricts vehicle pursuits. Police cannot pursue suspects in vehicles unless there’s probable cause to believe that the suspect “committed or is committing a violent offense or sex offense.” That means if officers spot a car with a driver matching the description of a bank robbery suspect, they wouldn’t be able to pursue or make an arrest. There’s no probable cause yet.

That’s not all. The suspect must pose an imminent threat at the time, the pursuit must be necessary to apprehend the suspect, and the officer has to have a supervisor’s approval. Imagine checking off all those boxes before the suspect drives away and escapes.

Police Hesitate to Engage with the Mentally Ill

There have already been real-world consequences. In Chelan County, a man in a yellow dress who had just been discharged from a mental hospital allegedly stole a bus. Sheriff’s deputies made contact with the man, but he refused to pull over.

Police had reasonable suspicion that the man stole the bus, but that wouldn’t satisfy the higher bar for probable cause. So the deputies stopped their pursuit. Hours later, the man was accused of driving heavy construction equipment into the home of his estranged wife.

These new rules also affect the way police assist in mental health or drug crisis calls. Sometimes, officers have to use force during involuntary commitments that get people off the streets before they hurt themselves or others.

But probable cause wouldn’t exist for an arrest: running around partially naked and causing a scene isn’t a crime. And unless that person has a weapon in his hand, there’s no imminent threat.

This exact scenario occurred in the city of Sedro-Wooley. Officers responded to two calls within hours of each other but didn’t do anything because they interpreted the law to prohibit them from laying a hand on the man in crisis. They could only get involved after a suspect committed a crime or if the suspect acquired a weapon.

It’s easy to see why police chiefs and sheriffs are sounding the alarm. It’s why some have flatly said they will no longer respond to specific calls.

Ban on Other Weapons Makes Firearm Use More Likely

Not only do these laws make police officers’ jobs nearly impossible, they also make communities less safe. And residents have reasonable expectations that police will handle these incidents when they call 9-1-1 to report them.

Other new laws make the work of the police more dangerous. They will likely lead to more suspects being injured — the exact opposite of what Democrats said they intended.

HB 1054 prohibits police from using certain weapons. Democrats based their ban on caliber size, intending to stop police from using “military equipment” weapons that they didn’t even use. They defined the military equipment as “.50 caliber or greater.” By the letter of the law, this bans non-lethal bean bag guns, which would force officers to use more lethal tools like their firearms.

The bill’s sponsor claims the intent wasn’t to ban the non-lethal weapons and told ABC News that he expects the state’s attorney general to clarify the intent officially. Until then, given the anti-police sentiment in the legislature and leftist-controlled cities, officers are reticent to risk losing their certification in case it does contradict the new law.

In circumstances like a riot, a bean bag gun can come in handy. Police might also use tear gas to disperse violent crowds, but that has been seemingly banned too. Law enforcement agencies can still use tear gas to address a riot, barricaded subject, or a hostage situation. But before deploying this tool, they must first “exhaust alternatives to the use of tear gas that are available and appropriate under the circumstances.”

But during a riot outside of a prison – such as the one that occurred in downtown Seattle after the George Floyd death – officers must adhere to vague mandates like “whether the present circumstances warrant the use of tear gas” and allowing “sufficient time and space for the subject or subjects to comply with the officer’s or employee’s directives.”

In Seattle especially, activists want to ban the use of tear gas entirely, so they never deem circumstances warrant its use. And how do officers determine if sufficient time has passed before deploying the tear gas? Before or after a third building is ransacked or set ablaze?

More worrisome and controversial is that the law mandates agencies seek authorization from the highest elected official in the jurisdiction before using tear gas in these circumstances.

Depending on the agency and jurisdiction, that could mean a mayor, county executive, or governor – although not an elected sheriff or an appointed police chief, who actually have law enforcement expertise. In this scenario, you may end up seeking permission from a leftist official who supports the ban on the non-lethal tool. Without tear gas, officers just go into a riotous crowd with their lethal weapons. That puts everyone at risk.

Unclear Laws Won’t Be Clarified Soon

What’s worse, the laws reimagining policing are currently in effect. But the mandated model policy that would help clarify the intent of some of the laws isn’t due until mid-2022.

“There’s a lot of angst [from] an officer’s perspective in that we don’t have a model policy, and now we’re asked to go out and still do our best with trying to understand what the legislation is asking of us. And if we don’t do it right, we potentially could be decertified,” Seattle Police Interim Chief Adrian Diaz explained on my Seattle-based talk show on KTTH Radio.

All of these changes couldn’t have come at a worse time. Washington state saw a 47 percent rise in homicides last year, almost double the nationwide average.

Seattle is on pace to surpass 2020’s 26-year-high homicide rate record. Tacoma is seeing a similar surge. On the east side of the state, after a 186 percent increase in homicides last year, Spokane continues to see a spike in crime, with 12 drive-by shootings and 44 other shootings this calendar year through May.

Democrats Say Pushback Just Due to ‘Paradigm Shift’

With police statewide hamstrung, how do Democrats think this will end? They don’t seem to care. In a masterclass of gaslighting, the architect of these bills downplays issues, pretending the police were responsible for the violence.

“We have to create new policies because what we were doing before was not working,” Rep. Jesse Johnson (D-Federal Way) told ABC News. “What we wanted to do with these bills is set an expectation that officers de-escalate and that there’s less lethal enforcement of the law. A lot of the pushback we’re getting is because it’s a paradigm shift.”

The pushback they’re getting is because the laws make policing less effective and more dangerous for everyone involved.

Legislators didn’t think these changes through. They exploited the defund police movement that escalated after Floyd died in Minneapolis. They purposefully ignored law enforcement groups and lawmakers with police backgrounds as they warned of what their laws would mean.

Democrats’ goal was to dismantle and reimagine the police. And that’s exactly what they did. Now we wait for its deadly consequences.

Crime Is Spiking In U.S. Cities Because Democrats Literally Asked For It,"Despite the contrary admonition, crime does pay, and it has never paid better than under the ruling left. Making crime not pay depends on deterrence, thus the war on law enforcement is having its predictable and inevitable effect. Excusing their actions as a pursuit of “justice,” leftist activists and mayors alike are inflicting growing injustice on American society.

San Francisco’s epidemic of organized theft from stores is the latest example of what happens when Democrat-run cities neuter police enforcement. The thefts are so blatant and widespread that they exceed traditional shoplifting, in which isolated items are surreptitiously stolen. These criminals are walking items out en masse and in broad daylight. Call it low-speed looting.

The wanton and widespread nature of these robberies has already caused targeted stores to limit their hours. Other stores are closing altogether. Speaking to a local television station, Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Jerretta Sandoz described a recent theft: “They didn’t even run out, they walked out. That’s sending a message that we, the criminals, are winning.”

These growing crimes are symptomatic of the lawlessness infecting areas controlled by people who want to abolish the police. In 2020, riots and looting were dubbed “protests” by leftist politicians and media. Unsurprisingly, in cities where unrest was celebrated, crime has become a way of life — and frequently death. Just fill in the blank for crimes that spiked after a summer of crime went largely unpunished: riots (Portland has been particularly noteworthy), looting, carjacking, shootings, and homicides.

In Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s Chicago, shootings are a daily occurrence. A computer search shows how nearly impossible it is to keep track of which shooting headline is attached to which day. Over one July weekend, a recap declared “73 people hit by gunfire” and “at least 11 died.” Over the long Independence Day weekend, “at least 95 people were shot” in Chicago. The Windy City is hardly alone. Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and sadly others could be added as well.

While nothing can match the level of urban shootings that have made many municipalities unsafe places to live, there have been surges of lower-level lawlessness as well, in tandem with the homeless encampments that are taking over many cities.

The best way to stop rampant crime is law and order. Only enforcement of both raises the cost of crime above its return. Recognizing this, society sets penalties progressively higher for crimes it deems more serious and therefore wants to deter more. As the left strips away those deterrents, crime’s return grows and — because criminals are economic maximizers too — the crime’s incidence grows with it.

While the crimes may run the gamut of offenses, the locales are almost completely entrenched on the left of the political spectrum. The crime explosions in Democrat-controlled jurisdictions reflect the left’s broader rejection of traditional authority.

To proponents of leftist doctrines like critical race theory, today’s society is based on oppression. Therefore, attempts to enforce society’s laws are one manifestation of this oppression, so enforcement is the first thing these radicals want expunged. Into the vacuum, of course, comes crime in all its forms.

The dynamic that has led to crime surges in Democrat-controlled cities is also replicated along America’s southern border. Before they called for defunding the police, leftists were screaming for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). What was once an empty mantra has become today’s policy. The result is a virtually open border and a crisis of unchecked illegal immigration.

The increase of crime on the left’s watch is not coincidental, it is causal. The war on law enforcement also carries a dynamic for acceleration. Just as penalties are more severe for more serious offenses, once enforcement is removed the dynamic runs the other way: There is a larger return for greater lawbreaking. The result of anti-law enforcement action is both more crime and worse crime.

Leftist agitators have decreased law enforcement in many cities where they hold the power to do so, and crime has surged in areas under their control. They have cloaked their actions by describing them as “justice” movements, but this is simply their latest way to advance their old agenda: shifting power to themselves. In the meantime, they are shifting crime to the rest of us.

"'Vindication' Returns for Season 2, Mixing Faith, Texas, And Crime Drama","Pure Flix, a key player in the niche market of faith-based streaming services, has announced that season two of indie drama series “Vindication” — a unique merger of crime procedural and faith-conscious family drama — will premiere on September 1.

TV veteran Todd Terry, known for roles in “Breaking Bad” and “Walker: Texas Ranger,” leads the show as Sgt. Travis, who runs a police precinct in the fictional Texas city of East Bank. The detective and his team solve break-ins and suburban-set mishaps, with a larger threat looming. Characters also struggle with personal issues such as forgiveness and addictions.

“Most entertainment today comes from a few large studios based in Los Angeles,” said writer-producer Jarod O’Flaherty in a phone interview from Fort Worth, Texas. “We’ve found a large, underserved audience hungry for content that reflects their values. This show tells realistic stories that people can relate to, and faith is part of that picture.”

Seeking to fill a perceived void of faith-and-family content, the show targets an audience akin to that of “The Chosen,” a serialized loose gospel adaptation distributed by Angel Studios that has become a global phenomenon. Similarly, “Vindication” sparked significant buzz when it launched. Currently available to watch free on emerging streamer RedeemTV and on Pure Flix, production on season one was bootstrapped by a resourceful cast and crew.

Now they’re looking to bring production quality to a new level. “This time around, it’s not a slow burn,” said Venus Monique, co-star on the series. “We have more big action scenes throughout, which punctuate stories full of emotion and heart, as people have come to expect.”

Bigger Cast—and Ambitions

Production on “Vindication” season two began in June 2020, with sporadic film shoots at various Dallas/Fort Worth locales up to this past May. O’Flaherty said they followed the stringent COVID-related guidelines imposed at the time and had only minor issues.

When an actor called the day before a film shoot to say he had tested positive for COVID-19, the showrunner had an “emergency recasting” session for that minor part. “The masking was a challenge,” recalled Terry. “It’s the new world we live in for any film set you’re on. Everybody was cautious and tried to respect others, because there’s a lot of different opinions on COVID and whatnot.”

“Vindication” has also expanded its cast with Cameron Arnett (“Overcomer”), Laurie Coker (“Laurie’s Poem”) and, as Travis’ detective partner, T.C. Stallings (“War Room“). Accomplished actor Stallings said this role breaks from “violent, thuggish-type guys” other shows typecast him in. “To get to portray an intelligent, upstanding black man in law enforcement, it’s refreshing,” said Stallings. “My character Tre, he’s a good friend and sometimes cracks a joke.”

He admitted to binge-watching procedurals like “NCIS” and “Castle,” and said he was bowled over by this indie show’s first season.

“Before I saw ‘Vindication,’ I wished somebody would create a really great crime drama that was willing to tackle questions of faith,” he said. “What was already a really good show, I bring a new dynamic to it.”

Tackling Complex Topics

Stars of the show, known for past faith-based projects, embrace how “Vindication” views the world through a Christian lens. “This series shows people living out their faith in everyday life,” said Terry. “But it’s not like each episode has a specific message that’s beat over your head.”

One mid-season episode tackles racial conflicts, with Stallings’s character a central figure. Beyond his usual review board, O’Flaherty said he consulted voices representing multiple racial backgrounds on the script.

Stallings was glad the show wasn’t afraid to take on such topics. “It’s impossible to address the totality of racial divisions in a half-hour episode,” he said. “This story tackles one aspect, about the interaction of a police officer across ethnic lines. It’s informative and will certainly start some conversation.”

Some past reviews question the show’s treatment of delicate subject matter. When “Vindication” dealt with sex trafficking, Laurel Shaler, a licensed social worker and professor of counseling at Liberty University, called it “less than helpful.” Its “feel-good, all’s-well-that-ends-well conclusion” simplified complex issues of domestic trafficking, rescue, and recovery, she said.

“Vindication’s” Monique said the series touches on difficult subjects to challenge assumptions. “People become introspective and think deeper,” she said. “After an opening scene, viewers might make a quick judgment about a situation. But it ends up turning out totally different by the end.”

Finding the Faithful in Streaming

The series comes as family titles are driving success for major streaming rivals, from Netflix to Disney Plus. But many families increasingly see those services’ corporate values shifting further away from their own.

People of faith can tell when Hollywood studios are being disingenuous, says O’Flaherty. “In their shows, someone might say a prayer at Thanksgiving dinner, or they’ll walk past a church. But for believers, seeking God is a part of our everyday lives.”

Producers behind “Vindication” say this underserved market creates space for Pure Flix, a streaming service which Sony’s Affirm Entertainment acquired last November. With Affirm’s slate of quality faith films like “Soul Surfer” and “All Saints” coming to its library, Pure Flix has a better chance of getting to critical mass.

“Vindication” season two will be the first Pure Flix Original series to hit the streamer since Sony’s acquisition closed, reflecting their hope to bring on new subscribers. Season two will premiere on September 1, with Amazon Prime availability also expected in the fall.

Bringing a dose of star power to the series, Stallings says he’s not out to replace Terry or first-season detective partner Kris (Monique), who tangled with several criminals. “Oh, she’s totally solid,” he said. “As a trio, we are super dangerous now.”

Will Defund The Police Lead To Federal Patrols In Big Cities?,"Violent crime is mounting in America. Many reasons—excuses, mostly—have been proffered for this: COVID-19 lockdowns, unemployment, the Defund the Police movement and its budgetary fruits, largely tolerated urban looting and rioting, police reluctance to enforce the law in high-crime areas for fear of being accused of civil rights violations, and soft-on-crime leftist prosecutors.

The ramifications of this rise in crime are being felt largely by the urban poor and may yet generate political fallout for the largely leftist elite who run most of America’s major cities today. Let’s examine the conditions giving rise to that possibility.

Crime in America

First, some background on crime in America. The FBI reports crime in two major buckets: violent crime and property crime. Violent crimes involve force or threat of force, including murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Property crimes are defined as burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson—with no force or threat of force against the victims.

The violent crime rate peaked in 1992 at 758 crimes per 100,000 people. It moved down fairly consistently until 2014, when the violent crime rate bottomed out at 362, less than half of the level of violent crime 22 years earlier. Violent crime crept back up to 387 in 2016, and then moved down for the first three years of the Trump presidency to 367 in 2019. Final 2020 numbers have not been released.

The most recent violent crime victimization surveys indicate that for every 1,000 people aged 12 and older, there were 21.0 reported violent crimes in 2019. By race and ethnicity, this broke down to a rate of 21.0 for non-Hispanic whites, 18.7 for non-Hispanic blacks, 21.3 for Hispanics, and 7.5 for Asian, and 66.3 for other (Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and persons of two or more races).

Property crimes are sometimes referred to as quality-of-life crimes. In 1992, the national property crime rate was 4,904 offenses per 100,000 people. By 2019, the property crime rate had declined to 2,110.

Property crime victimization reports show that property crime was 125 percent more common in urban areas than in rural areas, with suburban areas in between. The reported rates per 1,000 households were 153.0 per 1,000 in urban areas, 110.8 in suburban areas, and 68.1 in rural areas in 2019. Property crimes have a disproportionate effect on the poor in urban areas, preventing the accumulation of capital and discouraging job-creating investment. Wealthy urbanites can pay for their own security measures or move out of high-crime areas.

Some Basic Statistics About Policing and Crime

As of 2019, there were 1,003,270 full-time law enforcement employees in America, according to the FBI, of whom almost 700,000 were sworn officers. There are wide variations in policing nationwide due to population density, tradition, and need, with the Middle Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) having the highest per capita level of law enforcement, 4.0 employees per 1,000 residents, almost double that of the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) at 2.1 employees per 1,000 residents.

One might presume there are more law enforcement personnel in high-crime cities, but there is little correlation. Some cities have high crime rates and robust law enforcement numbers, and some have high crime rates and a thin blue line.

For instance, Kansas City, Missouri, the U.S. murder rate capital., employs 3.7 law enforcement personnel per 1,000 residents. In 2019, there were 1,431 violent crimes reported per 100,000 people in Kansas City while the property crime rate was 3,856. This compares to the national average of 3.5 law enforcement personnel per 1,000 people with a national violent crime rate of 367 per 100,000 people and a property crime rate of 2,110.

The table below highlights some cities that were in the news during much of 2020 for protests, riots, looting, and arson. It compares them to other major cities that largely escaped significant unrest, comparing their levels of law enforcement, violent crime, property crime, and the ratio of law enforcement to those crimes, essentially providing a measure of the number of crimes committed per law enforcement personnel.

Of note, three of the cities noted for persistent and damaging unrest—Minneapolis, Portland, and Seattle—had a volatile combination of law enforcement staffing levels far below the national average paired with property crime rates more than double the national average—in 2019, a year before widespread unrest broke out.

Thus, from a practical standpoint, Minneapolis, Portland, and Seattle had already defunded the police by 2019. That all three cities were constantly in the news throughout 2020 makes more sense when understanding that, from a policing standpoint, local political leaders had already surrendered to lawlessness.

In Seattle’s case, it should be completely unsurprising that the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) later known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) would fester in a city that had police staffing levels at 70 percent of the national average. Portland, the site of the persistent Antifa siege of a federal courthouse and other government buildings, employed half of the national average of law enforcement personnel, while seeing the highest ratio of property crimes per law enforcement staff of the 13 cities examined.

How many police there are, how they are trained, equipped, and deployed, and the level of trust they enjoy with the public largely drives law enforcement’s ability to solve crimes. This is known as the crime clearance rate.

Of the violent crimes known by law enforcement, only 45.5 percent were cleared by arrest of a suspect in 2019, with 61.4 percent of murders resulting in an arrest. The closure rate for property crime that year was a dismal 17.2 percent nationally, meaning if you had your stuff stolen, there was about a one-in-six chance police might arrest the perpetrator. In cities of 1 million or more, the odds of seeing justice for stolen goods drops to 11.6 percent, or about one-in-nine.

What Happens Next?

With police increasingly seeing their profession under assault while politicians seek to appease protesters, law enforcement retirements and resignations have surged. From April 2020 to March of this year, retirements increased 45 percent from the prior 12-month period with resignations up 18 percent. Hence, even if some cities wanted to maintain or increase their police force, they may have to find even greater numbers of new recruits to make up for the loss of veteran officers.

Mayors and city council members in urban areas beset with rising crime and unrest may take three possible paths. They can ask for outside assistance—such as federal law enforcement or National Guard soldiers—to supplant overtasked police departments. They can double down on defunding the police. Or they can reverse course, whether voluntarily or by being thrown out of office and their replacements changing policy.

Baltimore, Maryland offers an example of asking for outside help. Baltimore suffers from a violent crime rate some five times the national average. Its leaders are now calling for federal help to make up for their faulty management. Baltimore police announced in late July they would ask for 100 federal agents to make up for a police department that is short 392 officers, 14 detectives, and another almost 200 support staff. In 2019, the city employed 2,940 law enforcement personnel.

Exactly one year earlier, Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby penned an op-ed for the Washington Post in which she warned President Trump she would prosecute any “militarized federal agents (sent) to Baltimore City to attack our citizens by making illegal arrests, kidnapping people, (or) assaulting them…” What a difference a year makes. Mosby and her husband are now under a federal criminal investigation for financial wrongdoing, having bought two homes in Florida since last September for more than $1 million.

Portland offers a cautionary tale on doubling down. Last summer, its city council cut $15 million from the police department while zeroing out the gun-violence team’s 38 positions. Murders are now on track to exceed the city’s record high of 70 killings set in 1987. The city now wants to bring back the gun-violence squad, but only four police officers have applied to work on the new 14-member team whose required qualifications include the ability to fight systemic racism. In the meantime, mostly minority Portlanders are being killed.

Lessons from the Los Angeles Riots

The city of Los Angeles in the wake of the 1992 L.A. riots offers the most dramatic example of a city changing course, although perhaps the events of 1992 during the height of America’s crime wave are of a different nature than today’s challenges. Due in equal parts to the advent of social media and the fading of time, however, most Americans likely think 2020’s unrest was far worse than what occurred over six days in Los Angeles in April and May of 1992.

In summer 2000, more than 62,000 National Guard members were deployed in response to unrest in more than 30 states and 200 cities, including Washington, D.C. Property damage in the first two weeks of violence starting May 26 totaled $1 to $2 billion in insured losses with some 14,000 arrested by the end of June.

By comparison, the 1992 L.A. riots saw 12,111 arrests with $1.8 billion of property damage in inflation-adjusted dollars. In addition, 10,000 National Guard troops were deployed to help restore order, with an additional 3,500 active-duty forces brought into the L.A. area. In other words, the six days of violence and destruction in Los Angeles in 1992 was about equal to the paroxysms of rioting, looting, and arson over the two most intense weeks nationwide in 2020.

So, what happened in L.A.? In 1992, Los Angeles suffered its worst year of violent crime. There were calls to reform the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)—and to significantly increase its numbers.

A year after the riots, Los Angeles elected its first Republican mayor in 32 years with Richard Riordan calling to increase the LAPD by 40 percent over five years. While the Democratic supermajority on the city council resisted Riordan’s efforts to expand the LAPD, the force did in fact grow from 7,600 in 1993 to 12,954 in 2019, an increase of 70 percent, while the city’s population expanded by only 12 percent over the same period. This increased the force patrolling the city from about 2.2 law enforcement personnel per 1,000 people in 1993 to 3.2 per 1,000 in 2019.

New York City’s recent mayoral primary offers hope that voters may turn things around themselves. Eric Adams, a former police captain, narrowly won the Democratic nomination for mayor while voicing opposition to defunding the police. Running as a centrist, Adams beat out New York Times-endorsed Kathryn Garcia, Maya Wiley, the Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-approved candidate, Andrew Yang, and others.

Adams faces Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, in the general election in November. Adams’s victory will continue New York City’s traditional robust financing of a police department with a per capita staffing level 80 percent above the national average. The violent crime rate in New York was 56 percent higher than the national average, but still far below most major cities.

The Defund the Police movement will inevitably collide with the reality of rising crime in elections through 2022. Results at the local level will be uneven. Nationally, however, Democrats who don’t unequivocally support law enforcement will face strong electoral headwinds from voters of every race and ethnicity who prize their own safety above rhetoric.

'Stillwater' Probes The West's Identity Crisis – And Ties That Promise Hope,"“Americans don’t like to change.”

One of the first lines of dialogue in “Stillwater,” which opened in theaters July 30, is from a Spanish-speaking migrant worker expressing amazement at the idea that Americans simply come back, rebuild, and carry on despite tornadoes repeatedly levelling their town. The worker wonders why residents don’t just go someplace else to avoid this regular devastation to their lives.

It’s a fair observation, although anyone making such a critique, particularly someone who’s left his home seeking greener pastures, ought to be reminded that it’s often the stubbornness of people that builds places we can call home in the first place.

The provocative dialogue establishes a central theme of “Stillwater”: the meaning of place. Where we’re from plays a major role in establishing our identities. Where we are at a moment in time also dictates what we can and cannot do, even if we haven’t changed on the inside.

Plot Inspired By the Amanda Knox Case

The where and who are subject to stress in “Stillwater,” directed and partially written by Tom McCarthy. Matt Damon portrays Bill Baker, a former oil rig worker who has been working construction (and tornado clean-up) jobs to get by living in the movie’s namesake of Stillwater, Oklahoma. He leaves for Marseille, France, to visit his daughter Allison, who has spent five years of a nine-year sentence in prison for murdering her female lover while attending university in the country.

It’s a journey Baker has made several times, only this time he discovers there may be a way to prove his daughter’s innocence. In the interest of not spoiling the film, it need only be said this revelation takes Baker on a journey that strains him physically and spiritually, challenging his relationships with those he cares for most.

If “Stillwater’s” plot sounds a lot like the Amanda Knox case, that’s because it’s directly inspired by the 2007 murder of a British exchange student in Italy, for which Knox was convicted and imprisoned. Although she was acquitted and released several years later, the case remains deeply controversial to this day, in part due to perceived miscarriages of justice committed by the Italian authorities.

“Stillwater’s” link to the case generated controversy just days before its theatrical release, with Knox posting a lengthy Twitter thread criticizing the film and its makers for attempting to profit off her “name, face, and story without my consent.”

A Tale of Two Cities

The Knox connection aside, “Stillwater” is still gripping and thought-provoking. Despite the title, nearly the entirety of the film takes place in Marseille. The audience is taken on a veritable tour of the city, seeing it in both sunlight and darkness, at its best and at its worst. In some ways, Marseille is the star of the film, providing not only a picturesque setting but also establishing the contours of the story.

As a foreigner (an American no less), Bill Baker must come to grips with the fact that France, despite having Best Western hotels and Subway, plays by an entirely different set of rules, culturally and legally. The language barrier alone is suffocating, but hardly the greatest obstacle.

France may be a “first world” country, yet it proves insufficient to rely solely on institutions for help. Instead, Baker must rely on the good faith and kindness of others, including strangers, highlighting the importance of community and personal relationships, whether in Stillwater or Marseille.

The setting also creates a tense atmosphere, representing something of a crossroads for France. An ethnically diverse city with large numbers of immigrants and foreign residents (many from North Africa, a legacy of France’s colonial history), Marseille is an epicenter of the ongoing debate about the French national identity and its future. Like much of the West, France has walked a tightrope, attempting to atone for the darker side of its history while still defending its culture, honor, and way of life as they come under fire.

There exists a perceptible political undertone to “Stillwater.” Aside from a few instances where social issues are bluntly treated, “Stillwater” handles them overall with a sterling level of nuance. It acknowledges that, while problems exist, nobody has a good answer for any of them. Opening dialogue aside, “Stillwater” doesn’t cast judgment towards the United States or France. If anything, the message seems to be that both countries, two linchpins of Western civilization, are undergoing respective crises.

The contrast between rural, largely monocultural Stillwater and urban, multicultural Marseille fashion the two locales as worlds apart in every sense. Yet they also have much in common. Stillwater is a city with a median income of $34,309, well below the national average, along with a high rate of poverty. Likewise, Marseille’s vibrancy cannot hide its significant poverty and unemployment, both higher than the national average.

From the American heartland to a bustling European metropolis, large numbers of people on both sides of the Atlantic are struggling and facing increasingly uncertain futures. Meanwhile, they’ve also diverged from their own countries.

Stillwater is “flyover country,” culturally and politically distant from America’s “blue” coasts. A television tuned to Fox News at Bill Baker’s mother-in-law’s residence is a sign of to which “America” Stillwater belongs. Similarly, Marseille isn’t like Paris, as noted by Virginie (Camille Cottin), a French woman who aids Bill. An attorney who worked on Allison’s case remarks, at a pivotal moment in the film, “This could’ve only happened in Marseille.”

A Convincing and Compelling Cast

But the broader contextualization would’ve been lost in translation if not for strong performances from the cast. At 50 years old, Damon shows no signs of atrophy.

Admittedly, it’s hard at times to distance Bill Baker from the Jason Bourne character Damon has made emblematic. But Stillwater constantly reminds the audience it’s an entirely different film, in part because Damon’s role is considerably deeper than anything he’s done in years. He provides an empathetic portrayal of the working-class middle American, steeped in politeness, with an unwavering faith in Christ, unconditional love for family, and a can-do spirit.

Abigail Breslin delivers a sympathetic portrayal of Allison Baker, proving how far the actress has come since she broke out at age 10 in 2006’s “Little Miss Sunshine.” Breslin and Damon establish a convincing father-daughter dynamic, one filled with love and strain all at once.

Yet the true emotional center of the story may be Bill’s relationship with nine-year-old Maya (Lilou Siauvaud) and her mother Virginie, who provide shelter, help, and companionship for Bill in his long quest to free his daughter. Notwithstanding their differences, the three form a seemingly unbreakable bond. Maya especially reinforces Bill’s sense of purpose, providing him a second chance to be a better man and discover blessings and joy he never thought he’d find.

“Stillwater” begins as an engaging crime thriller but its emotional investment in Bill Baker’s stubborn fight to save Allison — while building himself a new life and finding family in a place he’ll never truly be able to call “home” — is what connects us with the story. Despite its lengthy 140 minutes, Stillwater remains engrossing throughout.

Some viewers may find the ending lacking or otherwise problematic, but it does give viewers much to contemplate. “Stillwater” may not be an instant classic, but it’s an example of an intriguing, tense, character-driven drama with timely themes done very well.

Video Shows Manhattan Hatchet Attack On 51-Year-Old Man Using ATM,"Warning: This article contains graphic material.

Surveillance footage obtained by the New York Post shows a masked man walking into a bank in Manhattan and attacking a customer with a hatchet.

The attack occurred inside a Chase Bank in New York City’s Financial District on Tuesday. In the video, which the Post obtained on Tuesday, a man pulled a hatchet from a bag and targeted another man.

After the first blow, the bloodied victim tried to evade the attacker, shifting around the room. Upon beating the man several times, the unidentified attacker smashed the cash-dispensing machines and left his bag and hatchet on the floor. Police confirmed to the Post that the weapon was left behind.

“A man was there with a hatchet and [hit] my head … and my leg,” the victim told the Post while reportedly “dazed” and “with his head wrapped in a large bandage.”

Police arrested a man, 37, who matched the description of the attacker at 10:00 p.m. on Tuesday after they caught him breaking car windows, according to sources who spoke to the Post.

Ryan Girdusky, a New Yorker and the author of “They’re Not Listening: How The Elites Created the National Populist Revolution,” told The Federalist it is time for Democrats to get serious about fighting crime.

“Crime in this city is getting worse, but it’s also becoming more brutal,” Girdusky said. “People are detached from their humanity. We need more than just restoring our police budgets and undoing Cuomo’s bail reform.”

Back in May, Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Manhattan’s three biggest problems are “crime, crime, [and] crime.” The remarks came amid a 73 percent increase in shootings and a 47 percent spike in robberies, according to data from the New York Police Department.

Cuomo has been roundly condemned for his bail reform policy that has closed correctional facilities and led to criminals being pardoned. In his final days as governor, the Democrat granted clemency to 10 felons, including three people linked to murders.

After the murder of George Floyd last year, Democrats across the country moved to defund the police, with New York slashing about $1 billion. But like other increasingly crime-ridden cities, New York City pivoted, with lawmakers moving to add $200 million to the budget in June. Democrat Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, however, hailed the move as “targeted investments to break the cycle of incarceration and reduce gun violence.” The budget did not include more money for hiring officers.

The situation has become so stressful for police that the city hired therapy dogs, according to the Washington Post.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/18/graphic-video-shows-heinous-manhattan-hatchet-attack-on-51-year-old-man-using-atm/,2021-08-18
Hulu’s ‘Only Murders In The Building’ Mixes Laughs With Thrills,"Circling back to the bloody crime scene on the ninth floor of a posh Manhattan apartment building, the no-nonsense police detective encounters a motley crew of amateur sleuths: a 20-something woman flanked by two men in their 70s, all residents of the Upper West Side property. They engage the detective about forensics until she stops them.

“Look, this is suicide,” she says with annoyance. “Which podcast are you all hooked on? I swear, if I meet one more true-crime nut…”

Halfway through the premiere episode of “Only Murders in the Building,” a 10-part mystery series premiering August 31 on Hulu, this moment encapsulates its tone: tense drama with tongue-in-cheek self-awareness. Comedy legend Steve Martin and writer/producer John Hoffman (“Grace and Frankie” on Netflix) ironed out a serialized dramedy with a mix of magnetic personalities and wild twists that keep adding layers of complexity.

Fans of Steve Martin and Martin Short’s comedy schtick — from 1986’s “Three Amigos,” to two “Father of the Bride” movies, to multiple live tours in recent years — will feel right at home, as the set-up gives them maximum opportunity to play off each other. It’s also the longtime friends’ first TV show as co-stars, reflecting a years-long trend of big stars migrating to the small screen.

In these funhouse mirror versions of real life, Martin portrays a washed-up actor and Short a down-on-his-luck Broadway director. When a shocking death shatters their sense of safety and the building is cleared, the two meet in a cafe along with a third resident played by Selena Gomez. It turns out they’re all obsessed with the same true-crime podcast — a delicious parody titled “All is Not OK in Oklahoma” — to the point of drawing detailed maps of the crime scene and surrounding area.

Quickly deciding to launch their own crack investigation into the strange death and produce a podcast out of it, the three commence what might appear to be only a comedy of errors. Yet this suspenseful whodunit keeps viewers hooked by smartly balancing the macabre with droll amusement.

Some light spoilers follow.

Building the Case

Thrown into the mix of the comedy duo’s natural rapport, one might imagine Gomez would be a third wheel. But the singer-actress holds her own, bringing to life an intriguing character whose presence allows the show’s free-flowing humor to address generational and gender differences.

A pop star who hasn’t acted in a TV series for roughly a decade, Gomez shared in a recent interview how much she learned from her co-stars. “They have a sense of humor that’s just classic — I feel like it doesn’t exist anymore,” she said.

Each of the trio gets moments to shine as the story grows in complexity. An unattached interior designer living in her aunt’s apartment, Gomez initially conceals her personal connection to the victim and raises suspicions. After the triad of investigators begins to work as a team, Martin strikes up a romance with another resident, which complicates things.

Meanwhile, Short relives some of his former hits and mishaps on Broadway in an elaborate flashback sequence. Playing to his strengths, he leans into laughs in scenes opposite comic Nathan Lane (“The Birdcage”), who plays a deli owner named Teddy Dimas.

When Short hawks a sponsorship for the podcast, Dimas recounts all the opportunities he’d missed thanks to the plucky director. “‘Les Mis’ — It’s such a downer, Teddy, and all over a loaf of bread.” “Well, it was,” Short deadpans. “And ‘Hamilton’!” He grimaces: “I said they picked the one founding father with no pizzazz. That was wrong, I guess.”

Similar to later seasons of “The Office,” the series integrates a constellation of stars into its narrative, each gelling as part of the ensemble rather than seeming out of place. Tina Fey shows up as a character at first played for laughs — who also ups the stakes. Superstar Sting seems a likely suspect at multiple points. A pity they couldn’t work Tim Curry in for a cameo, considering “Clue” clearly provided some inspiration. Perhaps season two.

The series earns its TV-MA rating for a few moderately gory scenes — and mostly for language, as characters constantly drop f-bombs. (Note this review reflects 8 episodes provided to screen.) Considering Martin and Short’s history of tamer comic material, the coarseness seems unnecessary and reinforces Disney-owned Hulu’s reputation as not exactly family-friendly.

Classic Mystery Updated for Streaming Era

“Did you guys hear about that mysterious death in the park last night?” asks Short to his two companions in the pilot. “We could multitask a little bit, silo out a second investigation and do a second podcast.” Martin stops him: “No, we need to focus — only murders in the building.”

More than an offhand conversation that names the show, the exchange also reflects a truth about the series. Amid all the eccentric people and absurd situations, viewers find it’s influenced as much by Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rear Window” as by “Clue.” The trio continually narrows in on the horrific crime: who had the motive, means, and opportunity? Answers lead them to a cover-up involving multiple suspects over several years.

Red herrings abound, with the final episodes not only action-packed but also emotionally resonant. Even funnyman Short waxes philosophical when hinting at how it all wraps up. “I understand someone feeling they’re the victim,” he said in an interview. “Some people learn from their mistakes, and some people are destined to repeat them because they won’t accept any fault within themselves.”

Show co-creator Martin has expressed hopes that “Only Murders in the Building” will resonate so they’ll get the greenlight for future seasons. Whether it becomes the next binge-watch obsession or a hidden gem like Hulu’s “Hardy Boys” update, the story doesn’t give away its secrets easily — keeping viewers guessing possible outcomes to the end.

Rated TV-MA for coarse language, some violence and mature situations, “Only Murders in the Building” premieres its first three episodes August 31 on Hulu.

Kenosha Is A Liability For Democrats Because They Let It Go Up In Flames,"It’s been one year since an immigrant watched every vehicle in his car dealership go up in flames, one year since Rode’s Camera Shop became a pile of ashes and the country woke up to learn the name Kyle Rittenhouse after the teen killed two people. A year since businesses frantically tacked “Black Lives Matter” signs onto their storefronts and families spraypainted “Please, kids above” onto boarded-up windows hoping the mob would pass over them — ominous symbols that still remain after a full trip around the sun.

One year ago, a town in southeast Wisconsin reaped the consequences of the left-ignited race war when onlookers imposed racist motives onto a police officer — who had acted within his professional duty to protect the lives of a mother and her children — and subsequently set a city ablaze. That one incident and the nights of violence that ensued would not only change the people of Kenosha; it would also change the politics.

It isn’t that riot violence is partisan, although the 2020 summer of rage was undoubtedly fueled by the reckless race-baiting of the left-wing ruling class and carried out by Marxist so-called “racial justice” revolutionaries. Rather, the infamous riots that ravaged Kenosha last summer are politically significant because they unearthed the incontrovertible difference between our red and blue political leaders on upholding the law.

“I think those individuals … in Kenosha recognize that President Trump supported enforcing the law and supported public safety,” Rep. Bryan Steil, the congressman representing Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District, which is home to Kenosha, told The Federalist. “And the Democrats were beholden to the far left, and in particular, those calling to defund the police and refusing to support the men and women of law enforcement.”

Steil was referring specifically to Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers. Although the state’s top Democrat and his media sycophants have tried for the past 365 days to rewrite the events of last August, history condemns them.

With each executive decision, the governor prioritized the most radical wing of his party over law and order. In fact, Evers didn’t merely respond incorrectly to the violence; he helped ignite it, blasting out anti-police statements before any facts of the Jacob Blake shooting had come to light. For example, in the hours after Blake was shot on Sunday, Evers tweeted:

Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kathy and I join his family, friends, and neighbors in hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his injuries. — Governor Tony Evers (@GovEvers) August 24, 2020

“We must see the trauma, fear, and exhaustion of being black in our state and our country,” Evers said, stoking the flame in a video address he posted the following day. He also tweeted about his administration’s legislative efforts “to increase accountability and transparency” in policing and endorsed statements decrying “racial injustice and systemic oppression” in Wisconsin communities. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes jumped in the ring too.

To everyone that is as tired as I am, know that I stand with you in the fight for a better world—a world where Black lives actually matter. A world with decency, with true justice, equity, and opportunity for all Black people. — Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes (@LGMandelaBarnes) August 24, 2020

“The executive came out and decided that it was incumbent upon him to be judge and jury and executioner and issued a statement that was so inflammatory, that cops across Wisconsin came out and said, ‘We prefer you not say things like that — at all,’ ” former Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch told The Federalist.

Kleefisch was talking about a letter the presidents of four different law enforcement organizations in the state sent to Evers on Aug. 27, four days after the Blake shooting, asking the governor to “discontinue and refrain from making statements” about the Blake shooting until the facts of the case were investigated because they said he was putting police in danger. They said his comments were “premature, judgmental, inflammatory and only add[ing] to the anger and divisiveness of an already dangerous situation.”

Evers’s rhetoric “just shows a governor who is completely out of touch with Regular Wisconsinites,” Kleefisch said, noting a nationwide poll from Marquette University showing 80 percent favorability toward police. He’s “particularly out of touch with the needs of people in crisis, like the folks in Kenosha who desperately needed help.”

But it wasn’t just the Democrat’s race-baiting commentary that fueled the city’s fiery nights. It was also Evers’s lack of leadership and refusal to deploy adequate National Guardsmen or federal back-up, despite pleas from local leaders all the way up to the president of the United States.

Kenosha county board members formally requested 1,500 National Guard members on Aug. 26, a request Evers did not accommodate. In fact, more than 24 hours after the Blake shooting, during the second night of rioting, Evers sent only 125 guardsmen, saying it was the best he could do. That’s fewer than he deployed for crowd control last month for the NBA finals in Milwaukee.

Kenosha Needed More Than a Few National Guards

The National Guard wasn’t his only option, however, as Steil explained. Beyond simply deploying guardsmen for crowd control, the governor could have requested federal assistance to fill a more traditional law enforcement role, such as U.S. marshals, FBI agents, or people from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to handle arson issues. That’s why, hearing the pleas of Kenoshans, the congressman called the White House switchboard and worked his way up until he got on the phone with Trump to request assistance.

“Well, Bryan, your governor hasn’t called me,” Steil said, recalling Trump’s response to his request. “Let me get this straight, Bryan. You want me to call your governor?” And that’s exactly what the president did.

Despite the White House extending a hand, however, the Evers administration turned it down — that is, until the fatal Rittenhouse shooting, which happened exactly one year ago last night. That’s what it took for Evers to accept help from the Republican president. In fact, the official response from the governor’s office was that he “would not need federal assistance in response to protests, but would welcome additional federal support and resources for our state’s response to COVID-19.”

“Donald Trump was the man who showed leadership in the throes of riots and crisis,” Kleefisch said. “In fact, Tony Evers did not even show up in Kenosha until four days after the fact. Two men had to lose their lives and 50 businesses had to be destroyed in order for Tony Evers to bother showing up.”

Evers eventually relented, accepting federal help and upping the National Guard count to 500 troops, after an estimated $50 million dollars in property damage affecting 100 businesses (with 40 of them now “out-of-business for good”), three people shot, and two of them dead. Steil said that if Evers had accepted help sooner, the Rittenhouse shooting on Tuesday night of that fiery week “for sure” wouldn’t have happened.

“Nobody should have been on the streets on Tuesday night, nobody,” Steil said. “They should have had sufficient resources and enforced a curfew and all of this. Everything that occurred on Tuesday night could have been avoided.”

Since When Does Evers Care about ‘Official Channels’?

To this day, Evers’ defenders say he fulfilled “all requests for assistance we received via official channels,” but his detractors say, “Who cares?” All it would have taken was the governor turning on the news or answering a call from a concerned citizen to know that his public relations prattle about “official channels” wouldn’t be enough to protect his constituents in Kenosha and their livelihoods.

“Talk to them, figure out what they need,” Steil said. “You’re the governor, you get to decide whether or not something is needed or not in the end. And clearly, the evidence is overwhelming that for three nights in a row, he failed to provide sufficient resources.”

“Evers’ version of official channels is mind-boggling,” Kleefisch added. “This is the same man who permitted a secret recording of legislative leaders. I wonder if he thinks things like that are somehow official channels.”

Evers’ office did not return The Federalist’s request for comment.

This Is Bad News for the Governor

None of this bodes well for Wisconsin’s governor, who will be up for reelection next November. Despite the media’s best efforts, evidence shows many of the state’s voters are fed up with crime and with leaders who aren’t willing to crack down on it. For instance, in the inner city of Kenosha, now-President Joe Biden fared worse than expected in the 2020 presidential election, losing the purple county by 3 percentage points.

Even Democrat voters are concerned about crime. A 2022 Democratic primary poll conducted last month in Kenosha’s neighbor Milwaukee showed that “lowering crime and increasing neighborhood safety” are top issues for even blue voters.

Election results are about more than riots, however, and in the 2022 gubernatorial race, they’ll be based on Wisconsin’s 72 counties, not just battered Kenosha. But polls show crime concerns are much bigger than isolated riots. According to the Marquette University poll, 69 percent of registered Wisconsin voters think crime is rising nationwide, with 43 percent saying it is higher in their communities.

“If you take a look at what has happened in Wisconsin over the last year, you’ve seen a drive-by shooting in the Wisconsin Dells, waterpark capital of the world, right? You’ve seen a shooting two blocks off of State Street, where we like to advertise the world’s largest outdoor farmer’s market right by the Wisconsin State Capitol. You saw a state senator beat until he was unconscious and left on the Capitol lawn while rioters destroyed statues and tried to firebomb the City County building,” Kleefisch said. “Even the NBA championship celebration was interrupted by shootings.”

“These are the news cycles that our everyday Wisconsinites are watching,” Kleefisch continued. “And to see this type of thing bleed into everyday conversations is a sad change from what we saw just a few short years ago, and I think it is a direct result of the abdication of leadership and the weakness of Gov. Tony Evers.”

Everyday Wisconsinites are watching, and like the Kenoshans whose windows are still boarded, they won’t soon forget.

Newsom Recall Challenges Democrat Party Plans To Californicate America,"For much of the last decade, journalists have described “the California model” of high taxes, strong regulations, and aggressive action on climate change as the progressive template for the rest of the United States. After voters elected Donald Trump president in 2016, they elevated California as the leader of the national resistance to his administration and agenda. And in January reporters noted that “California is emerging as the de facto policy think tank of the Biden-Harris administration and of a Congress soon to be under Democratic control.”

But with growing evidence that California voters may recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom from office next month, the tenor of news media coverage is starting to change. CNN yesterday aired a segment headlined, “Democratic Support for California Gov. Gavin Newsom Is Dwindling.” In it, three lifelong Democratic women in Los Angeles said they were leaning toward voting for the recall because of rising crime and homelessness.

The recall is by no means assured to happen. The most recent fundraising numbers showed that Newsom had ten times more money to spend than the top-polling Republican in the race, conservative radio show host Larry Elder. Forty-six percent of voters are Democrats and just 24 percent are Republicans. And Elder’s opposition to abortion, the minimum wage, and laws banning gender discrimination is viewed as fringe by most California voters.

‘Homelessness Is Making Progressive Voters Moderate’

But when you interview Democrats in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, it is striking how many say they are leaning toward voting yes on the recall. “Homelessness is making progressive voters moderate,” a Democratic strategist told CNN, “because they’re so upset.” On Tuesday, Michelle Tandler, a San Francisco native who is one of the city’s most influential moderate Democrats, surveyed 2,600 of her Twitter followers and found 43 percent thought Newsom would be recalled compared to 33 percent who thought he wouldn’t be.

All of this has come as a shock to many Democrats nationally. “I think a lot of left-of-center people are confused as to why Republicans might be within distance of winning the election in California when most Californians aren’t conservative,” tweeted influential center-left commentator Zaid Jilani earlier this week. “It’s because incumbents aren’t entitled to the job forever if they are not performing well.”

The possibility of a political earthquake as large as Brexit and the election of Trump in 2016 may lead CNN and other news media to increasingly acknowledge that what we call “homelessness” stems less from poverty and high rents and more from drug addiction and untreated mental illness. “Let me work. Let me pay my taxes,” said one of the women CNN interviewed. “But provide me with safety and not be accosted by two homeless people within the matter of 15 minutes.”

While cost of living plays a role in homelessness, rents rose in many American cities, such as Chicago and Miami, over the last 15 years, even as homelessness declined. What determines whether there are large numbers of unsheltered people in the streets is whether cities have built sufficient homeless shelters, and required people to use them.

“New York [City] has made the decision that everyone should have an exit from the street,” moderate San Francisco Supervisor Rafael Mandelman told me last year. “San Francisco has consciously chosen not to make that commitment. And the conditions on New York’s streets versus San Francisco streets are somewhat reflective of what that means.”

I heard from many Democrats inside and outside of California, including friends and family, after I endorsed the recall of Newsom, and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer as his replacement, earlier this week. Some accused me of being hyperbolic for claiming that our civilization and humanity are at stake.

Others pointed out that, if the recall passes, Elder was more likely to win than Faulconer, who is a liberal Republican, and thus threaten abortion rights, the minimum wage, and higher fuel economy standards. Others worried that Sen. Diane Feinstein, who is widely rumored to be suffering from dementia, could leave office before her term ends, leaving it to a Republican governor to select her replacement.

A Humanitarian Crisis

But these concerns are overblown and fail to address the urgency of the humanitarian and public safety crisis in California. What’s hyperbolic is the idea that a Governor Elder could override a supermajority of Democrats in the legislature to undo decades of employment, abortion, and other laws in the nine months before he is up for re-election, or that he would choose to use his highly limited political capital on culture war rather than addressing homelessness.

As for Feinstein, there is little reason to think she is more likely to step down in the next eight months than she was during the last eight months, and will likely remain in office through next spring, by when Democrats will have passed their agenda through Congress and turned to the 2022 midterm elections.

While much of the concern among Democrats is routine partisan tribalism, many betray the same confusion toward “homelessness” that has characterized the party’s response for 30 years. Democrats who don’t have to confront the crisis of untreated mental illness and addiction directly, either because they don’t live in California or because they don’t live in its biggest cities, still haven’t come to grips with just how terrible the situation has become. They are thus more worried about symbolic concerns, like culture war issues, than about skyrocketing deaths from drugs, and the sexual assault, arson, and homicide occurring in open drug scenes referred to euphemistically as “homeless encampments.”

As for California’s other much-hyped progressive successes, they are largely illusory. The only accurate way to calculate the poverty rate is by factoring in the cost of living, and when demographers do so, they find that California has the highest poverty rate in the nation. The state’s official anti-racist religion masks atrocious racial disparities.

Sixty-nine percent of San Francisco’s white public school students are proficient in math compared to 14 percent and 24 percent of its black and Latino students. And California’s effort to substitute solar panels for nuclear and natural gas plants has resulted in electricity shortages, prices rising much more than in the rest of the United States, and the growing use of diesel generators.

Given how badly California has performed on social justice and environmental metrics, it’s remarkable how long it’s taken the news media to report basic facts. “Problems grow,” reported CNN correspondent Kyung Lah, in a report this week. “Wildfires. Crime. Cost of living. But the worst for [voters]: homelessness, which expanded through the pandemic into neighborhoods in middle class Los Angeles.”

Why is that? Why does it take political earthquakes, from Brexit and Trump in 2016 to the Yellow Vests in France in 2018, to the recall election in California in 2021, for mainstream journalists to report on the public’s discontent with progressive policies?

‘Crime Don’t Climb’

On homelessness, part of the problem is that journalists have relied on progressive advocates and experts, who have been misleading them for decades. “We’ve always known that most homelessness is a result, pure and simple, of poverty,” University of California, San Francisco, homelessness researcher Margot Kushel told The New York Times last year. One of the biggest myths is that it is “caused by mental health and substance use problems,” Kushel explained. “We know that most homelessness is driven by economic forces.”

But reporters didn’t have to take Kushel’s word for it. They could have read one of the most important books ever written on homelessness in San Francisco, the 2010 “Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders,” by sociologist Teresa Gowan, for an alternative view. “Ain’t no homelessness problem in my opinion,” one homeless man tells her. “The problem is addiction, period. Even those people that have schizophrenia or something else like that, generally you find they have a big problem with addiction as well.”

Part of the problem is that progressive journalists, like progressives generally, are out-of-touch with what life is like in downtown neighborhoods. Things don’t seem so bad if you live in hilltop neighborhoods like the Berkeley Hills, Bernal Heights, and Noe Valley. There is an ugly expression in San Francisco: “Crime don’t climb.” Said a San Francisco native to me recently, “The richer people are, the higher they go.”

Democrat Voters Want to Read Fake News

Another problem is that progressive consumers of the news demand fake news from reporters. On Twitter, many progressives complained that the women Lah had interviewed weren’t representative. “Congratulations, you found three outliers to do a story about,” said one. “They were never Democrats,” said another. “Not EVER.” One person claimed, “None of women gave any concrete reason as to why they would vote yes,” even though they explicitly said they were voting yes because of the threat to public safety posed by homeless people in psychotic states.

Psychologists find that most of us seek to confirm our existing biases. It is hard on our pride to confront disconfirmatory information. If you believe that “homelessness is a result, pure and simple, of poverty,” you’ll go looking for experts to explain away the obvious signs of addiction and mental illness.

If you believe that renewables are the future, you’ll look for experts to explain away California’s seven-fold higher increases in electricity prices and increasingly frequent blackouts. And if you believe Republicans are evil incarnate, you’ll look for reasons to justify the status quo, even though the status quo killed 93,000 Americans, including many children, last year.

Expressions like “Crime don’t climb” betray some awareness among progressives that they live in a bubble, but for many it reinforces their prior views. The more aware many progressives become of the worsening chaos, the more social pressure they feel to signal their virtue, whether by putting a Black Lives Matter sign in their window, declaring climate change a threat to civilization, or voting against the recall. Many progressives react to information that challenges their prior beliefs by seeking news media coverage that reassures rather than challenges them.

“California Democratic recall messaging seems to almost entirely be based on fear tactics,” observed Jilani. “All of them are talking about what voters should fear from Republicans, not talking about what they’d promise to do with their Democratic supermajority+Governor in the next year … If Republicans had mounted a well-funded campaign against Newsom, they would maybe even be in the lead now.”

The National Impact of the Newsom Recall Vote

But if Newsom is recalled, the entire progressive Democratic project will be called into question, and not just in California. After all, California has explicitly been the model for what progressives and Democrats, including Biden and Harris, have been trying to do nationally. If voters reject that model in California, then what claim to legitimacy could it possibly have in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania?

If the recall passes, Democrats will have no choice but to change course on homelessness, drugs, and crime. The shift is already underway in New York, where Democrats elected a moderate, Eric Adams, a former police officer who ran on a tough-on-crime agenda. If Newsom survives the recall, he will be forced to change course, or face defeat in 2022. And if a Democrat is elected California’s governor in November 2022, she or he won’t be the same kind of Democrat Newsom has been.

As such, the California model is dead, no matter what happens in the recall, and thus so too is the progressive agenda. This is partly because Democrats have succeeded in implementing so much of it, including tens of billions to reduce child poverty and subsidize renewables. But it is also because the progressive agenda has so manifestly failed in the state that has implemented it the most.

California has long been the harbinger of national change, and may be that once again. Whatever happens in the recall, Democrats must start taking open air drug scenes, untreated mental illness, and addiction seriously. That should start with the recognition that addressing the 93,000 annual drug deaths must come before fuel economy standards, long-dead culture war issues, and who will replace Diane Feinstein.

Democratic Mayors Refuse To Take Action As Violent Crime Surges In Pennsylvania,"Amid surging crime in Pennsylvania’s largest cities, it remains unclear if Democratic leadership is up to the task of ensuring law and order.

Take Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, who faces intensifying criticism as the city grapples with a public safety crisis. This year, 137 children under age 18 have been shot in city neighborhoods, and 32 have died. “That’s a bullet ripping into a young person’s body every 40 hours,” wrote the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Helen Ubiñas.

Last month, after a 15-year-old girl was shot in the head in North Philadelphia (she died the next day), community activists called for Kenney to deploy the Pennsylvania National Guard in the crime-ridden city. Kenney, though, said it is not an “effective tool to bring in uniformed, camouflaged, gun-rifle-carrying people in helmets to address [the crime] problem.”

Recent data indicate that Philadelphia, where crime declined in the early 2010s, is now the second-deadliest city in the United States behind Chicago. As the Philadelphia Inquirer recently put it, “There’s only been one day so far this year – Jan. 2 – when not a single person was shot in the city.” The city experienced a 30-year homicide high in 2020. So far this year, homicides are up more than 24 percent and shootings more than 25 percent, according to data from the Philadelphia Police Department.

“The epidemic of gun violence in Philadelphia is out of control and our elected officials in the city need to step up and take responsibility,” said Nick Gerace, a retired longtime Philadelphia police officer and president of Protect Our Police PAC.

Prosecutions have fallen dramatically under Larry Krasner, the city’s progressive district attorney who has sparred with Kenney. As it stands, 65 percent of gun charges have been dismissed or withdrawn this year, marking a 17 percent increase since 2015. In 2015, there were 375 guilty pleas; in 2020, just 148.

Yet Kenney has deflected blame. In July, for example, the mayor sent a letter to a city council member who favors declaring the gun crisis an “emergency” and claimed that doing so “is not a solution that will demonstrably change conditions in Philadelphia.”

Earlier this summer, after the City Council voted to cut police funding by $33 million for fiscal year 2021, the mayor agreed to eliminate a $19 million increase and cut existing funding by $14 million.

Carlos Vega, a longtime assistant district attorney who unsuccessfully ran against Krasner in May’s Democratic primary, told me that the defund-the-police movement will fail.

“It’s communities of color being killed,” Vega said, observing how 85 percent of this year’s homicide victims are black. “People have not thought through the impact defund the police is going to have on communities who are suffering the most.”

Philadelphia is not alone among Pennsylvania cities in failing to stave off crime. Often overlooked amid the nationwide crime surge is Pittsburgh, in recent years considered the Rust Belt’s greatest urban success story.

Following last summer’s riots, homicides have about doubled in Pittsburgh in 2021 over the first six months. As recently as April, the city saw a 90 percent surge in violence, with police officers pleading for more programs and funding. Young people continue to fall victim to violence, and nonfatal shootings are up about 68%, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In late August, the University of Pittsburgh warned students about “violent criminal activity,” especially in the popular South Side neighborhood.

Still, earlier this year, Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto slashed the police budget by $5.3 million. Last summer, not long after a disorderly demonstrator was arrested near Peduto’s neighborhood – leading to protests at his house – the mayor acknowledged the “right for people to take to the streets to demand much-needed reforms.”

But Peduto’s praise for protesters wasn’t enough to survive the city’s Democratic mayoral primary this past May. The more progressive Ed Gainey is poised to win his job in November.

Gainey, a state representative who earned endorsements from Democratic socialists and a major health care union, went so far as to accuse Peduto of “overpolicing” the city. He has pledged to “redirect” law enforcement funds to social services.

Pittsburgh’s GOP insiders see no end in sight to the city’s surging crime. Bob Hillen, chairman of the Republican Committee of Pittsburgh, thinks that far-left Democratic leadership under Gainey will continue to give crime a “free pass.”

“We could use more police on the streets right now,” Hillen told me. “I mean, every night there is a shooting. This is well out of hand. We have to do something quick.”

Other regional Republicans are more optimistic. When asked about getting the Steel City’s crime situation under control, Republican state Rep. Rob Mercuri of Allegheny County said, “We can do this if we work together in the Pittsburgh region.”

The GOP is strategizing on how to oust Democrats in a historically moderate state. The focus is on Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. “Bill Peduto and Jim Kenney are gaslighting and deflecting blame,” says Allie Carroll, spokeswoman for the state Republican National Committee.

Kenney is term-limited, with Philadelphia’s next mayoral race in 2022, while Gainey is primed to assume office in a city that hasn’t elected a Republican mayor in 88 years. So Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, two Democratic strongholds, find themselves in similar straits. Will their problems trigger a statewide political backlash?

Can Republicans Play Hardball On Impeaching Biden?,"“The president is not going to be removed from office,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell when asked about the growing calls for the impeachment of President Joe Biden as a result of his failures with the Afghanistan withdrawal. Noting that Democrats control both the House and Senate, he bluntly told a Kentucky group it’s “not going to happen,” and added, “I think the way these behaviors get adjusted in this country is at the ballot box.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy chimed in on the question already brewing before the Afghanistan debacle, saying it “is so serious it should only be taken” in extreme cases. “If Biden takes an illegal action, we would move impeachment. But we’re not going to move … for political purposes.”

Those views embody the prevalent position of Congress over a two-centuries-long period in which only two presidents were impeached. The common understanding across political parties was that the constitutional requirement of “high crimes and misdemeanors” meant just that: “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

That all gave way to a new threshold during the Donald Trump presidency, though, one that could accurately be called the “Nike Rule”: “Just do it.”

No Limits: ‘Treason,’ Anyone?

From the beginning, Democrats’ lack of restraint and reason was on full display. In an opinion article entitled “Impeach Trump,” a cryptic one-line argument was presented: “It’s not too early to start.” It was published in The New York Daily News on March 2, 2016—almost a year before Trump was sworn in as president.

Just six months after his inauguration, the first article of impeachment was formally filed in the House of Representatives. Three months later, a second charge came. Shortly thereafter, a batch of five new articles were filed. And so it went—for four years.

Along the way, the press was aflush with articles such as these:

Those were published articles. It got much worse on social media.

Say what you will, but Democrats are not afraid to fight. They battle day in and day out, and they don’t break ranks. If anything, they compete to one-up each other in their zealous pursuit of enemies.

Despising Trump’s very existence, they skipped past censure and went straight for the jugular—impeachment. Not only were they not content to allow an election to handle matters, they actually tried him after he had left office.

In the end, the mob was barely sated with a charge of “incitement of insurrection.” Some argued for treason—a crime punishable by death—but to their dismay found it was legally limited to the enabling of a foreign enemy, not a domestic one, as was alleged to have arisen on January 6, 2021. So there was no gallows.

Clearly, there is no limit on the bombastic rhetoric from Democrats, nor are they embarrassed by any of it. Yet Republican leaders still prefer to play the game by different rules that disadvantage their voters. Even after watching the 45th president be pummeled for years by false allegations, corrupt investigations, and endless calls for impeachment—capped by the actual deed pulled off, not once but twice, in his last 14 months in office—they still seem oblivious to the change in war tactics.

They fight like noblemen of old, standing at attention in line in an open field, ready to trade musket balls with the enemy—as they’re picked off from behind trees, one by one. Perhaps they never heard Gen. George Patton’s admonition that “no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.”

The Constitutional Case Against Biden

Although the Afghanistan matter is drawing the most attention at this time, other known abuses of power should not be overlooked. Congress has a duty to act when high crimes are committed, and there’s strategic value in pursuing multiple issues, as Democrats have shown.

The truth is that Republicans do not have to sacrifice ethics or the Constitution in seeking an impeachment of Joe Biden. There is ample evidence of Constitutional abuses, derelictions of duty, and possible crimes, including the following:

President Biden abused his powers by directing the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to target political opponents under the guise of protecting the United States from “domestic violent extremism.”

President Biden abandoned his oath of office and his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed by refusing to enforce statutes that govern immigration.

President Biden directed private companies to restrict the speech of Americans, thereby corruptly using a proxy to violate their First Amendment rights.

President Biden unconstitutionally enacted a ban on evictions without the approval of Congress and in defiance of the Supreme Court.

Biden abused his powers as an official of the U.S. government to induce foreign investments and payments to his family and himself.

Also, of course, there is Afghanistan, for which a persuasive case can be made for impeachment based on dereliction of duty—or worse. Impeachment of Biden can coexist and possibly further punishing the military and administrative brass whose heads should roll over the disaster as well.

Consider that every move Trump made over four years was critiqued through a lens that portrayed him as a “Putin puppet.” But what about the “the Big Guy?”

Are his equity holdings abroad affecting his decision-making? Why would a president allow China, Russia, and others the chance to rip apart our Blackhawk helicopters and other weapons, revealing classified technology? Is that action itself criminal? As our sailors on nuclear submarines can attest, even the release of pictures of classified equipment is a felony offense. Democrats would not ignore or merely comment on any of this if a Republican were president. As Joe might say, “It’s a big f—ing deal.”

There’s also the video of Biden regaling an audience with the story of his quid-pro-quo with the Ukrainians. Fire the prosecutor “or you’re not getting the billion dollars,” he said. It perfectly mirrors the unsubstantiated charge lobbed at Trump in his first impeachment. As Democrats have made clear, impeachment powers are also not limited to the president’s time in office, and this was a textbook definition of “abuse of power.”

Who with “corrupt motives” recently withheld another $100 million that Congress had appropriated to help “Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression?” That would be Biden—holding up the funds as a reward to the Russians for moving some troops to boost his political capital before the G-7 summit.

In addition, Democrats charged that President Trump had obstructed justice by directing agencies and offices to “defy lawful subpoenas” issued to obtain documents for their investigation. Has Biden unconstitutionally directed officials in Arizona, via the Department of Justice, to defy a lawful subpoena in the production of documents—and routers—related to an investigation of his election?

Democrats would have a field day with any of these. Republicans? They’re too busy coming up with all the reasons they can’t do anything while demanding that voters hand them back control of Congress—but for what? More excuses?

Why Impeach?

Republican leaders are clearly nervous at the mere mention of “impeachment.” Besides their natural inclination to avoid dust-ups that might wrinkle their pressed suits, there is also the pragmatic concern: “Why do this, only to end up with a Kamala Harris presidency?”

The answer lies in another question: Did Democrats ever slow down their impeachment efforts over the “ultra-conservative” VP who would take Trump’s place? No, because their efforts were more focused on Sun Tzu than Mike Pence. They knew that chaos creates opportunity, and “opportunities multiply as they are seized.” Impeachment was just a tool to drive the chaos. Pence would never be president.

If a Harris presidency were to occur, is there any reason to believe the policies would differ substantially from those of the Biden administration, whoever that actually is? And would any president unimpaired by cognitive issues be better able to avoid foreign policy meltdowns?

The Process Is the Point

Democrats figured out the secret to winning a political war: being political. Wield every weapon possible—allegations, investigations, and cries for impeachment. It all discombobulates the opponent, weakens the support of allies, and slows forward movement.

Although presidents historically benefit from a post-election mandate, pushing through key legislation while the iron is hot, Trump’s first 100 days were a “honeymoon from hell.” A full repeal of Obamacare never happened, and other legislative priorities were stalled.

The president commented in October 2017 that the Democrats “are very good at, really, obstruction.” They were just getting started. The next month, that batch of five new articles of impeachment were filed against him, built around a theme that he was a danger to the country. Democrats were already waging an effective political war—without control of the House or the Senate.

Can Republicans play this kind of hardball? Do they understand the value in it?

‘The Supreme Art of War’

McConnell must know there is no shortage of potential impeachment charges. It’s time to learn to battle. Democrats were never shy to act on the slightest rumor from a partisan whistleblower, or the worst interpretation of a perfectly legitimate phone call, or to twist the unruly actions of a few people into a full-blown “insurrection.”

Nor did they wait on majority status to launch their fusillade of impeachment attacks. In the end, they sought to tar and feather the president, even as he packed his bags to leave the White House. And they did, trumpeting, “the president is impeached for life!”

Sun Tzu advised that “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” So far, Democrats have done just that to their noble adversaries across the aisle.

Can GOP leaders awaken and summon the will to fight, to give their voters something to vote for in 2022 and 2024? Can they hold Biden accountable? Several members are stirring, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy may be getting the message from voters, so perhaps momentum is building. Take it from Democrats, congressman, it’s not too early to start.

'Real Housewives Of Salt Lake City' Propels Bravo's True Crime Trend,"The long-awaited return of Bravo’s “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” underscores the creeping true-crimeification of the network’s popular reality fare. Like this fan-favorite season of the Beverly Hills housewives, RHOSLC promises to document in painful detail the legal drama surrounding one of its stars. It’s great television.

The trend also emphasizes the salience of a major question dogging our pop culture: What is it with women and true crime?

One of the biggest problems with “Only Murders in the Building” is that two of its three main characters are men. In a Spotify article probing “why women are so obsessed with True Crime,” social psychologist Amanda Vicary said, “My research suggests that women are drawn to true crime because of the information they can learn from it, even if they aren’t aware that that may be the reason they are listening!” A Mother Jones article last year noted, “The podcast Wine and Crime reports that women make up 85 percent of its audience, which lines up with a 2018 study that found that 73 percent of true crime podcast listeners are women.”

The conflicts on Bravo are often centered around mysteries: Does Brooks actually have cancer? Did Lisa plant the story? What did Teresa know? Is Aviva really asthmatic? But Jen Shah, Mary Cosby, and Erika Girardi find themselves in the middle of allegations they committed serious crimes, allegations that played out as cameras were rolling. (Erika claims, often convincingly, to have had no knowledge of her husband’s alleged financial crimes.)

In the case of Shah, RHOSLC’s second season premiere starts out with a flash-forward to the day of her arrest, promising a season thick with drama and intrigue. The episode then allows Shah to display her riches, seemingly unaware or unconcerned with the optics and legal implications. For viewers, most of whom are likely female, the unsolved mysteries gives each episode an added layer of immediacy and a sense of higher stakes as they scan cast members’ behavior for clues and evidence.

Shah, according to the indictment against her and her assistant, “allegedly generated and sold ‘lead lists’ of innocent individuals for other members of their scheme to repeatedly scam.” None of her aggressively luxurious lifestyle adds up, something the producers subtly emphasize throughout the premiere episode. Even subtly, she’s an incredible character.

The allegations against Cosby, stemming from former members of the church she oversees, are equally if not more compelling. “All the rumors are that Mary is a cult leader,” says one of the women.

I always think of the “Housewives” as docuseries as much as reality series (the good franchises, at least). They’re incredible commentaries on American decadence, and incredibly funny too. True crime, then, makes for a seamless genre merger.

It should also be a wake-up call to the network and its super fans that reality television is about antiheroes. Viewers don’t need them to be protagonists and social justice activists; they need them to be authentic and interesting and that’s just fine. By bringing Shah and Cosby back to the series, Bravo seems to concede this — at least when the crime isn’t political incorrectness. It’s also always worth reiterating that it’s fine for TV stars to be bad people so long as their platforms serve as commentaries on their immorality, which is exactly what Bravo does.

This season of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” is riveting wherever you stand on Girardi’s innocence. With two accused criminals, one currently battling charges, RHOSLC is off to an enormously promising start. We’re all wondering exactly how guilty Shah is, but another question to ponder is why are women currently so hooked on true crime? Bravo is bringing us closer to an answer.

"Amid Left-Wing ‘Defund The Police’ Push, Murders Rise Nearly 30 Percent","Amid a left-wing campaign to “defund the police,” murder rates in the United States skyrocketed in 2020 by nearly 30 percent.

According to the FBI’s 2020 crime statistics, there were more than 1,277,696 violent crimes committed in the United States in 2020. While robbery and rape offenses fell in 2020 compared to 2019, murder and “nonnegligent manslaughter offenses” increased by 29.4 percent. Motor vehicle thefts have also increased by 11.8 percent since 2019.

“For the first time in four years, the estimated number of violent crimes in the nation increased when compared with the previous year’s statistics,” the FBI admitted in a press release.

The numbers, which indicate a national crime surge, come shortly after Democrat-led city councils in Austin, Los Angeles, D.C., Baltimore, and Minneapolis voted to divert funds away from law enforcement or cut budgets that would have allowed for more officers to patrol the streets. The cuts were initiated shortly after the “summer of rage” in 2020 following the death of George Floyd. It was during this time that thousands of people rioted in the streets, calling “all cops b-stards” and even saying they should die.

While property crimes technically dropped by 7.8 percent compared to 2019, the FBI noted that “collectively, victims of property crimes (excluding arson) suffered losses estimated at $17.5 billion in 2020.”

That number does not include arson, which plagued many of the nation’s cities in 2020 during the Floyd riots. According to estimates made during the peak of rioting, the first three weeks of violence in 2020, which included arson, cost an estimated $2 billion to recover. Other reports suggest looting costs in America’s 20 largest metropolitan areas exceeded $400 million from just the first weekend of rioting, looting, arson, and other crimes committed in the name of “racial justice.”

It was during this summer of rage that leftists latched onto the “defund the police” narrative. Soon after, law enforcement agencies around the nation began to suffer from understaffing during a period of heightened crime, especially in major metropolitan areas.

The FBI report notes that the total number of officers employed in the United States fell to 696,644 despite a larger number of agencies (13,377) reporting their staffing numbers. In 2019, a smaller number of law enforcement agencies (13,247) reported that they had 697,195 sworn officers.

"Of All The Third-World Cities I’ve Lived In, Baltimore Was The Worst","It only took seven months after my family and I moved to Baltimore in January for us to move out. We’re hardly the only ones leaving — in 2020, Baltimore lost more residents than did any other major U.S. city. At one point, my Brazilian husband remarked, “I thought America was a developed country.”

His observation is particularly telling because, before coming to Baltimore, we spent five years living abroad in two of the most dangerous places in the world – Brazil and South Africa. In many ways, life in those countries was easier than life in Charm City.

The residents of Baltimore pay some of the highest taxes in the country for some of the worst public services. Crime is a constant threat, even though the neighborhood where we lived is usually labeled “gentrifying.” A professional exterminator warned us never to buy second-hand furniture due to the prevalence of bed bugs. Everyone on our block kept a cat – often two or three – to combat the rodents.

After we fled to the suburbs, I was left pondering why life in Brazil and South Africa was easier — particularly South Africa, which has many parallels with America because it reached a fairly high level of development, but ruinous government policies are now driving it backward. Public services in South Africa have been so deeply riddled with corruption and mismanagement for so long, citizens have learned to do without or developed workarounds, something the residents of Baltimore haven’t learned yet.

Ballooning Crime and Ill-Equipped Police

Baltimore and South Africa are both infamous for high crime rates. In South Africa, police are helpless and incompetent. For example, a few years ago, the police cybercrimes unit had to drop hundreds of cases because they forgot to pay for their software licenses. They can also be corrupt; South Africans told me stories about police officers demanding bribes to do routine tasks like writing up a car accident report.

As a result, everyone from the lower middle class and upward pays for private security. In the small city where we lived, a local security firm patrolled the streets like a private police force. Even the police sometimes hire private security to guard their precincts.

In Baltimore, the number of reported homicides reached a record high in 2015 after the city erupted in riots at the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. In the wake of the riots, police became less visible on the streets, and they have not returned. The Baltimore police department operates with around 400 unfilled vacancies. The city’s homicide rate has yet to fall to pre-2015 levels.

While the current condition and recent history of police in Baltimore and South Africa are different, the outcome is the same: criminals run rampant. Neighborhoods and businesses in Baltimore appear to be gradually moving towards the South African solution: private security.

South Africans do not mess around with their safety. In addition to hiring private security, they protect their houses with things like tall electric fences, CCTV, guard dogs, and motion sensors. People in Baltimore are still naïve in that regard. I followed several online groups for city residents. Many of the posts were by people whose houses had just been burgled, who often shared images from their security cameras. I was amazed to note most of them did not even have a fence in their backyards.

Decrepit Public Services

I also found myself surprised that people in Baltimore – and Americans in general – still rely heavily on the U.S. Postal Service. We sometimes only saw our mailman once a week and he often brought us other people’s mail. In South Africa, the postal service has been a disaster for so long that many people have stopped sending mail at all.

Other public services in South Africa were just as bad. Usually, the poor are left with scraps, while those with money usually pay twice: once in taxes for worthless public services and then for a private solution that actually works.

Electricity is very expensive in South Africa because the state utility Eskom is corrupt and mismanaged. Millions of people live without electricity, while those who can afford to pay Eskom’s rates also have to buy generators or solar panels as a backup for the regular power outages.

South Africa’s constitution includes the right to water, but this right is violated all over their country every day. The tap water in the city where we lived was unsafe, so we bought large containers from one of the many local “water shops.” Other people take it a step further by drilling boreholes and installing their own filtration systems. In one city, a group of citizens took over running their local water and sewage plants because they were so badly mismanaged.

Community solidarity like this was common in South Africa, and made the difficulties manageable. South Africans organize private groups to do things like fill potholes, repair or repaint road signs, and collect garbage. They form neighborhood watch groups that partner with professional private security firms.

There are certainly significant tensions between different ethnic groups in South Africa, but within individual groups, I observed a very strong culture of looking out for one another. We lived in a college town, and students in their late teens and early twenties regularly helped us with things like home repairs or running errands. This was already their normal way of life. In a difficult country like South Africa, “going it alone” is not an option.

In Baltimore online discussion groups, people often posted comments like “we have to work together” or “we should stand up.” I agree, but until they turn those words turn into offline actions, life in their city will not improve much.

Baltimore is a particularly bad case. But in many other American cities, crime rates are rising and the quality of public services is dropping. If we have any hope of reversing the decay, we should take note and act now.

How Leftist Prosecutors Contributed To 2020's Massive Murder Spike,"The number of homicides in the United States increased around 30 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported last week, along with a 5.6 percent increase in violent crime in the same period.

This is no wonder, when prosecutors across the country have ceased prosecuting in the name of racial and economic equity. From Los Angeles and San Francisco to the Eastern seaboard, city attorneys are declining to prosecute cases, denying justice to victims, and creating dangerous cities.

Just as critical race theory has bled out of the big cities into small and unsuspecting jurisdictions, so too might prosecutors with visions of “reimagining” the criminal justice system come to a town near you.

Seattle’s Singularly Extreme Approach

Seattle deserves special recognition for its failure to provide even basic law and order, and things may be about to get worse as the city votes in November for a new city attorney. Responsible for prosecuting misdemeanors, the Seattle City Attorney’s Office has become a leftist experiment lab under Pete Holmes.

In 2019, Holmes’s office “declined to file charges in nearly half of non-traffic-related criminal cases, and of the cases it does charge, 42% did not have a meaningful resolution,” King 5 News reported. By the end of October 2020, his office had declined 143 of the 261 protest-related misdemeanor cases referred by the Seattle Police Department, NPR reported.

Last summer, the life of prolific offender Travis Berge came to a violent end – a tragic example of how Holmes’ leadership failed Berge and continues to fail Seattle. The notorious meth addict, who had boasted openly that he had beat the criminal justice system, had been arrested 47 times, racked up 35 convictions and violations, killed his partner, and then drowned himself in a tank of bleach. Instead of protecting Berge and his victims, the city of Seattle turned a blind eye, resulting in two needless deaths.

The situation in Seattle may soon go from bad to worse, as voters seem poised to replace a non-prosecuting prosecutor with a candidate who has actively encouraged criminal behavior. Holmes, city attorney since 2009, conceded a three-way primary race in August to his competitors: law-and-order moderate candidate Ann Davison and punishment opponent Nicole Thomas-Kennedy.

“I would like to abolish most of the criminal legal system,” Thomas-Kennedy told Fox13, “but it is a process. It doesn’t happen overnight.”

As the city faces a 3,000 municipal court case backlog, Thomas-Kennedy would scale back prosecuting to even greater extremes. The Seattle attorney’s office “should immediately stop prosecuting nearly all misdemeanors – especially ‘civility’ crimes like trespass and petty theft,” she told The Urbanist weeks before the primary.

Worse still, she has made comments that appear to overtly encourage violent and illegal behavior. At the height of the riots following the death of George Floyd in 2020, Thomas-Kennedy tweeted, “Property destruction, at this point, is a moral imperative.” She has since deleted the tweet and, when confronted by a local journalist, waved it off as a joke.

Even traditional liberals see the dangers of electing someone like Thomas-Kennedy. Most recently, two former Democratic governors of Washington State – Christine Gregoire and Gary Locke – endorsed Davison. In a statement about her endorsement of the Republican Davison, Gregoire told Fox13 News that she couldn’t throw her support behind “a person who believes in anarchy” (referencing Thomas-Kennedy).

The dismal reality is that, combined, the non-prosecutor Holmes and the penalty-abolitionist Thomas-Kennedy received more than 66 percent of the Seattle vote. Moderate Davison, who wants to focus instead on enforcing the law and providing alternative support for those suffering from mental illness and drug addiction, received 33 percent. Seattle voters should think long and hard before reflexively supporting Thomas-Kennedy.

Reimagining Criminal Justice Across America

Seattle’s situation, although extreme, is not unique. The criminal justice system in cities across America is being hijacked by prosecutors who will do anything but prosecute. This dangerous trend denies justice to victims and creates cities flourishing with crime.

Boston District Attorney Rachael Rollins, for instance, published a memo in 2019 listing 15 misdemeanors her office would automatically decline to prosecute, including shoplifting, trespassing, and wanton or malicious destruction of property. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner released a similar memo. Steve Descano, the commonwealth’s attorney in Fairfax, Virginia, followed suit, as have others.

“As a group, they see the police as the enemy, and criminal defendants as victims,” write the Heritage Foundation’s Charles “Cully” Stimson and Zack Smith. “In practice, their policies harm the very people they pretend to care about the most: low income and minority individuals.”

The results of these policies are sobering. “In a survey of six jurisdictions where progressive district attorneys serve, every city or county logged a lower overall felony-conviction rate, as well as a lower conviction rate for violent or serious crimes, than did their predecessors,” writes Jason Johnson at City Journal. “On average, the profiled prosecutors dropped 20 percent more felony cases. Crime has risen dramatically.”

Your Locality Isn’t Immune

Lest you think your own locality is immune from such extremism, remember that the insidious and false “equity” ideas of critical race theory are being discovered throughout America’s schools, governments, and corporations – not just isolated to big, liberal cities like Seattle and L.A. Critical race theory has also made its way into the Midwest, the South, and widely used companies like Bank of America and Verizon. What starts among elites and in big cities too often spreads to the rest of the country, whether the general public desires it or not.

What might the solution be? It starts with an active and well-informed citizenry. The parental uprisings against teaching critical race theory in K-12 schools provide a suitable example of how concerns about malfeasance in the public sector can lead to decisive grassroots action. If you haven’t already been doing so, start paying attention to what is happening in your city government and local elections. Inform yourself on every candidate, their backgrounds, and their objectives.

Then, take action. Discuss your findings with your friends and neighbors. Attend public city meetings. Voice your opinion in those meetings. Vote accordingly. These prosecutors are elected by you, the general public, and it is you who holds the power to replace them with officials who will uphold the rule of law.

"The Left Wanted To Destroy The Police, And So Far They’ve Succeeded","For the past year-and-a-half, “police reform” has been at the center of public debate. After President Joe Biden and leftist Democrats took power, the radicals reintroduced their legislation to “reimagine” policing — the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

We were told that it was of momentous importance, yet three weeks ago, when it was announced that Senate negotiations had failed and the bill was finished, the overall reaction from the left was general indifference. Ruling class media expressed perfunctory outrage for a day or two, and then the issue disappeared. Why?

Let’s take a moment to consider how we got here. The real purpose of Democrats’ Black Lives Matter-inspired legislation was to destroy policing, not to improve it, as I observed last May. The bill was poison. It was built upon the big lie that American policing is systemically racist.

We saw almost a year of Black Lives Matter and Antifa mob violence with 574 riots; $2 billion in destruction, arson, and looting; at least 25 dead; and more than 2,000 police officers injured. To re-enforce this spirit of lawlessness, leftist prosecutors dismissed most charges against rioters and looters in Portland, New York City, and across the country.

While every aspect of the Democrat bill was designed to undermine law enforcement, two provisions would have directly dismantled the police and resulted in thousands more black people being killed. First, the bill would have stripped the protection of qualified immunity for individual officers, causing more officers to leave the job or retreat from fighting crime. Second, in deference to tenets of critical race theory, the bill would have made it law that any group-identity statistical disparities in investigation or enforcement results would constitute prima facie proof of racial profiling.

Law-abiding minority citizens want the police in their communities. Eighty-one percent of black Americans want to keep or increase the number of police officers in their neighborhoods. But this bill would have prevented police from proactively policing high-crime black communities. A leftist, race-based enforcement quota system would have permanently diverted vital police resources away from high violent-crime neighborhoods.

Mission Almost Accomplished

So why was the radical left so quiet when its legislative plan to destroy policing failed? Because their mission has already been almost completely accomplished. In virtually every major Democrat-run city and beyond, policing as we know it has been undermined beyond recognition — perhaps beyond repair.

The numbers speak for themselves. America’s crime epidemic saw a 30 percent homicide surge in 2020, the biggest ever. Almost 10,000 homicide victims were black — 53 percent of all victims, despite blacks constituting only 13 percent of the U.S. population.

The Black Lives Matter Marxists’ program of defunding, demonizing, and dismantling the police has emboldened criminals and caused police to pull back. The war on cops has also escalated. Already this year, 241 officers have been shot, 44 killed by gunfire, and ambush attacks have increased 103 percent.

Black Lives Matter, Democrats, the ruling class media, and rogue prosecutors have broken the police. Perpetuating the myth of systemic police racism has justified eliminating cash bail, ending qualified immunity, and enacting laws that practically legalize theft. In Democrat-run cities, proactive policing is dead. Officer morale is at rock bottom and many of the most qualified veterans are bailing out. Last year across the country, retirements increased by 45 percent and resignations by 18 percent.

Finally, the radical left has insidiously and effectively undermined our law and civil order through an organized takeover of states’ attorneys offices by radicals. Funded by leftist billionaire George Soros, these rogue prosecutors subvert the system from within — dismissing thousands of felony cases, failing to charge violent criminals, and arbitrarily refusing to prosecute quality-of-life crimes, such as public urination or prostitution.

In this way, no matter how effective local police are at arresting criminals, their efforts are sabotaged. Massive spikes in violence are directly connected to pro-criminal Soros prosecutors in Chicago, Baltimore, Austin, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and other Democrat-run jurisdictions.

Last year’s BLM/Antifa armed rioting and today’s out-of-control violent crime demonstrate that when the mob and street criminals run wild and police pull back, American civilization disintegrates. This is the ultimate objective of the leftist elites.

How Can We Fight Back?

Faced with such a vast array of anti-police power, what can we do? Two options remain. In Democrat-run cities, residents and neighbors must organize, speak out, and take grassroots political action outside the Democratic Party machine. In Republican states, citizens and elected leaders must enact unabashedly pro-police laws and policies — everything the Democrats are not.

Unfortunately, in most Democrat-run cities with leftist mayors and city councils, subversive prosecutors, and increasingly more woke police chiefs, things will get a lot worse before they get better. Violent crime is intensifying and spreading, but average citizens are beginning to fight back.

Austin, Texas, is ruled by a leftist Democrat mayor and city council who enacted one of the most radical defund the police efforts in the country — $150 million, one-third of the police budget, was cut. The result has been a public safety disaster. Homicides in the city have increased 44 percent over last year and 200 percent compared to five years ago. During the past year, police retirements increased 65 percent and resignations 63 percent. Undermanned, the Austin Police Department no longer responds to citizens’ 911 calls for eight categories of crimes and disturbances.

But Austin residents have stood up, putting an initiative on the November 2 ballot to hire more police officers and increase officer training. However, the arrogance and extent to which leftist elites will go to demolish the police knows no bounds. Soros, who funded the radical Travis County district attorney, has also sunk $500,000 into a campaign to defeat Austin citizens’ public safety initiative.

Florida Leads

Fighting for the police and preserving the rule of law in every Republican state is crucial. In this fight, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is leading the way.

Of all America’s governors, DeSantis has been the most outspoken in his support for police and the rule of law, proclaiming, “Make no mistake: the reason that you have such huge spikes in crime in many parts of the country is because of not standing up for law enforcement, having weak policies where you’re letting people out, and you’re not prosecuting people who are committing habitual offenses. That is clearly causing disastrous consequences.”

Under DeSantis, Florida enacted the “Anti-Riot Bill,” increasing penalties for crimes committed during violent assemblies and protecting law enforcement officers and law-abiding citizens. The Florida law also makes it more difficult for municipalities to defund the police.

The leftist elites, whether in the form of Black Lives Matter Marxists, Antifa anarchists, socialist Democrats, subversive district attorneys, or critical race theory race hustlers, know that American civilization cannot survive without law, order, and public safety. This is the reason they are destroying the police. And this is the reason that the American people must stop them.

Lightfoot Refuses To Pay Unvaxxed Chicago Police Amid Crime Crisis,"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is placing police officers who refuse to get the COVID-19 jab on unpaid leave during the Windy City’s raging crime spree.

While the “defund the police” Democrat claimed on Monday that only a “very small number” of officers were demoted to no-pay status, CNN reported on Friday that “up to half of Chicago’s rank-and-file police officers” were at risk of losing their pay over the shot mandate. By Monday, a third of the officers were still not in compliance. When The Federalist inquired about the actual number of officers who were cut off from their paychecks over the weekend due to the vaccine mandate dispute, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) deflected to the mayor’s office, which said the number would not be made public.

This decision to shun an unknown number of officers comes as the city tries to fend off a crisis of deadly and violent crime against Chicago citizens, including children and police officers. Lightfoot framed the vaccine mandate as the “only way that we can maximize safety in our workplace,” but the dozens of daily shootings and violent offenses in the Windy City are alarming Chicagoans concerned about their safety.

Lightfoot’s order currently forces all Chicago city employees to get the shot or comply with weekly testing. Beginning Jan. 1, 2022, however, Chicago workers will have to get vaccinated or be approved for an exemption to keep their jobs. The CPD warned officers who did not comply by the arbitrary Thursday, Oct. 14 at midnight deadline that they would “become the subject of a disciplinary investigation that could result in a penalty up to and including separation from the Chicago Police Department.”

Despite growing threats and pressure from the mayor’s office and CPD for officers to get the jab, the president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police John Catanzara spoke out against the mandate. After the city filed a complaint against Catanzara and the union for publicly opposing their medical coercion and “encouraging a work stoppage or strike,” a Cook County Circuit judge ordered Catanzara, whom Lightfoot accused of trying to “induce an insurrection,” to shut up and silenced him from offering any dissidence to the mandate until an Oct. 25 hearing on the matter.

“I think that the City has alleged a public interest in precluding Mr. Catanzara from making further comments encouraging his members to refuse to comply with the City’s policies so for that reason, I’ll enter a temporary restraining order requiring that Mr. Catanzara be precluded from making additional public comments,” Judge Cecilia A. Horan said. “Mr. Catanzara, you can talk to your friends, you can talk to your family, but I am talking about the YouTube things, and the various media things.”

Catanzara denied that he has ever “engaged in, supported, or encouraged a work stoppage,” but the union filed a lawsuit against the city for overlooking their bargaining power and instead “implement[ing] their unilateral changes.”

Chicago’s decision to get rid of police officers amid a crime spike follows an alarming trend where institutions that are essential to public health, safety, and travel are sacrificing their staff and ability to serve Americans on the altar of medically coercive vaccine mandates.

Multiple Cities Voting Whether To 'Defund The Police' Amid Crime Surge,"Voters in at least four cities are headed to the polls on Tuesday to determine whether they will “defund the police” amid rising urban crime rates. These referendums come on the heels of a growing crime surge in the United States, especially in urban areas.

While ballots in Austin, Texas, are asking voters to decide on an initiative that will actually increase staffing and law enforcement funding if passed, most of the “defund the police” proposals on the ballot in Cleveland, Denver, Minneapolis, and Albany, New York use vague language such as “police reform” to mask the policies’ true intent of dismantling law enforcement departments.

Minneapolis’s proposal is by far the largest and most expansive law enforcement overhaul on the ballot. If passed, City Question Two will restructure the Minneapolis charter to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a “Department of Public Safety” managed by the leftist mayor or a possibly more progressive replacement and the City Council. The Department of Public Safety would be staffed by mental health and social workers who would take a “comprehensive public health approach” to fighting crime and only include traditional police officers “if necessary.”

While some cities such as Los Angeles got away with defunding the police after referendums during the 2020 election, public support for pulling funding from law enforcement is down across the board. In Minneapolis, 55 percent of voters said they don’t support reducing the police force in the city.

A poll from the Pew Research Center published last week indicated that a rising number of Americans in general, 47 percent, actually want police spending in their areas to increase. That number is up 16 points from the beginning of the summer of rage in June 2020. Twenty-one percent of those who said they support funding hikes said the law enforcement spending should go up “a lot,” citing concerns about rising crime. Even 34 percent of Democrats admitted they wanted more funding for police moving forward.

Even some cities that don’t have specific referendums or proposals to yank money from law enforcement are set to vote on whether they will elect a mayor who supports “defunding the police.” In Boston, Atlanta, New York City, and Buffalo, New York, voters must choose between supporting a Democrat mayor who plans to rally around defunding the police in the name of racial justice or a Democrat mayor who has estranged themselves from the progressive policy.

Democrat mayoral candidate Annissa Essaibi George in Boston has openly supported adding hundreds of officers to the city’s police force to combat crime, but her progressive opponent Michelle Wu has already debuted a “public safety plan” that prohibits trained law enforcement officers from certain duties and hands them to “unarmed civilian personnel.”

Minneapolis Voters Reject Leftist Push To Defund And Replace Police,"Minneapolis voters overwhelmingly defeated an amendment on Tuesday aiming to defund the Minneapolis Police Department and replace trained law enforcement officers with social workers.

Question Two asked voters whether they supported an overhaul of the city’s law enforcement system by replacing the MPD with a “Department of Public Safety.” Under the proposal, which was created to dismantle policing following the death of George Floyd in May 2020, leftist Mayor Jacob Frey or his significantly more progressive competitor and the City Council would manage the DPS. The DPS would be staffed by mental health and social workers who would take a “comprehensive public health approach” to fighting crime and only include traditional police officers “if necessary.”

Polling suggested that 55 percent of voters in the blue city were not keen on reducing the number of officers in their areas, especially due to a national rise in urban crime. That number rose to 56 percent or 80,506 voters who were against the proposal after all 136 Minneapolis precincts reported on election day. Despite the city’s leftist track record, only 62,813 voters, or 43 percent, said they wanted to see the police department go.

Minneapolis voters may have hesitated to let go of their city’s law enforcement, but voters in Austin gladly voted against a measure that would have increased the city’s police staffing to better address crime.

A poll from the Pew Research Center published last week indicated that a rising number of Americans in general, 47 percent, want police spending in their areas to increase. That number is up 16 points from the beginning of the summer of rage in June 2020.

Sheriff Calls For Felony Charges Against Wisconsin Election Commissioners,"On Wednesday afternoon, the Racine County Sheriff’s Office issued a press release announcing it had forwarded to the county district attorney recommended charges for election fraud against five members of the Wisconsin Election Commission, including two felony counts. The announcement followed last week’s 75-minute press conference by Sheriff Christopher Schmaling and lead investigator Sgt. Michael Luell.

During that press conference, Luell provided a methodical review of the Wisconsin Election Code and his investigation into a complaint lodged by “Judy,” whose mother “Shirley” was a resident of the Ridgewood Care Facility.

After her mother died on October 9, 2020, Judy discovered a vote in the November 2020 presidential election had been cast in her mother’s name. In an affidavit originally filed with the Wisconsin Election Commission, Judy stated that she believed the residential care facility had taken “advantage” of her mother’s “diminished mental capacity and filled out ballot(s) in her name.”

While their investigation focused on Ridgewood Care Facility, during the press conference, Schmaling and Luell made clear that the fundamental violation of election law occurred when the Wisconsin Election Commission, or WEC, directed municipalities not to “use the Special Voting Deputy process to service residents in care facilities,” and instead to “transmit absentee ballots to those voters by mail.”

As Luell detailed in the October 28 press conference, Section 6.875 of the Wisconsin election code provides the “exclusive means” of absentee voting in residential care facilities, and that statute requires the local municipality to dispatch two special voting deputies, or “SVDs,” to a facility. The election code further requires the SVDs to personally deliver a ballot to residents of the facility, and then witness the voting process. And only a relative or an SVD may assist the voter in the process, and once voting is complete, the SVD must seal the ballot envelope and deliver it to the clerk.

By directing municipalities not to use SVD, as required by state law, Luell explained, the WEC appeared to violate Section 12.13(2)(b)(7) of the Wisconsin Election Code, entitled “Election Fraud.” That section expressly provides that it is a crime if, “in the course of the person’s official duties or on account of the person’s official position,” the official “intentionally violates or intentionally causes any other person to violate any provision” of the election code, “for which no other penalty is expressly prescribed.”

Also noted were several other relevant criminal provisions, including the crime of receiving a ballot from, or giving a ballot to, a person other than the election officer in charge, or receiving a complete ballot from a voter unless qualified to do so. Here, Luell explained how ballots were handled by low-level employees, kept unsealed in drawers, and otherwise maintained in violation of state law.

Whether to charge these crimes is a matter for prosecutors to decide, the sheriff and his lead investigator explained. However, given that Racine County is just “one of 72 counties,” and “Ridgewood is one of 11 facilities within our county,” they encouraged the state attorney general to launch his own investigation.

Late Wednesday, in a media release, Schmaling explained that, because of the failure of Attorney General Josh Kaul to initiate a statewide investigation into the WEC’s directive to voting clerks not to use the Special Voting Deputy process required by Section 6.875, his office had “forwarded charging recommendations to the Racine County District Attorney’s Office.”

The sheriff then explained he had recommended charges for Commissioners Margaret Bostelmann, Julie Glancey, Ann Jacobs, Dean Knudson, and Mark Thomsen. Jacobs, Thomsen, and Glancey are Democrats, while Bostelmann and Knudson are Republicans. The only member of the WEC not referred to the prosecutor’s office was Robert Spindell, Jr., a Republican appointed to the Committee by the Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader, Scott L. Fitzgerald.

No explanation was provided for why Spindell was omitted from the referral. Spindell had originally voted along with his five fellow commissioners to “suspend” the use of SVP in the spring of 2020, before the primary election. But then in September, Spindell reversed course, questioning where the WEC’s authority to override the legislative mandate came from. He then pushed the WEC to reinstate the use of SVP before the November 3, 2020 election.

Given that the Sheriff Office’s investigation and criminal referral concerned only the November 3, 2020 election, the omission of Spindell’s name from the list provided to the district attorney’s office makes sense.

Spindell’s name was also conspicuously absent from the two-page letter the WEC released late in the evening the day of the October 28, 2021 press conference. All of the commissioners, except Spindell, had signed that letter, with Spindell telling the press, there was “a lot in that statement I did not agree with.”

And as for whether the WEC violated the law? “That’s not up to me to determine whether the commission did or not,” Spindell said, I just don’t know.”

For now, Racine County District Attorney Patricia Hanson will need to decide whether to initiate criminal charges, and if so, on what basis. The Sheriff’s Office had recommended three misdemeanor and two felony charges, as follows:

Misconduct in Public Office in violation of Wis. State 946.12(2) (Felony) Election Fraud –Election Official Assisting with Violations in violation of Wis. Stat. 12.13(2)(b)7 (Felony). Party to the Crime of Election Fraud-Receive Ballot Non-Election Official in violation of Wis. Stat. 12.13(3)(n) (Misdemeanor) Party to the Crime of Election Fraud—Illegal Ballot Receipt in violation of Wis. Stat. 12.13(3)(p) Party to the Crime of Election Fraud—Solicit Assistance in violation of Wis. Stat. 12.13(3)(s) (Misdemeanor).

While the Racine County Sheriff Office’s press conference had explained the basis for the various election fraud charges, the recommended charge under Section 946.12(2) is new. That section, entitled “Misconduct in Public Office,” provides:

Any public officer or public employee who does any of the following is guilty of a Class I felony: (2) In the officer’s or employee’s capacity as such officer or employee, does an act which the officer or employee knows is in excess of the officer’s or employee’s lawful authority or which the officer or employee knows the officer or employee is forbidden by law to do in the officer’s or employee’s official capacity.

The various clips and quotes included in the summary of the Racine County Sheriff Office’s investigation provide pretty strong evidence that the WEC members knew they were exceeding their lawful authority and thus violated Section 946.12(2) of the criminal code, as well as the election code provisions specified.

To date, however, no one cared. Will District Attorney Patricia Hanson?

6 Things We Just Learned About The Supreme Court’s Gun Rights Case,"Last week the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the first gun rights case to reach the high court in more than a decade. The case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen, concerns the constitutionality of New York’s law banning the carrying of handguns outside the home for self-defense, absent a license—something the state will only issue if the applicant establishes a unique need for self-defense.

For an overview of the case, read here. A more in-depth analysis of both the case and the current state of Second Amendment jurisprudence is available here. For six take-aways from the argument, read along.

1. New York Concedes The Second Amendment Secures an Individual’s Right to Bear Arms Outside the Home

When the individual New Yorkers challenging the law, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, along with the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, first asked the Supreme Court to hear their appeal, they sought to entice the high court to take the case by stressing how important the underlying constitutional principle at issue is, writing: “Perhaps the single most important unresolved Second Amendment question remaining” after Heller and McDonald established the individual right to bear arms, “is whether the Second Amendment secures the individual right to bear arms for self-defense where confrontations often occur: outside the home.”

Not only was that question unanswered by the Supreme Court in Heller and McDonald, but after Heller and McDonald the lower courts disagreed on the scope of the Second Amendment outside of one’s house.

But last Monday’s argument made the issue a non-issue, with New York conceding the question. The “history is so clear that New York no longer contests that carrying a handgun outside of the home for purposes of self-defense is constitutionally protected activity,” Paul Clement, the attorney arguing on behalf of the petitioners challenging the state’s restrictive licensing law, stressed during oral argument.

2. Nice Little Right—I Mean, Privilege—You’ve Got There

While New York conceded the Second Amendment applies beyond one’s threshold, Solicitor General Barbara Underwood quickly forgot that the Bill of Rights protects rights—it doesn’t define privileges. For instance, in discussing the regulation of firearms outside the home, Underwood started to say that “these regulations are all an effort to accommodate the right,” but then backtracked, saying the regulations seek to “respect the right of self-defense.”

The slip of the tongue was telling, however: It means New York state doesn’t truly view the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms as a right, but as a privilege it will accommodate — when governmental officials deem it appropriate.

Justice Samuel Alito exposed this reality more clearly when he asked New York’s solicitor general whether an employee leaving a New York City building at midnight had a right under the state’s licensing scheme to carry a concealed weapon if she feared walking home through a high-crime area. Underwood acknowledged that under the New York licensing scheme, the cleaning woman would not be entitled to a permit.

“How is that consistent with the core right to self-defense, which is protected by the Second Amendment?” Justice Alito countered.

“Because the core right to self-defense doesn’t . . . allow for all to be armed for all possible confrontations in all places,” New York’s attorney replied.

While true, the response ignores the reality of New York’s position, which Justice Alito spelled out: Celebrities, retired police officers, and judges can carry guns, but not “the kind of ordinary people who have a real, felt need to carry a gun to protect themselves.”

Several times throughout the argument, the lawyer for those challenging New York’s law stressed the same point, telling the justices: “In order to exercise a constitutional right that New York is willing to concede extends outside the home, you have to show that you have an atypical need to exercise the right that distinguishes you from the general community. That describes a privilege. It does not describe a constitutional right.”

3. Feels Matter More Than Truth for Some Justices

Sadly, the state of New York was not the only one viewing Second Amendment rights as second class—so were several of the justices. In this regard, Justice Stephen Breyer proved the most transparent of the Democrat-appointed justices, pivoting between the statistics presented by social “scientists” and his discomfort with guns.

What is New York “supposed to say,” Breyer asked early on: “You can carry a concealed gun around the streets or the town or outside just for fun?” “I mean, they are dangerous, guns,” he added. Justice Breyer later returned to this point, noting “a concealed weapon” “is a dangerous thing,” and “you want to carry a concealed weapon, you go shooting it around and somebody gets killed.”

Justice Breyer brought home his point by noting some of the amicus curiae briefs by “social scientists” that claimed, statistically, the more liberal a government is “in allowing people to carry concealed weapons who are good character people and there is a greater risk of crime or harm, where that happens, there are more deaths of innocent people.”

Brian Fletcher of the U.S. Department of Justice encouraged this line of “reasoning” during his time arguing on behalf of the federal government as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court, in support of New York’s restrictive licensing law. “What I can tell you is that we do share the concern behind the New York law, which is the concern that having more guns on the street does escalate — does complicate and increase the danger inherent in citizen/law enforcement encounters,” he said.

In his rebuttal, though, while arguing on behalf of the petitioners seeking the ability to carry handguns in self-defense Clement told the court—specifically addressing Justice Breyer—that for “empirical evidence,” the court should look at the “English brief.”

The “English brief” referred to the amicus curiae brief filed by Professor William English. In that brief, English noted that he has “conducted the largest-ever nationally representative survey of firearms owners in order to estimate reliably the frequency of firearm carriage and use for self-defense.” The Georgetown University professor also recently “authored the first statistical study utilizing estimates of state carry permits issued each year in order to accurately assess the effects of shall-issue laws—also known as right-to-carry laws—on violent crime and murder rates.”

As Clement highlighted, the English brief provides empirical evidence that negates the running narrative that the more legal guns on the street, the more crime. What you see, if statistics are done right, Clement noted, is that there is no difference in the crime rate, and “the only difference you really see is that people who have a handgun for self-defense end up with a better outcome. They’re not shot. They’re — they’re not made victims.”

4. New York Twisted Itself Into a Paradox

How the justices handle the competing statistics in the Supreme Court’s eventual opinion will prove entertaining, but likely not as entertaining as the pretzel New York twisted itself into in trying to justify its blanket ban on licenses for all except those who can prove an individual need to self-defense.

Throughout the argument, Solicitor General Underwood stressed that New York’s licensing scheme was necessary because the government did not want guns in densely populated areas of the state, such as New York City, while in “back country areas,” the carrying of concealed weapons was not as problematic since no one was around.

Justice Roberts was quick to point out, however, that Heller relied on the right to self defense as a basis for its reading of the Second Amendment and that need is most acute in a high-crime area in New York City.

“If you’re out in the woods, presumably, it’s pretty unlikely that you’re going to run into someone who’s going to rob you on the street,” Roberts reasoned, continuing: “On the other hand, there are places in a densely populated city where it’s more likely that that’s where you’re going to need a gun for self-defense . . . And it seems to me that what you’re saying is that’s probably the last place that someone’s going to get a permit to carry a gun.”

Underwood countered that, “Where there is dense population, there is also the deterrent of lots of people and there is the availability of law enforcement.” The contradiction did not escape Justice Roberts, though: “It’s paradoxical that you say a place is a high-crime area, but don’t worry about it because there are a lot of police around.” After all, Justice Roberts then quipped, “How many muggings take place in the forest?”

Justice Alito also pointed out the problem with the state’s purported concern that it didn’t want a lot of guns in New York City. “There are a lot of armed people on the streets of New York and in the subways late at night right now, aren’t there?” the justice asked. At first, Underwood claimed she didn’t “know that there are a lot of armed people,” but after realizing his point, she acknowledged, “There are people with illegal guns, if that’s what you’re referring to.”

“How many illegal guns were seized by the New York Police Department last year?” Justice Alito pushed. While she didn’t have a number, Underwood acknowledged that “it’s a substantial number.” But while “they’re walking around the streets,” Justice Alito queried, “the ordinary hard-working, law-abiding people I mentioned, they can’t be armed?”

Here the state’s attorney returned to the emotional plea, noting that the “idea of proliferating arms on the subway is precisely, I think, what terrifies a great many people.” The fear factor may sell gun control to a mass market of moms, but it tells the court nothing of the constitutionality of New York’s licensing scheme.

5. Text, History, and Tradition, or Something Else

How, then, will the court analyze the constitutionality of New York’s licensing scheme?

Throughout the argument, the court focused on the “text, history, and tradition” of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. But for anyone listening (or reading the transcript), what exactly was the history and tradition at the time of the Founding, or later when the 14th Amendment was ratified—which period was the appropriate one to consider, Justice Thomas asked—was a muddle. More on that shortly.

In addition to the “text, history, and tradition,” test discussed throughout last week’s argument, however, lower courts have applied or considered other standards, as Justice Neil Gorsuch stressed. “Some lower courts have refused to apply the history test, for example,” Justice Gorsuch noted, saying “they will not extend Heller outside the home until this Court does.”

Other courts have applied strict scrutiny, he noted, a standard of review that requires the government to have a compelling interest for a law to pass constitutional muster, and then only if the law is narrowly tailored to that interest. Still other courts, Gorsuch added, have suggested an “intermediate scrutiny,” that looks to whether there is an important governmental interest and if so, if the law is substantially related to that interest.

What standard should we apply, he then asked? The attorneys all seemed to agree that the appropriate analysis was to consider the text, history, and tradition of the Second Amendment and then, if that analysis proved insufficient, the court should turn to the scrutiny analysis. Unsurprisingly, the petitioners sought review under strict scrutiny, while the government pushed for review based on the easier-to-satisfy intermediate scrutiny standard.

No matter the approach taken, however, the Supreme Court needs to clear up the question for the lower courts, as ten-plus years have left the lower courts confused—some purposefully so, because of a desire to uphold gun restrictions.

6. Rights for the Win—But How Big?

While there was some discussion on a governing standard of review, the majority of the justices seemed focused on the “text, history, and tradition” analysis set forth by Heller and MacDonald as the appropriate approach for judging the constitutionality of the law. From there, the breakdown seemed to fall with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Breyer all reading the history of the Second Amendment as providing New York the power to ban the possession of handguns outside the house absent an applicant establishing a specific need of self-defense.

The remaining six justices all seemed more inclined to strike the statute, although with varying levels of tells for how they would vote. This bodes well for a win for the right to keep and bear arms, but how big is unclear.

The Supreme Court could provide a detailed analysis that not only specifies the text, history, and tradition analysis as controlling, but also provides for the highest level of scrutiny for laws for which the text, history, and tradition provide no answer. But even just clarifying that the text, history, and tradition test adopted by Heller and MacDonald governs will go a long way toward returning the Second Amendment to its rightful place in the realm of fundamental rights.

If that happens, future cases will need to explore the contours of that right. Hopefully, the high court will not wait another decade before next delving into the question.

How Finland Is Using Hate Crime Laws To Persecute Christians,"On this episode of “The Federalist Radio Hour,” Bishop Juhana Pohjola joins Executive Editor Joy Pullmann in the Hillsdale College Kirby Center studio to discuss his experience being prosecuted in Finland under hate crime laws after stating Biblical truths about the distinctions between males and females.

“I’m very worried about the situation because whatever the outcome of the case is, this is also sending a signal that if they can come after [a] bishop and if they come after [a] grandma, member of Parliament, then they can come after you,” Pohjola said.

If found guilty, Pohjola could face fines and years in jail for simply exercising his freedom of speech and preaching Christian values.

“There are some positive signs even from non-Christians who are very supportive for us. [They say,] ‘I don’t agree at all with you, with your Christian views and your arguments, but this is a question of freedom of speech, and we totally 300 percent support you,'” Pohjola said.

Lawmakers Demand U.S. Punish Finland For Criminalizing Christianity,"Six Republican U.S. representatives Wednesday issued a letter demanding that the United States take action against Finland for criminalizing Christianity through its hate crimes laws.

Prosecutors in Finland are pressing charges against a Protestant bishop and a member of the national Parliament for publicly stating what the Bible teaches about sex and marriage.

Bishop Juhana Pohjola and Parliament member Paivi Rasanen face fines and up to two years in prison under “hate crimes” laws that effectively criminalize speech and set the government up as the arbiter of what religious beliefs are legal in Finland. One of the charges against Rasanen is the alleged crime of posting a Bible verse on Twitter.

“Free people should not have to violate and recant their deepest convictions to remain part of a free society,” the U.S. lawmakers write in response to this situation. “True religious liberty both protects an individual’s right both to hold beliefs that are unpopular with the prevailing cultural winds of the world, but also their right to live out authentically and profess the truths they hold dear without fear of government interference. Those rights are fundamental and unalienable to the whole human race, and it is critical to the flourishing of both the human soul and civil society.”

Rasanen and Pohjola have each been interrogated for hours by Finnish officials for stating beliefs that Christians have held for thousands of years. They will stand trial in January.

Pohjola is the bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland. His alleged hate crime is publishing a 2004 booklet written by Rasanen about the Bible’s teachings about sex and marriage. Years after the publication of that booklet, Finland passed laws creating legal privileges for LGBT citizens, under which the two Christians are now being accused of “incitement against a group of people.”

In an exclusive interview with The Federalist Tuesday, Pohjola made it clear that he and Rasanen have never incited and would never incite violence against anyone, because God’s love for all people that erases all their sins is another core Christian belief. The pair are being prosecuted solely for nonviolent speech, which the current Finnish government insists is “ethnic agitation,” thereby criminalizing Christianity.

Pohjola noted that prosecutors’ interpretation of Finland’s hate crimes laws effectively make Christians in the nation second-class citizens by limiting their ability to freely speak on public affairs on an equal footing with all other Finnish citizens. These laws also keep Christian pastors and parents from bringing up their own children according to their deepest and most important beliefs, another human right.

“These criminal prosecutions raise serious questions regarding the extent of Finland’s commitment to protection religious freedom for its citizens, as agreed to with its participation in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other multi-lateral organizations,” the U.S. lawmakers’ letter says. “Additionally, punishing citizens for remarks made on social media and a booklet that has been in the public eye for 17 years is a clear abuse of government power. These actions by the Finnish government will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on free speech in Finland and the West.”

The letter calls on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom to take action against Finland as a result of its human rights violations in the Pohjola and Rasanen cases. In May, ten globally recognized intellectuals sent a letter to the commission about this case, asking the U.S. Treasury secretary to sanction Finnish prosecutors for this violation of universal human rights.

The legislative assistant for Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told The Federalist that a U.S. senator could also hold up the pending nomination of the U.S. ambassador to Finland to further pressure the nation to fulfill its commitment to human natural rights that include freedom of speech and religion. Besides Roy, the other signatories of the letter are U.S. Reps. Michael Cloud, Byron Donalds, Paul Gosar, Jody Hice, and Doug Lamborn.

"Amid Push To Downplay Sex Crimes, Colorado Rebrands 'Sex Offender'","The Sex Offender Management Board of the State of Colorado has voted to rebrand the term “sex offender,” replacing it with the euphemistic phrase, “adults who commit sexual offenses.”

The board’s decision passed following a 10-6 vote on Nov. 19 will not change the language used in criminal justice proceedings, the Colorado Sex Offender registry, or the name of the Colorado Sex Offender Management Board itself. It does, however, apply to the “Standards and Guidelines for the Assessment, Evaluation, Treatment and Behavioral Monitoring of Adult Sex Offenders.” Some on the board argued this new phrasing will aid rehabilitation efforts.

The SOMB reportedly considered a number of other terms to replace the phrase “sex offender,” including people who are “in treatment for engaging in sexually abusive behaviors” and those “who have committed sexual offenses.” Following this vote, the proposed change will be open for public comment for 20 days, and then the board will vote again on whether to alter the decision and make it final.

The rationale for the language shift is reducing stigma against those convicted of sex crimes, with the Denver Post claiming “many attorneys, people on the sex offender registry and even some victims have criticized Colorado’s management of this population as overly harsh and counterproductive to the goal of rehabilitation.”

This argument is also being used in Colorado to criticize the sex crimes registry that requires those convicted of sexual crimes to publicly report their residence and reside away from places children congregate such as schools and playgrounds. Earlier this year in relation to this public discussion, the Denver Post sympathetically portrayed the story of a man convicted of sexually assaulting a minor being removed from volunteer positions after he served his time because people found him on the registry.

The SOMB’s language decision has been met with backlash, with Sexual Assault Resource Prosecutor Jessica Dotter telling KOAA that such a change “minimizes victim experiences and trauma,” continuing to note that “If the self-image of sex offenders is prioritized over the devastating impact on victims’ lives, we are concerned that would negatively impact public trust.”

Michael J. Allen, a Colorado district attorney, also spoke out against the change, telling the outlet that “The Sex Offender Management Board should spend its valuable time on finding effective ways to treat a challenging group of convicted criminals, rather than coming up with new ways to label them,” going on to note that “there is no reputable study in existence that shows that such a change in terminology will have any measurable effect on the successful treatment of sex offenders and recidivism.”

Lawmakers in the state also previously shot down a bill from Democratic Rep. Kerry Tipper that would have erased the phrase “sexually violent predator” from state law.

This official decision to change the language that is used to denote sex offenders comes just days after a national controversy erupted in response to assistant professor Allyn Walker of Old Dominion University publicly advocating for pedophiles to instead be referred to as “minor attracted persons” in an attempt to destigmatize pedophilia. Walker has since been put on administrative leave by Old Dominion University following widespread backlash.

These rhetorical changes mimic those that were present in the Centers for Disease Control’s woke language guide. That also exchanged terms like inmate and prisoner for “people who are incarcerated or detained.” Criminal was changed to “people in pre-trial or with charge” or “people who were formerly incarcerated.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/20/amid-criticisms-a-sex-crimes-registry-is-overly-harsh-colorado-rebrands-the-term-sex-offender/,2021-11-20
Waukesha Killing Suspect The Latest Criminal Freed By Soft-On-Crime DA,"Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm has launched an investigation into what he called the “inappropriately low” bail set for Darrell Brooks, Jr., the suspect in the deadly Christmas parade attack in nearby Waukesha, Wis. Sunday afternoon.

Brooks, who faces five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, was freed after posting $1,000 bail even though he faces serious felony charges in two different open cases in Milwaukee. In the most recent, he allegedly “ran [the victim] over with his vehicle” in what proved to be an ominous foreshadowing of the horror he allegedly inflicted just days later.

“The bail recommendation in this is not consistent with the approach of the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office toward matters involving violent crime,” Chisholm said in a news release, “nor was it consistent with the risk assessment of the defendant prior to setting of bail.”

This is a nauseating lie: Inappropriately and dangerously low bail recommendations have been a hallmark of the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office since Chisholm, a liberal Democrat, was first elected in 2007.

Releasing Dangerous People Into the Community

One of the nation’s first proudly progressive reformers elected as a major city’s lead prosecutor, Chisholm almost immediately implemented an “evidence-based approach” that relied heavily on deferred prosecution and early intervention programs aimed at keeping criminals out of jail. No longer would the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office request high bails for criminal suspects or even prosecute their crimes. Instead, they would pursue alternatives that Chisholm fully admitted would result in dangerous felons being released into the community.

“Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into a treatment program, who is going to go out and kill somebody?” You bet,” Chisholm said in a 2007 interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Guaranteed. It’s guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the overall approach.”

From the moment he was sworn in, Chisholm understood that his radical reimagining of criminal prosecution would result in the loss of innocent lives but, chillingly, he viewed this as a necessary sacrifice. In 2010, the Journal Sentinel reviewed Chisholm’s deferred prosecution program and found “dozens of examples that raise questions about how the…program is being implemented.”

More than 200 defendants charged with such serious offenses as felony sexual assault, armed robbery, felony assault of a police officer, felony child abuse, and high-volume cocaine trafficking were never prosecuted. Easily the most stomach-turning was Cedric B. Young, 51, who was given a deferred prosecution agreement on charges of sexually assaulting a two-year-old girl.

He faced a maximum sentence of 60 years in prison but was never prosecuted after a psychologist his attorneys hired testified that “he did not consider Young a pedophile”—even though Young admitted to sexually assaulting a baby. He was released without ever serving a day in prison.

Of the more than 900 defendants who were given these sorts of sweetheart deals, 30 percent violated them by committing new crimes, failing to appear in court, or failing to fill court-ordered requirements. At least a dozen defendants were given deferred agreements even though they already had extensive criminal records.

One of them, Shermaine Worthy, “had had at least 14 prior felony and misdemeanor convictions for drug offenses, burglary, forgery and escape before he got a deferred agreement in 2009 on marijuana and theft charges. Less than a week later, the agreement was revoked when he was arrested for breaking into a car.”

No Punishment for Breaking the Deal

In several of the cases in which defendants violated their deferred prosecution agreements, Chisholm’s office refused to revoke the agreement and prosecute and instead extended the agreement.

One defendant, Dewayne Manuel, faced felony cocaine dealing charges and violated his deferred prosecution deal by stealing a car less than six months later. Rather than charge him with either crime, an assistant district attorney extended his agreement on the drug charges and gave him a new one that ran concurrently on the car theft charges. Manuel could have served more than 13 years in prison, but instead he only had to pay $123 in court costs.

In 2013, the family of a woman who died of a heroin overdose blamed Chisholm’s deferred prosecution program for keeping out of jail the man who provided the drugs that killed her.

Jeremiah Schroeder, 35, was charged with first-degree reckless homicide in the death of 26-year-old Cassandra Lutz. He had been charged the prior year with a felony for maintaining a drug house but given a deferred prosecution. Four months later, he was charged with another felony for possession of heroin with intent to deliver. His agreement was never revoked and he remained out on the streets.

“If he would have been in jail the way he should have been, this would not have happened,” her father told the Journal Sentinel. “She’d still be here.”

Ignoring Prosecution as Crime Rises

Chisholm refused to admit that his reforms were failing, and even as Milwaukee’s violent crime rate steadily rose throughout the early 2010s he insisted that his office’s policy of keeping offenders out of jail was an unbridled success. In 2015, he was even profiled in a glowing column in The New Yorker entitled “How to Stop Mass Incarceration.”

“Like many people in the criminal-justice system, John Chisholm, the District Attorney in Milwaukee County, has been concerned for a long time about the racial imbalance in American prisons,” wrote the now-disgraced Jeffrey Toobin. “Chisholm decided that his office would undertake initiatives to try to send fewer people to prison while maintaining public safety.”

Even Toobin had to concede that Milwaukee was a more dangerous place, as violent crime skyrocketed in Milwaukee (and across the country) in 2015, but Chisholm merely threw up his hands and refused to accept any blame, saying, “We redesigned our system, but we learned that no individual actor can change the dynamics of what goes on in a complex larger system like a city.”

In reality, one individual actor—Chisholm—had helped change the dynamics of Milwaukee by keeping thousands of violent offenders out of jail or prison.

“On his watch, the overall number of misdemeanor prosecutions in the county has dropped from 9,000 to 5,200,” Toobin noted. “Likewise, once Chisholm instituted a policy that all burglary-case filings must be approved by a senior prosecutor, the disparity that led to more cases against white alleged thieves than black ones faded. The number of African-American residents of Milwaukee County sent to state prison on drug charges has been cut in half since 2006.”

From 2007—the year Chisholm became Milwaukee County District Attorney—to 2015, Wisconsin’s prison population dropped from 24,500 to 22,000, and “most of the reduction [came] from Milwaukee County.”

During that same time period, FBI statistics showed that the violent crime rate in the city of Milwaukee skyrocketed from 1,403 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2007 to 1,506 per 100,000 in 2015. By way of comparison, the violent crime rate for the United States as a whole actually dropped from 472 per 100,000 people in 2007 to 374 per 100,000 in 2015.

Lowering Bail Requirements

During this period, Chisholm wasn’t just keeping often-violent offenders out of prison through deferred prosecutions and early interventions; he was also dramatically reducing bail for criminal suspects or eliminating it altogether.

In 2018, he bragged on Twitter about his office’s profile in the Safety and Justice Challenge organization’s annual report. The group, which “seeks to reduce over-incarceration by changing the way America thinks about and uses jails,” commended the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office for, as Chisholm put it, its “commitment to reforming and redesigning our system to achieve more just outcomes.”

“[From] the report: we are ‘focused on reducing the use of incarceration in all cases,” Chisholm tweeted. “Overall, prosecutors prioritize addressing the root causes of criminal behavior – substance use, mental health issues – and seek out alternative sentences, even for some violent offenders.”

He then quoted several assistant district attorneys who expressed their pride in how successfully they kept these violent offenders on the streets of Milwaukee.

“I would say the biggest change that I have perceived is trying to find ways to avoid prosecution in more cases and to see what can be done in terms of alternatives to prosecution,” said one.

“We have really made a commitment to not keeping individuals held unnecessarily on cash bail in the Milwaukee County Jail,” added another.

Instead, they have released even the most violent of defendants to the custody of JusticePoint—a non-profit organization dedicated to eliminating cash bail altogether and finding “alternatives to incarceration.

Rape a Child? Pay $750 and You’re Back on the Streets

A 2109 study by the John K. MacIver Institute found that bail amounts for serious crimes had dropped to shockingly low levels. A suspect charged with first-degree sexual assault of a child had bail set at just $750. Felony charges of hit-and-run causing injury resulted in $250 bail. Hit-and-run causing great bodily harm resulted in bail of $500. Even hit-and-run causing death produced a bail of just $5,000.

This is significant in light of skyrocketing car theft and reckless driving crisis in Milwaukee. Motor vehicle thefts have been increasing ever since the Milwaukee Police Department announced a “no pursuit” policy in 2010, and are up a staggering 162 percent over 2020 so far this year.

With so many violent offenders out on bail or deferred prosecution agreements, it is little wonder that Milwaukee is more dangerous than it ever has been. In 2020, the city saw a record 189 homicides—more than double the previous year and up 14 percent from the previous record set in 1991. Homicides had spiked in 1991 because of the discovery of the Jeffrey Dahmer murders, meaning Milwaukee was deadlier last year than when a serial killer was roaming its streets.

According to the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission, a total of 919 people were shot in the city last year; an average of 2.5 per day. As of November 15, this year has been even worse with an average of 2.79 people shot per day and 170 total murders.

Yet even as all violent crime—rape, aggravated assault, armed robbery, and arson—has spiked over the past two years, Chisholm has refused to accept any responsibility. Instead, he told a progressive prosecutors’ conference in March that “deliberately manipulated scare stories about rising crime” are fueling “false information” about the utopia he has created.

“We can never, ever, underestimate the power of fear to create bad policy,” he said.

In truth, the worst crime policy in Wisconsin has come from Chisholm’s own office. Under his direction, criminals like Brooks have routinely been given shockingly low bail and sweetheart plea agreements or never prosecuted at all. The horror in Waukesha is just now drawing national attention to it, but the Milwaukee area has been living—and dying—for 15 years with the unmitigated disaster Chisholm has created.

GOP Lawmakers Work To Prevent Another Waukesha Massacre,"As the people of Waukesha grieve the six people they lost and the more than 60 who were injured when a violent criminal tore through their annual Christmas parade in an SUV, Wisconsinites and the rest of the country — save for the corporate media that finds nothing to see here — are wondering, “How could this happen?”

A handful of state lawmakers are wondering, “How can we prevent this from happening again?”

“The senseless act of evil in Waukesha was preventable,” Sen. Dale Kooyenga, who represents most of Waukesha County and other parts of the Milwaukee suburbs, told The Federalist. “Far too often in southeast Wisconsin people have been released on low bail and lenient sentences, only to commit more crimes and hurt more people.”

Wisconsin bail protocols are convoluted. While a cursory glance might make it seem as though judges can consider an alleged offender’s record and community safety in setting a bail amount, the Wisconsin Constitution prohibits that. Although people charged with crimes are guaranteed bail, the only thing a judge can really consider when setting the bail amount is the likelihood of the accused returning to trial. The severity of the crime and the likelihood of reoffense cannot be considered.

In determining pre-trial release, meaning non-monetary release before the accused is tried and convicted, a court can make “reasonable conditions designed to assure their appearance in court, protect members of the community from serious bodily harm or prevent the intimidation of witnesses.”

Monetary conditions of release, or bail, are different. Under Article 1, Section 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution, “Monetary conditions of release may be imposed at or after the initial appearance only upon a finding that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the conditions are necessary to assure appearance in court” (emphasis added). State Statue 696.01 reiterates this. That means a court cannot consider community safety or the criminal record of the accused.

State Sen. Van Wanggaard’s chief of staff Scott Kelly told The Federalist it’s common in Milwaukee County for judges to set a low bail of $500, for instance, when an offender has strong ties to the community such as family, friends, or a home, and all the judge can consider is his likelihood of showing up at trial.

“Well, what happens is you get situations like what happened with Waukesha,” Kelly said, referring to Darrell E. Brooks, the alleged driver of the SUV who is also a registered sex offender and whose prior criminal charges include recklessly endangering safety while using a dangerous weapon, illegal possession of a firearm, drug possession, domestic abuse, disorderly conduct, bail jumping, battery, and resisting or obstructing an officer.

Brooks was released on a $1,000 bond for a handful of charges including multiple felonies in November before the Christmas parade massacre, after he allegedly ran over a woman who claimed to be the mother of his child on Nov. 2.

The progressive Milwaukee district attorney now calls this bail amount “inappropriately low,” but that hasn’t always been his position. In fact, DA John Chisholm knew his so-called criminal justice “reforms” such as low cash bail would end up killing someone — but he forged ahead with them anyway.

“Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into [a] treatment program, who’s going to go out and kill somebody?” Chisholm flippantly told to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2007. “You bet. Guaranteed. It’s guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the overall approach.”

This overall approach has been a disaster, and paired with Democrat Gov. Tony Evers vetoing multiple bills that could have kept the alleged Waukesha killer behind bars, the left’s approach to crime has proved deadly. Some Republican lawmakers in the state are taking action.

“It is outrageous to me that convicted felons are allowed to terrorize our communities time and time again with little more than probation or a slap on the hand,” state Sen. Julian Bradley told The Federalist. “I’m already looking into what legislation we should pass. In fact, I was already looking at restricting signature bond before this weekend.”

Wanggaard, who chairs the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, with Republican Rep. Cindi Duchow is introducing an amendment to the state Constitution that would allow courts to consider additional factors when setting bail, not just the likelihood of the accused to show up at trial. If the amendment passes, it would allow courts to consider the seriousness of the charged offense, the accused’s prior criminal record and history of violence, and the safety of the community, in addition to considering the probability of the accused returning for trial and preventing the intimidation of witnesses.

Furthermore, it broadens the language, so rather than allowing courts to consider how to protect members of the community only from “serious bodily harm,” the proposed amendment would allow the consideration of all “serious harm.”

“The term ‘serious bodily harm’ refers to ‘bodily injury which causes or contributes to the death of a human being or which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious permanent disfigurement, or which causes a permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ or other serious bodily injury,’” Wanggaard wrote in a co-sponsorship memorandum to his fellow legislators. “As applied, this has resulted in excluding crimes such as molestation of a child or repeat offenders for drunk driving.”

An amendment like this could have prevented the tragedy in Waukesha.

It was originally proposed four years ago, but it didn’t pass, in part because it was introduced too late in the session and some members didn’t recognize the severity of the subject. However, Wanggaard’s office is confident this redrafting will be more successful due to increased crime in Milwaukee and Madison, increased low-cash bail, and rising crime around the country due to left-wing prosecutors, such as in California and New York.

“It changes the dynamic,” Kelly said. “The timing is right.”

But even the amendment won’t ensure justice. Kelly says the DA can still let people off the hook as an elected official.

“If there’s a DA who wants to let people out of jail — like John Chisholm apparently does — you know, we can’t stop that. He’s elected, and that’s his prerogative I guess,” Kelly said. “It’s been a problem in Milwaukee for years.”

The amendment is a good first step, but Wisconsinites must also elect good district attorneys.

“The Waukesha tragedy is a terrible reminder that it’s long past time for prosecutors to take this problem seriously or resign,” Kooyenga said.

We simply can’t afford to risk another Christmas massacre enabled by prosecutors who flout law and order to achieve an impossible progressive fantasy.

Race Hoaxer Jussie Smollett Convicted On Five Of Six Counts,"Former “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was convicted by a jury on five counts of disorderly conduct on Thursday over staging a hate crime against himself in 2019.

Smollett, 39, was indicted on six counts in 2019 after authorities investigating the celebrity’s claims of a brutally racist and homophobic attack found that the assault had been orchestrated by himself. According to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, Smollett hired a pair of Nigerian brothers to stage a conditional attack that would later be treated as a virulent “hate crime,” earning the actor sympathy from politicians and media personalities.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” Smollett said in reference to then-President Donald Trump when explaining to ABC’s Robin Roberts why he felt he was attacked by two white men who screamed racial and homophobic slurs before they tied a noose around his neck and showered his skin with bleach, according to Smollett’s telling.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 30, 2019

Smollett was only acquitted of one count of disorderly conduct, which referred to a report he gave to detective Robert Graves.

The five other counts on which Smollett was found guilty include telling Chicago Police Officer Muhammad Baig he had been victimized in a hate crime, telling the same officer he was a battery victim, making the same two claims to Officer Kimberly Murray, and making another battery claim to Murray the next evening.

Penalties for a single disorderly conduct charge ultimately remain under judicial discretion, but the crime is punishable with up to three years incarceration and a $25,000 fine.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/09/race-hoaxer-jussie-smollett-convicted-on-five-of-six-counts-after-staging-fake-chicago-attack-in-2019/,2021-12-09
San Francisco Mayor Announces Crackdown On 'Reign Of Criminals',"San Francisco Democrat Mayor London Breed launched a crackdown on crime on Tuesday as the city grapples with a plague of rampant lawlessness exacerbated by soft-on-crime city leaders.

“It’s time that the reign of criminals who are destroying our city, it is time for it to come to an end,” Breed declared. “And it comes to an end when we take the steps to be more aggressive with law enforcement … and less tolerant of all the bullsh-t that has destroyed our city.”

The mayor’s plan includes a series of initiatives to implement a 180-degree reversal from blind compassion to “tough love.” Outlined in a Medium post, Breed’s proposals take aim at illegal drug sales and restore funding for police with targeted resources dedicated to the low-income Tenderloin neighborhood. The mayor calls for:

Executing an Emergency Intervention Plan in the Tenderloin neighborhood

Securing emergency police funding to ensure we have the resources to combat major safety problems over the next several months

Amending our surveillance ordinance so law enforcement can prevent and interrupt crime in real time — something they’re effectively barred from doing now — to better protect our homes and businesses

Disrupting the illegal street sales of stolen goods that have become a clear public safety issue and are contributing to retail theft

Michael Shellenberger, co-founder of the California Peace Coalition and author of “San Fran-Sicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities,” wrote that Breed’s latest initiative was a “big step in the right direction.”

San Francisco Mayor Breed has for years promised to crack down on drug dealing & crime, and things have only grown worse over, so skepticism is merited But Breed's plan lays out big goals and makes very specific promises, including new funding for policing. — Michael Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) December 14, 2021

While Shellenberger cautioned that skepticism is warranted, the mayor’s plan arrives at a desperate time for the city. Just 18 months ago, Breed diverted $120 million in law enforcement funding to minority welfare programs. Coupled with a district attorney refusing to prosecute crime, the results have been devastating.

“The main reason for Breed’s turnabout is skyrocketing crime,” Shellenberger wrote in a Wednesday Substack post, pointing to a report out Tuesday from the Public Policy Institute of California showing high spikes in crime. “Homicides increased in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego, and San Francisco by 17 percent in 2021. Property crimes in those four cities rose 7 percent between 2020 and 2021, reaching 25,000 total in October. Two-thirds of increase is due to larcenies, mainly car break-ins (by 21 percent) and vehicle thefts (by 10 percent).”

Meanwhile, left-wing District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who faces a recall in June, has declined to file charges on a majority of arrests. According to Shellenberger, he “charged just 46 percent of theft arrests, a 16 point decline since he took office in 2020, and charged just 35 percent of petty theft arrests, a 23 point decline from two years ago.”

DC Bar Restores FBI Russiagate Forger While He’s Still Serving Probation,"A former senior FBI lawyer who falsified a surveillance document in the Trump-Russia investigation has been restored as a member in “good standing” by the District of Columbia Bar Association even though he has yet to finish serving out his probation as a convicted felon, according to disciplinary records obtained by RealClearInvestigations.

The move is the latest in a series of exceptions the bar has made for Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty in August 2020 to doctoring an email used to justify a surveillance warrant targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Clinesmith was sentenced to 12 months probation last January. But the D.C. Bar did not seek his disbarment, as is customary after lawyers are convicted of serious crimes involving the administration of justice. In this case, it did not even initiate disciplinary proceedings against him until February of this year — five months after he pleaded guilty and four days after RealClearInvestigations first reported he had not been disciplined.

After the negative publicity, the bar temporarily suspended Clinesmith pending a review and hearing. Then in September, the court that oversees the bar and imposes sanctions agreed with its recommendation to let Clinesmith off suspension with time served; the bar, in turn, restored his status to “active member” in “good standing.”

Before quietly making that decision, however, records indicate the bar did not check with his probation officer to see if he had violated the terms of his sentence or if he had completed the community service requirement of volunteering 400 hours.

To fulfill the terms of his probation, Clinesmith volunteered at Street Sense Media in Washington but stopped working at the nonprofit group last summer, which has not been previously reported. “I can confirm he was a volunteer here,” Street Sense editorial director Eric Falquero told RCI, without elaborating about how many hours he worked. Clinesmith had helped edit and research articles for the weekly newspaper, which coaches the homeless on how to “sleep on the streets” and calls for a “universal living wage” and prison reform.

Special Counsel Could Still Be Investigating Clinesmith

From the records, it also appears bar officials did not consult with the FBI’s Inspection Division, which has been debriefing Clinesmith to determine if he was involved in any other surveillance abuses tied to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants, in addition to the one used against Page. Clinesmith’s cooperation was one of the conditions of the plea deal he struck with Special Counsel John Durham. If he fails to fully cooperate, including turning over any relevant materials or records in his possession, he could be subject to perjury or obstruction charges.

Clinesmith — who was assigned to some of the FBI’s most sensitive and high-profile investigations — may still be in Durham’s sights regarding other areas of his wide-ranging probe.

The scope of his mandate as special counsel is broader than commonly understood: In addition to examining the legal justification for the FBI’s “Russiagate” probe, it also includes examining the bureau’s handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s use of an unsecured email server, which she set up in her basement to send and receive classified information, and her destruction of more than 30,000 subpoenaed emails she generated while running the State Department. As assistant FBI general counsel in the bureau’s national security branch, Clinesmith played an instrumental role in that investigation, which was widely criticized by FBI and Justice Department veterans, along with ethics watchdogs, as fraught with suspicious irregularities.

Clinesmith also worked on former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into the 2016 Trump campaign as the key attorney linking his office to the FBI. He was the only headquarters lawyer assigned to Mueller. Durham’s investigators are said to be looking into the Mueller team’s actions as well.

The D.C. Bar’s treatment of Clinesmith, a registered Democrat who sent anti-Trump rants to FBI colleagues after the Republican was elected, has raised questions from the start. Normally the bar automatically suspends the license of members who plead guilty to a felony. But in Clinesmith’s case, it delayed suspending him on even an interim basis for several months and only acted after RCI revealed the break Clinesmith was given, records confirm.

Repeated Irregularities in Clinesmith’s Case

It then allowed him to negotiate his fate, which is rarely done in any misconduct investigation, let alone one involving a serious crime, according to a review of past cases. It also overlooked violations of its own rules: Clinesmith apparently broke the bar’s rule requiring reporting his guilty plea “promptly” to the court — within 10 days of entering it — and failed to do so for five months, reveal transcripts of a July disciplinary hearing obtained by RCI.

“I did not see evidence that you informed the court,” Rebecca Smith, the chairwoman of the D.C. Bar panel conducting the hearing, admonished Clinesmith.

“[T]hat was frankly just an error,” Clinesmith’s lawyer stepped in to explain.

Smith also scolded the bar’s Office of Disciplinary Counsel for the “delay” in reporting the offense, since it negotiated the deal with Clinesmith, pointing out: “Disciplinary counsel did not report the plea to the court and initiate a disciplinary proceeding.” Bill Ross, the assistant disciplinary counsel who represented the office at the hearing, argued Clinesmith shouldn’t be held responsible and blamed the oversight on the COVID pandemic.

The Democrat-controlled panel, known as the Board on Professional Responsibility, nonetheless gave Clinesmith a pass, rubberstamping the light sentence he negotiated with the bar’s chief prosecutor, Disciplinary Counsel Hamilton “Phil” Fox, while admitting it was “unusual.” Federal Election Commission records show Fox, a former Watergate prosecutor, is a major donor to Democrats, including former President Obama. All three members of the board also are Democratic donors, FEC data reveal.

Contrasting Action Taken by Michigan Bar

While the D.C. Bar delayed taking any action against Clinesmith, the Michigan Bar, where he is also licensed, automatically suspended him the day he pleaded guilty. And on Sept. 30, records show, the Michigan Bar’s attorney discipline board suspended Clinesmith for two years, from the date of his guilty plea through Aug. 19, 2022, and fined him $1,037.

“[T]he panel found that respondent engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the proper administration of justice [and] exposed the legal profession or the courts to obloquy, contempt, censure or reproach,” the board ruled against Clinesmith, adding that his misconduct “was contrary to justice, ethics, honesty or good morals; violated the standards or rules of professional conduct adopted by the Supreme Court; and violated a criminal law of the United States.”

Normally, bars arrange what’s called “reciprocal discipline” for unethical attorneys licensed in their jurisdictions. But this was not done in the case of Clinesmith. The D.C. Bar decided to go much easier on the former FBI attorney, further raising suspicions the anti-Trump felon was given favorable treatment.

In making the bar’s case not to strip Clinesmith of his license or effectively punish him going forward, Fox disregarded key findings by Durham about Clinesmith’s intent to deceive the FISA court as a government attorney who held a position of trust.

Clinesmith Pled Guilty to Falsifying Records

Clinesmith confessed to creating a false document by changing the wording in a June 2017 CIA email to state Page was “not a source” for the CIA when in fact the agency had told Clinesmith and the FBI on multiple occasions Page had been providing information about Russia to it for years — a revelation that, if disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, would have undercut the FBI’s case for electronically monitoring Page as a supposed Russian agent and something that Durham noted Clinesmith understood all too well.

Bar records show Fox simply took Clinesmith’s word that he believed the change in wording was accurate and that in making it, he mistakenly took a “shortcut” to save time and had no intent to deceive the court or the case agents preparing the application for the warrant.

Durham demonstrated that Clinesmith certainly did intend to mislead the FISA court. “By his own words, it appears that the defendant falsified the email in order to conceal [Page’s] former status as a source and to avoid making an embarrassing disclosure to the FISC,” the special prosecutor asserted in his 20-page memo to the sentencing judge, in which he urged a prison term of up to six months for Clinesmith. “Such a disclosure would have drawn a strong and hostile response from the FISC for not disclosing it sooner [in earlier warrant applications].”

As proof of Clinesmith’s intent to deceive, Durham cited an internal message Clinesmith sent the FBI agent preparing the application, who relied on Clinesmith to tell him what the CIA said about Page. “At least we don’t have to have a terrible footnote” explaining that Page was a source for the CIA in the application, Clinesmith wrote.

The FBI lawyer also removed the initial email he sent to the CIA inquiring about Page’s status as a source before forwarding the CIA email to another FBI agent, blinding him to the context of the exchange about Page.

Durham also noted that Clinesmith repeatedly changed his story after the Justice Department’s watchdog first confronted him with the altered email during an internal 2019 investigation. What’s more, he falsely claimed his CIA contact told him in phone calls that Page was not a source, conversations the contact swore never happened.

Clinesmith Was Politically Biased at the FBI

Fox also maintained that Clinesmith had no personal motive in forging the document. But Durham cited virulently anti-Trump political messages Clinesmith sent to other FBI employees after Trump won in 2016 – including a battle cry to “fight” Trump and his policies – and argued that his clear political bias may have led to his criminal misconduct.

“It is plausible that his strong political views and/or personal dislike of [Trump] made him more willing to engage in the fraudulent and unethical conduct to which he has pled guilty,” Durham told U.S. District Judge Jeb Boasberg.

Boasberg, a Democrat appointed by President Obama, spared Clinesmith jail time and let him serve out his probation from home. Fox and the D.C. Bar sided with Boasberg, who accepted Clinesmith’s claim he did not intentionally deceive the FISA court, which Boasberg happens to preside over, and even offered an excuse for his criminal conduct.

“My view of the evidence is that Mr. Clinesmith likely believed that what he said about Mr. Page was true,” Boasberg said. “By altering the email, he was saving himself some work and taking an inappropriate shortcut.”

Fox echoed the judge’s reasoning in essentially letting Clinesmith off the hook. (The deal they struck, which the U.S. District Court of Appeals that oversees the bar approved in September, called for a one-year suspension, but the suspension began retroactively in August 2020, which made it meaningless.) Boasberg opined that Clinesmith had “already suffered” punishment by losing his FBI job and $150,000 salary.

But, Boasberg assumed, wrongly as it turned out, that Clinesmith also faced possible disbarment. ”And who knows where his earnings go now,” the judge sympathized. “He may be disbarred or suspended from the practice of law.”

Anticipating such a punishment, Boasberg waived a recommended fine of up to $10,000, arguing that Clinesmith couldn’t afford it. He also waived the regular drug testing usually required during probation, while returning Clinesmith’s passport. And he gave his blessing to Clinesmith’s request to serve out his probation as a volunteer journalist, before wishing him well: “Mr. Clinesmith, best of luck to you.”

FBI Should Have Much Higher Standards

Fox did not respond to requests for comment. But he argued in a petition to the board that his deal with Clinesmith was “not unduly lenient,” because it was comparable to sanctions imposed in similar cases. However, none of the cases he cited involved the FBI, Justice Department or FISA court. One case involved a lawyer who made false statements to obtain construction permits, while another made false statements to help a client become a naturalized citizen – a far cry from falsifying evidence to spy on an American citizen.

Durham noted that in providing the legal support for a warrant application to the secret FISA court, Clinesmith had “a heightened duty of candor,” since FISA targets do not have legal representation before the court. He argued Clinesmith’s offense was “a very serious crime with significant repercussions” and suggested it made him unfit to practice law.

“An attorney – particularly an attorney in the FBI’s Office of General Counsel – is the last person that FBI agents or this court should expect to create a false document,” Durham said.

The warrant Clinesmith helped obtain has since been deemed invalid and the surveillance of Page illegal. Never charged with a crime, Page is now suing the FBI and Justice Department for $75 million for violating his constitutional rights against improper searches and seizures.

Explaining the D.C. Bar’s disciplinary process in a 2019 interview with Washington Lawyer magazine, Fox said that “the lawyer has the burden of proving they are fit to practice again. Have they accepted responsibility for their conduct?” His office’s website said a core function is to “deter attorneys from engaging in misconduct.”

In the same interview, Fox maintained that he tries to insulate his investigative decisions from political bias. “I try to make sure our office is not used as a political tool,” he said. “We don’t want to be a political tool for the Democrats or Republicans.”

Bar records from the Clinesmith case show Fox suggested the now-discredited Trump-Russia “collusion” investigation was “a legitimate and highly important investigation.”

Protecting People Who Hurt Trump

One longstanding member of the D.C. Bar with direct knowledge of Clinesmith’s case before the bar suspects its predominantly Democratic board went soft on him due to partisan politics. “The District of Columbia is a very liberal bar,” he said. “Basically, they went light on him because he’s also a Democrat who hated Trump.”

Meanwhile, the D.C. Bar has not initiated disciplinary proceedings against Michael Sussmann, another Washington attorney charged by Durham. Records show Sussmann remains an “active member” of the bar in “good standing,” which also has not been previously reported. The former Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer, who recently resigned from Washington-based Perkins Coie LLP, is accused of lying to federal investigators about his client while passing off a report falsely linking Trump to the Kremlin.

While Sussmann has pleaded not guilty and has yet to face trial, criminal grand jury indictments usually prompt disciplinary proceedings and interim suspensions.

Paul Kamenar of the National Legal and Policy Center, a government ethics watchdog, has called for the disbarment of both Clinesmith and Sussmann. He noted that the D.C. Court of Appeals must automatically disbar an attorney who commits a crime of moral turpitude, which includes crimes involving the “administration of justice.”

“Clinesmith pled guilty to a felony. The only appropriate sanction for committing a serious felony that also interfered with the proper administration of justice and constituted misrepresentation, fraud and moral turpitude, is disbarment,” he said. “Anything less would minimize the seriousness of the misconduct” and fail to deter other offenders.

Disciplinary Counsel Fox appears to go tougher on Republican bar members. For example, he recently opened a formal investigation of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, whom records show Fox put under “temporary disciplinary suspension” pending the outcome of the ethics probe, which is separate from the one being conducted by the New York bar. In July, the New York Bar also suspended the former GOP mayor on an interim basis.

Giuliani has not been convicted of a crime or even charged with one.

The Federalist’s Notable Books Of 2021,"Last year around this time, I lamented the end of 2020 with the expectation that better times had to be lurking around the corner. Well, I sincerely hope you had a good year, but it seems like the year was defined by inflation, the Afghanistan debacle, lapsing back into more COVID restrictions, and other disasters.

In other words, it was the second year in a row to retreat into a book and at least forget about day-to-day affairs for a while. With that in mind we bring you The Federalist’s notable books of 2021. Bear in mind, this is not a collection of the best books of 2021 — just a collection of what books Federalist writers and those in our orbit read to cope with another trying year.

In “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” journalist Abigail Shrier offers a compelling and compassionate understanding of the transgender moment. Shining light on the phenomenon of rapid onset gender dysphoria, Shrier exposes the dangers of disinformation feeding a contagion that’s infected young women and girls, with catastrophic consequences.

As the nation grapples with a sudden emergence of widespread gender dysphoria never before seen, erasing women’s sports, presenting dilemmas over private spaces and creating a new generation of the sexually confused, Shrier dissects the moment with an empathy one wouldn’t expect from the hysterical outrage of left-wing opponents. A book they’ve pledged to burn, “Irreversible Damage” is an instant legacy and one of the most important books to explain our cultural crossroads.

Neal Stephenson’s “Termination Shock” might be about a dystopian future shaped by climate change, but it’s also a brilliantly weird and frenetic work of speculative fiction. I wouldn’t say it was a return to form exactly, since all of Stephenson’s books are worthwhile, but the range of subject matter recalls some of his most intellectually exciting books, “Cryptonomicon” and “Seveneves.”

Sean McMeekin’s revisionist “Stalin’s War: A New History of World War II” isn’t just one of the most compelling histories written about the war this year, it’s one of the best ever. I doubt anyone who reads it will think about the Second World War in the same way.

I read everything Matt Ridley writes, and “Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19” (co-authored with Alina Chan) did not disappoint. Nor did “Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland” by Patrick Radden Keefe, which is a couple of years old, but a fantastic look at complexities and ugliness of The Troubles, told with the great compassion.

Having written my own book on Europe this year, my energies were focused on the topic. Books like “The Great Deception: The True Story of Britain and the European Union” by Christopher Booker and Richard North, “The Global Age: Europe 1950-2017” by Ian Kershaw. and “The Strange Death of Europe” by Douglas Murray were indispensable.

Other books I quite enjoyed: “The War That Made the Roman Empire: Anthony, Cleopatra and Octavian at Actium” by Barry Strauss, Jay Cost’s “James Madison,” and, yes, “Nöthin’ But a Good Time: The Uncensored History of the ’80s Hard Rock Explosion.”

Finally, my guilty pleasure was the discovery of Spike Milligan, whose “Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall” (published in 1971) is hilarious, chaotic, and poignant. I was happy to learn that his autobiographical account of the war has six more volumes.

British historian and professor Geoffrey Parker has been writing about the early Modern world since before most of us were born. While his particular focus tends to be military history, in this biography, “Emperor: A New Life of Charles V” of the 16th century Holy Roman Emperor, Parker somehow manages to turn an enormous, 760- page tome into an absolute page-turner: I simply didn’t want to put it down.

Weaving in threads of diplomacy, politics, economics, warfare, technology, religion, art, architecture, family soap opera, and psychological insights, all painstakingly documented and footnoted, it gave me a new sense of respect for the diminutive man who, during his lifetime, ruled the largest territorial empire the world had ever seen, much of it through the sheer strength of his personality. With long, dark nights and 20 new variants of Covid pending, this is the perfect companion to keep you from losing your marbles during the bleak midwinter ahead.

“The Woman Who Stole Vermeer: The True Story of Rose Dugdale and the Russborough House Art Heist” is an engrossing biography of the world’s most famous female art thief. Art crime is apparently a largely sexist activity, being committed overwhelmingly by men. Author Anthony Amore, currently director of Security and Chief Investigator for the Garner Museum in Boston, shows how a well-to-do member of the British moneyed classes turned into a B-list Patty Hearst during the 1960s.

Eventually Dugdale decided to actively support the terrorist practices of the IRA, much to the embarrassment of some in that organization, shifting her posh English accent to an Irish brogue or Cockney slang whenever she chose to selectively check her privilege. The tale of what eventually sent her to prison, which involved the violent theft of 19 Old Master paintings including Johannes Vermeer’s “Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid” (c. 1670-71), is absolutely astonishing, but you will come to loathe her (and feel sorry for her parents) long before the climax of the tale. To paraphrase Roseanne Barr, Rose Dugdale is a perfect example of why some animals eat their young.

The race riots of 2020 were based entirely on a lie. That lie hasn’t gone away; it’s only gone dormant, to be deployed the next time it’s useful for political ends. The lie is that the U.S. police and courts are systemically racist against black Americans. Pioneering social scientist Charles Murray documents this in his slim 2021 book, “Facing Reality: Two Truths about Race in America.”

The two truths of the subtitle are these: That America’s major racial groups currently exhibit different means and distributions of cognitive ability, what is commonly labeled IQ. The second is that America’s major racial groups have different distributions of violent crime rates. Murray explains why these two are connected—people with lower mental abilities commit more violent crimes—and why together they disprove the lie of systemic racism in America’s justice system.

These two facts also help explain why violent crime rises when police, district attorneys, and courts refrain from swiftly punishing violent crime. Besides basic cause and effect, people with lower cognitive abilities respond more strongly to clear and quick punishments and rewards.

Murray’s deeply important oeuvre helps connect this more broadly to why big government is especially bad for the poor and working class: Rule by administrative state deeply complicates government, essentially withdrawing participation from the lower classes and disconnecting virtues like hard work and playing by the rules from their rewards. This encourages the lower classes in a country to become dependent and thereby spiritually impoverishes their lives. It essentially cements the poverty cycle, to which crime and laziness are two key contributors.

“Rigged: How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized Our Elections” is the book about the 2020 election that only Mollie Hemingway was brave enough to write, even though the subject matter should have had political analysts, researchers, and journalists all over it. Mollie did ferret out such sources, but the fact that she was the only reporter to doggedly pursue good information about this major public concern tells you a lot about the state of U.S. politics, media, and even our culture. (Where have all the good men gone?)

The stories she tells as a result of her investigation only expand that commentary. “Rigged” is a book about liars and cowards, how they rule the rest of us, and that we allow it. Hop over here to get a preview of what awaits you inside this book if you haven’t read this 2021 bestseller yet. After you read your copy, sit down and consider what you plan to do now that you know.

Paul Auster’s 1987 dystopian novel, “In The Country of Last Things,” felt nearly realistic amid coronavirus chaos and the lockdowns that followed. The book centers around a young woman named Anna searching for her brother in a city that has collapsed into lawlessness and disorder. Starving citizens collect trash and barter with each other.

It is written as a letter to a childhood friend from the protagonist’s perspective. “Nothing lasts, you see, not even the thoughts inside you. And you must not waste your time looking for them. Once a thing is gone, that is the end of it,” Auster writes, communicating the sense of despair that has enveloped the city and cast a shade on all who have the burden of being in its midst.

Some may have sought a literary escape from the madness and unjust actions of our elites during the peak of lockdowns. “In The Country of Last Things,” however, was a journey into a sort of existential and schizophrenic crisis America has yet to experience but is beginning to recognize is possible. It was a wild ride, yet thought-provoking and tragic. Auster crafts an emaciated world that offers lessons of perseverance and loss in the face of humanity’s bleak destruction.

In “Speechless: Controlling Words, Controlling Minds” by Michael Knowles, the Daily Wire host deconstructs the misinterpreted idea of “academic freedom” and substantively argues in favor of ordered liberty. He crafts an effective argument against so-called “free speech absolutism” and describes why the American founding tradition was never intended to foster the sort of fusionist perspective that has led to ostensible conservatives putting aside morals for freedom.

In about 250 pages, Knowles historically charts how conservatives have lost ground in the culture war to the left. As he argues, the right has sought neutrality in an idealistic daze and failed to go on the offensive. Knowles introduces complex academic concepts in an accessible way and conveys the importance of language in shaping culture. He centralizes political correctness and cultural Marxism — and how the two shaped a morally degenerate, self-contradicting society. Informative and thoughtful, I think this is a pertinent work for any young or old conservative seeking to know What Time It Is amid the left’s march through the institutions.

Daniel James Brown’s new book, “Facing the Mountain: A True Story of Japanese American Heroes in World War II,” presents first-hand and often heartbreaking accounts of Japanese Americans’ forced relocation and lives inside internment camps. Yet when the United States joined World War II, Japanese Americans answered the call to duty and formed an all-Japanese American unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (RCT).

After reading the book, you will understand why the 442nd RCT was one of the most decorated units in the U.S. army’s history. This book is timely because today’s left advocates fighting past racism with racism. This book reminds us of a better approach — a generation ago, Japanese Americans responded to injustice and discrimination with patriotism and valor.

“The Last Girl: My Story Of Captivity” is a moving memoir by Nadia Murad, who came from the Yazidi community in Iraq. In 2014, Islamic State militants massacred people in her village, including six of her brothers and her mother. Murad and other Yazidi girls became sex slaves of ISIS militants. Murad was repeatedly raped, beaten, and sold. She would eventually escape her captivity.

She has courageously shared her story on the world stage and called for the persecution of ISIS for genocide against Yazidi. Her activism and outspokenness have earned her 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. This book documents Murad’s journey from a farm girl to a world-renowned human rights activist. Anyone who reads it will find plenty of inspiration.

There’s one more reason to read this book. In November this year, Toronto District School Board cancelled Murad’s book reading with students because superintendent Helen Fisher claimed the book would be offensive to Muslim students and “foster Islamophobia.” The leader of one of the largest school districts equates regular law-abiding, peace-loving Muslims with a terrorist organization is offensive and appalling. I treat the woke left’s zealous “book burning” as my shopping guide for good books, and you should do the same.

As we wait to see if Amazon will ruin its adaptation of the Second Age of Tolkien’s Middle-Earth (probably), dedicated Tolkien readers can rest easy knowing that the literary side of the legendarium is in good hands. Christopher Tolkien died in 2020, after a half-century of editing his father’s extensive unpublished work, and the task has now passed to Carl F. Hostetter, who has done excellent work on “The Nature of Middle-Earth.”

The material shows Tolkien grappling with significant worldbuilding problems such as elven aging, reproduction, and reincarnation, with sections on the later becoming almost scholastic. It demonstrates (again) that the greatness of Tolkien’s published work was in large part due to the depth of his contemplation of his creation—he craved coherence. Though this is not a book for the casual fan, those who delight in understanding Tolkien’s world will find treasure within these pages.

Why did some former liberals who fought against Soviet communism and the Warsaw pact governments turn into reactionary conservatives? It is not just Viktor Orban of Hungary. It is also a bunch of notable intellectuals such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Ai Weiwei.

The answer is in Glenn Diesen’s new book, “Russian Conservatism: Managing Change under Permanent Revolution,” which traces the roots of a changing Russia under Putin and breaks down some of the myths about our idea of modern Russia, a semi-despotic country that is also fundamentally a historic Christian conservative nation. It’s where gender studies and LGBT rights never reached the level that we see in the West; where Orthodox Christianity sees itself as a bulwark and historic successor of the Byzantines against both the forces of revolutionary Western liberalism and near-Eastern Islamism; where Count Suvorov’s historic guiding principle of “Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationalism” is still followed, despite who’s in charge in the Kremlin.

Diesen argues that the clash with Russia is not due to remnants of Soviet-era KGB ruling over Moscow, but due to a fundamental clash of societies, where the forces of secular transnational social revolutionaries are now pushing to change another Christian conservative society. It is a fascinating and thought-provoking book that might change the way we see Russia.

My second book of the year is a return to a classic, but not for the reason it’s getting a rep recently. “The History of the Peloponnesian War” by Thucydides is recently popular again due to Graham Allison’s book on “The Thucydides Trap.” That book charts why and when an emerging power ends up in a conflict with an established power, such as what happened between Rome and Carthage, Athens and Sparta, as well as Britain and Germany. Naturally, modern social scientists desiring to decolonise the entire Western canon look down on ancient wisdom from thousands of years ago. We have, after all, evolved. Or have we?

My reason for re-reading this was a portion called the Melian Dialogue (for those interested, there’s five minutes of simplified BBC video here) where Athens gave an ultimatum to the small island of Melos, to either join them or face annihilation. What followed was a treatise in a dialogue format about the realities of power, justice, values, morality, alliances, realpolitik, and expediency.

As Russian troops mass near the Ukraine border, China returns to Cold War form, and America and Britain realise the limitations of power, morality, and values after 30 years of utopian self-sabotage, Thucydides reminds us there’s a reason old wisdom is better than a thousand data-sets, or security studies papers, and there’s a reason classics still and always will be classics.

“Frank Sinatra Has a Cold, and Other Essays” by Gay Talese, a collection of “creative nonfiction” short pieces by one of the fathers of New Journalism, blew me away. The title essay in particular, which was originally published in Esquire magazine in 1966, may well be the best thing I’ve ever read. There’s really something for everyone here, as you see Talese following and breaking all the classic rules of good writing to the effect of transporting you to the room where it happened. I feel cooler for having read it.

“The Original Meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment: Its Letter and Spirit,” by Randy Barnett and Evan Bernick instantly set the gold standard for understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment. Most of the high-profile cases that come to the Supreme Court are adjudicated under this provision, which applies individual-rights protections against state violations, and the authors definitively show how the natural-rights principles of the Declaration of Independence return to our constitutional order — or at least would if the courts followed the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment — after the Civil War. (Full disclosure: Barnett is one of my intellectual mentors, while Bernick, now a law professor himself, was my intern.)

To be honest, I wouldn’t have picked up David Harsanyi’s book “Eurotrash: Why America Must Reject the Failing Ideas of a Dying Continent” had it not been written by a friend. I love visiting Europe, but I associate its policy debates with correctly measuring the curvature of bananas and applying mind-numbing “competition” (what we call antitrust) regulations. Although Harsanyi does cover that technocratic morass, he doesn’t dwell on it and in any event his lively writing shows rather than tells why the American way is superior — if we can keep it that way.

Stella Morabito

If you’re looking for one place that connects all of the confusing dots of the COVID-19 pandemic — historical, medical, political, and more — the book you’re looking for is “COVID-19 and the Global Predators: We Are the Prey,” by Dr. Peter Breggin and Ginger Ross Breggin.

No one is better positioned to bring it all into context than Dr. Breggin, who has a sterling history of calling out corruption in medicine and Big Pharma. He became trusted as the “conscience of psychiatry” after his success in the early 1970s to stop the American Psychiatric Association from reviving the barbaric practice of lobotomy.

He and Ginger Breggin have put together a masterpiece of meticulous research that delves into everything you need to know about the Wuhan Lab research, the vaccines, clinical studies (or lack thereof), home treatments, and more. On the political front, their book charts the exploitation of COVID-19 as an instrument for jumpstarting globalists’ fever dream of “The Great Reset,” the most massive social engineering project the world has ever known.

The Breggins also follow the money and the many players, including Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, John Kerry, the Chinese Communist Party, et al. With a true psychiatrist’s eye, the Breggins describe “the perpetrator syndrome” which is at the heart of the fear-mongering and the totalitarian impulse, causing enormous damage to human freedom and well-being. There is an exhaustive chronology (through August 2021) that brings the big picture into even sharper focus. As unapologetic lovers of freedom and America, the Breggins also offer prescriptions for getting us out of this mess, making “COVID-19 and the Global Predators” a must read.

One of the sadder things about the libertarian movement is how absent it has been — and really it’s been worse than absent — from important battles against government overreach with COVID mandates. John Tamny’s “When Politicians Panicked: The New Coronavirus, Expert Opinion, and a Tragic Lapse of Reason” is a notable exception to that sad state of affairs. He explains in detail how government policies were bound to fail because of the lack of information held by central planners, providing deep thinking at a time of little thinking.

About mid-way through Ronald J. Pestritto’s history of progressivism in America, “America Transformed: The Rise and Legacy of American Progressivism,” I began to get excited about how it would end. He so beautifully and comprehensively lays out the consequences of the deviation from the constitutional governance into the progressive administrative state that it reads like a thriller. Even more interesting, the ending was just as explosive as I hoped (or is it feared?) it would be. A truly excellent book.

“Spooked: The Trump Dossier, Black Cube, and the Rise of Private Spies,” Barry Meier’s almost-too-late-to-matter book looks at how a fake dossier alleging Donald Trump colluded with Russia came to be peddled by so many media figures and cause so much damage to the country. It’s worth reading, even if readers of The Federalist will be much more knowledgeable on the topic than readers of other publications that botched the story, if for no other reason than Meier is one of the only corporate journalists to even explore the topic.

And because of his deep friendships and relationships with key figures in the Russia collusion lie, he provides never-before-seen details about the hoax and how easy it was to launder it through left-leaning media such as The New York Times. Because he looks at other hoaxes that were peddled through the media, it’s an important warning about how seriously corrupted not just political journalism is, but business and other journalism as well.

My reading was somewhat limited this year because I was writing “Rigged: How The Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized Our Elections,” my book on the 2020 election. A wonderful companion book from Hans von Spakovsky and John Fund — “Our Broken Elections: How the Left Changed the Way You Vote” — does an excellent job of moving the conversation from past problems with election integrity into future fixes. Its deep dives on the private, Zuckerberg-funded takeover of government election offices and misadministration of voting rolls and other important aspects to free and fair elections is extremely helpful and serious.

A few years back I got into the habit of reading my youngest child books about brave women. One of my favorites was “Shepherdess of Elk Valley,” an historic account by a woman who lost her husband in the Spanish Flu shortly after they bought ranch land near Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The delightful book is about how she became a successful rancher on her own, with the help of God-given perseverance, kind neighbors and a great dog.

Right now I’m reading “Light in the Dark Belt,” Rosa Young’s memoir of how she came from abject poverty to help found 30 Lutheran schools, 35 Lutheran congregations, and Concordia College in Alabama. I love her attention to detail and how her memories unfold on the pages.

Mark Hemingway

Browsing in a small used bookstore in Santa Fe this summer, I stumbled across an old, slim paperback that looked intriguing because it was blurbed by both Groucho Marx and Harper Lee. Much to my surprise, I had never even heard of the 1968 novel “Red Sky at Morning” by Richard Bradford, despite the fact that it sold more than 1 million copies in its day and they made a movie out of it starring Richard Thomas (a.k.a “John-Boy” from The Waltons). I don’t know why the book has become undeservedly forgotten — the few people I’ve encountered who have read it all recall it affectionately, and people from New Mexico sing its praises for capturing the zeitgeist of a pretty unique part of the country.

It’s the tale of a teenage boy who’s uprooted from cozy upper middle-class circumstances in Alabama and sent to live in New Mexico when his father decides to enlist in the Navy during World War II. In the 1940s, the southwest was still largely the undeveloped wild west, and what little civilization there was depended on learning to appreciate the ways of series of lively Hispanic and Native American characters.

If being a fish out of water wasn’t enough of a struggle, the young protagonist also has to become the man of the house when his high-flown southern eccentric of a mother starts unraveling mentally. Coming of age novels don’t get any better than this, striking a near perfect balance between laugh out loud comedy and bittersweet angst. In other words, the blurbs were truth in advertising — “Red Sky at Morning” feels like what would happen if you forced Groucho Marx and Harper Lee to write a book together.

Whittaker Chambers is best known for his sprawling book “Witness,” the magnum opus of anti-communism. However, for much of his career Chambers was a workaday journalist for Time magazine and other outlets, and his some of his lesser writings have been collected in “Ghosts on the Roof,” edited by Terry Teachout, an estimable critic and biographer in his own right.

I won’t claim that “Ghosts on the Roof” contains writings on par with the historical import of “Witness,” but the book is a minor revelation. Even when you’re reading something as seemingly disposable as a short film review, when it’s written by Chambers there’s still a moral gravity to his words that’s distinctly missing from so much of today’s journalism that should shame all of us contemporary ink-stained wretches.

I had long known that S.J. Perelman is a legendary and much-admired humorist — to bring this full circle, he wrote the screenplays for the Marx Brothers films “Monkey Business” and “Horse Feathers” — but it took until 2021 that I picked up “The World of S.J. Perelman.” To be honest, much of the subject matter is so dated as to be alien and I am well into my middle age years. However, the jokes still land effortlessly and seamless craft of his prose will be savored and enjoyed by anyone looking to be amused and who appreciates top-notch writing.

Earlier this year, I plowed through several by Jack Carr, who writes airport potboilers in the vein of Lee Child and Tom Clancy. Carr is an ex-Navy SEAL, which means that he a) has no business being as competent and entertaining a writer as he is and b) when it comes technothrillers about terrorism, the military, and emerging geopolitical threats, he knows what he’s talking about. Amazon is soon releasing a TV series starring Chris Pratt based on Carr’s first book, “The Terminal List.” Once you read that book, you’ll be hooked on the rest of Carr’s series.

“The Long Ships” by Frans G. Bengtsson is another classic that somehow evaded my attention until 2021. The 80 year-old book has long been a staple of Swedish literature, and if you want historical fiction and adventure, this tale of Viking life is just a rollicking good time and does fantastic job of worldbuilding. I always understood that the Vikings were pagan, but “The Long Ships” really gives you a window into the motivations of a culture that existed outside an historic Judeo-Christian understanding of European life. The way characters are casually killed off, regardless of how likable and central to the story you may think they are, makes me wonder how much of an influence it was on “Game of Thrones.”

Speaking of adventure, if you’re looking for a beach read or other diversion, it’s hard to beat “The Lost City of the Monkey God,” by Douglas Preston. A real life Indiana Jones tale, it’s about an expedition into a remote and very dangerous jungle Central America in order to explore the existence of some legendary archeological ruins.

Preston is perhaps best known as a hugely successful writer of supernatural thrillers, and his ability to keep readers turning pages is no less evident in his nonfiction. Aside from telling an amazing story, there’s a ton of fascinating info here on everything from LIDAR to snakes to how woke politics are roiling archaeology. And despite being written in 2017, the abundant info on tropical diseases mean that even Anthony Fauci manages to make an appearance without distracting too much from an otherwise extremely entertaining book.

It's Time To Defund The Speech Police,"San Francisco has had enough. The city’s mayor recently declared that “the reign of criminals who are destroying our city, it is time for it to come to an end,” and she promised to “take the steps to be more aggressive with law enforcement.”

Her get-tough pledge is, of course, shameless — if only there had been a municipal leader who could have done something before now! — but when wokeness has lost the mayor of San Francisco, it has a public-relations problem.

Following electoral defeats in Virginia, and facing a likely wipeout in next year’s midterm elections, many Democrats are scrambling away from identity politics. From crime to education to the workplace, it poisons everything, and Americans are sick of it.

Thus, we may hope that Scott McConnell is correct in predicting that wokeness “will be rolled back, its practitioners and cultural preferences first widely mocked and then ignored, its victims rehabilitated and in some cases honored.” But we should not be too sure; even if wokeness is politically toxic now, it might nonetheless win in the long run.

Identity politics’ likely resilience was highlighted in a response by Ed West as well as in a Reason article by Greg Lukianoff chronicling how the first wave of political correctness in the 1990s persisted despite its unpopularity. Put simply, identity politics holds power in key institutions, especially in tech, academia, education, the media, and Big Business. While voter anger might spook politicians on issues such as crime, wokeness in all its forms will be hard to root out of its institutional fortresses.

Thus, identity politics will remain as a powerful force in American life even if Democratic politicians avoid and downplay its more unpopular ideas (and they aren’t all giving up yet). Like a weed, snicking the head off wokeness will not kill it. Unless it is actively uprooted, wokeness will continue to embed itself within powerful institutions, just as it was doing before it broke into public view over the last few years.

Entrenched Wokeness

Thus, defeating wokeness will require more than ballot-box triumphs. The campaign against it will be long and must be sustained at multiple levels of government. To win, the conservative movement will need leaders who will persevere until leftist strongholds are reformed. We will also need bureaucratic knife-fighters who can grind through the trench warfare of administrative law.

Otherwise, wokeness will advance even if Democratic politicians disavow its most destructive ideas. After all, identity politics is now big money, offering jobs, jobs, jobs for the boys (and girls, and non-binary they/them/theirs). There is an entire industry of well-paid diversity, equity, and inclusion experts and consultants.

College administrators are making six figures to push wokeness on campus, and they are not going away just because some Democrats sidle away from critical race theory after losing a few elections. And in the long run, controlling the Ivy League and Silicon Valley may matter more than controlling Congress.

But Congress has a say, if it is willing to act. Wokeness is parasitic, subsisting largely on government time and the taxpayer’s dime. Thus, to defeat identity politics, we must defund it.

The GOP has regularly failed at this, even when government money is going to groups that use it to undermine conservatism and shill for Democrats. This must change, and identity politics must be made into a liability, rather than a status symbol and career enhancer. If wokeness is the job, the position should be eliminated. If wokeness is not part of the job, then those who make it part of the job should be fired.

Defeating Identity Politics with the Law

The legal tools to do this are available because wokeness is racist, misogynist, and religiously bigoted, and therefore frequently in violation of federal civil rights laws. What is needed is the political will and perseverance to excise wokeness from government and from private companies and organizations that depend on the government. Put simply, woke bigots engaged in discrimination shouldn’t be employed by the government or get government contracts.

There are many obvious cases of woke abuse, such as teachers and school administrators organizing racially segregated events and classrooms, or grooming a preteen girl into transgenderism without even telling her parents. In such cases, teachers and administrators should be fired and possibly prosecuted — and the school district should be sued into oblivion. Wokeness is an elite affectation that will struggle in front of a jury of ordinary Americans.

Politically, there is much to do. For instance, Republicans must recognize that wokeness is a national security vulnerability, so they must prioritize cleansing the military of woke apparatchiks who care more about winning diversity plaudits than winning wars.

Likewise, the next Republican president should have the Department of Justice relentlessly pursue legal action against woke violators of civil rights law. The next Republican secretary of rducation should reverse the perversion of civil rights laws that Biden is using to treat racial discrimination as anti-racist and to refuse to protect women against men pretending to be women.

State legislatures should cut university funding for woke initiatives and positions, and they should prohibit the use of ideological “diversity statements” in faculty hiring. Parents should take back control of local school boards and clean house, dumping administrators and teachers who have abandoned excellence and equality for identity and equity.

Conservatives need skilled leadership to accomplish these and other measures against identity politics. At the national level, we should look for a presidential candidate who can run an effective administration, rather than one who excels at annoying the woke on Twitter. In the meantime, there are victories available at the state and local levels. We will not win everywhere — San Francisco may crack down on crime, but it is unlikely to totally abandon wokeness — but we can win in a lot of places.

What is essential is turning the electoral backlash against wokeness into effective action in government. The way to beat wokeness is to defund it, and so we need to choose savvy leaders who will act, rather than just bluster.

WA State Democrats Want To Pull Back Penalties For Drive-By Shootings,"Image Credit Pexels/Photo

Washington state Democrats are seeking to pull back penalties for drive-by shootings in the state in the name of “promoting racial equity in the criminal legal system.”

Washington state Reps. Tarra Simmons and David Hackney introduced H.B. 1692 this month in an effort to keep charges related to drive-by shootings from escalating to an aggravated first-degree murder charge. The lawmakers, according to Fox News, are seeking to remove a 1995 provision that classifies murders “committed during the course of or as a result of a shooting where the discharge of the firearm … is either from a motor vehicle or from the immediate area of a motor vehicle that was used to transport the shooter or the firearm” as aggravated.

Washington Democrats want lighter penalties for drive-by murderers because of ""racial equity."" All this does is make life more dangerous, especially for black residents who suffer higher rates of criminal gun violence. I discussed with @bdomenech on #FOXNews. pic.twitter.com/178QwnTWOM — Jason Rantz on KTTH Radio (@jasonrantz) December 30, 2021

Simmons told Fox she believes “it’s clear that [the original law] was targeted at gangs that were predominantly young and Black” even though historical reports suggest that at the time of the law, “the state was experiencing a surge in gang-related crime.”

“Murder is murder no matter where the bullet comes from but locking young people up and throwing away the key is not the answer,” Simmons said, suggesting that the original provision is an example of “systemic racism.”

Multiple GOP legislators have condemned the legislation as another progressive push to let criminals off the hook as the state struggles to contain its rising crime rates.

“Washington state is already seeing a surge in violent crime, which is currently at a 25-year high, with murders at an all-time high in 2020, up 80 percent from five years ago,” Republican floor leader Rep. Jacquelin Maycumber said in a statement. “Rape is up 40 percent from five years ago and aggravated assaults are up 50 percent from five years ago. In light of this, why are some elected officials so intent on making it easier to be a violent criminal and releasing murderers back onto our streets?”

“Violent crime is on the rise in our communities, in part, because law enforcement officers do not believe under new laws passed by the Legislature earlier this year that they have the authority to detain or pursue individuals, for whom they reasonably suspect have committed criminal acts,” said Rep. Gina Mosbrucker in a press release. “It was reported during the summer that at least nine drive-by shootings in the Yakima area this year have left a trail of injuries, deaths and traumatized neighborhoods. This horrific crime is happening more and more across our state, taking the lives of innocent victims, destroying families, and leaving neighborhoods and communities in fear.”

Far-Left DAs Have Unleashed Murder Rates In Cities Like Philadelphia,"We still debate the reasons that crime fell in the 1990s. Better policing? Longer jail sentences? An aging population? Removal of lead from the atmosphere? They all may have played a role, along with other factors we are probably missing.

That debate is now academic. Crime has been rising for several years now. The new concern is why, and how we can get it to stop. Again, there are many factors, but the rise of leftist prosecutors who are soft on crime must be at the head of the list.

In my hometown of Philadelphia, crime as a general matter has been getting worse for years, and there are statistics to prove it. Philadelphia, like many big American cities, is experiencing more violent crime than at any point in its history.

Murder rates are a good proxy for violent crime generally, not only because it is the most horrific crime, but because it is harder to obscure statistically. Whether the authorities want to report it or not, whether or not the police get called, it is hard to hide the fact that someone was killed. Looking at that statistic gives us a fair impression of the level of violence in the city more generally.

The trend is discouraging, to say the least. In 2021, Philadelphia shattered the previous record in murders, which was 500 in 1990. As of December 31, a total of 559 people have lost their lives this year in the City of Brotherly Love. After some of the safest years in decades, the murder rate has climbed steeply since 2016. This year now has more than double the murders of just five years ago.

Other crimes are up, too. Carjackings were nearly unknown in the city just a few years ago. They exploded in 2020 and are up another 80 percent this year, according to Philly police. Earlier this month a member of Congress, Mary Gay Scanlon, was carjacked in broad daylight in South Philadelphia. People who don’t live in Philadelphia will say that it was always unsafe, but this level of crime, this type of brazen lawlessness, just did not happen until recently.

What’s changed? Why now? Why here? Some national trends play into it. Crime is up everywhere, and local politicians would like to chalk it all up to pandemic frustration or the Black Lives Matter riots. Those surely played a role. School closures might well have led teenagers like the ones who carjacked Scanlon to turn to crime when the major source of structure in their life — public schools — abandoned them.

But crime started rising before anyone in Philly ever heard of Wuhan or George Floyd. Years before that, change was already underway when Philadelphians elected a district attorney determined to do anything but put criminals in jail.

Larry Krasner was one of many George Soros-backed progressives elected in Democratic cities, part of the far-left backlash against Donald Trump’s 2016 victory. Energized to do something — anything — to spite the man in the White House, lefty voter turnout soared and led to Krasner, a career defense attorney, being placed at the head of the city’s law enforcement regime.

It has been an unmitigated disaster. In the face of rising crime, the DA has alienated cops, forced out career prosecutors, and rigged the bail system to dump more criminals back onto the streets. Between intentional weakness on crime and more conventional ineptitude, all of the gains of the 1990s and early 2000s have been erased. The average Philadelphian has a greater chance of being the victim of a crime than ever before. This is the “progress” leftist prosecutors have wrought.

We all see the numbers, but every one of them represents a real person, a real family, a real community forever changed by violent crime. Earlier this year, Todd Shepherd of Broad + Liberty talked to the family of a seven-year-old boy killed in a shootout between criminals in his neighborhood. That child, Zamar Jones, was gunned down in 2020 by a man who had been arrested in 2018 on a felony gun charge that should have kept him behind bars for years. Instead, Krasner’s office let him enter a plea for a misdemeanor in 2019 and got him a sentence of three to nine months. This senseless death was avoidable, and it is not the only one.

Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, a fellow Democrat, finally had enough of the exploding crime rate in his and other neighborhoods across the city, penning an op-ed for the Philadelphia Inquirer about it on December 7. It is good that city Democrats are wising up on the mess in the DA’s office, but it would have been better to do so before reelecting Krasner to a new four-year term two months ago.

Philadelphia’s story is similar to a lot of big cities across the country. Crime is getting worse and will keep getting worse until prosecutors start getting tough and making the streets safe for law-abiding citizens again.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/03/far-left-district-attorneys-have-unleashed-murder-in-cities-like-philadelphia/,2022-01-03
'Domestic Terror Unit' Is A Way To Punish Americans For Thought Crimes,"On Tuesday, Department of Justice representatives informed a Senate committee of plans to gather a group of select attorneys to form a “Domestic Terror Unit” in light of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, noting that its number of investigations of alleged domestic terrorists have more than doubled since the spring of 2020. While admitting “there is no single federal crime labeled ‘domestic terrorism,’” a DOJ official promised to invoke a “criminal code” that allows enhanced sentences for certain crimes listed as “terror offenses.”

There are many reasons to doubt the authenticity of the federal government’s efforts against this “persistent and evolving” threat, including its conveniently blurred definitions.

The National Defense and Authorization Act’s definition of “domestic terrorism” distinctly refers to “unlawful use or threat of force of violence in furtherance of ideological agendas” in the context of political or anti-government extremism. Most other common-sense definitions clearly denote violence as an essential feature. However, federal agents have a poor track record in their use of the label, not only in the case of parents angry at school boards, but most recently in relation to Jan. 6, 2021.

In July 2021, after pleading guilty to “obstruction of an official proceeding,” non-violent Jan. 6 defendant Paul Hodgkins, who had no prior criminal record, was given a heavy eight-month sentence. Judge Randolph Moss described him as one of many “terrorists” that day, baselessly lumping him in with those who committed actual violence.

In all his insufferable rantings about an “assault on democracy” and the rebellious “symbolism” of Hodgkins raising a Trump flag, Moss could not explain how his particular crime of roaming the Senate floor for 22 minutes had enabled violence. In fact, he plainly admitted that the punishment wasn’t based entirely on individual guilt, but on a perverse idea of “balanced” justice:

The court here had to consider both what I think are the extremely damaging events that occurred that day but also who Mr. Hodgkins is as an individual. And as I think is reflected by the sentencing I imposed, I tried to strike that balance.

This implies one may be considered a terrorist by virtue of being within geographical distance of what terrorists are doing if one’s political leanings are on a similar spectrum.

Despite the court’s claims, neither the prosecution nor the judge brought forth a sentencing enhancement based on the existing code of terror offenses mentioned Tuesday. Why? Because Hodgkins’ crime isn’t on it. It was terrorism because the court said it was, not by law.

More judicial malpractice occurred in the case of non-violent defendant Jacob Chansely, the infamous “Q shaman” who was held in solitary confinement for months while Judge Royce Lamberth repeatedly denied his release. In November, Chansely received an unbelievable 41-month sentence when he pleaded guilty to the same charge as Hodgkins.

While admitting Chansely committed no violent crime at the Capitol (in fact, he openly called for peace), the court cited a “need to deter others especially in cases of domestic terrorism.” By punishing a non-terrorist more harshly than necessary to “deter others,” our bloodthirsty DOJ showed a willingness to weaponize federal convictions that deplete a defendant’s civil rights just to make an example out of him.

In August, the government extended its wild accusations out of the courtrooms and into local police departments. Leading up to the anniversary of 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert advising police and neighborhoods to be on the lookout for potential terror threats. Among them were “opposition to COVID measures,” or association with “conspiracy theories on perceived election fraud.”

Do you oppose certain COVID policies or hold a skeptical view of the 2020 election’s security but have no intent to respond violently or illegally? The DHS draws no line; to them, you may be a terrorist. Their language spreads beyond actions to include statements or beliefs that are inherently devoid of any call to action, violent or not. One could almost call it an indictment of “thought crime.”

Lastly, while the Jan. 6 Capitol attack obviously involved acts of political violence, it hasn’t been linked to any broader, organized threat to the country, raising more questions as to what exactly justifies a new Terror Unit in response.

In August, after hundreds of arrests and investigations, the FBI admitted to finding no hard evidence of an elaborate political plot on Jan. 6, a confession no one in the government has retracted since. The most concerning evidence of a plot may be the FBI’s own use of provocateurs, but it’s looking doubtful the FBI or DOJ will investigate itself.

When asked by the Senate committee if any Jan. 6 defendants have been charged with “insurrection,” DOJ representatives said they were unaware of any. That’s because the answer is no. Regardless, the feds continue to ramp up their already fanatical response to a problem they haven’t clearly defined.

Our self-serving ruling class hasn’t conducted itself responsibly or transparently in the wake of the Capitol attack, and we can expect this new development to be no different. While the Biden administration would have us believe that the aimless actions of a few foolish troublemakers represent the greatest authoritarian threat to the United States, its systematic purge of political opponents indicates otherwise.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/17/doj-domestic-terror-unit-is-just-a-new-way-to-punish-americans-for-thought-crimes/,2022-01-17
Leftists Refusing To Punish Crime Are Destroying The Country,"Leftists’ intentional failure to prosecute violent criminals in some of the country’s most populous cities is propelling our societal breakdown.

Los Angeles officials revealed this week that in 2021, the city saw its highest number of homicides in 15 years. In addition to skyrocketing murders, Los Angeles is also struggling with an uptick in violence on the county’s railroad tracks, which are frequently targeted by gangs of looters. Since December 2020, some railroad companies have reported a “160% increase in criminal rail theft,” which has resulted in “approximately $5 million in claims, losses and damages” to the train companies alone.

During these raids, teams of looters pull boxes filled with luxury merchandise, Amazon packages, and even medical equipment such as COVID-19 tests and epinephrine pens out of train cars. After picking through the thousands of packages, the scavengers leave the junk in piles on and around the busy tracks.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1481816935188865026?s=20

Union Pacific, the second-largest railroad company in the United States, issued a scathing letter last month scolding the city for failing to control or punish the criminals organizing increasingly popular train raids but to no avail.

With the uptick of train crimes in the last year and a lack of prosecution from progressive district attorneys, Union Pacific said it is evaluating relocating from Los Angeles until the crime problem is properly addressed. Adrian Guerrero, Union Pacific’s director of public affairs, blamed far-left Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon for refusing to prosecute and punish the criminals who raid “over 90 containers” a day.

“Criminals are caught and arrested, turned over to local authorities for booking, arraigned before the local courts, charges are reduced to a misdemeanor or petty offense, and the criminal is released after paying a nominal fine,” Guerrero wrote in a letter to Gascon. “These individuals are generally caught and released back onto the streets in less than twenty-four hours. Even with all the arrests made, the no-cash bail policy and extended timeframe for suspects to appear in court is causing re-victimization to UP by these same criminals. In fact, criminals boast to our officers that charges will be pled down to simple trespassing — which bears no serious consequence.”

“Without any judicial deterrence or consequence, it is no surprise that over the past year UP has witnessed the significant increase in criminal rail theft described above,” Guerrero added.

Los Angeles certainly isn’t the only city experiencing a terrifying rise in violent and destructive crime. New York, D.C., and Chicago all saw “record-high” murders in 2021 while Philadelphia; Portland, Oregon; Louisville, Kentucky; and Albuquerque, New Mexico, “had their deadliest years on record.”

As Federalist Contributor Kyle Sammin noted in a column at the beginning of this year, “in 2021, Philadelphia shattered the previous record in murders, which was 500 in 1990,” which some attributed to the tumultuous social conditions brought on by the death of George Floyd and COVID-19.

“But crime started rising before anyone in Philly ever heard of Wuhan or George Floyd,” Sammin noted. “Years before that, change was already underway when Philadelphians elected a district attorney determined to do anything but put criminals in jail.”

While Democrats and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s rigged Jan. 6 commission like to claim Republicans endorse and even incite violence, there is no denying that progressives’ soft, leftist policies have ravaged cities and are quickly turning the U.S. into a crime-ridden state.

During the 2020 summer of rage, thousands of rioters sacked cities across the nation, costing taxpayers, business owners, and families up to $2 billion. They looted storefronts, set businesses owned by families for generations on fire, and vandalized government property in the name of “racial justice.” Instead of facing condemnation in the courts or in the public court of opinion, however, many of these violent rioters were bailed out on the recommendation of now-Vice President Kamala Harris and progressive-backed initiatives under lax-on-crime policies implemented by leftist DAs.

This same caveat for crime was applied more recently in Waukesha, Wisconsin, when Darrell Brooks Jr. was let out on exceptionally low bail days before he was charged with murder for using his red SUV to mow down dozens of people and kill multiple adults and even a child at the city’s annual Christmas parade.

The Milwaukee district attorney, whose policies set Brooks free, is a pro-criminal-release leftist who previously said it was “guaranteed” that someone he let off easy would kill somebody someday.

“Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into [a] treatment program, who’s going to go out and kill somebody?” Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm flippantly said to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2007. “You bet. Guaranteed. It’s guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the overall approach.”

Chisolm was unwilling to take responsibility for letting Brooks off the hook days before his deadly crimes but had also expressed an unwillingness to change his policies, which circumvent or eliminate bail requirements for many dangerous criminals.

Waukesha massacre suspect Darrell Edward Brooks was released from Milwaukee County jail on $1,000 bail earlier this week.

Some city officials such as San Francisco Mayor London Breed have finally admitted the necessity of a crime crackdown to address “all the bullsh-t that has destroyed our city,” but that sentiment is not shared in other quickly declining urban areas.

Until prosecutors start being tough on crime again or progressive district attorneys are recalled, crime in the country will continue to skyrocket and harm cities already struggling to keep citizens from fleeing poop-littered streets to red states.

Big Cities Are Coming To Their Senses On Law And Order,"Image Credit Flickr/Hollywata

Law and order won big in Seattle last November when Ann Davison was elected city attorney over a 12-year incumbent and a radical, police abolitionist candidate. Other cities seem to also be waking up to the urban decay brought about by lax law enforcement, offering a glimmer of hope that our major cities might be returning to a more common-sense approach to criminal justice. But leftists are not giving up without a fight.

Across the nation, the rotten fruits of leftist politics have become all too obvious, as the defund-the-police mentality has left citizens and their communities unprotected against criminals who are not held accountable for their crime sprees. The predictable result has been skyrocketing thefts, assaults, shootings, and murders. But people are finally getting fed up, and we’re beginning to see a change in both the political rhetoric and election of candidates promising to fix the problem.

Just a year ago, San Francisco Mayor London Breed was one of the leading champions of slashing police budgets. But in December, she changed her tune when she made an emergency request for more money for the police department, declaring, “It’s time for the reign of criminals to end.”

In New York City, former police officer Eric Adams was sworn into office as the new mayor after a campaign emphasizing law and order. One of his campaign promises was to bring back a plainclothes police unit to tackle gang and gun violence, a promise that is now becoming reality.

Resistance From District Attorneys

But the mayors of both these cities face opposition from the very people who should be enforcing their tough-on-crime policies. In San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin criticized Breed for his crackdown on crime. Despite the 161 percent increase in violence between 2020 and 2021 in the low-income, historically black Tenderloin neighborhood, Boudin insisted that jail and prosecution are not the proper solutions.

In New York City, the new Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has instructed his prosecutors to seek jail time only for those most serious of crimes (like murder, sexual assault, and major economic crimes). Some theft and assaults, gun possession, and other “less serious” offenses should be directed to alternative routes per Bragg’s policy.

Seattle City Council’s Power Play

In Seattle, the story is a little different. In what would have been a surprising development in other times, the liberal voters elected a Democrat-turned-Republican city attorney. Davison won with a ten-point lead over Nicole Thomas-Kennedy, a radical candidate who regularly called cops “Nazis,” “pigs,” and “losers.” In addition to record-breaking gun violence in the city, Davison also faces a backlog of nearly 4,000 criminal cases that accrued under the former city attorney during his last two years in office.

But before Davison could even take the oath of office, the Seattle City Council introduced and passed an unprecedented bill The Seattle Times called a “political power play” which is “brazenly undercutting the voters’ decisive mandate to make the city safer.”

The bill requires the Seattle City Attorney’s Office to provide a quarterly report on its prosecuting activities, as well as give a 90-day notice of any changes to the city’s diversion programs. Councilmember Alex Pederson was the sole vote against the bill, pointing out that a simple request for those reports would have sufficed without going to the lengths of changing the Seattle Municipal Code.

The Seattle Times warns that “the bill would impose the council’s ideas about which cases go to courts and which are diverted into community programs,” a blatant blurring of authority lines since it’s the city attorney, not the council, who is elected to charge crimes.

The council has disingenuously insisted this new ordinance is no threat to the authority and discretion of the city attorney, but merely an effort toward greater transparency, citing “racial disproportionality, affecting Black and brown communities” within Seattle’s criminal justice system.

At best, the bill is an insult to Seattle’s city attorney to create a rule never before placed on her predecessors. Davison said as much in a letter to the City Council. At worst, it is an attempt to wrest prosecutorial authority from the City Attorney’s Office to serve the council’s far-left political goals .

Positive Signs but Battle Continues

San Francisco, New York City, Seattle — these cities represent the ongoing battle for safe streets, holding people accountable for crime, and protecting victims. The changed rhetoric of a progressive mayor and the election of more tough-on-crime candidates in these large cities is a sign of hope, but this is not the time to sit back in satisfaction. People must continue to push these elected officials for performance, not just promises.

Power will not be easily wrested from the hands of those on fanciful journeys to “reimagine” the American criminal justice system. It’s a struggle that will likely take many years of persistent work in local, state, and federal elections — but it’s worth fighting.

"I Couldn't Wait To Live In D.C., Now I Pay Less For More Freedom, Safety","My first trip to Washington, D.C. was during a government shutdown. Alongside the national monuments inexplicably guarded by park rangers and caution tape — as if that effort cost the government less money than just leaving the monuments in peace — I remember observing sprinklers running in the rain on public grounds and a locked public bathroom with its lights on. Undeterred by that impression, I was still thrilled with the city.

By the time I graduated high school, I was determined to end up living and working in D.C. I went to college in northern Virginia in part for the proximity it offered to the Washington political scene. My first college internship led me to spend a summer in the city and it lived up to my rosy expectations — the excitement and conveniences of a city were at my fingertips without the grime, claustrophobia, or overwhelming size of a place like New York.

I loved walking past important-looking people on my way to the office, trying out food trucks in Farragut Square at lunch, going to the Kennedy Center, exploring museums after work, networking over coffee. Was I looking through starry-eyed intern glasses? Of course. But there were still real things to love about the city.

Fast-forward, and my plans to settle in the city were delayed by the Covid shutdown. I ended up starting a remote job (here at The Federalist) and placing my big-city plans on pause until the Covid mania subsided and the dust from a summer of unrest was settled.

Now, almost two years after unscientific Covid lockdowns pushed by power-hungry Democrats shuttered cities like D.C. across the country, I’m thanking my stars I dodged signing a lease.

Just earlier this month, Mayor Muriel Bowser forced a citywide vaccine mandate that bars the unvaccinated from restaurants, coffee shops, entertainment and sports venues, gyms, and conferences. Adult patrons must show proof of vaccination and a photo ID to enter such venues (more than the city requires when you show up to vote).

Meanwhile, crime has soared. Just last year, Time reported, “In Washington D.C. over 200 murders were recorded for the first time since 2003.” The homicide rate for 2021 was more than 200 percent higher than a decade prior.

Last month, a father pushing his baby in a stroller in broad daylight was assaulted by a man who threw a brick at them with no apparent motive. In July, gunshots sent fans at a Nationals baseball game into panic. That same weekend, a six-year-old girl was killed in a drive-by shooting.

A recent report showed that carjackings in D.C. jumped from 360 in 2020 to 426 in 2021. Days after 66-year-old Muhammad Anwar was killed in a carjacking, Bowser was tweeting that “auto theft is a crime of opportunity.”

Recently, someone planning a trip to D.C. asked me where the safest parts of town to stay would be, and out of curiosity I searched for a crime map. The entire downtown was red, from Capitol Hill to the Potomac.

I haven’t ridden the Metro subway system in more than a year, but friends tell me it’s worse than ever. After a train derailed “at least three times in a single day” in October, the metro system pulled about 60 percent of its trains from service.

While no one was injured, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) offered a meager $21 to those involved in the incident as an apology. WMATA “said the remaining 40 trains will run every 30 minutes. Passengers reported waits of as long as an hour during Monday morning’s rush,” a local news station reported in the aftermath.

Add an extra helping of left-wing neighbors, urban smog, homeless camps, and crime-filled parks that Bowser only cleans up when she’s holding a press conference, and what’s not to love?

Meanwhile, the cost of rent in D.C. actually grew by 12 percent in the past year. A one-bedroom apartment will set you back an average of nearly $2,500. For that monthly price, you can rent a five-bedroom house in Tucson, Ariz., or Indianapolis, for example.

I sincerely hope the city rights itself soon. I haven’t given up hope that, despite the faults it’s always had, it’ll be a bustling place again and even a welcoming one. But for now, I’ll enjoy my freedoms, my safe streets, clean air, cheaper housing, and 60-second commute.

6 New Revelations From The John Durham Spygate Probe,"On Jan. 25, Special Counsel John Durham filed a “discovery update” and a request for an extension of time to provide Michael Sussmann documents related to the government’s pending criminal case against the former Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer.

The 19-page court filing reveals some fascinating details about the Sussmann case, the broader special counsel investigation, and most intriguingly an apparent rift between Durham’s team and the Office of Inspector General. Here’s a quick refresher of the case, followed by five takeaways.

What’s Happened So Far

On September 16, 2021, the special counsel’s office filed a one-count indictment against Sussmann, who served as a lawyer for the Clinton campaign during the 2016 election. The indictment charged that Sussmann had lied to FBI General Counsel James Baker when he provided him information that purported to show the Trump organization had established a secret channel to communicate with a Russian bank, Alfa Bank.

Specifically, according to the indictment, “Sussmann lied about the capacity in which he was providing the allegations to the FBI,” with Sussmann falsely stating “he was not doing his work on the aforementioned allegations ‘for any client.’” In fact, though, the indictment charged, Sussmann was acting on behalf of “a U.S. technology industry executive at a U.S. Internet company”—later identified as Rodney Joffe—and “the Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign.”

Before the 2016 election, the Clinton team also pushed claims to the press of a Trump-Alfa Bank covert communication channel, with Slate publishing a detailed story on this conspiracy theory the week before the election. The FBI later concluded there was nothing to the story and then turned its attention to claims of a broader Trump-Russia collusion for the next three years.

But by May 2019, the investigators had become the investigated, with then-Attorney General William Barr directing Durham “to investigate certain intelligence and law-enforcement activities surrounding the 2016 presidential election.” Prior to the 2020 election, Barr appointed Durham as a special counsel, and for the last year-and-a-half he has continued in that role, albeit with little fanfare.

1. There’s Much More to Come

In fact, Sussmann represents only the third individual charged as a result of Durham’s probe. In August 2020, FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith pleaded guilty to altering an email to push forward the FISA surveillance application against Carter Page. On November 4, 2021, Durham charged Igor Danchenko, Christopher Steele’s primary sub-source, with five counts of lying to the FBI.

Now, with Monday’s filing in the Sussmann case, there is reason to believe more is to come—much more. And that’s the first take-away.

2. Criminal Investigation of Sussmann Afoot

There is an “active, ongoing criminal investigation” of Sussmann’s conduct.

After news broke of the indictment against Sussmann, the left quickly spun the charge as a big nothing-burger. “Is that all John Durham Has?,” more than one commentary asked.

Of course the indictment of Danchenko a little over a month later proved that wasn’t the case, but even before Durham charged Danchenko, the media should have known more was to come. After all, when the special counsel’s office charged Sussmann, it should have been clear from Durham’s timing that he was trying to outrun the clock on the five-year statute of limitations: With Sussmann’s alleged lie to Baker occurring on September 19, 2016, the special counsel team had to file the indictment when it did to prevent the charge from being time-barred.

That Durham was not done seemed clear from the 27-page speaking indictment that, among other details, revealed that in crafting the Trump-Alfa Bank narrative, computer researchers working with Joffee “accessed ‘data of an Executive Branch office of the U.S. government,’ which ‘Internet Company-I had come to possess as a sub-contractor in a sensitive relationship between the U.S. government and another company.’”

And while Danchenko’s indictment makes clear the special counsel’s office was not done in general, yesterday’s filing by the special counsel suggests he isn’t even done with Sussmann.

“The Government also maintains an active, ongoing criminal investigation of the defendant’s conduct and other matters,” Monday’s court filing explained on its opening page. Special Counsel Durham’s office repeated that point two more times, adding more texture in the third instance: “In addition, the Special Counsel’s office maintains an active, ongoing criminal investigation of these and other matters that is not limited to the offense charged in the Indictment.”

So, no, this offense is not all Durham has, either in general, or potentially related to Sussmann.

3. Marc Elias Called Before the Grand Jury

Another significant revelation from yesterday’s court filing concerned Sussmann’s Perkins Coie colleague, Marc Elias, the top lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Elias, identified in the Sussmann indictment and the government’s discovery update as “Campaign Lawyer-1,” provided sworn grand jury testimony, according to the special counsel’s office. That revelation proves significant given that Elias served as an attorney for the Clinton campaign and thus attorney-client privilege would generally protect communications related to the legal work performed.

However, as the attorney known by the moniker Techno Fog noted, “the fact that Marc Elias, the DNC/Clinton lawyer, was before a grand jury. . . indicates Durham has used the ‘crime-fraud exception’ to compel disclosure of information and to elicit testimony.”

The crime-fraud exception provides that communications are not protected by attorney-client privilege if a client seeks advice from an attorney to plan or commit a crime. If Durham did successfully use the crime-fraud exception to question Elias or force the production of documents, that would be a huge development, especially given Elias’s role in hiring Fusion GPS, which hired Steele.

But there’s much more than Marc.

4. Many Others Called Before Grand Jury

Elias was not the only one called before the grand jury, as Durham’s team laid out in Monday’s filing in an effort to obtain an extension to the discovery deadline.

In addition to Elias, the grand jury heard sworn testimony from James Baker; Bill Priestap; the assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division; a former FBI deputy assistant director for counterintelligence; an FBI special agent; an FBI headquarters supervisory special agent; two CIA employees; two employees of Georgia Tech; and a former employee of one of the internet companies identified in the indictment.

Also significant was the list of individuals or companies served with grand jury subpoenas for documents, which included the Clinton campaign; “a political organization,” likely the Democratic National Committee; Perkins Coie; three internet companies connected to Joffe; Georgia Tech; Fusion GPS; and “a public relations firm that advised [Perkins Coie] concerning public statements issued in 2018 about the [Sussmann’s] meeting with the former FBI General Counsel.”

The full list of materials provided to Sussmann’s legal team added additional insights into the breadth of the special counsel’s investigation, including the fact that Durham’s team conducted at least 94 interviews. In addition to Baker and Priestap, Durham’s team interviewed more than 24 other current or former FBI employees, numerous CIA employees, a dozen employees at various internet companies connected to Joffe, as well as an employee of Joffe’s, the former chairman of Perkins Coie, a former employee of the Clinton campaign, and four current and former employees of Georgia Tech.

Likewise interesting is that the special counsel’s office turned over to Sussmann 12 transcripts of interviews conducted by the DOJ’s Office of Inspector General in connection with the OIG’s investigation of Crossfire Hurricane. That Durham had these documents suggests the special counsel’s office is reviewing what the OIG compiled as part of its own investigation.

A final tidbit of note: The special counsel’s office provided Sussmann nearly 400 emails its team had retrieved from the FBI’s holdings that were sent to, received from, or copied to Sussmann’s Perkins Coie email address from January of 2016 through June of 2017. That’s a lot of email messages: To whom at the FBI was Sussmann communicating during that time period, and about what?

5. The Court of Public Opinion

In addition to detailing all of the information the special counsel’s office had already provided Sussmann or would shortly, in requesting an extension to finish discovery, Durham’s team stressed the breadth of Sussmann’s discovery demands and the transparency with which those demands were met.

For instance, Sussmann’s attorneys requested “all of the prosecution team’s communications with counsel for witnesses or subjects in this investigation, including, ‘any records reflecting any consideration, concern, or threats from your office relating to those individuals’ or their counsels’ conduct…and all formal or informal complaints received by you or others’ about the conduct of the Special Counsel’s office.”

After noting that “communications with other counsel are rarely discoverable,” the government said it expects to produce responsive documents later this week. But the special counsel office added, “it is doing so despite the fact that certain counsel persistently have targeted prosecutors and investigators on the Special Counsel’s team with baseless and polemical attacks that unfairly malign and mischaracterize the conduct of this investigation.”

For instance, “certain counsel have falsely accused the Special Counsel’s Office of leaking information to the media and have mischaracterized efforts to warn witnesses of the consequences of false testimony or false statements as ‘threats’ or ‘intimidation,’” Durham explained to the court.

In other words, with Sussmann’s lawyers soon to receive this cache of complaints against Durham’s team, watch for the corrupt media to be quoting those false charges by this weekend, spinning a narrative of a corrupt special counsel’s office.

6. Wait! WHAT?

Near the end of the special counsel’s 19-page discovery update and extension request came the fifth takeaway: something strange is going on in the Office of Inspector General.

According to yesterday’s filing, on December 17, 2021, the OIG provided the special counsel’s office a written forensic report concerning a “cyber-related matter” that Sussmann had told an OIG special agent in charge about. Specifically, in early 2017, Sussmann told the OIG agent that one of his “clients had observed that a specific OIG employee’s computer was ‘seen publicly’ in ‘Internet traffic’ and was connecting to a Virtual Private Network in a foreign country.”

When the OIG office provided Durham’s team the “forensic report,” it represented “that it had ‘no other file[] or other documentation’ relating to this cyber matter.”

However, one week ago, Sussmann’s attorneys informed Durham’s team that Sussmann had, in fact, personally met with the DOJ’s inspector general in March 2017, when he passed on the tip about the OIG employee’s connection to a foreign VPN. While Sussmann had not told the OIG his client’s name at the time, last week his lawyers informed Durham’s team that it was Tech Executive-1, i.e., Joffe, who had discovered the OIG employee’s computer connecting to a VPN in a foreign country.

Upon learning this news, Durham’s team promptly contacted the OIG again and learned, for the first time, that Sussmann had met with both the inspector general and his then-general counsel in March 2017 about the above-described cyber matter. Since then, including over this last weekend, the OIG has been providing further documentation related to that meeting to the special counsel’s office.

So many questions! First, why did the OIG not inform the special counsel’s office that Sussmann had met with both the inspector general and his then-general counsel? And why did the OIG falsely represent that there was no “further documentation”? Sure, it could have been accidental, but given that Durham’s attorneys publicly exposed this “mistake,” it suggests something more is afoot.

Then there is the question of the veracity of the claim and what happens to the investigation. Was there really an OIG employee connecting on a foreign VPN? Who was it? Why? Did the OIG ever find out?

What about Joffe: How in the world did he discover the OIG employee’s computer connecting to a VPN in a foreign country? Was Joffe monitoring other government computers? How? Why? Was anyone else involved? Who knew?

These questions seem significant given that Sussmann’s meeting with the OIG occurred in March 2017, putting the “discovery” during the Trump administration and ongoing Crossfire Hurricane investigation. With questions like these just arising now, no wonder Durham isn’t done yet with his investigation.

"In Russia Crisis, Ukraine Should Trade Land For Independence","When Viktor Yanukovych, the last pro-Russian president of Ukraine, was deposed in the midst of the Euromaidan protests in 2014, Moscow moved quickly to annex the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea. The reason for that was obvious: Crimea is the site of Sevastopol, traditionally Russia’s most important naval base in the world.

The 20-year lease Kiev and Moscow signed in 1997 was expiring soon, and now almost certainly would not be renewed. Moscow couldn’t risk losing the home base of its vaunted Black Sea fleet on a territory that had never been considered part of Ukraine before the ravages of Communism.

Along the Russian frontier in eastern Ukraine, on the other hand, Russia has moved more slowly, making its ultimate goal less obvious. The provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk in the region of Donbas declared independence almost at the same time as Crimea, but they were not annexed. Despite issuing 600,000 passports to residents of Donbas and funneling more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to there every year, Moscow has done virtually nothing to integrate the areas into Russia administratively. On the contrary, it is facilitating emigration from Donbas to Russia proper.

So what does Russia want now? Its principal demand of Kiev is the implementation of Ukraine’s obligations under the Minsk cease-fire agreements of 2014 and 2015, which are enshrined in U.N. Security Council Res. 2202.

Ukraine promised to let Luhansk and Donetsk conduct local elections under a special status law with guarantees of local autonomy and a general amnesty. In exchange, the separatists agreed to disband their “people’s republics,” lay down their weapons, and allow the Ukrainian military to regain control of all Ukrainian territory to the Russian border.

The agreements were never implemented, due largely to disagreements over sequencing. But now Ukraine seems to be walking away from them altogether. Ukraine has apparently decided that leaving the separatist areas under Russian control indefinitely may be preferable to implementing the Minsk Agreements and giving Russia a powerful lever over Kiev again. That might be right, and may be the real reason Russia is about to go to war.

What the USSR Left Behind

The map of Ukraine left behind by the Soviet Union in 1991 had no historical precedent in the history of the area before the Communist Revolution. Ukraine and Crimea came to Russia independently starting in the 17th century. Ukraine came in stages as Poland waned in territory, with the areas east of the Dnieper River firmly in Russian hands by the time of Peter the Great, while Crimea was captured from the Ottoman Turks.

Centuries later, after World War II, the Soviets wanted to give the impression of a diverse coalition of states, particularly in order to justify their demand for multiple seats at the United Nations, so Ukraine was presented to the world as a powerful Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1954, Premier Nikkita Khrushchev – a Ukrainian – “gave” Ukraine nominal control of significant territory and strategic forces, but it was all a show, because everyone knew the Kremlin retained total control.

When those borders suddenly became “real” in 1991, amidst the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kiev found itself in control of a nuclear arsenal, the Black Sea fleet, Russia’s most important commercial and naval ports in the world (Odessa and Sevastopol), and tens of millions of Russians. U.S. diplomats realized the situation was dangerously untenable, and quickly pressed Kiev to return the nuclear arsenal and Black Sea fleet to Russia. Unfortunately, the adjustments stopped there, leaving Ukraine with a bigger bite of Russia than it could safely chew.

A glance at the map of 1991 should have made people wonder whether Ukraine, in these artificially enlarged borders, could even be a viable state. It wasn’t at all clear that Ukraine would be strong enough to maintain both political independence and territorial integrity given the weight of vital Russian interests involved. “Russia is never as strong as she looks, Russia is never as weak as she looks,” the saying goes, and the map of 1991 reflected a state of Russian weakness that was bound to prove fleeting.

Ukraine had no problem controlling the territory as long as it accepted Moscow’s control. But the moment it definitively broke away from Moscow in 2014, it immediately lost control of those areas that were most vital to Russian interests, and nobody with an even minimal sense of Russian and Ukrainian history can pretend to have been taken by surprise.

Choosing Independence Over Territory

The years since have helped clarify Kiev’s priorities. The exclusion of Crimea and eastern Donbas from Ukrainian elections had a salutary benefit: There would henceforth be virtually no chance of a pro-Russian party winning an election in Ukraine. Understandably, Ukraine has upped the ante.

In 2017 it imposed an economic embargo on the separatist areas of Donbas, leading to their total economic collapse; they are now utterly dependent on Moscow, and good riddance as far as many Ukrainians are concerned. Perhaps even more infuriating from Moscow’s point of view, the most prominent Putin ally in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, has been under house arrest since May 2021, his television stations and other enterprises shuttered. Now Kiev is advancing a draft law “On the Principles of State Policy of the Transition Period” that would make the implementation of Minsk all but impossible.

What explains these moves is that Ukraine is now free of Russian dominance and is consolidating its political independence and increasingly westward orientation. But that could change if the Minsk Agreements are implemented, which explains why Russia is so insistent on their implementation. The Minsk Agreements – particularly their provisions on the reintegration of Donbas into Ukraine – represent Russia’s last hopes of maintaining political influence over Kiev by peaceful means.

Whatever military action Moscow is contemplating now will almost certainly be shaped by the overriding objective of political influence – not territory – and the United States should plan accordingly. Russia may decide to take territory instead, but if it does so violently, it is not likely to stop at the areas under its current control. It will most likely (at the very least) capture the hundred miles of coastline along the Sea of Azov that currently separate Donbas and Crimea. It’s important to keep in mind that if Russia’s objective was to annex the Donbas territories, it could have done so at any time since 2014, without the need for massing an invasion force on three sides of Ukraine.

Americans with only a thin understanding of Russian motives are thinking in terms of “domino theory.” They insist that if Russia isn’t stopped here, it will only go for more territory. Echoes of Sudetenland and “peace in our time” incline many of us to stand up to tyrants who would prey on peaceful democracies.

But Russia’s motives appear to be considerably more nuanced and carefully considered. Putin hates the settlement of 1991 and would change many things if he could. For example, he would love to have at least part of the Baltic States back. But he surely sees that any inch of territory of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member is hopelessly out of reach, and NATO must make sure the point is crystal clear.

But Putin seems motivated more by a desire to forestall further degradation of Moscow’s strategic position than by a desire to revise the settlement of 1991. In that sense, Moscow is reacting to events, as it did in 2008 when it invaded parts of Georgia, a preventive response to the Bush administration’s reckless suggestion of NATO membership for that former Soviet republic.

That brings us to the crucial question of NATO and the vital U.S. interests in the Ukraine crisis. It’s crucial to remember that in managing the liquidation of the Soviet Empire, it was never a goal of U.S. policy to separate Russia from Crimea or its Black Sea fleet, or otherwise dismember it. Such a goal would have jeopardized the whole objective of a peaceful end to communism in Europe, not to mention the dubious justice of continuing to punish the people who were arguably the principal victims of both Nazism and Communism, namely the Russians themselves.

The principle of territorial integrity and political independence of sovereign states is part of the bedrock of the international system, and the United States should reaffirm it always. But a nation’s commitments must always be calibrated to the weight of the interests involved, and a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine simply does not, in and of itself, implicate vital U.S. interests – leaving aside the fact that this dispute involves the historical territorial integrity of Russia as well as a newborn Ukraine.

For some, the Ukraine crisis implicates U.S. prestige, in tatters after the shameful withdrawal from Afghanistan. But prestige is a good reason not to make commitments that can’t be backed up.

NATO’s Mixed Messages

Confusion about NATO’s mission since the end of the Cold War has inevitably translated into confusion about how big the alliance should be. In 1999 and 2004, NATO expanded its membership to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the Baltic states. Including those countries made sense both geographically and in terms of shared values, interests, and national power.

But with the accession of Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and Croatia in 2004 and 2009, NATO expanded to include countries that were unstable, militarily weak, and economically moribund in a geographic area that was not vital for the survival of NATO. Worst still was NATO’s announcement that it “welcomed” membership for Georgia and Ukraine, a move that had no strategic justification and caused considerable alarm and anger in the Kremlin.

NATO is open to states that can qualify for membership, and Russia cannot be given any sort of formal veto rights under the NATO treaty. But that doesn’t mean that the composition of NATO is none of Russia’s business.

Russia points to the principle of “equal and indivisible security,” which the United States and its NATO allies have agreed to under auspices of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, as enshrining a commitment not to increase the security of one state at the expense of another. Historical examples abound to back this up.

For example, the proposed Anschluss of Germany and Austria in 1938 was very much the business of France and England, which should have gone to war to prevent it. And Russia is entirely within its rights to protest the stationing of strategic offensive forces in countries right on its borders, for the same reason the United States protested Moscow’s placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962.

Compromise isn’t always the same as appeasement. To give one prominent example, the idea of NATO membership for Ukraine, while it still claims sovereignty over Russia’s most important naval base in the world, is both preposterous and needlessly provocative, and there is no shame in admitting it.

Russia has continued to be a malign force in world affairs. But not all its grievances are unreasonable, and it is a dangerous mistake for Kiev and Washington to reject them all out of hand.

The United States and its NATO allies should recognize Kiev’s decision to prioritize political independence over territory, for it helps clarify the outlines of a peaceful settlement. The Ukraine crisis can’t last forever. And while Russia surely knows it can’t have everything it wants, if it gets some of what it vitally needs, perhaps Ukraine can, too.

18 Fundraisers Aiding Riots And Murder That GoFundMe Didn't Shut Down,"While GoFundMe races to confiscate millions of dollars from Canadians protesting the country’s coercive Covid response, the left-wing fundraising site has proven itself very willing to help raise funds for criminal riots, abortions, and genital mutilation.

“We now have evidence from law enforcement that the previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity,” GoFundMe wrote in the company’s Friday announcement that it would steal millions from the truckers participating in the “Freedom Convoy” to protest Canada’s Covid mandates, diverting the money “to credible and established charities chosen by the Freedom Convoy 2022 organizers and verified by GoFundMe.” After backlash, the platform announced it would instead refund the money to donors.

GoFundMe cited one of its terms of service that “prohibits the promotion of violence and harassment.” The group used similar logic to suspend fundraising campaigns for Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges after he shot three men in self-defense. GoFundMe tried to defend its decision then by claiming that “GoFundMe’s Terms of Service prohibit raising money for the legal defense of an alleged violent crime,” despite the platform’s willingness to crowdsource for arrested rioters.

Also, after a protest on Jan. 6, 2021 saw some attendees forcibly enter the U.S. Capitol building, GoFundMe said it would nix fundraisers for “travel to a political event where there’s risk of violence by the attendees,” as well as those that “spread misinformation about the election, promote conspiracy theories and contribute to or participate in attacks on U.S. democracy.”

Those who now seek to shut down the “Freedom Convoy” in Canada are leaning on similar inflammatory language as that used to stoke outrage in describing the U.S. Capitol incident. Yet for all the company’s efforts to shut down freedom-minded Canadians, GoFundMe has done plenty to help unsavory fundraising campaigns on the left, which include funding for crimes, criminal defense, killing babies, and more. Here are just a few examples.

Funding for Criminals, Riots

One GoFundMe fundraising campaign entitled “CHARGED WITH BANK ROBBERY DURING GEORGE FLOYD RIOT” is seeking bail money for Dominique Maxey, who was arrested in May 2020 and charged with bank larceny.

In another listing, Raven S. is seeking $2,000 to help pay fines after, as she wrote, “on November 13 I was arrested and detained for trying to assist a man being wrongfully assaulted by police.”

A woman named Stephanie has raised nearly $3,000 for her daughter who was arrested in conjunction with a riot in 2020. “Tia Pugh, a 21 year old resident of Mobile, was arrested for alleged criminal mischief and inciting a riot while attending a George Floyd protest the Sunday prior; two municipal misdemeanors. She was then arrested for federal felony civil unrest for the same incident,” she wrote.

After three suspects were arrested for vandalizing the home of a defense witness in the Derek Chauvin trial, leaving his home “smeared with animal blood” with “a severed pig’s head dumped on the front porch,” GoFundMe enabled the three self-described “community activists” to raise more than $10,000 for legal fees.

GoFundMe allowed a campaign called “PDX Protest Bail Fund” to raise nearly $1.4 million for arrestees.

The fundraising site has also enabled CrimethInc. to raise nearly $60,000, despite the group’s promotion of violence to an extent that even Facebook banned it.

After Alissa Azar was indicted on a felony riot charge and multiple misdemeanor charges, including one relating to the use of tear gas and pepper spray against another person, GoFundMe helped her raise more than $6,000 for legal defense.

When “comrades” “reclaimed” (read: took over) a hotel in Minneapolis, GoFundMe enabled the trespassers to raise more than $245,000.

Far-left extremists occupied an entire hotel during the 2020 riots and raised hundreds of thousands on @GoFundMe: https://t.co/GMyl66w7Zh — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) February 5, 2022

GoFundMe itself donated $500 to the Riot Kitchen, a pro-riot food truck. Eight “Riot Kitchen” members were arrested in August 2020 near Kenosha, Wis., after filling numerous gas cans and attempting to escape after police confronted them, according to law enforcement. Police also reported “helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks and suspected controlled substances” in the vehicles.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1489939800631226371

GoFundMe also took to Twitter to promote a fundraiser for farmers inside Seattle’s “Capitol Hill Occupational Protest,” in which rioters overtook a police precinct and set up their own lawless compound for weeks. (Contrast that to what GoFundMe’s leftist allies are calling an “occupation” in Canada.)

Killing Babies and Funding Mutilation

GoFundMe also helps people to raise money to be able to kill their unwanted children.

In a listing titled “Help fund my abortion,” Sofia Abdul has raised $183 toward an $800 goal to put her child to death.

Another person named Sol who describes herself as nonbinary has raised $460 to get an abortion because she “got pregnant when I missed a couple pills.”

Similar listings seek money to “Help Create An Abortion Fund In South Carolina” and “Help Fund Texan Abortions.”

GoFundMe also platforms numerous fundraisers where people can pay for the mutilation of other people’s bodies. “I can’t stand my body anymore,” says a man who goes by Lena B. who is reportedly €35,000 in debt after “5 years of transition” and seeking more money to finish his surgical abuse.

A man who goes by Maeve has raised nearly £8,000 to affirm his fantasies of being a woman. “I first realised that I was transgender when I was 14 years old in 2009, but unfortunately due to my anxious and depressive disposition combined at that point undiagnosed Autism, I stayed in the closet until a botched suicide attempt when I was 24,” he wrote, seeking money for things like “Facial Feminization Surgery” and “psychotherapy” after a “bad experience” with “one evangelical Christian psychotherapist that sought to deny my transness.” Clearly this suffering man needs help, but not via the financing of mutilative surgery and further mental anguish.

A mom calling herself Helen is using GoFundMe to raise money to pay for similarly deforming “treatment” for her child. “Please help us to support my son’s transition,” she wrote of her son Max.

Another mom named Marie is seeking money to mutilate her daughter’s genitals and breasts. “I am trying to raise funds to support my son within his transition from female to male,” she wrote. “The money raised will be spent on appointment fees, Top Surgery & Bottom Surgery.”

Murder Capital: Charles Allen And Selling DC Out To Crime And Activists,"WASHINGTON, DC — Last Wednesday night, a woman was attacked while she drove with her 11-month-old child, just three blocks from Union Station and five from the Supreme Court.

The criminal held her at knifepoint as he forced his way into her car, brushing past the bright “Baby On Board” sticker. Video surveillance recorded her desperate screams and pleas for mercy echoing through the streets, while a passing pedestrian barely flinched. The perpetrator is still at large.

Two weeks earlier, just across the river, a gang of gunmen stole the car from a candidate for city council as he filled his tank. The highspeed operation, launched in broad daylight from an SUV, looks more like Baghdad than the United States. No arrests were made.

At 10 in the morning a month prior, at a small park across the street from the city police’s First District Substation, a father walking with his two young children was attacked by a vagrant throwing bricks. Bleeding from his head, he begged his attacker to let his infant baby and toddler be, but the man threw a second brick, fracturing the face of his eleven-month baby girl in her stroller, and leaving her with 12 stitches across her face.

A neighbor running out after he heard the screams found the father covered in blood, cradling his screaming baby.

One week before, just two blocks away in busy Eastern Market, a man smashed a brick over a young mother’s head while she walked with her child. Both of her front teeth were knocked out. The man escaped.

The nights between these awful attacks are filled with stolen cars, break-ins, car-jackings, assaults, robberies, and homicides.

You would never guess, however, that ours is a city in crisis — this past year literally suffering the largest percentage drop in population in the United States, while homicides increased by 15 percent — from how the D.C. City Council is spending its time and money.

Indeed, the 2022 budget cut the police department by 7.8 percent. Fighting back, the mayor requested a supplemental $11 million to hire 170 officers to work toward replacing the 400 — four hundred — who quit or retired since 2020’s Black Lives Matter riots, but even this was thwarted by the council; particularly arch-anti-police Member Charles Allen.

In a “compromise” led by Allen, the council approved only $5 million of the emergency request — enough to hire a mere 60 recruits — sending the remaining $6 million of the emergency request to “community violence interrupters,” an activist wet dream with little data to support its efficiency.

The council also made sure to award themselves, increasing the budget for “public election financing” — a program that makes it so every dollar a resident donates to them earns them another $5 from the taxpayer.

The system is allegedly designed to give everyone a chance (and curtail corporate-influenced corruption), but in practice it protects incumbents with higher name recognition — multiplying their larger hauls by five times, effectively burying lesser-known challengers.

Mayor Muriel Bowser had opposed the campaign finance overhaul in 2018, but after signing the bill she claimed she’d been convinced by the outpouring of voter support for her taking tax dollars to “strengthen our democracy.”

“I have heard them,” she wrote, “and I have been moved by their passion.” Her campaign’s received $2 million from the program so far this year.

“People are stoked,” one D.C. Democratic consultant on a city council campaign bragged to Axios. “People really feel empowered.”

Still, the council’s largesse doesn’t extend to public safety: In the same period of time they quadrupled their public campaign contributions, they’ve cut $100 million from the police — and overseen a simultaneous 36 percent increase in homicides.

“Residents want safety, not politics,” the council wrote in a press release explaining the decision to cut the police’s budget yet again.

Not all was lost, though: They managed to find $1,385,000 for the Office on Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs, an office that supports things like “multicultural development,” including a Dominican Republic culture party called “Fiesta DC.”

They also approved $6,386,000 for the Office of Latino Affairs, which operates along the same lines.

The top result of a Google News search for this office’s most recent community impact is an article titled, “‘They’re Targeting Latinos’: DC leaders asked to help after robberies of contractors.” The article tells the story of a rash of armed robberies targeting Hispanic immigrant construction workers. One criminal, arrested last month, was suspected of at least 19 other attacks.

“It happens,” one victim said, “on a weekly basis.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/10/murder-capital-charles-allen-embraces-the-politics-of-selling-dc-out-to-crime-and-activists/,2022-02-10
It's Time To Rescue Decaying U.S. Cities From Leftists' Chokehold,"If the last two years have taught us anything it’s that progressive policies are ruining U.S. megalopolises and it’s time for Americans to take back the nation’s cities.

Urban hubs once hailed as beacons for American innovation have morphed into drug-crazed, crime-filled, dirty, sad, and expensive cities run by woke politicians that are just getting worse. Thanks to progressive policies, criminals guilty of violent and dangerous crimes are back on the streets instead of behind bars, drug addicts are incentivized with smoking kits and designated shoot-up areas, children are regularly indoctrinated and still forcibly masked in schools, essential police are let go, and rent prices are rising.

As a result, people are ditching cities for better lives in well-managed towns. Polling shows Americans as a whole are more likely to prefer a life in the suburbs than urban areas. During government-mandated lockdowns and mask mandates, Americans left blue states filled with cities for red states and less-crowded towns.

Progressives policies are fueling this rapid urban decline but not all hope is lost.

Those who have yet to move from dystopian hellholes are fighting to take back their cities. San Francisco is one of the bluest cities in the nation yet its citizens are fed up with the progressive politicians who are wreaking havoc on their urban way of life.

Voters in the Bay Area city overwhelmingly decided this week to recall at least three of the city’s progressive Board of Education members. Board president Gabriela López, vice president Faauuga Moliga, and commissioner Alison Collins were all ousted yesterday after parents fed up with San Francisco Unified School District’s progressive streak took to the polls.

Several factors played into the landslide unseating — including forever pandemic learning restrictions, attempting to rename schools named after founding fathers and former presidents including Abraham Lincoln, and racist affirmative action policies — but ultimately, parents were simply frustrated that the board prioritized politics over their children’s education.

San Francisco just voted to recall three progressive members of the city's school board.



It was not even close. pic.twitter.com/CR8xwxeBW9 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) February 16, 2022

San Francisco citizens will also soon vote in a June recall election for District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who has been criticized for being soft on crime and standing by while the city is plagued with rampant lawlessness.

San Francisco might be a Democrat-controlled and Democrat-majority city, but it’s slowly coming to its senses. Even San Francisco Democrat Mayor London Breed recently admitted that defunding the police and releasing criminals back onto the streets made the city a worse place to live.

“It’s time that the reign of criminals who are destroying our city, it is time for it to come to an end,” Breed said. “And it comes to an end when we take the steps to be more aggressive with law enforcement … and less tolerant of all the bullsh-t that has destroyed our city.”

Plenty of U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York City, Chicago, Detroit, and others need to shift away from progressive wokeness back toward what makes living in a resourceful area so great.

The parents of San Francisco stepped up and fought for what’s right, safe, and good for their families. So did historically progressive voters in Minneapolis, another Democrat-majority city, in November when they rejected a leftist campaign to defund the police.

It’s time for Americans to take back our cities. Crime, vaccine mandates, drugs, and wokeness are ruining the reputations of once-beautiful and flourishing urban hubs. People are leaving and those who don’t are increasingly scared for their lives and just plain miserable.

Just as the parents in Democrat-dominated San Francisco successfully, and against all odds, ousted progressives from the school board, other urban areas need to use upcoming elections including 2022 midterms to force out the hypocritical politicians whose policies are ruining the nation.

Mexico Sues U.S. Gun Makers For Crime While Fueling Violent Cartels,"Mexico is using U.S. courts to shift blame to gun manufacturers for Mexico’s failure to drag drug cartel leaders and narco-terrorists into its courtrooms. The audacity of the maneuver would be comical if it didn’t have such deadly consequences on both sides of the border.

Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s secretary of foreign affairs, took a victory lap for both himself and the government of Mexico being named The Arms Control Association’s 2021 “Person of the Year.” Ebrarb didn’t earn the distinction because he curbed the illegal gun trafficking, narco-terrorism, and murder that’s plaguing his country. His distinction is mocking America’s judicial system by dragging U.S. firearm manufacturers into court for a $10 billion shakedown that would put America’s gun industry out of business and America’s Second Amendment at the mercy of foreign powers.

Mexico’s government, with the help of the gun control group Brady United, alleges U.S.-based gun manufacturers are negligent in their business practices because Mexican-based drug cartels and narco-terrorists are murdering Mexican citizens. Their lawsuit outrageously claims these companies are knowingly flooding Mexico with illegal guns.

That’s just a plain perversion of basic facts. Moreover, it’s an assault on America’s God-given rights, which, of course, Mexican citizens can’t exercise in their country.

Instead of tackling the rampant crime that has been plaguing Mexico for decades, Ebrard—with the blessing of Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his “Hugs, not bullets” approach to violent drug cartels—is shifting the blame for Mexico’s failures. He’s using U.S. courts to do it, scapegoating a lawful industry that’s the convenient target of the ire of the Biden administration and gun control groups, and subjugating constitutionally protected God-given rights to cover up Mexico’s unwillingness to enforce its own laws.

Mexico’s unchecked violence is directly linked to the illicit drug trade, human trafficking, and organized crime cartels that victimize Mexico’s citizens. Ebrarb and Mexico’s government have shown no willingness to meaningfully face this scourge. Their approach instead is a $10 billion squeeze that is doomed to fail.

The negligent practices Ebrarb says are targeting Mexico start right in Mexico City. Mexico has strict gun control laws, but everyone knows that doesn’t stop the cartels. That’s because corruption fueled by the drug trade has rotted away the rule of law.

Instead, Mexican authorities are working with the cartels. Bribery is a way of life. Mexico is ranked as 124 out of 180 countries on a corruption index by the watchdog Transparency International, putting Mexico on the same level with Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan.

Ebrarb claims to want to change the way U.S. firearms manufacturers do business. These are the manufacturers that provide firearms to law-abiding Americans, who must pass an FBI background check to purchase these firearms. This was the case more than 39.5 million times in just the past two years in the United States, with nearly 14 million Americans choosing to become lawful gun owners for the first time.

That’s not how the firearm business is done in Mexico. There’s just one gun retailer and that’s in the heart of a Mexican Army base, in the heart of Mexico City. Even then, only small-caliber handguns and shotguns are allowed for purchase.

Narco-terrorist cartels’ preference for military-grade firearms clearly doesn’t come from the inventory available to the American public. Sales of new automatic firearms to the American public were banned in 1986.

The source, it appears, is south of Mexico and overseas. Automatic guns and rocket-propelled grenades follow drug trade routes back to China, Guatemala, and the black markets in Central and South America. South Korean-made grenades have been recovered at drug cartel crime scenes.

All will agree that Mexico is awash in illegally obtained firearms. Law enforcement on the U.S. side continues to target, arrest, and prosecute those illegally trafficking guns across the border, but this isn’t a practice of firearm manufacturers. Rather, the firearms turning up at cartel crime scenes raise serious questions about Mexico’s commitment to stemming corruption and theft within their own military’s ranks.

Mexico’s military is allegedly losing up to 30 percent of its small arms that are purchased from U.S. manufacturers through military contracts. These aren’t firearms available to the general public. They’re only purchased by Mexico’s military. The corruption isn’t limited to the rank-and-file Mexican soldiers. It’s been witnessed at the highest echelons.

Mexican Gen. Juan Ernesto Antonio Bernal Reyes, a former candidate for Mexican defense secretary, was arrested in Oaxaca on extortion charges in December 2021. Mexico’s Secretary of Defense Salvador Cienfuegos was arrested for drug trafficking and money laundering charges and turned over to Mexican authorities, which declined to pursue charges. Mexico only recently levied charges for seven linked to the Obama administration’s ill-fated Operation Fast and Furious that cost the lives of U.S. Border Patrol agents.

Ten years after the illegal gun-running scheme, we are now seeing charges brought against Genaro García Luna, security chief for Mexico’s President Felipe Calderón from 2006-2012, and former Federal Police commander Luis Cardenas Palomino, a close assistant to García Luna and former drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.

García Luna sits in a Texas jail on allegations of protecting Mexican drug gangs. Palomino is sitting in a Mexican jail for torture charges. U.S. authorities also accuse him of taking bribes from the Sinaloa cartel. Guzman escaped twice from Mexican prisons before being captured and extradited to the United States, where he now sits in a federal maximum-security prison.

Ebrarb congratulates himself for pursuing the destruction of God-given rights of Americans and using the U.S. legal system to attempt it. He pats himself on the back for backing United Nations policies that label private ownership of firearms a threat to peace and security.

Ebrarb and the Mexican government would be better served by cleaning up the corruption on their side of the border and enforcing their own laws before subverting Americans’ Second Amendment rights and suing law-abiding gun manufacturers to dictate how they do business. We will keep our rights and protect the industry that provides the means to exercise those rights against foreign governments that can’t—or won’t—protect their own citizens.

Biden’s State Of The Union Promise To ‘Fund Police’ Was Pure Lip Service,"In Tuesday’s State of the Union address, President Joe Biden claimed he wants to restore safety and control crime. He denounced efforts to “defund” the police. But with congressional elections coming up, he lacked any useful proposals.

During the State of the Union, Biden claimed that “the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.” However, last year, even liberal fact-checkers acknowledged: the bill “did not stipulate that the relief funding had to be used on police officers or for other law enforcement initiatives.”

Biden’s own Treasury Department summarized the spending this way:

The Rescue Plan will provide needed relief to state, local, and Tribal governments to enable them to continue to support the public health response and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable economic recovery. In addition to helping these governments address the revenue losses they have experienced as a result of the crisis, it will help them cover the costs incurred due responding to the public health emergency and provide support for a recovery – including through assistance to households, small businesses and nonprofits, aid to impacted industries, and support for essential workers.

Where does this mention police or prosecutions as priorities?

Biden’s claims look a real change from what he said during the presidential campaign. Back in July 2020, when asked if Biden supported “redirect[ing] some of the funding for police into social services,” he responded: “Yes, I proposed that kind of reform.”

But you don’t need to go back to the campaign to see how superficial Biden’s words were on Tuesday. See what he said when he went to New York City last month and gave a major address on crime. What did he propose?

Did Biden point out that the Democrats in New York City cut the police budget by $1 billion per year? No.

Did he note how New York’s bail reform has let violent criminals out on the street only to commit more crime? No.

Did he criticize district attorneys in New York City or elsewhere who are not prosecuting violent criminals? No.

Did he express concern over the large numbers of inmates released from jails and prisons? No.

Of course, those calls would have upset many Democrats. But, unfortunately, besides lip service that he wants to reduce crime, he didn’t offer any of these obvious concrete proposals during his State of the Union address. On Tuesday, Biden offered no specific proposals to ensure funds go to the police.

Targeting Guns Instead of Criminals

Instead, the only specific proposals focused only on gun control. Biden ignores that over 92 percent of violent crime has nothing to do with guns.

He talked about the need to “repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued,” which is a lie. People can sue gunmakers if they sell a gun illegally or make a defective gun. Biden wants to make gun manufacturers civilly liable for misuse of firearms they sell. That means people could sue manufacturers and sellers whenever a crime, accident, or suicide occurs with a gun. The end goal is to put gun makers out of business. Imagine if you could sue Ford the next time someone gets intentionally run over with an F150.

He talked about an assault weapon ban, but in his New York City address, Biden talked about banning any semi-automatic gun that “can hold” a large capacity magazine. He has repeated that theme many times over the last few years. The problem is that any semi-automatic gun manufactured today “can hold” or has the “ability” to hold a magazine of virtually any capacity. About 85 percent of all handguns made were semi-automatics that “can hold” magazines. Almost as many rifles also fit that definition.

At the same time that Democrats are eviscerating law enforcement and prosecutions, Biden wants to make it difficult for people to defend themselves. Semi-automatic guns provide critical self-defense benefits. If we force law-abiding victims to rely on single-shot guns, they could find themselves in trouble. If they face multiple criminals or fire and miss their target, individuals may not have the time to manually reload their gun.

Biden talked about passing background checks on the private transfer of guns, but not using these background checks to create a national gun registry. He put together nearly one billion firearm purchase records. The government now has a searchable digital database containing 866 million transactions, including some 54 million made in 2021 alone. Federal law explicitly prohibits the creation of a federal firearm registry, but Biden is making one anyway.

This national gun registry isn’t complete because not all states have background checks on the private transfer of guns, and Biden hasn’t yet gotten all the transaction records that licensed gun dealers have. Federal agents can now type in a person’s name into a computer and possibly come up with all the guns they purchased.

It isn’t rocket science to understand why crime is increasing, and it isn’t the fault of gun owners. Many parts of the country are in dire need of basic law enforcement. But despite nice rhetoric, Biden is refusing to face the crime problem seriously.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/bidens-state-of-the-union-promise-to-fund-police-was-pure-lip-service/,2022-03-02
"Facing The Results Of Their Ideas, Leftists Are Backpedaling Like Mad","Image Credit Daniel Lobo/Flickr

It would appear that leftists don’t actually like a lot of the radical policies they have been advocating for since the beginning of the lockdowns and the death of George Floyd in spring 2020. From homelessness to crime to Covid policies, the left is backtracking on much of its platform in the face of disastrous results and frustration from rank-and-file liberals. Recent developments in our nation’s capital provide some of the most dramatic examples.

Cities across the country are taking a more aggressive stance on homeless encampments in response to residents’ complaints, including Washington, D.C. An early February poll conducted by The Washington Post found that three-fourths of Washingtonians support the district’s plan to clear the camps of homeless persons that now proliferate across the city.

That the American Civil Liberties Union and even some D.C. council members oppose Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s cleanups have not stopped their enforcement. Bowser has quite a mandate for this: the number of city residents who want these camps cleared does not substantially change based on respondents’ race, and is above 70 percent for white, black, Hispanic, and Asian residents.

That the district is pursuing this policy with substantial local support is a bit ironic, given that so many prominent leftist organizations, local leftist leaders, and Democratic politicians have been trying for more than a year to protect these encampments. This included Ann Marie Staudenmaier, wife of Maryland gubernatorial candidate Tom Perez, who last year advocated for homeless camps in the district to be permitted and protected. “Don’t evict them from the only place that they have to call home,” she urged.

Perhaps it has something to do with how large numbers of homeless persons affect the cleanliness, security, and attraction of neighborhoods. A separate recent WaPo article cited residents who noted homeless persons in the camp have harassed them. One D.C. resident said downtown is “not pleasant” and that the ubiquity of the encampments threatens the security of local residents.

Although many on the left would likely grimace to say it, national trends on curbing these camps indicate a significant percentage of the rest of America feels the same way.

Refunding the Police

Mayors of America’s largest cities, once responsive to calls to defund the police, have done a dramatic reversal in response to local frustration with higher crime rates. Now “refund the police” has become the cry of many liberal residents.

In D.C., residents’ opinions on crime and police have experienced this shift, given increased crime and murder rates in the city since 2020. According to a recent WaPo poll, a sizable majority (59 percent) now agree that increasing the number of police officers patrolling communities would reduce the amount of violent crime in D.C.

“The share of Washingtonians who say they are not safe from crime has risen to 30 percent this year from 22 percent in November 2019 and is the highest in more than two decades of Post polls,” reports the WaPo.

This is quite a change from the “defund the police” initiatives city residents — and various activist groups — so loudly endorsed after the death of George Floyd. The D.C. government in 2020 supported measures in June 2022 to cut $15 million from the police department budget. At the time, the police chief warned this could lead to the loss of hundreds of officers and that underfunding training and equipment might result in officers using more excessive force.

Thankfully, D.C. is not alone in wanting to refund the police. As NBC reported in February, Democratic politicians are calling the “defund the police” movement “dead” and mayors in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago are “moving to increase police budgets and end ‘the reign of criminals.’”

Surrendering to Pandemic Fatigue

Democratic states are also ending many Covid restrictions in the face of rising complaints from their constituents. Consider D.C. Mayor Bowser’s mid-February announcement that she would lift the city’s vaccine requirement for businesses and “dial back” the city’s indoor mask rules. This announcement followed a number of states — including many governed by Democrats — that have also eased their restrictions as polls come back showing their rising unpopularity. Now D.C.’s party scene is “returning to normal,” reports the WaPo, even though coronavirus case counts in and around Washington remain “high.”

This is a remarkable and speedy shift, especially considering D.C. had some of the most strict Covid restrictions in the country. Perhaps the District’s dramatic about-face has something to do with widespread annoyance with pandemic restrictions, even among liberal voters. Perhaps it results from the rising tide of Democratic politicians listening to their constituencies despite “public health guidance” claiming the country is moving too fast in loosening the rules.

Perhaps all of these changes also relate to the fact that the District of Columbia is no longer experiencing the population boom and gentrification that have defined the last couple of decades. The capital’s population declined by 2.9 percent from 2020 to 2021, according to the Census Bureau. Living in an increasingly dangerous, filthy nanny-city is apparently not that appealing, even to the District’s majority leftist population. This has been part of a broader national trend as people across the nation in 2021 left Democratic-run states.

Mugged by Reality

To borrow a phrase from the late Irving Kristol, D.C. residents (and liberals across the country) have been mugged by reality — and in some cases actually mugged. Perhaps living in a lefty utopia where the homeless camp wherever they like, undisturbed by a defunded police force, with fickle and irrational health-related restrictions isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.

Democrat D.C. residents, like the rest of Americans, don’t actually like their public spaces overrun by homeless persons, their neighborhoods suffering increased violent crime rates, or their cities stuck in a cycle of never-ending draconian public safety regulations.

What this all means is that, thankfully, certain activist narratives that threatened all Americans have lost considerable steam. It also means these policies are likely political liabilities in upcoming elections. Perhaps it also shows there are certain things that all Americans can still agree on.

Full List Of Every Lie Biden Has Told As POTUS: 223 And Counting,"Updated Feb. 7, 2023. Two hundred twenty-three lies and counting.

More than two years into President Joe Biden’s time in the White House and the end to his lies is nowhere in sight. Here is part three of The Federalist’s rigorous coverage keeping the Biden administration accountable with substantive fact-checking throughout the president’s tenure.

You can find part two of “The Full List Of Every Lie Joe Biden Has Told As President” here.

223. Chuck Schumer Is Minority Leader

Before his State of the Union speech even began, Biden greeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as “Senate minority leader.” Schumer has been the majority leader since Biden took office in 2021.

222. More Jobs Created in Two Years Than Any Other President

“I actually created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs,” Biden said during his State of the Union address. “More jobs created in two years than any president has created in four years. Because of you.”

Biden didn’t create new jobs, as he often likes to claim. The only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of Covid-19.

221. Fastest Growth in 40 Years

On Feb. 7, 2023, during his annual speech to Congress, Biden repeated his infamous lie that he initiated the “fastest job growth in 40 years.”

Records show, however, that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During approximately that same time period, the unemployment rate also declined by 8.3 percent.

In January alone, American payroll jobs under Biden fell by more than 2.5 million.

220. Inflation Is ‘Coming Down’

Another lie Biden repeated during his State of the Union address is that inflation in the U.S. “is coming down.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are suffering from gas prices still well above $3 per gallon, weathering a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021. Biden may not be responsible for the fastest job growth in the last four decades, but inflation under his watch rose at its fastest rate in 40 years.

[READ: Biden, Media Taunt Struggling Americans By Insisting 6.5% Inflation Is A Good Thing]

Biden tried to blame the nation’s economic misfortune on the pandemic and the “unfair and brutal war in Ukraine,” but the truth is, inflation in the U.S. directly coincides with the time he took office.

219. Democracy Faced ‘Greatest Threat Since Civil War’ on Jan. 6

President Biden forgot about the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and the repeat episodes of violence at the Capitol when he claimed at the 2023 State of the Union that the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, was the “greatest threat since the Civil War.”

Look at McCarthy’s reaction as Biden repeats the lie that the Jan 6 riot was the greatest threat since the Civil War.

218. I’m Responsible for the Largest Deficit in U.S. History

Biden wants to take credit for cutting the national deficit “by more than $1.7 trillion — the largest deficit reduction in American history” in his first two years in office.

“Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor,” Biden said at the 2023 State of the Union.

The truth is, federal spending under Biden increased more than $10 trillion since his first month in office. That’s more than any other president spent in his first two years in U.S. history.

217. Republicans Are Trying to Cut Social Security

Biden pledged to halt desperately needed cuts to bloated entitlement programs as Congress debates raising the debt ceiling.

“If anyone tries to cut Social Security,” the president said during his annual address to Congress, “I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.”

The Democrats’ reconciliation bill passed last summer, however, raided nearly $300 billion from Medicare to boost insurance companies by removing leverage from negotiations on drug prices.

""If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.""

216. Fires Have Burned an Area the Size of Missouri

President Biden tried to claim during his State of the Union speech that more wood had been burned by forest fires than the area of the entire state of Missouri.

“More timber has been burned than I’ve observed from helicopters than the entire state of Missouri,” Biden said.

In 2022, however, 7.5 million acres burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Missouri’s forests span 14 million acres, and the state itself is 44.6 million acres large.

The remark appears to have been made off-script according to what the White House released as the president’s prepared speech.

215. Biden Repeats Claim that Fast-Food Workers Sign Noncompete Agreements

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could be seen chuckling in the background at the State of the Union when Biden complained that fast-food workers were signing noncompete agreements with employers.

“A cashier at a burger place can’t walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more,” Biden said.

Biden made the same claim at a business roundtable in July 2020, earning the then-candidate a “false” rating from PolitiFact.

214. Biden Blames Crime Wave on Covid After Democrats Defunded Police

During the 2023 State of the Union, Biden blamed the coronavirus lockdowns for the nation’s recent crime wave.

Covid left scars, the president said, “like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.”

It was the Democrats’ rush to “defund police,” however, that left cities and neighborhoods vulnerable to criminals who remained free to roam the streets. Democrats in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and New York cut police funding by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the social justice fever that took over the country. More than a dozen cities saw the highest homicide rates ever reported as a result.

According to a poll from Politico last year, 3 in 4 Americans blamed the crime spree on the efforts to defund police.

213. I Re-Upped Funding for Cancer Research

One of Biden’s top priorities going into his 2023 State of the Union speech was his “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, which allocates funding to cancer research and care.

“Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead,” Biden said.

Biden may have restarted the program to “provide more support for patients and families,” but it was his pet legislation, the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act, that cut cancer research spending by nine times as much as his program is supposed to put toward it.

212. Immigration ‘Reform’ Will Secure the Border

During his annual address to Congress, Biden pointed to his “new border plan” as evidence that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding the U.S.

But his plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives, something several hecklers pointed out during his speech.

Biden said his “comprehensive immigration reform” would “fix” the national security threat that American border woes have become. In reality, that legislation would only encourage the millions of migrants overwhelming Border Patrol agents to keep paying the criminal organizations that control northern Mexico to escort them to the U.S.

211. Mass Shootings Went Down After Assault Weapons Ban

Biden claimed during the State of the Union that the federal assault weapons ban, which barred the manufacturing of semi-automatic rifles for civilian use from 1994 to 2004, caused mass shootings to drop.

“In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled,” Biden said.

That’s a lie based on a flawed study that claimed the ban reduced mass shooting deaths. Accurate data recorded during the ban shows that more so-called mass shootings occurred during the firearm prohibition. Even after the ban expired, mass shootings did not increase, as Democrats suggested they would.

210. Life-Saving Pro-Life Laws Are Extreme

During his State of the Union address, Biden wrongfully characterized pro-life legislation in several red states as “extreme” for limiting women’s ability to kill their unborn babies.

“Already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans,” he said.

In reality, it’s Biden’s abortion-on-demand throughout all nine of months of pregnancy agenda that is extreme. New polling suggests 7 in 10 Americans support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy.

Biden also criticized Republicans for trying to pass what he said is a “national abortion ban.”

As pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America noted, the GOP has not proposed a total ban on abortions. It has just worked to bring U.S. abortion law up to speed with other civilized countries, which recognize abortion beyond 15 weeks gestation as a barbaric practice.

209. ‘I’m Here to Be President for All Americans’

In addition to promising unity via bipartisan cooperation, Biden falsely claimed during his address to Congress on Feb. 7, 2023, that he is “here to be president for all Americans.”

Yet the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him. His smears against “MAGA Republicans” shows he has no tolerance for conservative voters or their values.

A president for all wouldn’t sic his Department of Justice on parents concerned that their children’s education stays indoctrination free or a pro-life father who rightfully defended his son from a deranged abortion activist.

208. Biden Claims ‘No’ Blame For Inflation

Biden refuses to take responsibility for the inflation crippling the nation despite its clear connection to his administration and policies.

“Do you take any blame for inflation?” a reporter asked the president on Feb. 3, 2023.

“Do I take any blame for inflation? No,” Biden replied.

“Why not?” the reporter countered.

“It was already here when I got here, man! Remember what the economy was like when I got here?” Biden asked.

REPORTER: ""Do you take any blame for inflation?""



BIDEN: ""No.""



REPORTER: ""Why not?""



BIDEN: ""It was already there when I got here, man!"" pic.twitter.com/ErvzSQVC4n — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) February 3, 2023

The economy before Biden’s inauguration may have suffered from government-mandated lockdowns, but that suffering drastically increased in March of 2021 shortly after Biden took office, when the new administration greenlit Congress’s $1.9 trillion spending bill.

Since then, inflation rose at its fastest rate in 40 years and still hovers far above pre-pandemic price hikes.

207. Biden Says He Began Career as Civil Rights Activist

President Biden told congregants at Georgia’s Ebenezer Baptist Church on the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day that he began his career as a mid-20th-century civil rights activist. Biden said he “started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”

While at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Joe Biden once again claims he was a civil rights activist: “When I started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”



This is a debunked lie. pic.twitter.com/CY6x07IN2N — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 15, 2023

On his first campaign for president, however, Biden disputed his participation in the movement.

“I was not an activist,” Biden said at a Washington press conference in September 1978. “I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Delaware. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. I was involved, but I was not out marching. I was not down in Selma, I was not anywhere else.”

206. Biden Says He Went to a Black Church as a Teen

President Biden also told congregants at the Ebernezer Baptist Church that he went to a predominantly black church as a teenager.

BIDEN: ""I used to go to 7:30 mass every morning in high school and then in college, before I went to the Black church. Not a joke.""



Congregants say they can't recall Biden ever attending. pic.twitter.com/4xcF6i0nFE — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 15, 2023

Members of the president’s supposed former church, however, don’t remember him.

205. Biden Claims He Taught Classes at UPenn

While speaking at the North America Leaders’ Summit in Mexico City on Jan. 10, Biden claimed he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania “four years after being vice president.” While Biden was paid nearly $1 million by the university, he reportedly never taught a class there.

Biden: ""The four years after being vice president, I was a professor at Penn.""

204. Biden Blames J6 Rioters for Capitol Police Officer’s Death

During an overtly political speech marking the two-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Biden falsely claimed that Officer William “Billy” Evans died as a result of “threats by these sick [Jan. 6] insurrectionists.”

Joe Biden just said that Capitol Police Officer William Evans died as a result of ""threats by these sick insurrectionists.""



Officers Evans was killed by a black Nation of Islam supporter who rammed him with a car. pic.twitter.com/5FIb6tIOtz — Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 6, 2023

Contrary to the president’s assertion, Evans was killed three months after the Jan. 6 riot in April 2021 by a Nation of Islam supporter who killed the officer by running him down with a car. The instance marks the second occasion in which Biden has conflated Evans’s death with the events of Jan. 6.

203. Biden Says Guns’ Only Use Is to ‘Kill People’

In a commemorative statement honoring the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, Biden falsely claimed that the only use for weapons like those used in the shooting is to “kill people.”

“I am determined to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like those used at Sandy Hook and countless other mass shootings in America,” Biden said in an official statement. “Enough is enough. Our obligation is clear. We must eliminate these weapons that have no purpose other than to kill people in large numbers.”

Americans have and use guns for a variety of reasons including hunting, range shooting, collecting, deterrence, and protection. In some cases, the guns that Biden refers to as “assault weapons” are more effective at activities like hog hunting than other types of firearms.

Additionally, those who use guns as self-defense tools are taught not “shoot to kill,” but only to shoot if necessary to stop, slow, or disarm someone who is threatening their life.

202. Biden Accuses Republicans of Suppressing Voters

“They are trying to succeed where they failed in 2020,” Biden said during a speech at Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 2, 2022. “To suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts. Instead of waiting until the election is over, or starting well before restarting now. They’ve emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. It is estimated that the more than 300 election denier on the ballot all across America this year.”

Instead of waiting until an election is over…they're starting now."" pic.twitter.com/HGT1TLFwa2 — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) November 2, 2022

In reality, it’s Democrats and Democrat operatives such as Marc Elias who oppose Republican-led election integrity laws around the nation and conservative attempts to make voting safer and more secure.

In Georgia, where Biden encouraged businesses to boycott the state over its “Jim Crow 2.0” election integrity law in 2021, early voters are turning out in record numbers. Even during early voting in the primaries, Georgia’s non-white voter turnout boomed.

201. White House Says Biden ‘Always Condemned Political Violence’

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told a room full of corporate media reporters on Nov. 2, 2022, that Biden “has always, always condemned political violence.”

“It doesn’t matter, again, if you’re a Republican, an independent, or a Democrat,” Jean-Pierre said.

Biden has, however, failed to equally apply his condemnation of political violence.

When radical abortion activists violently attacked at least 75 life-saving pregnancy centers and pro-life groups, assaulted at least 89 Catholic churches, and threatened to harm Republican-nominated justices following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson opinion leak, Biden failed to personally address it.

Biden was also silent when climate rioters led an insurrection at the Department of the Interior in October 2021.

Even before his presidency, Biden neglected to quickly condemn the rioters, looters, and vandals who inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on the nation’s cities in 2020. It took Biden months to condemn those attacks. He was also silent when Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker, and Maxine Waters urged violence against Trump and his supporters.

200. Biden Says Incomes Outpaced Inflation Last Quarter

“Although it may not feel that way, people’s incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation. Economic growth is up, price inflation is down, real incomes are up, and gas prices are down,” Biden said during a gubernatorial campaign event for Charlie Crist in Florida.

While inflation was up a reported 8.2 percent in September, wages and salaries only increased by 5.1 and 4.2 percent since September of last year.

199. Biden Says He Attended HBCU

During a Democrat campaign event in Florida, Biden said he received his education at a historically black college or university, or HBCU.

“I’m a big fan of HBCUs. I got my start at one of those other HBCUs, Delaware State University,” Biden told a cheering crowd.

While campaigning for @CharlieCrist in Miami-Dade County, @JoeBiden claims that he went to college at a HBCU (Historically Black institution) Delaware State University.

198. Biden Falsely Claims His Son Died in the Iraq War

Biden incorrectly claimed his son died in Iraq, presumably during the Iraq War.

“Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq. … Excuse me the war in Ukraine. I’m thinking of Iraq because that’s where my son died.”

Biden’s son Beau did die — but of brain cancer. Beau passed away in the United States in 2015, nearly four years after the end of the Iraq War in 2011.

197. Biden Says U.S. Has ‘Lowest Inflation Rate’ Globally

During a speech on Nov. 1, Biden incorrectly claimed the United States has “the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world.”

Biden: ""We have the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world."" pic.twitter.com/t1436gw0Qc — Greg Price (@greg_price11) November 1, 2022

As of September, the rate of inflation in the U.S. is 8.2 percent. Even though countries use different measures to calculate their inflation rates, the U.S. still had a larger increase in the cost of goods and services than many developed countries including Canada (6.9 percent), Japan (3 percent), Australia (7.3 percent), and Italy (5.79).

While many countries around the globe are suffering from price hikes, the U.S. inflation rate quadrupled, rising faster than Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Brazil, New Zealand, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Japan, India, China, and others

196. Biden Blames ‘Soaring’ Gas Prices on Putin (Again)

“Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in March sent gas prices soaring, literally, around the world. Not just here, but around the world,” Biden said in a speech on Nov. 1.

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1587489793239310343?s=20&t=zoxuWsJKnzqcEUQyjGOuXg

The president claimed that it’s “because of the action we’ve taken since then, [that] gas prices have actually come down.”

Not only were gas prices “soaring” long before Russia’s leader chose to invade Ukraine, but Biden’s decision to deplete the Strategic Petroleum Reserve shortly before the midterms is a political one, not a sustainable one.

As Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote for The Federalist, Biden’s reliance on reserves is just an artificial and temporary solution for an ongoing problem.

“Should the SPR draws stop, or … shift back to refilling the reserves, what would happen? Oil prices would immediately spike, with gasoline prices following quickly,” DeVore wrote.

195. Biden Lies About Price of Gas

During an address on Oct. 27, Biden falsely claimed that gas prices were far higher when he took office than they are now.

“The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office,” Biden said.

Biden: ""The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office.""

Not only is the national average for gas currently hovering around $3.76 per gallon, not $3.39, but gas was only around $2.39 per gallon when Biden assumed office.

194. Biden Claims He ‘Signed a Law’ Wiping Student Loan Debt

Biden falsely claimed that his executive order shifting student loan debt onto taxpayers was actually a bill Congress passed and that he “signed” into law.

“It’s passed. I got it passed by a vote or two,” Biden said during a Now This presidential forum on Oct. 23.

Here is the full clip for all you clowns who say it’s out of context. Biden first falsely claims he “signed a law” to cancel student loan debt, then says he “got it passed by a vote or two.”



??????? pic.twitter.com/JKdKde24db — Jake Schneider (@jacobkschneider) October 24, 2022

Biden’s attempt to bail out Americans with college loans by making other debt-free Americans foot the bill is controversial and could, as the president himself once admitted, be illegal. That’s why a federal appeals court temporarily blocked Biden’s plans to shift student loan debt onto taxpayers on Oct. 21.

193. Biden Claims He Hasn’t ‘Stopped or Slowed U.S. Oil Production’

To defend releasing even more oil reserves, Biden lied that he has not “stopped or slowed U.S. oil production.”

“Let’s debunk some myths here. My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production,” Biden claimed. “Quite the opposite.”

Joe Biden:



""My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production."" pic.twitter.com/J85rmKhEl1 — TheBlaze (@theblaze) October 19, 2022

Oil production may technically be up from its pandemic plunge, but it’s still nowhere near the pre-Covid levels achieved under Biden’s predecessor — and any growth since then is not thanks to Biden. Even before he set foot in the White House, Biden declared a war on oil and fossil fuels. Once elected, the president used some of his first days in office to halt the Keystone Pipeline and effectively shut down public oil land leasing. He’s also tried to stop new oil projects and has threatened to eliminate the fossil fuel industry by 2050.

All of these actions have hiked gas and energy prices for Americans.

192. White House Says Fetterman Not Disabled

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at an Oct. 17 press conference Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. and Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was “just as capable as always” five months after a major stroke.

“The president has found him to be an impressive individual,” Jean-Pierre said, claiming Fetterman is “just as capable as always and who’s carrying out his office.”

Fetterman, however, still struggles to communicate and experiences issues processing what people say. The Democrat Senate nominee remains unable to speak clearly.

John Fetterman gave a speech in Montgomery County yesterday.



Here are the highlights. pic.twitter.com/8udMddHAcQ — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 12, 2022

In mid-October, a reporter for NBC News defended her coverage of a one-on-one interview with Fetterman wherein she claimed, “In small talk before the interview without captioning, it wasn’t clear he was understanding our conversation.”

Fetterman will require closed captioning for his debate with Republican celebrity television doctor Mehmet Oz. The debate will be held on Oct. 25 which is weeks after early voting in Pennsylvania has already begun.

191. Biden Lies About Effects Of Dobbs

During an address at a Democratic National Committee event on Oct. 18, 2022, Biden claimed that when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, “Women all across the country, starting in my house, lost a fundamental right.”

Biden on Roe being overturned:

Not only is Jill Biden far beyond child-bearing age but many states have used the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, which gave states the power to decide abortion law, to expand their baby-killing radicalism.

Delaware, where the First Lady technically resides, allows abortion through “fetal viability,” which is considered between 24-26 weeks gestation.

190. Amid Recession, Biden Says Recession ‘Hasn’t Happened Yet’

In an attempt to cover up his role in exacerbating the nation’s economic crises, Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 11 that the U.S. is not in a recession.

“Should the American people prepare for a recession?” Tapper asked, shortly after Biden accidentally yet accurately called Democrats’ latest expensive spending package the “Inflation Act.”

“No,” Biden said. “Look they’ve been saying this now, every six months they say this. … It hadn’t happened yet. There’s no guarantee that they’re going to be a recess- I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, there will be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly.”

Back-to-back negative quarters, which signal the U.S. is in a recession, were first reported in July. Not only did the nation’s gross domestic product drop by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022, but inflation reached yet another record high, which severely damaged Americans’ purchasing power.

189. Biden Lies that He Lost an ‘Awful Lot’ of His Home to a Fire Years Ago

During a speech to Hurricane Ian victims on Oct. 5, 2022, Biden falsely claimed that he lost an “awful lot” in a 2004 kitchen fire at his Delaware home.

“I know from experience how much anxiety and fear concern is to other people. … We didn’t lose our whole home, but lightning struck and we lost an awful lot of it about 15 years ago,” Biden said.

Joe Biden claimed today that he lost ""an awful lot"" of his home in a fire from a lightning strike 15 years ago.



According to a report from the time, the lighting strike caused ""a small fire contained to the kitchen"" that ""was under control in 20 minutes."" https://t.co/l5l9eJ7MK3 pic.twitter.com/8yxvkUABPa — Greg Price (@greg_price11) October 5, 2022

According to the fire chief at the time, the fire, caused by a lightning strike, was contained in under 20 minutes.

Biden similarly told voters in New Hampshire in November of 2021 that his house burned down with First Lady Jill Biden inside of it.

“I know, having had a house burn down with my wife in it — she got out safely, God willing — that having a significant portion of it burn, I can tell: 10 minutes makes a hell of a difference,” Biden said.

188. Biden Claims Humans Make Hurricanes Worse

President Biden claimed Hurricane Ian was the firm proof of manmade climate change while touring the devastation in Florida on Oct. 5, 2022.

“I think the one thing this has finally ended is whether or not there is climate change and we should do something about it,” Biden said.

Data on hurricanes, however, only dates back about 100 years. Even President Barack Obama’s science adviser Steve Koonin said, “Humans have no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century.”

187. Biden Claims Roman Catholic Church Changed Position on Ending Unborn Lives

During remarks at the Democratic National Committee Reception on Sept. 22, Biden falsely claimed the Roman Catholic Church caved on allowing exceptions for abortions in the case of rape and incest.

“My generic point — and I happen to be a practicing Roman Catholic — my church doesn’t even make that argument now. And so we’re in a situation where things have changed a lot. But they’ve gotten more extreme in their positions,” Biden said.

While certain Catholic-identifying politicians such as Biden and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi regularly tout abortion, the Catholic Chuch still maintains that killing a baby, whose life began at conception, is a sin.

“Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,” paragraph 2271 of the Church’s Catechism states.

Even Pope Francis has publicly condemned Biden’s support for abortion as an “incoherence.”

186. Biden Pretends Inflation Isn’t Hurting Americans

During his “60 Minutes” interview with Scott Pelley on Sept. 18, Biden argued inflation is not as bad as it seems.

“Let’s put this in perspective,” Biden said. “Inflation rate month to month was up just an inch. Hardly at all.”

“You’re not arguing that 8.3 is good news?” Pelley asked, noting that the annual inflation rate for August was up 0.1 percent from July and more than 8 percent since the same time last year.

“No, I’m not saying it’s good news, but it was 8.2 or 8.2 before. You’re making it sound like all of a sudden, my God, it went to 8.2 percent,” Biden said.

As Pelley noted, “It’s been the highest inflation rate, Mr. President, in 40 years.” Americans are struggling to pay their grocery and energy bills, which have cost hundreds of extra dollars compared to previous years.

“I got that,” Biden retorted. “But guess what we are. We’re in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn’t spiked. It is just barely, it has been basically even.”

185. Biden Falsely Claims Energy Costs Came Down

In the same “60 Minutes” interview, Biden claimed energy prices have come down, but data for August inflation show energy costs are up 23.8 percent since August of 2021.

184. Biden Says His Expensive Spending Plans Will ‘Get Control of Inflation’

Moments after denying that inflation is spiking, Biden claimed that it’s his administration’s plans, including massive spending plans such as the misnomered Inflation Reduction Act, that will “get control of inflation.”

“Is the economy going to get worse before it gets better?” “60 Minutes” interviewer Pelley asked.

“No, I don’t think so. We hope, we hope we can have what they say a soft landing,” Biden said. “…I’m telling the American people that we are going to get control of inflation. And their prescription drug prices are going to be a hell of a lot lower. Their health care costs are going to be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody. Their energy prices are going to be lower.”

Despite Biden’s self-professed optimism about the economy, reports from financial analysts including those at the Congressional Budget Office say Democrats’ spending will make inflation over the next five years much worse, not better, as Biden and his party claimed.

183. Biden Repeats Civil Rights Activist Fib

During a Labor Day speech Biden claimed that, as a child, he became “very engaged in my case in the civil rights movement.”

“As a kid, I worked a lot in the movement,” Biden said.

Not only did Biden himself admit in 1987 that he was “not out marching” and “not down in Selma,” but even the media have repeatedly debunked Biden’s false assertions that he was “an activist.”

181. Biden Says Inflation Reduction Act Will Not Raise Taxes On Americans Earning Less than $400K

During an Aug. 16 signing ceremony for the Democrat Party’s $740 billion “Inflation Reduction Act,” Biden claimed that “no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes” once the legislation takes effect.

Biden’s assertion, however, runs contrary to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimates that Americans earning less than $400,000 a year “will pay an estimated $20 billion more in taxes over the next decade” as a result of the bill, “which also sets aside $80 billion to hire 87,000 IRS agents.”

180. Biden Says ‘Zero’ Inflation in July Following 8.5 Percent Rise

July’s consumer price index yielded a whopping 8.5 percent inflation increase since the same time last year, but according to Biden, July actually had no inflation whatsoever.

“I just want to say a number: zero,” Biden said in an address on Aug. 10. “Today, we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of July. Here is what that means: While the price of some things went up last month, the price of other things went down by the same amount.”

Though the CPI figures were down slightly from the 9.1 percent recorded in June, the prices for everyday necessities such as groceries and electricity continue to shoot upward, with the latest numbers showing a 10.9 and 15.2 percent increase, respectively, since last year.

179. Biden Claims He Has Cancer

In a “climate crisis” speech about fossil fuels in Massachusetts on July 20, Biden incorrectly claimed that he has cancer caused by oil pollution in his home state. Biden said that growing up, pollution in Delaware was so bad that his mother had to use windshield wipers to “get literally the oil slick off the window.”

“That’s why I and so d-mn many other people I grew up [with] have cancer,” Biden said.

The White House physician quickly released a statement clarifying that Biden “remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

The physician noted that Biden “has had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed” before.

178. Biden Pretends He Wrote Law Review Articles About Right to Privacy

During a speech about the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, Biden claimed he had written “a number of law review articles” about the right to privacy referenced in the now-overturned Roe v. Wade decision.

“And I have written, way back, a number of law review articles about the Ninth Amendment and the — and the 14th Amendment and why that privacy is considered as part of a constitutional guarantee. And the — they’ve just wiped it all out,” he said.

Biden may have helped pen close to 19 law review articles — and even flunked a law school class after plagiarizing portions of someone else’s law review article in one of his papers — but has never had a review published on the “right to privacy.”

As The Washington Post noted, the closest thing Biden has to a law review on the 14th Amendment is a 1991 opinion article in the Philadelphia Inquirer.

177. White House Silent on Biden’s Hunter Lies

When asked about Joe Biden’s voicemail indicating that he knew about Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she could not “comment on any materials from [Hunter’s] laptop.”

Biden previously promised to “always level” with the American people but has repeatedly lied about his son’s financial activity despite copious evidence that he may have been involved in some of Hunter’s transactions.

176. Biden Lies About Billionaire Tax Rate

Biden tweeted that there are approximately 790 billionaires who are taxed at an average rate of 8 percent. He went on to claim that “I believe that no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, an electrician, or a cop.”

As Carol Roth, a former investment banker and economic commentator noted in a Twitter thread investigating the president’s claims, Biden’s assertion that billionaire tax rates are low is not only misleading, but it’s also false.

According to Roth, the study the White House used to determine what Biden claims is the billionaire tax rate does not rely on normal factors such as tax records and income. Instead, it included unsold stock.

“What they are using is not INCOME at all, it is stock appreciation, NOT realized. This is a made-up proxy of a wealth tax,” Roth tweeted.

As Roth noted in her analysis, “this is not how income tax works, and it is straight up a lie to say this an income tax rate for billionaires and portray it as an average tax rate of the ‘wealthiest.’”

Roth said the Biden administration intentionally “took a one time event and used it to compare to yearly taxes.”

175. Biden Repeats ‘Fastest-Growing Economy’ Lie

Biden told Jimmy Kimmel during a June 8 interview that the U.S. has the “fastest-growing economy in the world.”

Joe Biden: “We have the fastest growing economy in the world”

Not only did the American economy shrink last quarter, but it is also plagued with record-high inflation and gas prices, a supply-chain crisis, and a baby formula shortage that has put several babies in hospitals.

174. Biden Says Trump Abused Constitutional Authority

During an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Biden agreed with accusations that Trump passed out executive orders “like Halloween candy.” He also accused the former president of abusing “the Constitution and constitutional authority” by issuing executive orders.

“I have issued executive orders,” Biden said after promising he wouldn’t issue executive action on guns, something he has already done. “But what I don’t want to do is emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and constitutional authority. I mean that sincerely because I often get asked — look, the Republicans don’t play it square, why do you play it square? Well, guess what. If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.”

While Biden blames Trump for what he says is an excessive amount of executive orders, the facts show Biden is on track to outpace the former president’s executive authority tally. During his first few months in office, Biden clocked more than 42 orders. Trump, on the other hand, issued 33.

173. White House Says Economy Is ‘In a Better Place’ Now than Historically

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in a press briefing on Tuesday that Biden’s administration believes “the economy is in a better place than it has been historically.”

Jean-Pierre: ""What we're trying to say is that the economy is in a better place than it has been historically."" pic.twitter.com/KIO61OnGNN — Greg Price (@greg_price11) June 7, 2022

Not only do voters reject this lie, but so do the facts. Inflation in the U.S. has reached record highs nearly every month recently as the supply-chain crisis and national staffing shortage drag on. Since Biden assumed office, gas prices have more than doubled.

There’s also a baby formula shortage that began when Biden’s Food and Drug Administration shut down a plant. It took months for the White House to address the critical crisis that left several young children and babies hospitalized.

172. White House Repeats Lie that Semiautomatic Gun Ban Decreased Mass Shootings

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated the lie that Congress’s 1994 semiautomatic gun ban decreased mass shootings.

“When he — when we talk about the executive actions that he’s taken — more than any president at this time of their administration — those are real steps that this president has taken. And not just as president, during his Senate years, in 1994, the banning of assault weapons; that is something that he led on,” she said during a press briefing on June 6. “And if we even look at what happened those first 10 years of that — of that assault [weapons ban] was in law — into law, it actually brought down mass shootings. And when it — when it expired in 2004, 10 years later, we saw mass shootings triple.”

A 2004 study funded by the Department of Justice, however, found that the Clinton-era ban was not the reason shootings decreased in the U.S.

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

171. White House Says Biden Believes Excessive Federal Spending Helped Economy

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told members of the press on June 6 that Biden believes his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan actually helped the economy instead of contributing to its problems.

“I want to say the Rescue Plan has really been able to help us, put us in an economic, a place where we’re stronger. And … this is something that we have to really continue to remember, we are in an economic crisis. And the president met that moment by putting forth the American Rescue Plan, by Democrats on the Hill voting for that plan, and really putting us in a place where we look at today in a much stronger economic situation where we can actually deal with inflation head-on,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have a lot of work to do and we understand what the American people are feeling, but we are in a stronger place to take that on.”

It’s a repeat talking point from the administration but one that holds no water against record-high inflation and gas prices.

170. Biden Claims He Initiated Fastest Economic Recovery

During a speech on June 6, Biden claimed that “my plans have produced the strongest, fastest, most widespread economic recovery America has ever experienced.”

Biden also bragged about “record jobs, new record small businesses, and wages rising,” but he did not mention that inflation has far outpaced those hikes for months now. The president also did not mention that gas prices have more than doubled since he assumed office in January of 2021.

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1533891641781764097?s=20&t=LeMTRb0AW6jh7sT01bHDAQ

Meanwhile, Americans deal with a prolonged supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising gas prices that the administration refuses to take responsibility for.

169. Biden Says Gun Manufacturers Have Blanket Immunity that Doesn’t Exist

President Biden claimed gun manufacturers enjoy blanket immunity on how their firearms are used.

“We should repeal the liability shield that all protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons,” Biden said in a gun speech on the evening of June 2. “They are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.”

BIDEN: Gun manufacturers ""are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity."" pic.twitter.com/OsmclOQyZx — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) June 2, 2022

Biden’s claim, however, enjoys no merit. Suing a gun company for a gun that fires when the trigger is pulled is akin to suing the Coors Brewing Company because beer got people drunk.

The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which became law in 2005, protects firearm manufacturers from liability for weapons used in a crime. Companies, however, may still be sued for negligence, breach of contract over gun purchases, and weapons defects.

168. Biden Says Deficit Cut Under Him Will Be Largest in History

“The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this year – the largest reduction in history,” Biden wrote in his WSJ op-ed.

That’s a misleading claim, however, that doesn’t capture just how huge Biden’s budget deficit remains. History shows that this year’s $1 trillion deficit will be “the 7th worst on record.”

167. Biden Claims Economy Was Already Bad Before Covid-19

“Things should also look different from the decades before the pandemic, when too often we had low growth, low wage gains, and an economy that worked best for the wealthiest Americans,” Biden wrote in his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation.”

From 2017 to 2019 under Trump, however, GDP growth averaged 2.54 percent. Hourly earnings were also up 2.97 percent and outpaced the 2.13 percent inflation rate.

“In 2019, median household income saw its largest increase on record. The unemployment rate hit its lowest rate in nearly 50 years, poverty rates for all races were the lowest on record, and income inequality declined,” the America First Policy Institute determined.

166. Biden Repeats Putin Price Hike Lie

“The price at the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil, gas, and refining capacity are off the market,” Biden wrote in his inflation article in the Wall Street Journal.

Gas prices started rising long before the Russia Ukraine war. When Biden assumed office and waged a war on domestic oil and gas production by shutting down drilling and pipelines, gasoline prices rose significantly. From Biden’s inauguration to the week Russia invaded Ukraine, gas prices in the U.S. rose from $2.38 per gallon to $3.53 per gallon.

165. Biden Claims He Inherited ‘Stalled Economy’

Biden wrote in his inflation op-ed that “In January 2021, when I took office, the recovery had stalled.”

Shortly before Biden was inaugurated, however, the economy measured an annualized growth rate of 4.5 percent.

164. Biden Says Americans Are Better Paid Under His Administration

Biden claimed in his Wall Street Journal op-ed that “millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay” now that he is in office.

While earnings under Biden have risen 5.5 percent, real wages are down 2.8 percent and prices keep rising above the current 8.3 percent rate.

“The average American has lost about $1,350 in purchasing power from President Biden’s inflation tax,” the America First Policy Institute calculated.

163. Biden Claims He Initiated ‘Fastest Decline in Unemployment on Record’

In his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation,” Biden falsely claimed that his administration is responsible for “the fastest decline in unemployment on record.”

“The job market is the strongest since the post-World War II era, with 8.3 million new jobs, the fastest decline in unemployment on record, and millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay,” he wrote.

Records, however, show that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During that time period, the unemployment rate also declined 8.3 percent, which is 5.7 percent more than the fall measured under Biden’s watch.

162: Biden Repeats False Cannon Claim

Shortly before Biden signed an executive order on policing, he repeated his claim that when the Second Amendment was created, “You couldn’t own a cannon.”

“You couldn’t own certain kinds of weapons. There’s always been limitations,” he said while arguing in favor of more restrictions on Americans’ rights to keep and bear firearms.

Not only were cannons legal when the Consitution was drafted, but they are also legal now. Revolutionary and Civil War-era cannons that don’t take a cartridge can be bought and sold as saluting and signaling devices in the United States. Certain modern artillery cannons that do take cartridges are classified as destructive devices and are legal and regulated under the National Firearms Act.

161: Biden Lies About Number of Times He’s Visited the Middle East

During his commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy in May, Biden claimed he has been to Iraq and Afghanistan “38 times.”

“I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 — I think 38 times,” Biden stated.

Not only did his own campaign confirm in 2019 that this was not true after the first time he stated this falsehood, but even The Washington Post fact-checked him on the erroneous claim.

Biden also implied that his son Beau Biden died in combat even though he passed away from cancer.

“My son spent a year in Iraq, won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal. I lost him,” Biden said.

160: Biden Says He Received Appointment to Naval Academy

Biden told graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy at their May commencement that he had received an appointment to attend the academy in 1965.

“Before I begin my speech, a thought crossed my mind as I was told the class of ‘72 is here. I was appointed to the academy in 1965 by a senator who I was running against in 1972,” Biden said. “Never planned it that way. I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in. I was only 29 years old when I was running. He was a fine man, and his name was J. Caleb Boggs.”

Biden went on to say that he declined to attend the academy “because I wanted to be a football star” and “you had a guy named Staubach and Bellino here.”

“So I went to Delaware,” he added.

Joe Biden falsely claimed he “was appointed to the [Naval] Academy in 1965” while speaking to Naval Academy graduates today.

At the time described in Biden’s claim, however, the future president was graduating from the University of Delaware. The football players he mentioned as deterrents to his dream of being a football star had also previously graduated, Roger Staubach in 1965 and Joe Bellino in 1961.

159: White House Says Biden Came Up With ‘Ultra MAGA’ Label Himself

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed in a May 10 press conference that President Biden came with the “ultra MAGA” label to define his political opponents all on his own.

“It’s the president’s phrase, and the president made those comments himself,” Psaki said.

The Washington Post revealed on May 13, however, that the label is the product of a “six-month research project” by the left-wing group Center for American Progress Action Fund with former Harvey Weinstein apologist Anita Dunn.

158: Biden Says There Was No Vaccine Available When He Took Office

The White House claimed no coronavirus vaccine was available when President Biden took office in a May 12 tweet.

Operation Warp Speed however, a project to fast-track development for the pandemic disease, produced vaccines in record time. In fact, about 1.3 million Americans were given inoculations on Biden’s first day in office, surpassing the vaccination pace President Biden pledged of 100 million doses distributed in his first 100 days to mark another accomplishment of Donald Trump.

Biden even received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine before taking office.

157: Biden Claims Roaring Economy He Inherited Was On ‘Brink Of A Great Depression’

At a May 11 address in Chicago, President Biden portrayed himself the savior an economy nearing collapse, except the economy was on a rebound from the short-lived pandemic recession that lockdowns threatened to restrain.

“We had an economy on the brink of a Great Depression,” Biden said, despite the nation’s economy not contracting until a year into the president’s term.

According to data from the Department of Commerce, quarterly GDP remained positive until this year, when it decreased 1.4 percent in the first quarter. Real GDP growth under Biden’s first quarter in office was higher than it had been in at least three years as the economy recovered from Democrats’ shutdowns.

156: Biden Claims Vote To Block Abortion Bill Was Partisan. But Joe Manchin Also Voted No

President Biden condemned Republicans on May 11 for their unified rejection of an abortion guarantee written into federal law ahead of a potential decision from the Supreme Court to terminate Roe v. Wade as ruling precedent.

“Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care,” Biden said.

But West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, also rejected the bill.

Manchin explained his opposition to the bill on Capitol Hill.

“I respect people who support” it, Manchin said of the bill, which would prevent states from passing restrictions on abortions before fetal viability, and would further allow women to kill their unborn babies if a physician determined the baby was “a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health” — which could easily be interpreted to broadly include a variety of things under the banner of emotional health.

“Make no mistake. It is not Roe v. Wade codification,” Machin continued. “It’s an expansion. It wipes 500 state laws off the books.”

155: Biden Once Again Blames Inflation on Putin and Covid Pandemic

Inflation reached a four-decade high last month, but, contrary to what Biden said during a speech on economics, Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not chiefly to blame.

“There are two leading causes of inflation we’re seeing today,” Biden said. “The first cause of inflation is a once-in-a-century-pandemic … [and] a second cause: Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine.”

BIDEN: ""There are two leading causes of inflation we're seeing today""

2) ""Mr. Putin's war in Ukraine""



MORE: https://t.co/IVmGxHlAWA pic.twitter.com/Hs1Zw0gmdH — NEWSMAX (@NEWSMAX) May 10, 2022

Inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

154: Biden Says Inflation Is His ‘Top Domestic Priority’

During an inflation speech, Biden claimed that tackling inflation is his “top domestic priority.”

“I want every American to know that I am taking inflation very seriously and it’s my top domestic priority,” Biden said.

Biden says he’s “taking inflation very seriously” but so far this week, his administration has been far more preoccupied with rejecting the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson draft opinion, which could see the court overturn Roe v. Wade, than soothing American consumers’ fears about a recession.

He also gave no indication that he plans to reinstate the American energy independence achieved under the Trump administration to lower gas prices, which rank as one of the highest inflation jumps each month.

153: Biden Said Robert Bork Thought Government Gave Americans Rights

Biden claimed Judge Robert Bork, the Supreme Court nominee he infamously torpedoed and smeared for his “original-intent judicial philosophy,” believed the government gives people rights.

“Bork believed the only reason you had any inherent rights was because the government gave them to you,” Biden said.

While Bork did appear to reject natural law as a guiding legal philosophy, he acknowledged its existence and never claimed to believe that inherent rights come from the government. Instead, Bork referred to rights in his confirmation hearings as something that could be transferred between parties but did not clarify how they were bestowed.

“What a court adds to one person’s constitutional rights, it subtracts from the rights of others,” Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois quoted Bork saying before asking whether Bork still believed that.

”Well, yes, Senator,” Bork said. ”I think it’s a matter of plain arithmetic.”

152: Biden Accuses ‘MAGA Crowd’ of Being ‘the Most Extreme Political Organization … in American History’

In a rant about the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization opinion signaling the end of Roe v. Wade, Biden accused the “MAGA crowd” of being “the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history,” before adding, “recent American history.”

Joe Biden says that overturning Roe v. Wade could lead to LGBT children not being allowed in school classrooms:



""This MAGA crowd is the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history."" pic.twitter.com/WyW6j52ju0 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) May 4, 2022

Biden failed to acknowledge that there are far more extreme and violent groups operating within the U.S., who have initiated deadly terrorist attacks on Americans, than the millions of people who voted for and support former President Donald Trump.

He also falsely suggested that the SCOTUS ruling on Dobbs would allow states to bar LGBTQ students from attending class with other students.

“If you have states change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children. Is that legit under the way that the decision is written?” he asked.

151: Biden Blames Putin for Months-Long, Record-High Inflation

Inflation reached a 40-year high last month, but Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not to blame, contrary to what Biden likes to suggest.

“I know that families are still struggling with higher prices. I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it. Let’s be absolutely clear about why prices are high right now: COVID and Vladimir Putin,” Biden wrote in a tweet on April 20.

The truth is, inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

150: Biden Repeats Lie that Buying American Products Is a Priority

Despite his refusal to utilize the U.S. oil industry to achieve energy independence, Biden said buying American-made products is a priority for his administration.

“From Day One, every action I’ve taken to rebuild our economy has been guided by one principle: Make it in America. That means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States of America,” the president tweeted.

Biden told a similar lie during his State of the Union address shortly after the White House defended buying at least $1.3 billion worth of Covid-19 rapid tests from China instead of U.S. manufacturers.

149: Biden Claims He Was A ‘Full Professor’ At The University Of Pennsylvania

Biden repeated a claim on April 14 that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, this time claiming “full” professorship despite his 2017-2019 tenure being an honorary position.

“For four years I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania,” Biden said during an event on supply chains in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Joe Biden says he was a ""full professor"" at UPenn.

Biden however, didn’t teach at the university, according to a spokesperson for the former vice president at the time he was hired.

The Daily Pennsylvanian headlined a piece ahead of Biden’s arrival, “No one is really sure what Joe Biden will be doing at Penn.”

According to the New York Post, Biden raked in more than $900,000 from the university despite rare appearances.

148: Biden Says You Couldn’t Buy Cannons When Second Amendment Passed

During his gun violence speech on April 11, Biden repeated the lie that cannons couldn’t be bought when the Second Amendment was ratified.

“You couldn’t buy a cannon when the Second Amendment passed,” Biden claimed.

147: Biden Says Gun Manufacturers Can’t Be Sued

Biden said gunmakers are immune from prosecution even though manufacturers can be sued if a firearm is faulty or malfunctions.

“Gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry,” Biden falsely claimed. “So they’ve never had to take responsibility for the death and destruction their products cause.”

BIDEN: ""Gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry."" pic.twitter.com/2Qkz50AL2W — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 11, 2022

Biden also claimed that gun manufacturers are “the only outfit in the country that is immune,” even though many of the manufacturers who created the Covid-19 jab are immune to prosecution.

146: Biden Claims His Family Worried About Gas Prices As a Kid

“I grew up in a family like many of you where the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was discussed at the kitchen table,” Biden claimed.

But, as RealClearMarket’s John Tamny noted after Biden told a similar lie in February, Biden “was born in 1942. When Biden was growing up, the price of gasoline was flat. And it was cheap.”

A chart from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows the price of crude oil nearly flat from the 1880s until the 1970s — far after Joe Biden’s childhood.

145: Biden Says ‘Nothing’ Stopping Domestic Oil Production Even Though He Is

Even before he assumed office, Biden pledged to take down the domestic oil industry in favor of pushing his green agenda. This involved canceling the permits necessary for the Keystone XL pipeline, halting new oil and gas leases, and more recently, delaying permits for drilling on federal land.

144: Biden Falsely Claims Transgenderism Is ‘Safe and Healthy’

Biden told parents of children suffering from gender confusion that “affirming your child’s identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy.”

Despite Biden’s claims, encouraging young children to take hormone blockers, bind, or engage in other physically altering “treatments” or dangerous and risky procedures is not safe nor healthy. In addition to causing a myriad of harmful side effects including sterility, severe dysfunction, and other health problems, pushing children to embrace an identity different than their God-given sex often leads to transition regret as well as an exponentially higher risk of suicide.

Biden told reporters that he “didn’t get a chance to see any of” Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings last week even though the White House said he did.

“The president watched portions of Judge Jackson’s hearing yesterday and today,” a White House staffer announced in a press briefing last week.

It is unclear if Biden simply forgot that he viewed the hearings or if the White House lied about how the president spends his time.

142: Biden Repeats ‘Very Fine People’ Lie to Smear Trump

During a press conference at the NATO summit in Belgium, Biden repeated the lie that Trump called the Charlottesville white nationalists “very fine people.”

It will always be funny to me when Biden says how Trump's ""very fine people on both sides"" line from Charlottesville was his inspiration to run for president.

Transcripts show that Trump’s “very fine people” line was in reference to the peaceful protesters on both sides who were civilly expressing their opinions about Confederate statues.

“But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,” Trump said.

Trump specifically said he was “not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,” but Biden still brings up the hoax on occasion.

141: Biden Says Unemployment Claims Down

Biden claimed that because unemployment claims are down because “our labor market is strong.”

Today we learned that the number of new unemployment claims is now lower than it was before the pandemic in 2019.



Our labor market is strong. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 17, 2022

The truth is, restaurants, hospitals, and businesses across the nation are struggling to stay open amid staffing shortages caused by an influx of federal cash. Record numbers of people left their jobs and even the labor market last year after multiple rounds of stimulus checks. Currently, more than 11 million jobs need to be filled and there aren’t enough workers willing to take those positions.

140: Biden Denies Cutting Off Domestic Oil Production

Shortly after he announced Russian oil would no longer be imported into the U.S., Biden claimed that he never stifled the U.S. oil and gas industry.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That is simply not true,” Biden insisted.

PANTS ON FIRE: Biden says some high gas prices could be b/c of price-gouging & it's a lie to say he's stifled domestic energy.

The truth is, Biden has done nothing but sabotage the U.S. oil and gas industry and replaced it with his green energy policy agenda. The president used his first year in office to wreck domestic production by suspending oil and gas leases, axing projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, canceling Arctic drilling leases, and pushing a cascade of taxes and regulation on the industry.

As a result, domestic gas prices were rising dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Painful prices at the pump have quickly become a sore spot for Americans, many of whom have indicated they’re looking for a change in the November midterms.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/08/heres-the-full-list-of-every-lie-joe-biden-has-told-as-president-part-three/,2022-03-08
Why Is Putin Talking About ‘De-Nazifying’ Ukraine?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has proffered, as one of his rationales for invading Ukraine, the need to “de-Nazify” the nation. Russian propaganda, some people sympathetic to it, and others perhaps well-meaning, points to the Azov Battalion in Ukraine as proof of that nation’s Nazi leanings.

To preface this discussion, it’s important to put into context what Putin means by de-Nazification. Both the Nazis under Hitler and the Soviet Union, especially in the early years under Lenin, emphasized national identity.

Because the Soviet Union sought to be a global communist empire, it anticipated a host of Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) for everybody: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and even Germany, Hungary, and the rest of Europe. Under this construct, the SSRs would be united in their international communist ideology, but unique in their national identity. In this, Lenin and later generations of Kremlin leaders, rightly surmised that the larger an empire is, the more leeway it must grant its provinces, at the risk of fomenting rebellion.

It was in this early time of the U.S.S.R.’s history that Ukraine saw a resurgence of its language, literature, and national identity after decades of Russification under the Tsars.

Thus, when Putin speaks of de-Nazification, what he really means is to Russify — to return to the age of the Tsars circa the 1860s, when Russia imposed a 40-year ban on the publication of books and newspapers in Ukrainian.

About Those Neo-Nazis

Putin’s insular view of what it means to be de-Nazified aside, there appear to be some actual armed neo-Nazis in Ukraine in the form of the Azov Battalion. What is the Azov Battalion and how did it come into being? Just as importantly, is it uniquely Ukrainian, or are there similar groups elsewhere?

In late 2013, as Ukraine’s fourth president, the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych, approached his fourth year of a five-year term, political unrest — known as the Euromaidan protests — grew out of a public desire for closer integration with the European Union rather than Russia. By February 2014, Yanukovych had fled to Russia while Russia was invading Crimea and sending Russian officers to the Donbas Basin provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, in Ukraine’s east.

In the chaos of 2014, the Ukrainian military, which had been left in disrepair and hobbled by corruption and cronyism, was wholly inadequate to the task of defending the nation. Crimea fell almost without a shot, while Donetsk and Luhansk were rapidly brought under de facto Russian control. Mariupol, the second-largest city in Donetsk with some 430,000 residents, was abandoned under pressure by Ukrainian government forces in May 2014.

But five weeks later, government forces, including the Azov Battalion, retook the city. Three months later, the Russian-backed separatists of the Donetsk People’s Republic tried again to take Mariupol, and again, the Azov Battalion played a leading role in keeping the city under Ukrainian control.

At the time, the Azov Battalion’s insignia and the ideology of its leadership and rank-and-file wer openly neo-Nazi. The unit was also accused of war crimes, including using torture on their Russian-backed enemy. When confronted with the similarity between the Azov Battalion’s unit patch and that of the German Nazi 2nd SS Panzer Division, Azov officials denied the connection, claiming that their symbol is an abbreviation for the slogan “National Idea.” (In Ukrainian, the letters “H” and “I” are tilted to the right by 45 degrees.)

Chris Joyner, writing for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on March 4, quoted Prof. David Malet, an expert on transnational fighters with the School of Public Affairs at American University, who noted that as the Ukrainian military gained proficiency, it sought to tame the Azov Battalion and discourage foreign extremists from volunteering in Ukraine. Malet told Joyner, “A lot of Russian propaganda has focused on Nazi ties, trying to paint all the volunteers in Ukraine as Nazis, when again it’s probably been a pretty good mix of it on both sides.”

Of course, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish, as was the nation’s previous prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman. This led Hans Jakob-Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, to sarcastically note of Putin’s claims of Ukraine as a Nazi state was, “apparently, a very new kind of Nazi that only a Russian understands how that works.”

Reinforcing Groysman’s view, the 450-member Ukrainian parliament, or Rada, only has one member from a party accused of neo-Nazi leanings. Svoboda, founded in 1991 at the dissolution of the Soviet Union, recruited skinheads and employed neo-Nazi symbols in the 1990s, only to later moderate. It reached its apex in the 2012 election, winning 10 percent of the vote and 37 seats. In the 2019 election, Svoboda received only 2 percent of the vote.

Returning to Malet, his contention that there’s a “good mix” of neo-Nazi-like groups in both Ukraine and Russia is important for context.

Putin has his own ultra-nationalist groups. For instance, in 2014, a Russian motorcycle gang with close Putin ties known as the “Night Wolves,” was used as the vanguard of the Crimea invasion — inaugurating a new era of so-called “hybrid warfare.” By streaming into Crimea, the Night Wolves showed that the Ukrainian central government was powerless. The gang’s ideology is based on contempt for a decadent and rootless West with its leader Alexander Zaldostanov admitting that “death to faggots” might be an appropriate motto.

The Rise of Neo-Paganism

In some sense, the rise of nationalism has paced the rise of globalism and the subsequent disorienting displacements of work and dilution of culture. One reaction to this can be seen in the concurrent rise of neo-paganism.

When I enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1983, I never saw pagan symbology. By the time I retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Army National Guard in 2007, it was noticeable, but not yet widespread. Interestingly, when I toured Folsom Prison in 2006 while a member of the California State Assembly, the prison chaplain told us the two fastest-growing faiths behind bars were Islam and Wicca, the latter being a revival of paganism.

There is a certain logic in this. Christianity is a global faith, making no distinction between people. Further, Christianity teaches forgiveness, to love one’s enemy, and to turn the other cheek. In the context of the profession of arms — or the dangerous reality of being incarcerated — Christianity may be seen by some as weak, whereas paganism can appeal to a warrior ethos.

Insofar as Ukraine and Putin’s Nazi accusations against the nation, the question is whether actual Nazis with real animus towards the Jewish people and other minorities can gain a foothold and use their power to persecute people. This prospect appears vanishingly small, and, if Ukraine survives as an independent nation, even less so.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/16/why-is-putin-talking-about-de-nazifying-ukraine/,2022-03-16
It Shouldn’t Be Hard To Condemn Jackson’s Leniency For Child Predators,"Joe Biden has nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the newest Supreme Court justice, a seat held for life. Immediately, Sen. Josh Hawley brought forward concerns about Jackson’s history of leniency toward child predators.

In a Twitter thread, Hawley cited multiple examples of this, using Jackson’s own words and sentencing history as a federal judge. This includes Jackson questioning whether child sex predators should be forced to register as sex offenders.

National Review’s Andrew McCarthy weighed in to say that Republicans like Hawley are making a big mistake, and a big deal out of nothing. McCarthy correctly points out that if Republicans are so concerned about this issue, they should make sentences on child predators tougher.

But McCarthy wasn’t arguing for tougher sentences, just making a rhetorical point. He went on to compare child sexual abuse imagery to drugs, and claimed the only justification for making these materials illegal is “market theory”—that the consumption of these illicit materials drives the abuse of children in the materials, even though the persons viewing the materials supposedly aren’t abusers themselves.

Says McCarthy: “If there were not simple possessors and consumers of illegal narcotics, there would not be a market that drives the much more serious drug-trafficking crimes. Yet no senators have suggested that illegal-drug possessors and users should be sentenced to harsh prison terms, much less mandatory minimums. And the Justice Department generally does not enforce simple possession statutes at all.”

McCarthy goes on to point out that 70 percent of judges, including many appointed by Republicans, think current federal mandatory minimums for child pornography are too harsh. According to McCarthy, this must mean these sentences probably are too harsh.

In jumps fellow National Reviewer Ramesh Ponnuru with an article that says our child porn laws “might” be too weak. Ponnuru correctly points out how wrong the Supreme Court was in 2002 to allow “virtual” child sexual abuse imagery where real children aren’t being abused, and then quickly argues that McCarthy’s view is wrong because these materials certainly harm “our moral ecology.”

The Conservative Old Guard Is Completely Useless

The real truth highlights both Jackson’s disregard for public safety and how ineffectual and lazy most of the conservative intellectual movement is. Ponnuru and McCarthy are full of theory and mumbo jumbo, but here are the facts.

The point of criminal justice is to keep the public safe. Murderers are put in prison not just to punish them, but to keep the innocent safe. The same should be true for child predators, especially since potential victims are literally the most innocent among us.

This is obvious to any normal person. It is precisely the reason Jackson is dangerous—because she clearly cares extremely little about public safety. Even her comment questioning the registering of sex offenders is egregious, because registering offenders isn’t that draconian. It only loosely keeps offenders away from areas where children congregate and allows concerned parents to see who’s in their neighborhoods that they should be concerned about.

The reason men trading in child rape images should get locked away is that the vast majority of these men (if not all) are active threats to the children around them. Many, probably at least half, are active or hands-on child abusers. It’s really that simple. So all the stuff about “drugs” or “moral ecology” is the same thing you step on in a farmyard.

Predators usually don’t just have a few images, or accidentally download something here or there (this was the Democrats’ alleged concern in Minnesota with tougher laws). Rather, they amass collections of hundreds or thousands of images and videos that come straight from the pit of hell. The horrifying facts can’t be repeated here, and reader discretion is advised, but a Minnesota government report (pages 34 and 35, or 40 and 41 in the PDF) details just what kind of materials these predators are collecting.

And who cares if many federal judges think a five-year minimum, which still comes with a lot of prosecutorial discretion (that gets explained using a state-level example here), is too harsh? Judges have helped ruin this country, and many are going straight to hell. Should we all go with them?

In addition, sentences for offenders are incredibly lax, especially at the state level. States like Minnesota have all but decriminalized possessing and trading in child abuse imagery and around 85 percent of offenders receive probation (although a recent law could marginally improve things). McCarthy mentioned drugs, which is interesting because drug criminals often receive harsher sentences than child predators do. You’d think the left would be all over that because there is a racial component here: many child predators are white and drug criminals are disproportionately not white.

How To Help Curtail Child Rape

It is important to realize that America at both the state and the federal level massively under-enforces these crimes relative to the size of the problem. Child predation is also a growing problem, coinciding with greater family breakdown, the rise of the internet, the opioid and meth crisis, and the prevalence of increasingly violent and degrading adult-on-adult online pornography.

Very few predators downloading images of abused children online are able to be pursued by law enforcement, because law enforcement in this area is so under-resourced. The primary vehicle to do so—the Internet Crimes Against Children task forces, or ICACs—are extremely underfunded at both the state and federal levels.

Meanwhile, the FBI is politically distracted and does relatively little to go after predators. Just look at its personnel who deal with these crimes relative to the agents it is adding to counter “domestic terrorism.” Federal prosecutors, too, have an incentive to pad their stats with easy drug and gun crimes, relative to the growing problem of human trafficking and child predation.

All these things can be fixed with money, tougher laws, and better incentives for prosecutors, but it takes leadership. Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden has sponsored a bill that, although imperfect, offers more resources. The GOP has notably been silent, as far as I can tell, on greater enforcement spending.

What America really needs is a War on Trafficking, and it would be great to see the senators pushing against Jackson launch such a measure. For example, funding for the ICACs should get massively increased. Then, break up the FBI, scatter the new components throughout the country, and create a specific, well-funded, anti-trafficking federal enforcement entity.

Back to Ponnuru and McCarthy: it is striking how little the right’s intellectual elite deals with common sense, and astonishing how disconnected many of these personalities are from how normal people think. Am I being hard on them? Yes. But these guys get paid to come up with solutions to our problems because they’ve researched the details.

Middle America might be lost on the conservative punditry, but Washington Republicans are not. Talking about theory and rhetoric all day is why Republicans win elections and accomplish nothing outside of corporate priorities, while Democrats push policy ideas that advance their long-term agenda. The right desperately needs to move away from that.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/28/it-shouldnt-be-hard-to-condemn-ketanji-brown-jacksons-leniency-for-child-predators/,2022-03-28
Democrats Are Overlooking Child Sex Crimes To Protect Jackson,"In the week since Biden Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was questioned about her pattern of reduced sentencing in grisly child pornography cases, two narratives have developed.

The first view holds that the question of sentencing, and the implication that Judge Jackson is soft on child pornography offenders, is “disingenuous,” “a smear,” and “meritless to the point of demagoguery.” According to this narrative, such claims distort the rate at which judges routinely depart from the sentencing guidelines and do not distinguish the harm between the production of child pornography and mere possession of it.

This view also seems to imply that most child pornography cases involve the unjust sentencing of 17-year-olds turning 18, when their otherwise mildly voyeuristic behavior suddenly turns criminal. It’s an argument that, bizarrely, also relies on the Washington Post’s vilification artist, Glenn Kessler, to justify a flippant dismissal of the concerns raised.

In a recent podcast, National Review’s Charlie Cooke claimed Republicans did not acquit themselves well for focusing on the topic. National Review’s editor, Rich Lowry, said the “child porn thing” was “demagogic,” and should not have even been raised. Columnist Brad Polumbo implied Republican senators asking detailed questions about Judge Jackson’s sentencing record were “grandstanding.”

A second narrative, however, acknowledges that reality is a bit more complicated than simply casting key Republican senators off as demagogues – particularly when it involves confirming a judge to a lifetime term on the Supreme Court, which, owing to Congress’s routine failure to legislate on any meaningful question, is now the arbiter of all our major cultural questions.

Moreover, a cursory examination of the sentencing record of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as it relates to child pornography reveals that these cases are not, in fact, simply about the perceived injustice of sentencing a just-turned-18-year-old to years in prison for a crime he wouldn’t be punished for at the age of 17.

Editor’s note: The following contains explicit descriptions of child pornography as described in court documents.

The facts in many of these cases are far more heinous, and brutal – even in the cases involving teenagers. In the now much-discussed 2013 case, United States v. Hawkins, Wesley Keith Hawkins was arrested for possession of child pornography and sentenced by Judge Jackson to just three months in prison despite the prosecution asking for two years. Here are the details of the case and sentencing, as described in court documents and summarized by Real Clear Investigations:

In 2013, Hawkins was busted posting videos on YouTube of ‘prepubescent boys engaged in sexual activity with each other, including oral and anal penetration,’ according to court documents. He told an undercover officer that he preferred children as young as 11 and sent him a video of a ‘prepubescent male masturbating.’ Investigators recovered 17 videos from his phone and laptop, which showed, among other things, ‘an approximately 11-year-old male being anally penetrated by an adult male.’ In her sentencing, Jackson ruled she didn’t think the volume and content of porn he had was particularly egregious and she gave Hawkins essentially a slap on the wrist — and then apologized to him for it. ‘This is a truly difficult situation,’ she told Hawkins at sentencing. ‘I appreciate that your family is in the audience. I feel so sorry for them and for you and for the anguish that this has caused all of you.’ Jackson then expressed sorrow over even the light sentence she handed down. “I feel terrible about the collateral consequences of this conviction,” she said, explaining that “sex offenders are truly shunned in our society, but I have no control over the collateral consequences.”

Hawkins later went on to re-offend, and Judge Jackson placed him in a halfway house for six months. But the Hawkins case is not the only case in question.

The other child pornography cases overseen by Jackson do not involve teenagers. They involve grown men actively seeking to groom children to have sexual intercourse, the distribution of sadomasochist pornography with depictions of young male children, and a case where a criminal distributed 102 child pornography videos and shared lewd photos of his 10-year-old daughter, among others.

In every single child pornography case handled by Judge Jackson, she went below the maximum recommendation, below the minimum recommendation, and below the prosecutor’s request.

The White House Obfuscation

Now there is another case to consider – the details of which the Biden White House apparently “overlooked” when sharing records with the Senate Judiciary Committee. The case, United States. v Cane, which Judge Jackson sentenced less than a year ago, involved more than 6,500 files depicting school-aged children engaged in sexual acts or other conduct with adult men and foreign objects. Notably, while the probation office recommended a sentence of 84 months, Jackson sentenced the man to 60 months in prison, the mandatory minimum.

Much has been made of the probation office’s pre-sentencing recommendations. Senate Democrats and the White House have claimed that, in dipping below the sentencing guidelines, Jackson was simply relying on advice from the probation office, which oversees offenders and makes recommendations to the judges for conditions of sentencing. But the Cane case, where Jackson disregarded the higher sentencing request from the probation office, appears to undermine that talking point.

Cane does more than simply highlight an inconvenient fact about Jackson’s sentencing record, however. It continues to expose the undercurrent surrounding this entire nomination process, which has been one of obfuscation. From beginning to end, there has been a concerted effort to stymie senators from engaging in the vetting process.

The White House continues to withhold 48,000 documents related to Judge Jackson’s tenure, including her time on the Sentencing Commission. And the Sentencing Commission refuses to turn over anything more than summary documents, citing “balance of power” issues in its role in the judiciary. (It should be noted that Judge Jackson could personally request that her archive be released. She has not done so.)

The pre-sentencing documents relied upon by the White House and Senate Democrats have not been turned over in full to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In their place, senators were presented a single-page summary document, without underlying records. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, claims that sharing the full records confidentially with the committee would put people at risk.

Committee Democrats like Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, who infamously released confidential documents to the public during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing and then embarrassingly called his stand his “I am Spartacus moment,” had the gall to lecture the committee about the unprecedented nature of sharing pre-sentencing documents in confidence.

But perhaps more broadly, the intentional obfuscation and the slow release of new documents and fact patterns, particularly as it relates to Judge Jackson’s sentencing history, validates every Republican senator who leaned into this line of questioning. Not only is showing up and asking specific and informed questions of nominees the job of senators, but oftentimes their persistence is rewarded.

Thanks to the senators who engaged Judge Jackson with regard to her record and judicial philosophy, both the senators and the public know far more than they originally did, the White House narrative around this nomination has begun to crack, and critical concerns about the philosophy and discernment of Judge Jackson have been presented to the full Senate, who will ultimately be the final arbiter of confirmation.

None of this would have happened if Republican senators had simply taken on faith the notion that asking pointed questions, based on the facts presented in the nominee’s record, somehow constitutes a disingenuous smear.

Judge Jackson Remains Outside the Sentencing Averages

Within the legal community and beyond, there remains a robust debate about sentencing guidelines as they relate to pornography. But elements of both the right and left have used the presence of this debate not to recognize the validity of the other side, but to try and delegitimize both the questions and the questioners who have raised it – casting Sens. Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Mike Lee, Marsha Blackburn, and others as cynical, uniformed actors bent on burnishing their own credentials, rather than as sober-minded members of the committee constitutionally tasked with vetting judicial nominees for their temperament and judgment.

“All judges do this,” the refrain frequently goes. In some cases, this is true. As Judge Jackson noted in her confirmation hearing, the sentencing guidelines passed by Congress are out of date, and often don’t meaningfully distinguish between the production of child pornography and mere possession of it, and because of this, many judges and even prosecutors depart from the guidelines.

But Judge Jackson sets herself apart for the rate at which she has consistently departed from the guidelines, and the sympathy she has expressed for the defendants while doing so. According to data from the Sentencing Commission, cross-referenced with Judge Jackson’s sentencing in child pornography cases, on average she imposed sentences that were 57 percent less than the national average for possession of child pornography. For distribution, her average sentence was 47 percent less than the national average.

Judge Jackson isn’t the norm for two reasons: first, her sentencing history is well below the departure average for most judges, and second, “most judges” aren’t nominated to the country’s highest court, where they will set national policy and legal parameters for decades to come. Only Ketanji Brown Jackson is. And she will take the bench at a time there is an academic effort underway to seemingly normalize pedophilia, and when major American corporations, not to mention public schools, aggressively seek to sexualize young children.

When Child Pornography Mattered to the U.S. Senate

The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote to report out the nomination of Judge Jackson on Monday. Her nomination will then be considered by the full Senate shortly thereafter. Despite information that continues to be disclosed about her record, it seems likely all Senate Democrats will vote in her favor – and Republican Sen. Susan Collins recently announced she will join them.

For Democrats, the vote represents an evolution as it relates to acceptable sentencing for crimes of child pornography. In 1996, Congress found that child pornography “played a central role in the exploitation and sexual abuse of children,” particularly as it “encourages the activities of child molesters and pedophiles.”

In 2003, Congress acted to pass the PROTECT Act, with the express purpose of giving prosecutors more robust tools to crack down on child pornography and sex crimes. The bill and its attendant conference report received unanimous support in the Senate.

The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., now a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, spoke of the chamber’s agreement “that we should do all we can to protect our children from being victimized by child pornography,” and the need to “write a law that will both do that and produce convictions that will stick.”

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY, an original sponsor of the bill and now the Democratic majority leader, likened the child pornography problem to “a worldwide war.” “We cannot and we will not permit child pornographers to hide behind the courts or modern technology,” he said. “We must send child pornographers the message that Congress will not tolerate child abuse or child pornography, today, tomorrow, or ever, no matter what the state of technology is.”

The question of taking the issue of child pornography and its harms to vulnerable victims seriously is once again before the Senate, this time in the form of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson’s approach to these issues will shape future jurisprudence for decades to come. And, now that Congress has shifted most of its lawmaking prerogatives to the judiciary, Judge Jackson’s legal philosophy will also have an outsized impact on shaping the culture as well.

This is why the pursuit of records, facts, and sentencing patterns is so vital – not just to the legal community, but to the country. Thank goodness for senators who investigate these issues fully, rather than choosing to dismiss them lightly.

'Antilynching' Law Could Let Feds Jail You For Crimes You Never Commit,"Touted as an overdue (if duplicative) law that no one could disagree with, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act signed by President Biden last week includes a subtle provision that could boost the Biden administration’s war on wrongthink.

The bill sailed through the U.S. Senate and the House with ease. The tactful naming made the bill radioactive to oppose, which is why 422 congressmen voted in favor while only three opposed.

Rep. Thomas Massie, one of the three who voted against the bill, expressed a handful of concerns, including that there are a limited number of constitutionally specified federal crimes, that lynching is already criminalized, and that “Adding enhanced penalties for ‘hate’ [on top of existing criminal punishments] tends to endanger other liberties such as freedom of speech.”

He also highlighted another potential pitfall of the legislation: “The bill creates another federal crime of ‘conspiracy,’ which I’m concerned could be enforced overbroadly on people who are not perpetrators of a crime.” Here’s the section Massie is referring to:

Whoever conspires to commit any offense under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall, if death or serious bodily injury (as defined in section 2246 of this title) results from the offense, or if the offense includes kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, be imprisoned for not more than 30 years, fined in accordance with this title, or both.

The bill amends the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, passed in 2009, which defines and criminalizes hate crimes. The minimum qualification is an attempt “to cause bodily injury” due to the victim’s race, sexual orientation, nationality, gender, religion, or disability.

Bodily injury can be defined as “physical pain” or “any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary.” Sensibly, the 2009 law requires an attempt at violence to be made, which is a crime itself regardless of prejudiced motives. The new “antilynching” law takes this a step further by criminalizing “conspiracy” to commit certain hate crimes.

I’m sure someone will retort: conspiracy to commit a federal crime is already a federal crime. This is not a universally accepted interpretation of conspiracy law, nor does the law’s language or historical precedent justify such a broad interpretation — hence the ostensible necessity for the new antilynching law. Criminalized conspiracies are those plotting “against the United States” – like the Volkswagen executives who attempted to defraud the Environmental Protection Agency by faking emission results and, more recently, the leader of the Oath Keepers who plead guilty to seditious conspiracy for his part in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot.

So as of last Tuesday, it is illegal to simply “agree” to participate in an act if it falls under the categories highlighted above. One can imagine dark political humor venturing into these categories (a comment such as “I hate so-and-so so much I could kill him,” for example) being interpreted as “conspiring to lynch.”

The key issue here is that intent should not be the sole subject of a court case. The purpose of courts is for a neutral arbiter to determine whether someone’s rights were violated during an encounter between two parties. Conspiracy, if no action is taken in pursuit of it, involves only one party: the conspirators. Therefore, it alone constitutes no crime as it couldn’t have possibly violated someone else’s rights.

With this new law, the U.S. government has further expanded into the realm of policing thought crimes. Ominously, this law comes on the heels of the Department of Homeland Security’s attempt to broaden the “domestic terrorism” category and expand methods for identifying “threats.”

For those unaware, killings attributed to domestic extremists in 2020 and 2021 were each far lower than in the previous five years. Overall there were only 29 such killings in 2021. Despite this, we continue to hear fearmongering from those in power.

FBI Director Christopher Wray went before Congress last year to declare “The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a number of years.” Attorney General Merrick Garland adopted a similar tone, warning “Domestic violent extremists pose an elevated threat in 2021, and in the FBI’s view, the top domestic violent extremist threat we face comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.”

“Domestic violent extremism poses the most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat to our country today,” claimed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last spring. A White House press release added: “The two most lethal elements of today’s domestic terrorism threat are (1) racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race and (2) anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists, such as militia violent extremists.”

It’s a mountain-out-of-a-molehill on par with the “Don’t Say Gay” hysteria. But this one may have far greater consequences down the road as texts, emails, social media posts, and everyday speech are monitored and analyzed by various three-letter agencies to establish the intent of our discourse. The Emmett Till Act may become a key piece in the arsenal for U.S. intelligence agencies’ war on free speech.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/05/new-antilynching-federal-law-could-let-prosecutors-imprison-you-for-a-crime-you-never-committed/,2022-04-05
"In Sacramento Shooting, Newsom’s Soros-Funded Policies Are To Blame","The tragedy doesn’t stop with the six lives lost in a downtown Sacramento shooting last Sunday. What makes this even more painful is that this killing spree could have been prevented.

No, this isn’t referring to stricter gun control measures — California gun laws are already some of the most restrictive in the nation. It was the state of California’s absurd plan to create “safer prisons” that pulled the trigger.

One of the alleged gunmen, Smiley Allen Martin (27), was arrested in 2018 for domestic violence and assault and sentenced to 10 years in prison. In February 2022, Martin was released by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation as part of a plan to reduce the number of inmates in California’s prisons.

By releasing him early, the local government showed they didn’t care about Martin’s violent record. They didn’t care that by releasing him, they were subjecting those around him to his violent nature. They wanted to follow through with their ill-thought-out and hastily delivered plan, no matter the cost. The price ended up being six lives.

The plan to release inmates early was approved by California’s Office of Administrative Law and passed in three weeks as an emergency order. Not only are they recklessly releasing criminals, but they are also freeing them without any sort of parole supervision, whether that be through human accountability or other electronic means.

These “early release credits” are being handed out to inmates of all records, from petty thieves to “violent and repeat felons,” with the latter making up 63,000 of those eligible. Twenty thousand of those were sentenced to life sentences.

According to California gubernatorial candidate Michael Shellenberger, there is more to the story. Many of Newsom’s policies are pushed by organizations funded and supported by leftist billionaire George Soros, who, incidentally, donated $1 million during Newsom’s recall election.

In April 2021, Martin was one of the inmates proposed to be released. Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Danielle wrote to the Board of Parole Hearings asking that Martin remain in prison due to his dangerous record, according to The Sacramento Bee.

Abildgaard voiced her concerns over Martin’s potential release saying, “Martin should not be released as he poses a significant, unreasonable risk of safety to the community.” Despite this, Martin was freed from jail in February 2022.

No surprise that only two months later, Martin was allegedly one of the gunmen who killed six people and injured 12 others. Ignoring how his laughable policies put this gunman on the street, Newsom followed the age-old sentiment and put the blame solely on guns. He tweeted, “We cannot continue to let gun violence be the new normal.”

Unfortunately, this is not the only example of felons being released to kill. In November 2021, Darrell E. Brooks plowed his vehicle through those enjoying a Christmas parade and killed six. He had been released on a $1,000 cash bond days prior.

Gerald Brevard III had been in jail for burglary and assault (among other charges) before he stalked and murdered two homeless men and injured three in New York City and Washington, D.C., in March 2022.

Fox News also reported that felons released on bond in Harris County, Texas, have collectively killed 156 people since 2018. One of those was grandmother of six Rosalie Cook, who was stabbed in a Walgreens parking lot by Randy Lewis in 2020. Lewis had been arrested 67 times and was currently out on “two personal recognizance” bonds when he killed Cook.

There is nothing to keep criminals from breaking the law and hurting others if there are no consequences for their actions. These changes to the prison system send a message loud and clear, and it isn’t a good one.

Freeing criminals before they have served their time only hurts innocent, law-abiding citizens who become defenseless targets. Instead of proposing stricter gun control measures, leftists should be rethinking their plan to let violent criminals roam free with no accountability.

The state of California is determined to make safer prisons, but what about a safer California? Every day Californians will pay the price for the sharp increase of violent criminals on the streets, and this seems to be nothing but a sunk cost to Newsom.

"If Democrats Cared About Ending Crime, They Would Punish Criminals","President Joe Biden told Americans on Monday that regulating firearms is the best way to combat rising violent crime in U.S. cities, but taking away the gun rights of law-abiding Americans doesn’t rein in criminals, especially those let off the hook by soft-on crime progressives.

Violent crime, often perpetrated using firearms, is on the rise in many American cities. In 2021 alone, at least 14 Democrat-controlled urban hubs reported all-time high homicide records.

Even though this historic crime streak is even plaguing cities with strict gun laws, the Biden administration wants gun parts, such as frames and receivers, to be serialized and regulated as regular firearms so they can be traced. This would require customers who purchase gun kits from retailers to undergo a background check like they would if they were buying an already-assembled firearm.

“All of a sudden, it’s no longer a ghost. It has a return address. It’s going to help save lives, reduce crime, and get more criminals off the streets,” Biden said.

What Biden failed to mention in his lie-riddled gun-control speech is that build-your-own guns make up a remarkably small portion of the firearms used to commit crimes in America. To put it in perspective, New York City police seized more than 6,000 illegal guns in 2021. Only about 200 of them did not have serial numbers.

New polling suggests that 61 percent of voters are not pleased with Biden’s handling of crime, so now the White House is clearly trying to take action to combat this negative perception with random rules ostensibly to curb gun violence. Chances are, however, any rules regulating so-called “ghost guns” won’t have the effect on crime that Biden claims they would.

Media outlets often frame the increase in guns without serial numbers as a big problem for crime-plagued cities, but the fact is that a large percentage of these criminals obtained their guns illegally.

A 2019 Department of Justice survey of imprisoned criminals found that at least 43 percent of offenders obtained their firearms via the black market. Only 10 percent made a purchase from a federally licensed firearms store, which is where Biden’s new rules would be enforced. In other words, Biden’s new gun rules won’t change the crime rates because his policies target purchasers who buy from gun retailers, not the black market.

Instead of trampling on the Second Amendment to supposedly combat rising crime, Biden should encourage members of his party and progressive judicial activists to toughen up on the offenders who use guns to facilitate illicit activity.

Earlier this year, California’s soft-on-crime Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation released from prison Smiley Allen Martin, one of the gunmen accused of going on a shooting spree in downtown Sacramento last week. Martin was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 for domestic violence and assault. If not for his early release under the state’s prison capacity reduction plan, Martin would still be locked up.

Prosecuting and locking up offenders is pivotal in combatting crime, but it’s not something Biden or Democrats are focused on promoting.

In fact, for most of the last month, the White House has actively defended progressive criminal reform policies and people such as Biden’s Supreme Court pick Ketanji Brown Jackson who are guilty of using them to let dangerous offenders off the hook.

Taking away the gun rights of law-abiding Americans doesn’t stop dangerous criminals from obtaining firearms and committing crimes. Instead of trying to legislate crime off the streets, Biden and Democrats should focus on prosecuting and punishing offenders to the full extent of the law.

"As Crime Grows, Biden’s Radical War On Self-Defense Is Alienating Voters","President Joe Biden’s unpopular gun control moves are doing little to appease his gun control donor class. Worse, those same moves are distancing him from voters that clearly see crime as a central issue and gun ownership as a right to be protected.

Among the unpopular policy positions dragging down his presidency is his myopic focus on gun control instead of crime control. The Biden White House has pursued the most far-reaching and radical gun control agenda of any president, previously naming a gun control lobbyist to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) whose nomination was defeated when not even all Senate Democrats could support the nominee.

Biden has since nominated Steve Dettelbach, who once campaigned for public office on a gun control platform. President Biden is also circumventing Congress’s authority to write laws by issuing an administrative rule to redefine frames and receivers and ban arm braces on AR-style pistols and instituting a top-down policy of “zero tolerance” inspections that would revoke licenses of firearm retailers instead of working with small business owners to correct minor clerical errors.

On top of that, President Biden is facing two additional factors not working in his favor on gun control and lawful gun ownership. Gun control groups are livid that President Biden hasn’t delivered their goal of disarming the American population. He was rated just a “D+” by gun control groups exasperated that he hasn’t ruled like a dictator to unilaterally ban entire classes of firearms and delivered a laundry list of gun control “must-haves,” including a Cabinet-adjacent position that’s outside of Senate confirmation to push even more gun control policies.

Voters Are Worried About Criminals, Not Legal Gun Owners

At the same time, many voters aren’t behind Biden’s radical gun control agenda. Support for gun control is dropping. After high-profile criminal incidents that captured the news cycles, including the New York City subway attack and the gang-related murders in Sacramento, Calif., voters are seeing that gun control isn’t the pressing issue. Crime is.

The Biden administration is attempting to “bait-and-switch” public opinion to ignore inaction on curbing crime and lay the blame on lawful gun owners. The president has repeatedly used the bully pulpit to demand everything from universal background checks (which would require every law-abiding gun owner to be listed on a government watchlist) to the repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which prevents frivolous lawsuits against the firearm industry for the actions of criminals.

He repeats claims that have been debunked time and again, including that Americans couldn’t buy a cannon when the Bill of Rights was enacted. In fact, it is perfectly legal for an individual to own a cannon today.

President Biden isn’t just facing a public that’s more concerned about crime than cracking down on gun owners. He’s also facing an electorate that abandoned him on his push to relegate lawful gun ownership to the fringe.

Gun Owners Are Growing and Diversifying

More than 21 million background checks were conducted for the sale of a firearm in 2020, the year Biden was elected. Another 18.5 million were tallied in 2021. Among those gun buyers were nearly 14 million between 2020 and 2021 who purchased a firearm for the first time.

Those gun owners are increasingly from many parts of America, with more African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans taking up lawful gun ownership. Women gun owners are increasingly a larger force in firearm purchasers, making up one of the fastest-growing demographics of gun owners.

Simple election math indicates these are growing gun-owning demographic groups that don’t easily overlay traditional Republican voters. That means the gun-owning tent is getting bigger and makes the path to winning a White House election more complicated than parroting the talking points fed by special interest gun control groups.

That’s got some analysts warning Democrats – including President Biden – to back off of their gun control push. Richard Feldman, president of the Independent Firearm Owners Association, wrote in an op-ed saying the substantial increases of women and minority gun owners over the past two years are changing the calculus. These are core Democrat voting blocks.

More troubling for Democrats is that, even a few years ago, 48 percent of self-identified independents said they owned or lived with someone who owned a gun. That swayable middle is the crown jewel in any election.

Voting Blocks Are Already Shifting

According to Feldman, last year’s off-cycle elections in New Jersey and Virginia are telling. New Jersey’s Republican state Sen. Ed Durr defeated long-serving Democrat state Senate President Steve Sweeney by 2,300 votes in deep-blue New Jersey. Durr initiated his campaign because he couldn’t obtain a concealed-carry permit.

While critical race theory in education was the hottest-button issue in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, former Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe campaigned on expanding gun control in the Commonwealth, including an outright ban on AR-15s. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vowed to protect gun rights. Feldman pointed out that a 1 percent shift in the voter turnout would mean McAuliffe would be governor today.

Virginia’s Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears embodied the shift in voting blocks that helped hand victory to the Republican ticket. She’s African-American and her campaign photos included some of her holding her AR-15. Sears told The New York Times “I look like the strategy” for future elections.

That means rethinking where certain demographics fall in the political spectrum. Attitudes are shifting, and new gun owners of all backgrounds are voting with their wallets when it comes to their values of lawful firearm ownership.

Subway Violence Shows Ills Of 'Social Justice' Policing,"Image Credit Pom'/Flickr

The deterioration of New York City’s subway system shows us what happens when we confuse “social justice” for justice.

Last week, I got off the L at Bedford Avenue to a commotion. It’s not unusual in New York City to disembark the subway to the sounds of a street musician or a scuffle, but this was different, more visceral. These were shouts of real distress.

They came from a homeless man sitting on the lip of the platform, legs hanging tentatively over the edge. He grasped the ledge with one hand and his chest with the other, howling as he leaned toward the tracks to check for the oncoming train. A commuter passing by reached out his hand to help.

“No, don’t touch me!” warned the homeless man, recoiling from touch, leaning further over the edge.

“Hey, don’t do this,” the commuter implored. I took out my phone to dial 911 as people pushed hurriedly toward the exits, busy with their daily lives while the homeless man considered the end of his.

I could hardly blame them, whether it was fear propelling them up the stairs or just plain desensitization. By New York standards, this was hardly a notable instance. The veins of the country’s most populous city have become increasingly bloody amid layers of social “reforms” that lead to crimes going unpunished and the mentally ill loosed on the streets.

New York City Is Increasingly Dangerous

In 2021, a man deemed the “A-train ripper” went on a 14-hour stabbing spree, killing two and injuring two more. In January, a young woman died after she was pushed onto the tracks at Times Square. Two people were bludgeoned with hammers in separate 2022 attacks, and in March, a man was released by a judge after smearing feces in the face of a commuter.

And then April 12, 2022. Frank James threw two smoke grenades and opened fire on a train full of people entering the 36th Street station in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Twenty-nine people were injured, including 10 from gunfire.



Stabbings, shootings, suicides, attempted rapes in broad daylight — the list goes on and on. It’s clear that social justice policing is making our city less hospitable, allowing people to roam the subway when they are in need of serious mental help.

Transit crime in New York City is up nearly 60 percent since last year. The staggering statistics reinforce public perception, which only makes the problem worse. As The Atlantic points out, fear of crime begets low ridership, and causes more crime.

Causes of the Crime Spike

Infographics are circulating on social media, offering various explanations for the shooting and crime spike. They place blame at the feet of the New York Police Department (NYPD), calling it a “jobs program,” “political organization,” and an “abject failure.” Others have expressed frustration about Mayor Eric Adams’ recent sweeps of homeless people from subways and encampments, calling it “war,” and stating that he’s “made sadism New York’s official policy.”

I disagree. On the contrary, this crime surge is the result of policymaking by activists, who prioritize “social justice” over justice.

That much is obvious from a cursory glance at James’ rap sheet, which includes nine arrests in New York state for criminal sex acts and theft of service, among others. James was arrested in New Jersey an additional three times for crimes including terrorist threats.

James, a prolific criminal and eminent threat, was allowed to walk free as a direct result of criminal justice reform catalyzed by recent social justice initiatives. Bail reform, or the recent prohibition of cash bail for most misdemeanors and non-violent felonies, is perhaps the most egregious.

Journalist Josh Hammer cites supporting statistics for Newsweek: A 2018 Department of Justice report revealed that 83 percent of prisoners released without bail across a sample size of 30 states were re-arrested at least one time over the next 9 years, with 44 percent of those arrests happening in their first year post-release.

What’s concerning is not just the rate of recidivism, but the nature of the crimes committed: 77 percent of drug offenders released were re-arrested on non-drug-related charges, and 34 percent of these arrests were for violent crime.

‘Criminal Justice Reform’ Making Things Worse

And then there are the policies instituted by soft-on-crime District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who instructed prosecutors to downgrade select felonies (such as armed robbery) to misdemeanors, and not to prosecute people for resisting arrest.

The policy was allegedly intended to decriminalize poverty and alleviate racial tensions. But what was empathetic in theory has been harmful in practice. The effects of this policy change have been devastating for the minority communities it was enacted to protect. In 2022, felony assaults have risen by 21 percent, robbery by 48 percent, and grand larceny by 55 percent.

As for the New York Police Department, Mayor Adams faces an uphill battle to rebuild a system wracked by former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s billion dollar cut to the police’s budget and an uptick in police deaths in the line of duty, which reached a 20-year high in January.

The police are also fighting public perception, as evidenced by a study conducted by the Manhattan Institute. “In surveys, many people say that they think American cops kill 1,000 unarmed black men every year, but the real number averages out to more like 20,” says fellow Robert VerBruggen, “and it’s even lower than that if you just look at suspects who weren’t attacking someone when they were shot.”

Black Lives Matter Shows Contempt for Black Lives

Where do these misconceptions and the ideological underpinnings for these anti-cop, soft-on-crime policies come from? Commentators point to organizations like Black Lives Matter, whose damaging ideas have captivated the hearts and minds of individuals, corporations, and government officials alike.

BLM has made a fortune promoting controversial ideologies like critical race theory, and cultivating racial resentment and division in the name of social justice. When taken to their logical end, these ideas motivate dangerous people like James, who posted racist rants on YouTube and tweeted, “oh black Jesus, please kill all the whiteys.”

The mainstream media is on board with the grift. A Washington Free Beacon study of hundreds of articles from major papers over a span of two years uncovered a startling skew in coverage: white offenders’ race was mentioned in 1 of 4 articles, compared with 1 in 17 articles about a black offender and 1 in 33 articles about a Hispanic offender.

For those desiring justice, or the fair, equal, and impartial treatment of all races under the law, this should disturb you. Until we’re allowed honest conversations about crime, race relations, and data, our situation will worsen. Our city, our subways, will continue to deteriorate.

The homeless man didn’t jump. After several harrowing minutes, he was consoled and helped to his feet. The lone bystander who stopped at the sound of his howls, without regard for his own time or safety, held him until police arrived.

Allowing people who are a danger to others and to themselves to walk free is suicidal. Adams must seize the moment to hold his city in check and fight for the justice that needs no qualifier.

How Democrats' Culture War Is Destroying Their Ability To Govern,"New York Times columnist Charles Blow recently claimed to be “truly shocked” by a poll showing President Biden with a 33 percent approval rating. I was shocked, too — how could his approval rating be that high?

Blow, of course, is surprised at Biden’s unpopularity, and worried that the Democrats are stumbling into a bloodbath in the November midterms. Blow is paid to understand and explain politics and culture to his readers. That he is surprised reveals a lot about the bubble he is in. And his meandering analysis of Democrats’ problems illustrates how the ideology making Democrats unpopular is also preventing them from understanding why they are unpopular.

Blow initially blames Biden — for being too much of a “decent man … sober and straightforward” rather than a “showman.” This is a ludicrous assessment of a politician, who, until age caught up with his tongue, was one of D.C.’s preeminent bloviators. Nonetheless, Blow’s ordinary partisan delusion is less interesting than the ideological blind spots revealed when he turns to genuine sources of Biden’s unpopularity, such as “the fear of crime and the pinch of inflation” and that “Republicans are playing heavily into culture war issues.”

Class and Culture Wars Merge

Although Blow does not seem to realize it, these issues combine to reinforce voters’ disapproval of Biden. Democratic failures on bread and butter issues such as crime and inflation are related to the culture-war radicalism that has captured their party.

Twitter, not the blue-collar union hall, is now the heart of the Democratic Party, which is controlled by the educated, urban professional-managerial class, epitomized by woke, union-busting CEOs. This faction has merged the class and culture wars — championing cultural radicalism, entrenching its own economic interests, and neglecting the common good.

The Democrats are the party of wealthy diversity consultants lecturing hourly workers about white privilege and cis-heteropatriarchy while inflation eats away at wages and investment firms buy up homes in the hope of making America a nation of permanent renters. The governing priorities of those running the Democratic Party are sending government money to their clients (from teachers unions to Planned Parenthood) and waging culture war.

Dems Are Fanatical Culture Warriors

And they are fanatical culture warriors. Consider Blow’s complaint that the GOP is “challenging the teaching of Black history and the history of white supremacy in schools, as well as restricting discussions of L.G.B.T. issues and campaigning against trans women and girls competing in sports with other women and girls.” He adds that “Republicans are using white parental fear, particularly the fears of white moms.”

This litany of whines highlights the bubble Blow and his audience at The New York Times are in. Ordinary Americans know the difference between teaching history and teaching poisonous ideology derived from critical race theory. Americans understand that it is unjust for males to compete in women’s sports, and that it is perverse to teach young children about sex and gender ideology. They are angry when educators encourage children to transition, and outraged when they hide it from parents.

Voters have also noticed that the cultural left never stops where it says it will. We were assured that the LGBT movement was about tolerance for consenting adult relationships; now it is about transgender toddlers, child drag queens, and men in girls’ locker rooms. We are also now told that being anti-racist somehow means judging people based on the color of their skin. Blow and other bubbled liberals may be okay with mastectomies for confused teenage girls, but most Americans are not.

This cultural radicalism erodes Democrats’ ability to govern competently. Sometimes this is the result of neglecting the basic tasks of government in order to prioritize boutique cultural issues, other times it is a direct consequence of ideology, as exemplified in the crime wave resulting from woke prosecutors and defunding the police.

Cushioned from Consequences

In either case, wokeness is an ideology for those who are cushioned from its consequences. Indeed, wokeness is primarily a phenomenon of the college-educated, and especially the well-off; it is a niche, luxury political philosophy that thrives among the privileged and in the shelter of academia.

But though it is often a political liability, there are ways it serves the interests of its adherents. In particular, woke ideology legitimates the rule of the woke over the non-woke, and justifies economic exploitation and socio-political repression.

Wokeness claims to reveal the systems of unjust oppression that permeate society; it focuses on race, sex, and gender, and relegates economic class to a second-tier concern. This allows many of the privileged and powerful to claim to be righteous allies of the oppressed without having to sacrifice economic or social power or position. Indeed, many can claim to be oppressed themselves. This is why wokeness tends to focus on BIPoC and LGBT representation in boardrooms and Ivy League campuses, rather than helping the working class.

The Wicked Working Class

Thus, it is to be expected that woke discourse often suggests that the working class (especially working-class whites) have it coming for their sins of racism, sexism, transphobia, and so on — the wicked deserve punishment, not sympathy. This is why pundits such as Blow are so quick to accuse dissenters of racism and bigotry. And it is why the woke left supports oligarchic power in pursuit of its aims, and eagerly uses economic, technological, and cultural power to suppress dissent.

This is why professors are having to submit woke loyalty oaths in the form of diversity statements, and why mandatory diversity, equity, and inclusion training has become the norm in the corporate world. This is why the left is eager to use social media censorship to suppress “misinformation” — which in many cases is truth that is inconvenient to the regime (e.g., the Hunter Biden laptop story).

It is also why the left cannot understand its own failures. They have isolated themselves in a bubble that has drifted so far from reality and the concerns of normal voters that even electoral disaster may not bring them back to Earth. Cocooned in privilege and ideology, they think Biden is doing just fine. But most Americans have had enough of a government that is more committed to transitioning children than to controlling crime and inflation.

"Burned By Soft-On-Crime DA, San Franciscans Are Headed For A Recall","The year 2022 may go down as one of the most transformative years in San Francisco’s history. After firing three leftist school board members with an overwhelming majority in a recall election in February, Asian Americans in San Francisco, fed up with rising violent crimes in the city, have become the driving force to recall the city’s woke District Attorney Chesa Boudin on June 7.

Boudin was elected district attorney of San Francisco in November 2019. According to a New York Post profile, Boudin’s parents, David Gilbert and Kathy Boudin, were “members of the domestic-terror group Weather Underground.” They were involved in the infamous 1981 Brink’s robbery case, in which two police and one guard were murdered. Boudin’s parents were arrested and served lengthy jail time.

Only 14 months old at the time of his parents’ arrest, Boudin was reportedly raised by leaders of the Weather Underground. Not surprisingly, Boudin’s political allegiance is on the far left. According to The New York Post, Boudin “served as a translator for late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,” and his campaign for DA of San Francisco won the support of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. During his campaign, Boudin promised to reduce incarceration rates, end cash bail, and focus more on police misconduct and racial bias.

The 2019 race to become DA of San Francisco was tight, and votes from Asian Americans reportedly were crucial to Boudin’s eventual victory. Many of his Asian supporters are experiencing buyer’s remorse two years later, mainly due to violent crimes against Asians having increased more than 560 percent in 2021 compared to 2020.

Reports of Asians being pushed, kicked, robbed, or even murdered when walking out of a bank, strolling down the street, or sleeping at home at night have made many feel unsafe. Asian-owned businesses in Chinatown have been struggling with frequent robbery and vandalism. Often, these heinous crimes were committed by repeat offenders whom Boudin set free.

Repeat Offenders Kill Again After Release

Hanako Abe’s tragic death was a perfect example. On last New Year’s Eve in downtown San Francisco, 27-year-old Abe and 60-year-old Elizabeth Platt were killed by Troy McAlister, who was trying to get away after committing a robbery when he hit and killed both women. San Francisco-based writer Susan Reynolds found out that McAlister has a 25-year criminal record. Yet Boudin brokered a deal and let McAlister go on parole in March 2020.

Reynolds’ research shows that since being paroled, McAlister “had been arrested five times for crimes, including burglary, possession of burglary tools, vehicle theft, possession of the stolen property, possession of narcotics for sale, possession of suspected methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, and, of course, parole violations.” But thanks to Boudin’s soft-on-crime approach, McAlister “served a combined 11 days in jail” for those five arrests.

Believing their daughter’s tragic death was preventable, Abe’s parents filed a lawsuit against San Francisco and Boudin. Abe’s mother said in an interview that “San Francisco needs to change so that Hanako’s death is not wasted … I don’t understand why criminals are being protected in San Francisco. Inhumane but progressive? Is anyone responsible for Hanako’s death?”

Sadly, according to a Twitter thread from the Recall Chesa Boudin campaign, Hanako was only one of many victims killed by career criminals Boudin set free. It seems that Boudin is more sympathetic to the perpetrators who committed those monstrous crimes than the victims of the crime.

The family of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapkadee, who was violently pushed and killed by Antoine Watson in January 2021, was outraged after Boudin excused Watson as having “some sort of temper tantrum” when he committed the shocking crime. Boudin so far has refused to either retract his words or offer any public apology to Ratanapkadee’s family.

Robber’s 15th Robbery

Besides rising violent crimes, San Francisco residents are sick and tired of widespread drug problems and property thefts. During the last Christmas shopping season, the open smash-and-grab robberies of luxury stores in downtown San Francisco shocked the nation. Small businesses have been victims of such out-of-control robberies under Boudin’s watch all too often.

Even as Boudin is fighting to keep his job, he continues to be lenient on these career criminals. Early this week, local ABC news reported that Nathan Picco, a serial burglar who “had been convicted of 15 burglaries and theft-related felonies from 2002 and 2019,” has seen most of his charges dismissed by Boudin’s office.

In a statement, Boudin’s office explained that “the plea deal’s agreed-upon sentence was that Mr. Picco receive credit for the days he spent on jail on this case, take part in a residential treatment program, and be placed on two years’ probation.” Of course, Boudin’s lenience has only emboldened Picco to commit burglary against seven businesses in eight months last year, a clear violation of both the law and his probation agreement.

But according to Boudin’s office, Picco “will be issued stay-away orders, orders for restitution for all the burglaries, and be placed on electronic monitoring once he is placed in the [residential treatment] program.” Only “if he fails to comply with any of the terms of his release, Picco faces up to five years and eight months in county jail.” In other words, the DA’s office will continue to treat career criminals such as Picco with kid gloves till he does something really, really bad next time. Property owners be damned.

Boudin Least Popular with Asians

Polling suggests Boudin is unlikely to keep his job because most of San Francisco’s liberal residents support his recall, and Asian voters are especially unhappy with Boudin’s job performance. The latest San Francisco Standard Voter Poll shows that 67 percent of Asian voters support the recall, compared to “52% of Hispanic voters, 51% of white voters, and 34% of Black voters.”

Garry Tan, a San Francisco-based venture capitalist and son of Chinese immigrants who supported the school board recall, is now backing the campaign to recall Boudin. Tan told me he is concerned about “the future of SF and the entire community and economy.” He didn’t believe Boudin “is doing his best to protect people and ensure those who commit violent crimes are held accountable for victimizing the poor, the disadvantaged and the general public.”

In a Twitter thread, Kit Lam, an immigrant from Hong Kong, listed the rising crimes, drug overdose crisis, and homeless problems as reasons for Boudin’s recall. The safety issue hit close to home for Lam. He told me his working-class neighbors were victims of property theft. But Boudin’s office refused to prosecute the thief. They were Boudin’s supporters two years ago. But they are ready to see Boudin go in June. Lam said, “We need to recall him [Boudin] now because the public has NO confidence in the DA office.”

Most other Asian voters seem to share Tan and Lam’s concerns, and are holding Boudin accountable for the city’s crime surge and deterioration of its quality of life.

Asian voters’ activism was crucial for the landslide victory of the school board recall election in February, and the success has motivated many Asian voters to become more politically active. Today, Lam relies on skills he honed during the earlier recall to win support for the recall Boudin campaign. He has been busy going on Chinese radio shows, and calling and texting people he knows to urge them to vote yes on Proposition H (the ballot measure to recall Boudin).

Through both the school board recall campaign and the DA recall campaign, San Francisco’s Asian voters have demonstrated that they will hold Democrats accountable for destructive policies. Through their participation in the democratic process, Asian Americans have become the driving force for bringing positive change to their beloved city. Even more impressive is that they are succeeding in the most leftist city in America.

Data Shows White Supremacists Are Not The Most Likely Mass Murderers,"In his Buffalo, New York speech last week following a mass shooting, President Biden showed he still has only two things on his mind regarding crime: guns and white supremacists.

No one can defend white supremacists. But with violent crime soaring and this latest attack in Buffalo, people want something done. Yet Biden’s agenda won’t make people safer.

“Look, we’ve seen the mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; El Paso, Texas; in Pittsburgh. Last year in Atlanta. This week in Dallas, Texas, and now in Buffalo. In Buffalo, New York,” Biden said. “White supremacy is a poison. It’s a poison. It really is. Running through our body politic. And it’s been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more. I mean, no more.”

Of the 82 mass public shootings from January 1998 to May 2021, 9 percent have known or alleged ties to white supremacists, neo-Nazis, or anti-immigrant views. Many of the anti-immigrant attackers, such as the Buffalo murderer, hold decidedly environmentalist views that are more in line with the Democrat agenda.

Other groups commit mass public shootings disproportionately more than whites do. While non-Middle Eastern whites make up about 64 percent of the population, they make up 58 percent of the mass public shooters. Another 9 percent are carried out by people of Middle Eastern origin, who make up only 0.4 percent of the country’s population. That makes Middle Easterners the most likely ethnic or racial group to carry out mass public shootings.

Blacks, Asians, and American Indians also commit these attacks at a slightly higher rate than their share of the population. Hispanics commit them at much lower rates (11 percent lower) than their share of the population.

Seventy-one percent of mass public shooters have no identifiable political views. But you would never know this from watching TV police dramas or listening to Biden’s constant claim that white supremacists pose the biggest threat of domestic terrorism.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claimed in testimony in April that white supremacy is the top terrorism-related threat to the homeland. But when pressed, Mayorkas couldn’t name a single white supremacy case that his department referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution.

White supremacists with guns are not the threat that our government would have us believe. It’s not just that white supremacy is rare. So too are gun crimes. The number of gun crimes has been falling dramatically, and they now make up less than 8 percent of violent crimes in America. Yet we constantly hear the opposite from politicians who support gun restrictions.

“We can keep assault weapons off our streets. We’ve done it before. I did it when I passed the crime bill last time, and violence went down, shootings went down,” Biden falsely claimed in Buffalo. “We can’t prevent people from being radicalized to violence, but we can address the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism. We just need to have the courage to do that, to stand up.”

Biden’s focus on guns, and particularly assault weapons, is misplaced. Last Tuesday, Biden again bragged about how wonderful his 1994 assault weapon ban was in stopping mass public shootings, but even studies paid for by the Clinton administration couldn’t find evidence of its effectiveness.

If the federal assault weapons ban really drove the changes in the rate of mass public shootings, attacks with assault weapons should have become less common during the ban. Then they should have become more common, at least as a share of total shootings, after the ban ended in 2004.

But that isn’t what happened. Comparing the ten years before 1994 to the ten years after, we find that the percentage of mass public shootings with assault weapons rose slightly when the ban was in effect (going from 22.2 percent to 23.5 percent) and then fell in the ten years after the ban ended (23.5 percent to 18.2 percent).

Biden’s “guns first” approach ignores a basic fact: More than 92 percent of violent crimes in America do not involve firearms. In addition, although Biden blames guns for the increase in violent crime, the latest data show that gun crimes fell dramatically.

A new McLaughlin and Associates survey of 1,000 likely voters from April 20 to 26th for the Crime Prevention Research Center shows how misinformed people are. People across the country, of all races and incomes, have wildly inaccurate beliefs about how frequently violent crime involves guns.

The average likely American voter is way off, thinking that more than 46 percent of violent crimes involve guns. The people who had the most inaccurate views that the rate of violent crime with guns was the highest were the ones who most strongly supported gun control.

It might not be easy to accept, but based on the evidence, focusing solely on guns and white supremacy isn’t a wise use of resources.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/23/data-shows-white-supremacists-are-not-the-most-likely-mass-murderers/,2022-05-23
You Can Tell Democrats' Gun-Control Goals Based On Which Tragedy They Exploit,"Democrats are silent after more than 30 people lost their lives this weekend to violent crime waves that continually sweep through the nation’s cities.

Why hasn’t President Joe Biden, who recently visited Uvalde, Texas, after 19 children and two adults died in a school shooting, tweeted something or planned trips to Nebraska, Illinois, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania, where violence and shootings took the lives of dozens of people including children? Why hasn’t Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke executed another political stunt at a local press conference somewhere to call attention to a rise in domestic altercations that escalate into shootings? Mostly because none of the violence was politically advantageous for them.

The violence that took the lives of dozens of Americans over Memorial Day weekend either did not involve firearms such as AR-15s, which the left has openly admitted they want to confiscate, or occurred under the wrong conditions for grandstanding. Democrats pick and choose which tragedies to milk for their anti-gun agenda based on how much political leverage firearm-related deaths grant them.

In the case of Uvalde and every other school shooting, Democrats see the deaths of children to erroneously labeled “assault rifles” as an opportunity to move their gun-control agenda forward. They use families’ mourning to push do-somethingism on the American public and beg for “compromise” from their congressional peers.

As a result, squishy Republicans cede key ground in the Second Amendment preservation fight. Instead of hosting a constructive debate on the root causes of school shootings perpetrated by young males, they let their Democrat colleagues steamroll them into submission to pass legislation that only restricts law-abiding citizens’ right to buy and use guns.

This selective virtue-signaling is condemnable considering the record crime most U.S. cities have faced over the last two years. Where were the Twitter warrior AOCs and Sen. Chris Murphys of the world when urban crime and violence skyrocketed in 2020? They were cheering on, or at least caving to, the rioters who looted and set fire to government buildings during the summer of rage. They didn’t care that dozens of people died as of result of the “mostly peaceful protests” that caused an estimated $2 billion in damages.

It’s the same reason Biden avoided visiting Waukesha after a black man with a well-documented vengeance against white people plowed through a crowd of them at a Christmas parade with his vehicle. Sixty-two people left that day with injuries and six died, but all the president could muster was a small mention of the “horrific act of violence” during his presidential remarks on Covid-19 and the economy.

And it’s the same reason why corporate media largely ignores any stories detailing how good guys with guns prevent bad guys from hurting others.

Just last week, a West Virginia woman shot and killed a man who began firing his illegally obtained AR-15 at a crowd. Local officials acknowledged that her quick thinking and courage saved many lives, but the left will ignore it because it hurts their case to disarm Americans.

Democrats speak out against violence only when it’s useful for them and their anti-gun agenda. Their sadness about the lives lost in Uvalde might be authentic, but their outrage that Americans are losing lives to crime is not equally applied.

It's Past Time To Get A Gun And Prepare For Self-Defense,"Democrats’ rhetoric on guns doesn’t match reality. The “common sense gun control” policies they say they want would just tinker around the edges of the problem of gun violence in general, and not stop mass shootings in particular. Even giving a generous benefit of the doubt to proposals such as an “assault weapons ban” and “closing the gun show loophole,” they would at best marginally reduce the number of mass shootings and their casualties.

For all of their rhetorical Sturm und Drang, such as accusations that Republicans have children’s blood on their hands, Democrats’ proposals would do little to nothing to stop, or even slow down, most mass murderers. Thus, unless they are stupid or faking their moral outrage, the left’s actual gun control agenda is much more radical than they usually claim.

They will use whatever outrage they can gin up to take what they can get now, then push for more. They are not, of course, the only political movement to employ this sort of incremental approach, but they are especially dishonest about it.

Charles Blow of the New York Times recently took the gun control movement to task for this duplicity, along the way admitting what we all know, which is that Democrat efforts to sound moderate on guns are lies. He acknowledges that what they (and he) want is “a nonstop parade of laws, with new ones passed as they are deemed necessary, ad infinitum.”

So yes, they’re coming for your guns. Fortunately, they will likely fail because Americans know we cannot trust the left to protect our families and communities.

Democrats Encouraged Every Policy That Corrupted Our Culture

Gun control is all about displacement. It seeks to scapegoat rural conservatives for the violence that is overwhelmingly a problem of Democratic-supporting urban areas. As Kevin Williamson recently observed:

The gun-control debate is first and foremost a culture-war issue for Democrats. There is a great deal of violent crime in the United States, and that crime is concentrated in big cities over which Democrats enjoy an effective monopoly of political power. The people who commit most of the murders in the United States — and the people who most often die in those murders — check a lot of Democratic-voter demographic boxes.

Gun control is also about blaming the disorder, violence, and nihilism of American life on guns, rather than on a corrupt culture. Having encouraged almost every policy and cultural change that has made America less virtuous and more violent, the left has no idea how to make America peaceful, other than piling more restrictions on guns. Violent crime thrives in Democratic-run cities, and the seeds of nihilistic terrorism perpetrated by mass shooters are most commonly cultivated in the soil of family and social decay.

It is the left that is letting violent criminals out on low, or no, bail. It is the left that excused and even cheered the riots of 2020. It is the left that refuses to secure our borders as lethal rivers of drugs flow into our communities. It is the left that rejoices in the destruction of the traditional family, even as family breakdown leads to more children being poor and abused, and as fatherless boys turn to crime.

It is the left that has torn down the moral wisdom of the ages, and is now trying to build a new morality out of half-baked race and gender theories rooted in third-hand Marxism. It is the left that is more interested in teaching children about gender than geometry.

Vote GOP and Get a Gun

The obvious political response to this deliberate cultural and social destruction is to vote Republican, warts and all. Parents and working families of all races are indeed fleeing the Democratic Party, which has been captured by leftist ideologues.

The next practical personal response to rising crime and cultural disintegration is to prepare to protect yourself, your family, and your community. The 2020 riots sold a lot of guns to normal people who realized their government might not protect them. And many gun owners decided to become dedicated to training for the same reason.

The obvious step after that is to organize. It is possible, even likely, that we are going to see continued increases in both general crime and targeted political violence. Democrats have shown themselves unwilling or unable to restrain crime in general, and the 2020 carnage showed that Democratic leaders will permit rioting left-wing paramilitary groups to destroy neighborhoods and rule cities at night. One need only compare the aggressive prosecutions of those involved in the Capitol riot to the lenient catch-and-release treatment of Antifa thugs to see how the left uses the power of the state to punish its enemies and reward its friends.

Furthermore, the response to the impending Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has shown that Democrats are happy to sic mobs on their enemies, from Supreme Court justices to churches to crisis pregnancy centers. In response, conservatives should talk with friends and neighbors they can trust about how they might protect each other. Churches, I am sorry to have to say, need to step up their security plans. So do schools, crisis pregnancy centers, and other Christian ministries.

The more the left allows and encourages crime and social disintegration, the more the rest of us must prepare to defend ourselves, our families, and our communities.

3 Takeaways From Recall Of San Francisco's Far-Left DA Chesa Boudin,"On Tuesday, San Francisco’s largely liberal residents successfully recalled their woke district attorney, Chesa Boudin. The majority of San Franciscans held Boudin accountable for the city’s skyrocketing crimes and the deterioration of the quality of life. The recall’s success has significant implications for San Francisco and the rest of the country.

1. Wokeness Gone Too Far, Even For Democrat Voters

Since elected San Francisco’s DA in November 2019, Boudin has become the standard-bearer of the so-called progressive prosecution movement, which includes Los Angeles County DA George Gascón (he previously served as San Francisco’s DA), Chicago Cook County DA Kim Foxx, Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner, and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg.

These progressive prosecutors implemented radial policies in the name of criminal justice reform, including under-prosecuting or not prosecuting some criminals, not trying juveniles who committed violent crimes as adults and eliminating cash bailouts. They have prioritized the needs and welfare of the criminals over that of the victims and the wider society. Consequently, crime rates in these cities have spiked, and perpetrators with long criminal histories continue to roam around cities and terrorize residents and businesses freely.

Take San Francisco as an example. The city today has one of the highest crime rates in America, and it is more dangerous than 97 percent of the communities in California. During the last Christmas shopping season, the open smash-and-grab robberies of luxury stores in downtown San Francisco shocked the nation.

Many San Franciscans reached a breaking point when Troy McAlister, who has a 25-year criminal history, hit and killed two women in the city on New Year’s Eve. Outraged, San Franciscans believed these women would have lived had Boudin sent McAlister to jail rather than let him go on parole in March 2020.

Besides rising crime rates, people are concerned about the city’s widespread drug problem. There were 621 drug overdose deaths last year, more than the city’s covid-19 death toll. Yet, San Francisco Standard reported that Boudin had convicted no one for dealing the deadly opioid in 2021. Instead, he secured “just three convictions for ‘possession with intent to sell’ drugs: two for methamphetamine and one for a case including heroin and cocaine.” Since many drug dealers in San Francisco are foreign nationals, Boudin chose not to prosecute so they wouldn’t have to face deportation.

The low conviction rate of drug dealing and other lenient policies implemented by the city’s Democrat leadership have attracted drug users and drug dealers from all over the country to San Francisco. The city has more drug users than high school students. Residents do not feel safe walking downtown because there are used needles everywhere and open drug dealing for all to see. The drug problem has also worsened other issues in the city, i.e., the increase in the homeless population.

Boudin’s recall signals that his soft-on-crime policies have gone too far even for most Democrat voters. Kit Lam, a volunteer for the recall campaign, said the victory of the recall showed that “Extremism has no place in San Francisco.” One recall supporter named Garry Tan told me that voters expect elected officials “to faithfully perform the very basic functions of their offices. This public duty should always trump ideological crusades and personal political agendas.”

Boudin’s recall put progressive prosecutors who have implemented similar policies on notice. An effort to recall Los Angeles DA George Gascon is already underway because many Los Angeles voters blamed Gason for rising crime rates in their city. If other progressive prosecutors don’t abandon their radical policies, they may have to face similar voter revolts in their cities and lose their jobs as Boudin did.

2. The Democrat Party’s Establishment Is Out of Touch

Boudin’s supporters blamed Republicans for organizing and funding the recall campaign, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Even the New York Times concluded that Boudin’s recall revealed that “Democrats are at war with themselves.” It was a war between grassroots and establishment within the Democrat Party.

It was moderate Democrats who led a grassroots effort to recall Boudin. Although the campaign reportedly received some significant contributions from Republican donors, it said that over 80 percent of donations come from local San Franciscans. The majority of donors are either registered Democrats or have no party affiliations.

But the city’s Democrat Party establishment chose to stand by Boudin, even though multiple polls showed that most San Franciscans supported Boudin’s recall. He had the endorsements of the San Francisco Democrat Party, the editorial board of The San Francisco Chronicle, most of the city’s current and former leaders and lawmakers, many major unions, and celebrities. But these endorsements fell short of persuading voters.

Frank Ma, a former law enforcement official, pronounced that the establishment failed to realize that voters are tired of seeing “crimes happen in front of them and either nothing happening or the person who did the crime be back out within days.” Therefore, they ignored the establishment’s endorsement and soundbites and voted based on what they saw and experienced.

There is a similar disconnect between average Democrat voters and the Party establishment on the national level. While the Biden administration, Congressional Democrats, and their media allies continue to push policies on climate change, racial justice, and gender issues, most voters (including many registered Democrats) in key congressional battleground states consider inflation and crime to be the most critical issues. They believe the Democrat establishment “is out of touch with everyday people and are condescending toward voters.”

If the Democrat establishment refuses to listen to voters and reverse its harmful policies, the recall of Boudin is only the beginning of election defeats the party is likely to face this year.

3. Neither Party Can Afford to Ignore Asian American Voters

Since Asian Americans traditionally have been solid supporters of the Democrat candidates, the Democrat Party has taken their votes for granted, and the Republican Party hasn’t bothered to win them over.

But in recent years, Asian Americans have been at the forefront of opposing some of the Democrats’ extreme policies. In Washington State, Asian Americans helped defeat a 2019 ballot initiative that sought to allow “characteristics such as race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age” as factors when considering candidates for educational or employment opportunities. In California, Asian Americans helped defeat a similar ballot initiative in 2020.

This year San Francisco’s Asian voters were the driving force behind the two successful campaigns that first recalled three leftist school board members and now the city’s woke DA. The Democrat Party shouldn’t take Asian American voters for granted. If Asian Americans continue to feel harmed by the left’s extreme policies, the Democrat Party will see an exodus of Asian voters this November.

Meanwhile, Asian Americans’ successful political campaigns have demonstrated that issues than party loyalty drive them. There is an opportunity for the Republican Party to make inroads into the Asian community with the right policy ideas and dedicated outreach efforts.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/08/3-takeaways-from-the-successful-recall-of-san-franciscos-progressive-district-attorney-chesa-boudin/,2022-06-08
"Dems Yell 'Do Something!' On Guns, But They Own Our Crime Culture","Since a spate of recent shootings, Democrats led by President Joe Biden have been busy exploiting the tragedies to call for more gun control, go after the “gun lobby” bogeyman, and yell that we must “do something!” about firearm-related crime. They’ve been clear that they aren’t interested in talking about effective solutions that don’t involve gun-grabbing, so they probably also don’t want to talk about who’s responsible for America’s unsettling crime wave: the left.

Meanwhile, as of late Tuesday night, the Associated Press projected that San Francisco voters had handily recalled left-wing District Attorney Chesa Boudin, whose soft-on-crime policies wreaked havoc on the California city.

While a prosecutor recall might seem disconnected from an uptick in mass shootings and subsequent gun-control chatter, the two are intertwined. Just as the humanitarian crisis at the border is the predictable result of the left’s open-borders policies, our crime wave is the inevitable result of their anti-punitive philosophy of criminal justice. And the biggest culprits are progressive prosecutors like Boudin who champion Democrats’ policies and have been installed across the country after being bankrolled by left-wing radicals like George Soros and other groups.

Prosecutors Who Don’t Prosecute

According to a new report out from the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF), Soros alone has poured a staggering $40 million into prosecutor races to help elect 75 leftists that have contributed to the crime wave, and he’s just one of many billionaires working to destroy law and order, influence elections, control the media, and otherwise destroy the country.

The left and its skeptics continue to use guns as a scapegoat and say there’s no direct correlation between left-wing prosecutorial philosophies and crime, but the evidence suggests otherwise. According to the LELDF report, more than 40 percent of the roughly 22,500 homicides in 2021 — so more than 9,000 — happened in these 75 district attorneys’ jurisdictions, which accounted for more than one-third of last year’s violent crimes and property crime.

These DAs’ decisions produce consequences even in the areas they don’t oversee, however, since there’s nothing keeping released offenders in the prosecutors’ jurisdictions. Light sentences, low cash bail, and other slaps on the wrist send criminals right back onto their streets and those of their neighbors.

“These radical activists now preside over 72 million Americans and 40% of US homicides,” said LELDF President Jason Johnson, noting that Soros has already spent another $1 million to date this year to boost his preferred prosecutors. “Soros is using that campaign money and the hundreds of millions more for supporting organizations to quietly transform the criminal justice system for the worse, promoting dangerous policies and anti-police narratives to advance his radical agenda.”

The country saw the effects of progressive prosecutors up close over the last holiday season. The Waukesha parade murderer didn’t need a firearm. To kill six people and injure 62 more, he needed only a vehicle, a soft-on-crime district attorney’s office that let him out on a pittance of bail, and leftist policies that “guaranteed” offenders would kill people. It’s evil like that, enabled by leftist policy failures, that expose America’s crime problem as being so much bigger than a few psychopaths with guns.

Democrats’ Progressive Dream

But the rise in crime is much bigger than Soros and 75 district attorneys too. More fundamentally, it’s the predictable result of a long list of so-called leftist policy goals and beliefs that are prevalent not only among the radicals of the left, but also among the mainstream Democrat Party.

For a particularly grotesque example, look at cities in blue bastion California — particularly Boudin’s San Francisco, where the sidewalks are littered with used needles, passed-out junkies, and homeless encampments, and street sightings of human feces number in the tens of thousands each year. Facing an explosion in shoplifting, retailers in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco were helpless to do anything but reduce store hours. As a Wall Street Journal article noted in October 2021, “Walgreens has closed 22 stores in [San Francisco], where thefts under $950 are effectively decriminalized.”

That little $950 tidbit is courtesy of Democrats’ woke Proposition 47, which more than doubled the amount a person could steal before facing a felony. In other words, Prop 47 reclassified felonies as no-biggie misdemeanors. Crime in the Bay Area has gotten so bad that even Democrat Mayor London Breed was forced to admit that the left’s soft-on-crime approach has led to “all the bullsh-t that has destroyed” San Francisco.

Meanwhile, in 2021, Los Angeles experienced its highest number of homicides in 15 years, and looters ran rampant on that area’s train tracks, with some railroad companies reporting a “160% increase in criminal rail theft,” and “approximately $5 million in claims, losses and damages” to the train companies alone.

The Left’s Culture of Crime

The crime wave isn’t confined to California, though. It’s swept through Democrats’ strongholds across the rest of the country too. As The Federalist’s Jordan Boyd wrote in January, “New York, D.C., and Chicago all saw ‘record-high‘ murders in 2021 while Philadelphia; Portland, Oregon; Louisville, Kentucky; and Albuquerque, New Mexico, ‘had their deadliest years on record.'”

And let’s not forget the scores of rioters, looters, and vandals who went unpunished after the 2020 summer of rage that resulted in billions of dollars in damages. In fact, rather than condemn them, prominent Democrats including our very own Vice President Kamala Harris helped bail out of jail those who were caught. It was Minneapolis Democrats who voted to dismantle its police department in 2020, enabling a crime wave there. And Democrat lawmakers joined the chorus of those calling to “defund the police,” only stopping when they realized that abhorrent position could hurt them politically.

This approach to law and order is to say nothing of the left’s other principles that cultivate a culture of death, such as the celebration of snuffing out human life in the womb and exploiting children as sex objects.

It’s hard to take Democrats’ tired calls for gun control seriously anyway, given their debunked talking points and faulty logic. But it’s especially disqualifying for the left when you take into account all the lawlessness and violence they enable as hallmarks of their criminal justice platforms. If voters in far-left San Francisco can see it, it’s a safe bet the rest of the country can too. America’s culture of crime belongs to Democrats, and no amount of gun control can fix it.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/08/democrats-yell-do-something-on-guns-but-their-prosecutors-and-policies-create-our-culture-of-crime/,2022-06-08
Group Claims Enough Signatures To Recall Soft-On-Crime L.A. Prosecutor,"Image Credit FOX 11 Los Angeles / YouTube

A recall campaign aimed at ousting Los Angeles County’s soft-on-crime District Attorney George Gascon told Fox News Wednesday the effort received enough signatures to force a referendum on the ballot.

The Recall George Gascon campaign told Fox that organizers reached more than the 567,857 signatures needed by the July 6 deadline, and are aiming to collect 650,000 to ensure a buffer in case county officials declare signatures invalid. The campaign is the second attempt to rid Gascon from office after organizers failed to gather enough validated signatures last year.

“Simply clearing the required threshold is not enough – we must build the necessary cushion for signatures that are inevitably invalidated,” the group said in a campaign statement. “The only thing that can stop us at this point is complacency.”

Since becoming L.A.’s top prosecutor in December 2020 when he ran on criminal justice reform, Gascon has emerged as a national mascot for California’s sweeping crime wave terrorizing residents. Gascon has barred staff from pursuing sentencing enhancement and has also stopped prosecuting juveniles as adults no matter how heinous the crimes.

Further north, San Francisco residents frustrated by rampant lawlessness under a similarly left-wing reformer decisively voted to remove their own district attorney, Chesa Boudin, by roughly 55 to 45 percent last week.

The momentum against liberally reform-minded prosecutors in light of an ongoing crime wave has put other district attorneys of the same stripe on notice across the country. Several prominent incumbents told The New York Times that Boudin’s lost California contest is a lesson on messaging.

“We have to acknowledge that crime is up, that people are afraid,” Illinois’ Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx told the paper. “I think for too many folks when they talk about reform, they don’t talk about the link to public safety.”

“Countermessaging, however, can be tough,” the Times reported. “A story about 1,000 people who were allowed to await trial at home with their families and hold on to their jobs can be less compelling than that of one person who hurt or killed someone while out on bail.”

Voters, however, are placing blame for rising crime on the leftist prosecutors who decline to press charges as “smash-and-grab” robberies became the norm.

In October, Foxx drew criticism from her own mayor, Lori Lightfoot, for declining to pursue cases against suspects in a deadly shootout.

“Having been a prosecutor myself, having been briefed and looked at the evidence myself, I see ground for charges,” Lightfoot said.

Charges were eventually filed four months later.

Last month, a 911 dispatcher in Chicago criticized them both for an absence of leadership after a 35 percent spike in year-to-date crime.

“It’s crazy here in Chicago,” dispatcher Keith Thornton Jr. told Fox News. “It’s done, the city is done. If we don’t get new people in these positions to lead the city, the city is done.”

Enforcing Picketing Laws Might've Prevented Attempt On Kavanaugh's Life,"Everyone is more or less familiar with the concept of broken windows policing. Theories vary on whether prosecuting minor crimes directly deters more serious crime (because criminals fear the severity of prosecution) or whether it is the fear and withdrawal of citizens from disordered communities that allows more serious crime to come in.

Either way, the theory can be summarized as follows: When law enforcement vigorously prosecutes minor crimes such as littering, loitering, and vandalism, the effect is less serious crime in the community. If you allow one broken window in a building, soon the other windows will be broken, and more severe crime will follow.

Now apply that principle to the current situation regarding the leaked draft of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health. Once the draft opinion leaked and appeared to signal that Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey would soon be overruled, the protests began. These protests included threats to storm and burn down the Supreme Court building, as well as protests outside the personal residences of Supreme Court justices who are likely to vote to overturn Roe.

The Constitution protects the right to free speech and free assembly, but there are legal limits that clearly apply here. Federal law is quite clear about pickets or parades that seek to interfere with the administration of justice or influence a judge in the administration of his duty. Such action is criminal, punishable by up to one year in prison. If the pickets were a peaceful assembly of people who support abortion in a public place, such as the Supreme Court building, this would be political activity protected by the First Amendment.

But the protesters are bringing their demonstrations to the front yards of Supreme Court justices’ private residences. They come in large numbers; they shout through bullhorns; they utter profanities. Since this is in response to a leaked draft of an opinion that the Supreme Court justices have not yet voted on, there is no conceivable intent of such behavior other than to influence the decision. This is a federal crime.

Federal crimes should be prosecuted by federal authorities. Attorney General Merrick Garland was silent about these protests at the justices’ homes when they began. Only recently has he condemned the threats of violence and vowed the Department of Justice would “do everything we can to prevent” violence against the Supreme Court justices. Doing everything they can apparently doesn’t include enforcing the directly applicable federal criminal law, since the DOJ has announced no investigations or arrests related to these intimidating protests.

Fast forward one month, and a radical shows up at Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s house with the admitted purpose of assassinating him. Like the protesters, the alleged attempted murderer stated his primary motive was anger about the impending reversal of Roe v. Wade as well as his opinion that Justice Kavanaugh would vote to loosen gun restrictions.

This is what happens when we refuse to enforce the law. Obviously, nobody can look back and say that if the protesters outside the justices’ homes were vigorously prosecuted, this man definitely would not have attempted to assassinate Justice Kavanaugh. But the broken windows theory is telling: Failing to enforce the law on “smaller” issues creates an atmosphere that fosters more serious crime.

If the Department of Justice announced it would relentlessly prosecute any protesters who intended to use intimidation tactics to affect the outcome of the Dobbs case, it would create an atmosphere of law and order — an atmosphere that might dissuade someone from traveling across the country to assassinate a sitting Supreme Court justice. By completely failing to enforce the law, law enforcement allowed a societal window to be broken.

As Rod Dreher recently wrote, we now live in a society full of broken windows, of “small but telling outward sign[s] of inner disorder.” The escalation of protests that led to the attempted murder of Justice Kavanaugh is one poignant example.

Each time we allow protests to turn into violent riots, each time we allow the law to be broken because those in power agree with the politics of the lawbreakers, we allow another window to be broken in our society. We send a message that disorder is acceptable. We must draw clearer lines and restore order in our society. If we don’t clean up the graffiti and broken windows of lawlessness, we should expect the disorder to escalate.

Abortionist Kermit Gosnell Gets The True Crime Treatment In 'Serial Killer',"The title “serial killer” is not exclusively reserved for the likes of Bundy and Dahmer, but applies to Kermit Gosnell in “Serial Killer: A True Crime Podcast.”

With the power to decide laws on abortion returned to the states in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision reversing Roe v. Wade, it is now more important than ever to remind people of the depravity of abortion before the 2022 midterm elections. “Serial Killer,” narrated and produced by the husband-wife duo of investigative journalists Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer, is a six-episode podcast series in which McElhinney chronicles the investigation, trial, and conviction of Kermit Gosnell. What initially started as an investigation for selling fake opioids soon opened the door on his house of horrors in Philadelphia, turning his story into one of the nation’s biggest abortion stories.

“From cats roaming about procedure rooms to teenagers administering anesthetics, ‘Serial Killer’ exposes Gosnell’s 40-year killing spree and the political cover-up that allowed him to continue killing,” said McElhinney in a press release. “Several women died, many more were mutilated, and the grand jury that investigated his case found that throughout his career he probably killed hundreds if not thousands of babies born alive. The grand jury found that his crimes were covered up by politicians and Department of Health regulators who did not investigate because his victims were mostly minorities and because they were determined not to shine a negative spotlight on abortion.”

Episode one, which premiered Thursday, June 23, covers the genesis of the Gosnell investigation when abortion was not even a known part of it. The case started as a routine drug investigation, but as police and investigators followed the clues, all roads lead back to Gosnell and something even more sinister than the millions of dollars he made off prescribing oxycontin.

In episode two, which premiers Thursday, June 30, listeners get to enter the infamous Women’s Medical Society Clinic in Philadelphia, Pa., where Gosnell committed a number of atrocities and quite literally hid the bodies.

“It is an incredibly under-reported story,” McElhinney told The Federalist. “Very few people know who Kermit Gosnell is, who the grand jury said killed thousands of children. Even ABC News said he is probably one of the biggest serial killers in American history. Yet, he is not well known. This is an incredibly significant story that was largely ignored.”

“Serial Killer” also debunks the pro-abortion talking point that reversing Roe v. Wade will not reduce abortions, but increase the number of “unsafe” abortions.

“People say that, if you get rid of Roe, you’re going to have all these unsafe abortions,” McElhinney added. “Well, Pennsylvania is a progressive state in regards to abortion, and yet this is what happened [there]. Why would we think for even an instant that this is not currently being replicated across the country?”

“Serial Killer” brings the Gosnell story back to the forefront of our minds with testimonies from firsthand witnesses to Gosnell’s crimes, reenactments of actual court and grand jury testimonies, and jailhouse interviews with Gosnell himself. McAleer and McElhinney have also co-authored the New York Times bestseller, “Gosnell — The Untold Story of America’s Most Prolific Serial Killer,” and produced the movie “Gosnell — The Trial of America’s Biggest Serial Killer.”

"After Cops Shot, Philly Mayor Can't Wait To Abandon City To 'Enjoy' 'Stuff'","Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney had some choice words after two local law enforcement officers were shot at a July 4 parade but none of his anger had to do with addressing the rising crime that has plagued the City of Brotherly Love for years.

As a matter of fact, the “defund the police” Democrat’s reaction to the news that two police officers were in the hospital was to express excitement that his mayoral term is ending soon because “there’s not an event, or a day, where I don’t lay on my back, and look at the ceiling, and worry about stuff.”

“I’ll be happy when I’m not here, when I’m not mayor, and I can enjoy some stuff,” Kenney continued.

BREAKING/LISTEN: “I’m waiting for something bad to happen all the time. I’ll be happy when I’m not here. When I’m not mayor and I can enjoy some stuff.” @CoconnellFox29 follow-up question “You’re looking forward to not being mayor?” @PhillyMayor “Yeah.” @FOX29philly pic.twitter.com/yC1f96Uhw9 — Steve Keeley (@KeeleyFox29) July 5, 2022

Specifically, Kenney’s “waiting for something bad to happen all the time” has to do with guns, which he claimed will forever bear the blame for problems in the nation “until Americans decide that they want to give up the guns and give up the opportunity to get guns.”

Philly Mayor Jim Kenney (D): ""Until Americans decide that they want to give up the guns, and give up the opportunity to get guns, we’re going to have this problem."" pic.twitter.com/z3FxmJQrfO — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) July 5, 2022

So while the Philadelphia Police Department struggles to grapple with injured officers and the city’s record-high homicide rate which is on track to be much worse in 2022, the mayor is whining about gun control.

Philadelphia’s crime problem has been going on for years, but Kenney has repeatedly failed to address it. As a matter of fact, during the George Floyd riot era, Kenney made things worse by declining to increase the police budget to reflect the law enforcement needs in his city.

After facing pressure to defund the police, Kenney and the city council’s preliminary budget in 2020 sought to cut police funding by $14 million at a time when rioters were ransacking and looting small businesses after George Floyd’s death.

One year later, Kenney froze the police budget to prevent any increases in spending on the department.

To put it in perspective, in 2015, the year Kenney was elected, the PPD had close to 6,600 officers and at least 800 civilian employees. In the first quarter of 2022, the department only had 5,900 sworn officers and 600 civilians despite a significant increase in violent crime across the board.

As a result of Kenney’s neglect, Philly is suffering a “historic shortage of police.” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said that those officers who are still on the department’s payroll are “bearing heavier case loads, suffering from burnout, and experiencing increased stress.”

Maybe that’s why more than 63 percent of the city’s residents think Philly is “on the wrong track” and more than 70 percent of those surveyed listed increasing crime, drugs, and other public safety problems as their top issues of concern.

Kenney appears to care about crime and cops in his city as much as he cared about Philadelphia’s Covid-19 lockdown rules, which isn’t saying much. The officers injured on July 4 are well on their way to recovery but the city may not be unless the next Philadephia mayor prioritizes supporting the police instead of defunding them.

The Left Is Doing Its Best To Make Self-Defense A Crime,"The same left-wing prosecutors who let rioting run rampant and let repeat offenders out on low bail also want to make it difficult for you to defend yourself.

We don’t yet know all the details about an apparent fatal stabbing of an agitated man by bodega clerk Jose Alba in New York City last week, but we do know that the clerk was quickly charged with murder and initially held at Rikers Island on $250,000 bail while video surveillance seems to indicate he likely acted in self-defense. Surveillance videos show the unnamed girlfriend of Austin Simon, the man Alba killed who had a history of felony arrests and was out on parole, becoming upset with Alba when her card was declined and threatening to “bring my n– down here and he gonna f-ck you up.”

Another video shows Simon walking behind the counter to Alba, shoving him, and getting in his face before Alba stood up and appeared to try to walk past Simon, at which point the two wrestled until Alba eventually stabbed the other man. “I don’t want a problem,” Alba told Simon when he walked in, according to the New York Post. Further footage appears to show the girlfriend pulling out a knife of her own and slashing Alba, although she has not been charged.

After outrage over Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s decision to charge Alba, who has no prior criminal record, with murder, and his pursuit of such a high bail while Alba languished at Rikers, the bail amount was reduced — but the charges have so far not been dropped. In the meantime, GoFundMe deleted a fundraising page for Alba’s defense, in a move that has become common for the platform when its leaders don’t agree with a cause.

A fearless citizen with the will and means to defend himself is a threat to left-wing bureaucrats who want to boss him around — like they did when they knocked on doors sniffing out “unauthorized” religious services and gatherings during Covid lockdowns, or when they allowed lawless riots to hold cities hostage during the summer of 2020. Bragg’s decision to crack down on what appears to at least potentially be a strong case of self-defense may not have been an intentional ploy to criminalize self-protective autonomy, but it does follow a long string of actions and attitudes on the left that are hostile to the idea of a law-abiding citizen using a lethal weapon to protect himself and his property.

Elected last year, Bragg began his term by directing prosecutors under him to seek prison time only for “the most serious offenses — including murder, sexual assault and economic crimes involving vast sums of money — unless the law requires them to do otherwise,” according to The New York Times. He also directed them not to seek jail sentences for “certain robberies and assaults,” and to rarely “request prison sentences of more than 20 years.” Unsurprisingly, NYC crime rates have continued to rise.

Keep in mind, this is in the same state that just went to the Supreme Court over its desire to prevent regular citizens from being able to protect themselves from those crimes with a concealed handgun. After the Supreme Court found New York’s restrictive rules unconstitutional, the state rushed to pass a new law that severely limits where legal handguns may be carried and requires permit applicants to provide their social media accounts for review.

And never, ever forget the madness that descended on then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse after he shot three men in self-defense during a night of violent rioting in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse was smeared as a “white supremacist” by President Joe Biden and as a murderer by the corrupt press, and dragged through a weeks-long trial and more than a year of hateful slander before being found not guilty on all counts by reason of self-defense.

Power-hungry prosecutors and politicians who protect crimes and riotous behavior while targeting law-abiding citizens’ freedom to defend themselves don’t do so accidentally. They want Americans to be intimidated and dependent on them, and they don’t shy away from abusing the criminal justice system to achieve those ends. If that turns out to be the case with Jose Alba, you shouldn’t be surprised.

British Veteran Arrested For Reposting Meme That 'Caused Anxiety',"British veteran Darren Brady said Hampshire police were “impeding his right to free speech” by tracking him down for reposting a meme featuring the LGBT “pride” flag arranged in the shape of a swastika.

In viral footage of the arrest taken by political activist Laurence Fox who created the meme, officers tell the 51-year-old at his residence in Aldershot that “someone has been caused anxiety based on your social media post. That is why you have been arrested.”

https://twitter.com/thereclaimparty/status/1553383256439115776?s=20&t=52NbOB1HhUgDyRESuPn8ag

A spokeswoman for the Hampshire Constabulary told The Federalist that officers confronted Brady following a report “that an offensive image had been shared online.” It is unclear who filed the report but officers visited Brady’s home to “establish the exact circumstances around the social media post.”

Harry Miller, a former police officer and Bad Law Project CEO who was also arrested, said police first tried to “extort” Brady by demanding he “pay around £80 for educational course so he could downgrade from a crime to a non-crime, which would still show up in a basic Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.”

That’s why when officers promised to return on July 28 to hear Brady’s final answer about “re-education,” both Fox and Miller were on the scene to document what Miller dubbed the “world’s worst shakedown.” When officers arrived at Brady’s house for a second time, the police spokeswoman said “they were prevented from entering the address to discuss a potential resolution to the matter.”

“As a result, officers felt it was necessary to arrest a man at the scene so they could interview him in relation to the alleged offence,” the spokeswoman continued. She also said a 57-year-old man, whom the Daily Mail identified as Miller, was “arrested on suspicion of obstructing/resisting a constable in execution of duty.”

“He was released under investigation, and our enquiries are ongoing. Due to this being a live investigation we cannot comment further,” the spokeswoman said.

Officers claimed to be “investigating an alleged offence under Section 127 of the Communications Act (2003),” a sweeping law that gives the United Kingdom government the authority to imprison someone if officials deem his online posts “grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character,” or if he knowingly makes a false post “for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another.”

The spokeswoman made it clear that “no further action is being taken” against Brady but maintains that officers “come to work every day to protect the public” and were “acting in good faith” when they singled out Brady.

“We are engaging further with our police and crime commissioner to make sure that we deploy our resource in a way that reflects need in our local communities,” she concluded.

Donna Jones, the Hampshire police and crime commissioner, issued a statement criticizing her own force and voicing concern “about both the proportionality and necessity of the police’s response to this incident.”

“When incidents on social media receive not one but two visits from police officers, but burglaries and non-domestic break-ins don’t always get a police response, something is wrong,” Jones said before promising to write the College of Policing asking for “greater clarification” on how police should respond “more appropriately in the future.”

That hasn’t stopped free speech critics such as Caroline Russell, a member of the Police and Crime Committee in the Greater London Authority, from demanding police “look into Laurence Fox using pride flags to create nazi imagery and posting the images on a public platform.”

“This is a hate crime,” Russell tweeted.

Media Smear Moms Helping Recall Los Angeles's Pro-Crime DA,"Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon, whom many believe is too lenient on crime in his district, faces a possible recall this election year. Last week, the Los Angeles Times published an editorial in protest titled, “Anti-Gascon drive extends era of destructive, distracting recall mania.” When addressing the consequences of progressive policies on Americans, the legacy media’s leftist distortion is evident in nearly every line.

The piece begins with the assertion that voters’ desire to remove Gascon has no rational basis. It is instead motivated by “anxiety over disease, lockdowns, political turmoil, violence and societal disruption.” Gascon is the victim of emotionally unstable voters who have “poured their fears” onto him, the editors argue, and this hysteria has been streamlined into a movement by “opportunists of various political stripes but most notably from the far right.”

That doesn’t exactly fit the description of recall leader Desiree Andrade, a registered Democrat motivated by the killing of her 20-year-old son, Julian.

Police arrested five men in 2018 who had stabbed Julian, beat him, and thrown him off a cliff. Before Gascon took office, “special circumstances” charges of kidnapping and torture would have boosted the attackers’ sentences to life without parole if they were convicted. Gascon removed them, reducing their maximum sentence to 25 years in prison. Disgusted and wounded, Andrade became the co-chair of the recall effort.

In January, the Times spoke to Andrade about the “horrific details” of her son’s death. The paper noted that “she supports criminal justice reforms for low-level crimes, but she thinks Gascon has been soft on those who commit brutal violence.” The editors then had the gall to indirectly suggest that she belongs to a movement of cynical “opportunists” with no meaningful cause.

The recent emphasis on criminal reform in leftist politics involves radical attorneys seeking to dismantle “oppressive” systems at the local level, which they accomplish by lowering prosecution and rates of incarceration for various crimes, even violent or heinous offenses. This effectively nullifies the law and releases criminals back onto the streets in the name of “equity” and other ideological nonsense.

After a successful campaign for Los Angeles district attorney, thanks in large part to funding from progressive billionaire George Soros, Gascon took office in December 2020 to begin his criminal reform agenda. On his first day in office, he ended most uses of cash bail and eliminated the use of capital punishment in his district. He later shrank L.A.’s “Hardcore Gangs Unit” and illegally refused to uphold California’s “three strikes” law for repeat offenders. Among the most controversial of his directives was a total ban on sentencing enhancements, which he says are “racist.”

Overall, Gascon’s tenure has been marked by a spike in violent crime across the county, along with sharp criticism from lawyers and law enforcement in the staunchly liberal district. At least 35 cities have voted “no confidence” in Gascon, and voters have petitioned with more than 700,000 signatures for a recall. If only 566,857 are verified as legitimate, the option to recall him will be on the ballot in November.

Andrade sent a scathing response to the Times editorial, saying it “gaslights the public” and that the recall is about “Gascon’s pro-criminal policies, and nothing else.” As to the claim of “far-right” influence, Andrade pointed out that many behind the petition were initially supporters of Gascon.

Indeed, one L.A. mother who voted for the DA now supports the recall due to his handling of a hit-and-run case in which she was involved. In August 2021, an intoxicated 16-year-old driver, out on probation as a felon, plowed into her while she walked her baby in a stroller, knocking her and the stroller over with his car. Multiple videos show the driver veering directly into them, and she later said they made eye contact as she pleaded for him to stop. After the impact, he attempted to flee the scene but was stopped by a truck driver.

The DA’s office charged the minor with a felony count of leaving the scene of an accident that caused injury without exchanging information and two counts of felony assault, to which he pleaded guilty. Gascon stated, however, that there was “no evidence” of deliberate intent that would support attempted murder or manslaughter charges, and none of his prosecutors were allowed to bring them forward. The teen’s final punishment was a mere five-month sentence in a “juvenile probation camp” that would “rehabilitate” him.

“I voted for [Gascon] because I believe that our prisons do need some reform,” the outraged mother told Fox News, adding that his level of leniency toward criminals “is very far from any kind of reformation that anybody would think is appropriate.”

Such views are exactly what the condescending editors of the Los Angeles Times overlook, along with basic concerns for the safety and dignity of law-abiding citizens. They lament that because of the recall effort, Californians might waste time “arguing yet again over reforms they have endorsed again and again,” accusing their readers of being shortsighted.

In reality, nearly every aspect of the movement against Gascon shows that voters who expected moderate reforms feel betrayed. Instead, they got a radical whose policies have made such a mockery of law and order that convicted murderers have praised him by name from their jail cells as they await early release.

We will see soon enough if his deadly social experiment is allowed to continue.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/11/media-smear-the-outraged-moms-helping-recall-los-angeless-pro-crime-da/,2022-08-11
Police Will Keep Quitting Until Leftists Stop Neutering Them,"The New York Police Department (NYPD) is experiencing a record number of resignations. As of June 2022, more than 1,500 officers have either resigned or retired. This marks “the largest exodus of officers since the statistics have been available,” according to the New York Post.

An August report noted that many of New York’s finest are quitting before they even get their pensions. Oakland, California, is also experiencing a record number of police departures, according to a report from March. And last month, the entire police force of Kenly, North Carolina, quit.

Across the country, America is witnessing the same trend: Police forces are having unprecedented, catastrophic problems with retaining personnel. Consequently, homicide numbers for the first half of 2022, based on data from 23 cities, are 39 percent higher than they were in the same time period of 2019, according to a July report in Time magazine.

What is going on?

The Predictable Progressive Playbook

Much of the blame seems to lie at the feet of progressive politicians and police chiefs who were installed to “reform” police departments following widespread calls to “defund the police” in the aftermath of the 2020 death of George Floyd. Media reports indicate these ideologues are applying the same blinkered, anti-racist, leftist strategies across the country, with predictable results.

Take Charlottesville, Virginia, which hired RaShall Brackney, its first black female police chief, following waves of violence in 2017 “to restore public trust” in the city’s police force. A self-described “liberal Democrat,” Brackney implemented radical change by disbanding highly coveted special units and taking disciplinary action against six members of the city’s SWAT team, which she later disbanded.

Many officers called Brackney “heavy-handed,” and her leadership style was alienating. Mike Wells, president of the Central Virginia chapter of the Police Benevolent Association, noted the city’s force has “lost faith” in Brackney. A survey of the entire force found that an overwhelming majority of officers distrusted her. She resigned last year.

In New York, officers have cited “anti-cop hostility, bail reform, and rising crime” as reasons for quitting. “The city is out of control — especially since bail reform,” according to a former cop from Queens. This same officer told the New York Post that a common ethos is “get out while you still can.”

New York City even has a council member who has demanded the “racist”’ NYPD be closed down. And last week, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the U.S. House who represents parts of New York City, further delayed a public-safety bill that would have provided fund grants for local police departments to bring on new hires. AOC is a longtime proponent of defunding the NYPD.

In Oakland, a police union has blamed the recent exodus of officers on the lack of support from the Oakland City Council. “Just stop the rhetoric,” urged Oakland officer and president of the police union Barry Donelan in a recent letter. “Don’t blame Oakland Police Officers for everything that ills Oakland. That’s what we see from the council on a regular basis.”

In Kenly, North Carolina, the entire police force resigned in July in response to the town’s “progressively responsible” town manager — whom police chief Josh Gibson accused of creating a “hostile work environment.” And in Hillsborough County, Florida, State Attorney Andrew Warren developed a reputation for letting criminals go and not prosecuting crimes, angering police and leading Gov. Ron DeSantis to remove him from his post earlier this month.

Condescension Comes from Ideology

The bevy of nonsensical police reforms pushed for by leftists reveals the left’s blatant disrespect for America’s police forces.

Leftists have been downplaying their “defund the police” rhetoric for many months, given the alarming rise in crime across the country, especially in increasingly unpoliced urban areas. “Even Democrats are now admitting ‘Defund the Police’ was a massive mistake,” wrote CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza last November. But recrafted messaging can’t disguise the fact that the left’s ideology is one inherently at odds with what American police forces represent.

Police forces are necessary to address crime and in upholding equality before the law. And given that a disproportionate amount of crime occurs in black communities and is committed by black criminals, police officers will spend a disproportionate amount of their time addressing issues that arise in these communities.

But left-wing ideology, which is now fully under the sway of anti-racism ideologues, demands that the country’s police departments must be dismantled.

Police work is also inherently violent and physically coercive, which is why it’s no surprise that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers nationally.

Policing naturally lends itself to men because it is a profession that demands a high degree of physical and mental tenacity that is most readily found in those with high testosterone and who are physically able to engage wild drunks, abusive boyfriends, and the mentally unstable. Yet liberal ideology indicts men who manifest such traits as guilty of “toxic masculinity,” “heteronormativity,” and perpetuating “the patriarchy.”

In other words, as much the left tries to present itself as pro-police, its underlying ideology is decidedly against them, their identity, and their mission. Thus even when they don’t defund them, they can’t help but lecture them about how terrible they are.

In May, Adam Graham, a mayor from the state of Oklahoma, aggressively confronted two police officers in the middle of a routine traffic stop because he assumed they were engaged in racial profiling of a black driver despite one of the officers being black.

Until the left departs from its radical racial ideology, police officers will keep departing from their jurisdictions.

New York Defies Supreme Court With Unconstitutional Gun Laws,"New York’s new gun control law takes effect in two weeks. The law turns New York into a giant “gun-free zone.” But it also requires an in-person interview with law enforcement and the sharing of all social media accounts in order to obtain a gun license.

By requiring that gun license applicants have “good moral character,” New York is still acting in defiance of June’s Supreme Court decision, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, Inc. v. Brue. In a new court filing last week, New York Attorney General Letitia James claims that without these requirements, there would be an “entirely predictable chaos.” Democrats and gun control proponents have voiced similar fears in the other six states affected by the Supreme Court’s decision.

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s opinion in Bruen stressed the importance of “objective” standards for gun permits, ones that don’t require “the exercise of judgment, and the formation of opinion.” He also noted that “there is no historical basis for New York to effectively declare the island of Manhattan a ‘sensitive place’ simply because it is crowded and protected generally by the New York City Police Department.” New York’s default position is that all private property is off-limits to lawful concealed carry unless the property owner notes “by clear and conspicuous signage” that guns are welcome.

There is no “chaos” coming our way. Since 1976, 18 states have eliminated subjective “proper cause” requirements, which require convincing a government bureaucrat of one’s need for a permit, in favor of “right-to-carry” policies. In these and other states, concealed handgun permit holders have proved extremely law-abiding. No right-to-carry state has ever even held a legislative hearing to consider moving back to a “proper cause” requirement. Over time states have also eliminated their gun-free zones as they have seen predictions of disaster not occurring.

Permit Holders Have Proven Responsible

But some people will just never be convinced that regular Americans can be trusted with firearms. During oral arguments in Bruen, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer speculated: “People of good moral character who start drinking a lot and who may be there for a football game or—or some kind of soccer game—can get pretty angry at each other. And if they each have a concealed weapon, who knows?”

With 21.5 million permit holders and laws in place for many decades, Breyer’s scenario should have played out at least once. But there isn’t a single recorded incident like it.

In Florida and Texas, permit holders are convicted of firearms-related violations at one-twelfth the rate of police officers. The average revocation rate is 0.1% in the 19 states with comprehensive data. Usually, permit revocations occur because someone moved, died, or forgot to bring a permit while carrying.

Crime-Fighting Benefits

Concealed carry comes with extensive crime-fighting benefits. Academics have published 52 peer-reviewed, empirical studies on concealed carry. Of these, 25 found that allowing people to carry reduces violent crime, and 15 found no significant effect. Twelve studies observed increased violent crime after adopting concealed carry. But those are the only studies that Justice Breyer cited in his dissenting opinion, and they all suffer to varying degrees from systematic error. They overwhelmingly focus on the last 20 years and compare states that recently passed concealed carry laws with more lenient states that had passed concealed carry laws before that and sustained a much larger growth in permits over the past two decades. The finding that crime rose relatively in the later states that issued comparitively few permits is consistent with permit holders reducing crime.

The media capitols of California and New York are out of sync with the rest of the country. In those states, where public officials had the discretion to decide who could receive a carry permit, only a few adults out of every thousand have one. Most permit holders reside in rural counties.

In the rest of the U.S., 10 percent of adults have permits. People in most states don’t think twice about being surrounded by citizens carrying in movie theaters, restaurants, malls, and stores. In Pennsylvania, more than 14 percent of adults have permits. In Connecticut, it is 10 percent. In Vermont, no permit is needed. But most New Yorkers don’t fear for their lives when they cross their border with Pennsylvania, Connecticut, or Vermont.

Only Politically Connected Allowed to Carry

In 2013, Los Angeles County released a list of its 341 permit holders (out of almost 8 million adults). Only the political elite got permits: judges, reserve deputy sheriffs, and a small group of very wealthy, well-connected individuals who gave campaign donations to the county sheriff.

While Hispanics made up over half of Los Angeles County residents, they only received about 6.5 percent of the county’s permits. Women obtained about 7 percent of permits, and blacks 5 percent. In right-to-carry states, women have 29 percent of the licenses, and blacks have 12 percent. While detailed lists aren’t available for New York City, the story appears to be the same — only the most politically connected are allowed protection.

Where officials decide who gets permits on a discretionary basis, explicit death threats often aren’t even enough to qualify. Living in a high-crime neighborhood is irrelevant.

The Supreme Court has ruled against arbitrary and unfair permitting processes, but New York officials seem intent on dragging their heels. They will soon see that there was nothing to fear all along.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/22/new-york-defies-supreme-court-with-unconstitutional-gun-permit-laws/,2022-08-22
Mar-A-Lago Affidavit Proves DOJ Fished For A Crime To Get Trump,"The search warrant affidavit unsealed on Friday confirms the Department of Justice used a bait-and-switch tactic to justify the FBI’s unprecedented raid on former President Donald Trump’s home. The unredacted portions of the affidavit further expose the Biden administration’s manipulative and tenuous basis for the search and its reliance on inapplicable federal criminal code provisions to justify the targeting of a political enemy.

At noon on Friday, the search warrant affidavit used by the DOJ to obtain a warrant to raid Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home hit the public court docket, albeit with heavy redactions. While sparse, the unredacted portions of the affidavit nonetheless proved significant, especially when read in conjunction with the previously unsealed search warrant and the leaks to the compliant media cartel.

“The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment or removal of government records,” the affidavit opened, before noting that “the investigation began as a result of a referral the United States National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) sent to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on February 9, 2022.”

The affidavit then summarized the background of the NARA referral, explaining that “on February 9, 2022, the Special Agent in Charge of NARA’s Office of Inspector General sent a referral via email to the DOJ.” The referral explained that the NARA’s White House Liaison Division director had reviewed 15 boxes NARA had retrieved from Mar-a-Lago including “newspapers, magazines, printed news articles, photos, miscellaneous print-outs, notes, presidential correspondence, personal and post-presidential records, and ‘a lot of classified records.’” “Of most significant,” the search warrant affidavit explained, was that “highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records, and otherwise unproperly [sic] identified.”

While the next nearly eight pages of the search warrant affidavit remained redacted, the disclosures that followed exposed the affidavit’s focus on “classified records” as a sham. “On or about May 6, 2021, NARA made a request for the missing PRA records and continued to make requests until approximately late December 2021 when NARA was informed twelve boxes were found and ready for retrieval at the [Mar-a-Lago],” the affidavit continued, with the abbreviation “PRA” previously noted to stand for the Presidential Records Act.

As I explained previously, to fully comprehend the Biden administration’s weaponizing of the DOJ and FBI, it is necessary to understand the Presidential Records Act, the concept of “presidential records,” and the NARA’s role, and the search warrant affidavit’s references to those concepts confirm that point. In short:

“The Presidential Records Act provides that documents created or received by the president or his immediate staff, such as memos, letters, notes, emails, and other written communications, related to a president’s official duties, constitute ‘presidential records’ and must be preserved. The act further declares that the United States shall retain complete ownership, possession, and control of Presidential records.’ And at the conclusion of a president’s term in office, the ‘Archivist of the United States’ ‘assumes responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records.’”

The Presidential Records Act, however, expressly excludes specific documents from the definition of “presidential records,” including any documentary materials that are “official records of an agency,” “personal records,” or “extra copies of documents produced only for convenience of reference, when such copies are clearly so identified.” The federal statute further defines “personal records” as “diaries, journals, or personal notes ‘not prepared or utilized for, or circulated or communicated in the course of, transacting Government business’” or “materials relating to private political associations” or “relating exclusively to the President’s own election to the office of the Presidency.”

The public (understandably) may wish to sidestep the minutia of the mandates of the Presidential Records Act, but three top-line takeaways prove imperative to understanding the scandal of the Mar-a-Lago search. First, the Presidential Records Act is not a criminal statute, and violations of that federal law do not constitute a crime. Second, the Presidential Records Act does not reach broad swathes of documents retained by a former president, including “official records of an agency,” “personal records,” and convenience copies of presidential records. And third, the courts have refused to question a former president’s conclusion that a record constitutes a “personal record” and not a “presidential record.”

Two additional legal points require expansion for the populace to fully grasp the outrageous overreach of the DOJ, which was further exposed in the partially unsealed affidavit. The first legal principle of note concerns a president’s power to declassify documents. As Trump’s attorney stressed in a May 2022 letter to the DOJ, which the government released along with the redacted version of the search warrant affidavit, “a president has absolute authority to declassify documents.”

“Under the U.S. Constitution, the President is vested with the highest level of authority when it comes to the classification and declassification of documents,” Trump’s lawyer Evan Corcoran explained in his correspondence with the DOJ. Citing both the Constitution and Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988), wherein the United States Supreme Court wrote, “the President’s authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security … flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant,” Corcoran countered the DOJ’s attempt to frame NARA’s discovery of documents marked “classified” as warranting a criminal investigation.

Trump’s lawyer stressed a second significant legal principle in the same letter, writing that “presidential actions involving classified documents are not subject to criminal sanction.” Then, after noting that “any attempt to impose criminal liability on a President or former President that involves his actions with respect to documents marked classified would implicate grave constitutional separation-of-powers issues,” Corcoran wrote: “Beyond that, the primary criminal statute that governs the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material does not apply to the President.”

The attorney for the former president then quoted the statute that criminalizes the removal, possession, or retention of classified materials before stressing that “an element of this offense, which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, is that the accused is ‘an officer, employee, contractor, or consultant of the United States.’” “The President is none of these,” Trump’s attorney continued, before concluding, “thus, the statute does not apply to acts by a President.”

Corcoran closed his letter by reminding the DOJ of its obligation “to be candid in representations made to judges,” and requested that a copy of the lawyer’s letter be provided “to any judicial officer who is asked to rule on any motion pertaining to this investigation, or on any application made in connection with any investigative request concerning this investigation,” as well as “any grand jury considering evidence in connection with this matter, or any grand jury asked to issue a subpoena for testimony or documents in connection with this matter.”

The search warrant affidavit referenced Corcoran’s letter and provided a copy to Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who issued the search warrant. The DOJ also informed Reinhart of a Breitbart News article from May 5, 2022, which states that a former Trump administration official, Kash Patel, had characterized as “misleading” reports that documents retrieved by NARA included classified material; Patel alleged that the reporting was misleading because Trump had declassified the materials at issue.

The DOJ informed Reinhart of the above details and thus, in essence, that the government lacked probable cause to search Mar-a-Lago based on a violation of the statute governing the mishandling of classified documents. But what Trump’s legal team did not foresee, and what the search warrant affidavit revealed, was that the DOJ would twist the facts to find other crimes to justify the targeting of Trump.

The introductory section of the affidavit summarized three other legal theories to justify the search, stating first that “the FBI’s investigation has established that documents bearing classification markings, which appear to contain National Defense Information (NDI), were among the materials” contained in the 15 boxes retrieved by the NARA. Second, the affidavit maintained that there was “probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified NDI or that are Presidential records subject to record retention requirements currently remain at the Mar-a-Lago.” And third, the affidavit claimed there was “also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at” Mar-a-Lago. Those legal theories track the three statutes cited by the DOJ to justify the search, namely 18 U.S.C. §§ 793(e), 1519, and 2071.

As I previously explained, none of those criminal code provisions require material to be classified for there to be criminal liability. Rather, Section 793(e), also called the Espionage Act, makes it a crime for a person “having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over” “national defense information” to “willfully” share that information with a “person not entitled to receive it” or to “willfully retain” the national defense information and fail to deliver it to an employee of the United States “entitled to receive it,” if “the possessor has reason to believe [it] could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.”

The unredacted portions of the search warrant affidavit reveal how the DOJ manipulated the facts to fit within the Espionage Act. First, for the Espionage Act to apply, the material must qualify as “national defense information.” To establish probable cause that “national defense information” remained at Mar-a-Lago, the affidavit noted that a review by FBI agents of the 15 boxes retrieved by NARA “identified documents with classification markings in fourteen of the fifteen boxes.” The FBI agent who signed the search warrant affidavit then attested that based on his “training and experience,” he “knows that documents classified at these levels typically contain NDI” or “national defense information.”

What the DOJ did here, then, was this: It highlighted that the documents retrieved by the NARA contained “classification markings” and then used the FBI agent’s expertise to establish that documents that receive a classification marking typically include “national defense information.” That Trump declassified (or may have declassified) the documents is irrelevant under this analysis because the fact that they were ever classified would mean they likely qualified as “national defense information.”

The DOJ subtly confirmed this point by dropping a footnote that explains that “§ 793(e) does not use the term ‘classified information,’ but rather criminalizes the unlawful retention of ‘information relating to the national defense.’” The footnote continues by noting that Section 793(e) does not define “information related to the national defense,” but adds that courts have construed national defense information “broadly.”

In other words, the DOJ bent the Espionage Act to fit the facts of Trump’s possession of documents at Mar-a-Lago. The Biden administration couldn’t target Trump for mishandling classified material both because he declassified it and because the statute that criminalizes such mishandling doesn’t reach a president or a former president. So instead, they tried to find a crime to get the man.

Even then, there is a second problem with the DOJ’s reliance on the Espionage Act: An Espionage Act violation only occurs if the person has “unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over,” the national defense information. But how was Trump’s possession “unauthorized”?

From the unredacted portions of the affidavit, it appears the DOJ maintained that Trump’s possession of the national defense information was “unauthorized” because the documents were “presidential records” wrongly retained by Trump. But “presidential records” do not include agency records, personal records, or convenience copies, and the documents bearing the classification markings likely originated from intelligence community agencies and/or were hard copies printed for convenience, meaning Trump’s possession of those documents would not be “unauthorized” under the Presidential Records Act.

For the same reason, the DOJ’s reliance on Section 2017, which criminalizes the removal, destruction, or concealing of government records, falters because that criminal provision protects the government’s access to its own records, and merely possessing copies of government records is not enough to constitute a crime. Yet from the search warrant affidavit and the search warrant, it appears the government sought to recover from Trump hard copies of information it already had within its possession, either through various agencies or the electronic copies maintained by the relevant authorities. And it is a stretch for the government to rely on Section 2017 to criminalize Trump’s possession of the records.

Again, what we are seeing is a bending and twisting of the law to find a crime on which to launch the Mar-a-Lago raid. Mishandling of classified materials wouldn’t work, and Trump’s attorney made sure the DOJ knew that, so the creative team working under Attorney General Merrick Garland combed the federal code and found two plausible statutes on which to rely, adding a claim of obstruction of justice to round out the search warrant affidavit. While it is unclear from the affidavit the basis for the government’s obstruction of justice allegation, the affidavit establishes that the other criminal provisions relied upon representing illicit maneuvering to manufacture a crime for the man who was their political enemy.

Americans may shrug when prosecutors use pretext to target known drug dealers or human traffickers, but manipulating the criminal code to find a basis to search the home of a former president and a political enemy represents an appalling weaponization of the criminal justice system. And while large portions of the affidavit remain under seal, the country has seen enough to know that is precisely what the Biden administration did to get Trump.

"Crime Rampant In Democrat Cities With Beheadings, Shootings","In Democrat-run cities with defund the police initiatives, gun control policies, and illegal immigrants, crime has dramatically increased. While most crime that the leftist media covers at length is done to further their political narrative, much more crime that does not garner the same coverage makes these cities a dangerous place to live.

This weekend was no exception, as crime ran rampant in Democrat strongholds across the nation. Here are just a few highlights.

Philadelphia, PA

Over the weekend, 20 people were shot in the city of Philadelphia, four of whom were pronounced dead. There were an additional four stabbings this weekend in the east coast city. This deadly weekend put the city at 380 homicides for the year so far as of Saturday. While 2021 was the deadliest year the city has seen, Philadelphia is set to surpass last year’s record this year if this murder rate continues.

The four fatalities included a 64-year-old man who was repeatedly shot then pronounced dead at the hospital, according to a local news outlet. Joseph Durpee, a man who was in the area when this shooting occurred, stated, “It’s exhausting.” Like other Philadelphians, he wants “to walk around and not fear for [his] life.”

As a result of this rise in crime, reports show that the people of Philadelphia, specifically women, are increasingly becoming gun owners. According to Breitbart, “women began flooding into concealed carry classes as crime rose last year” and “outpaced men ’51 percent to 49 percent’” in concealed carry permit applications.

Former police firearms instructor Terrance Lappe stated, “I’ve been living in Philadelphia for almost 64 years and have never seen anything like this.” She added, “That’s why I carry a gun.”

Chicago, IL

Six people were shot and killed in Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s Chicago this past weekend, with an additional seven teenagers wounded among the 28 total non-fatal shootings. The shootings occurred between 5:00 p.m. Friday and 5:00 a.m. Monday.

Among the fatal attacks over the weekend included a 45-year-old man who was found in Washington Park on the South Side with a gunshot wound to the chest Friday evening. He was pronounced dead at University of Chicago Medical Center.

Four minors were shot within a six-hour span on the South Side, including a 17-year-old boy who was wounded in a drive-by shooting and taken to the hospital in critical condition. A 14-year-old boy was also wounded in a drive-by shooting but was in “good condition” when taken to the hospital.

While shootings are down from last year in Chicago, overall crime has risen to upwards of 45 percent in some districts, driving businesses out of the crime-ridden city. Despite this major uptick, Lightfoot stated last month that Chicago is making “progress” on crime. Violence committed and shootings of multiple Chicago residents each weekend, including teenagers, does not “scream” progress to people outside of Lightfoot’s line of thinking.

San Carlos, CA

Illegal immigrant Jose Rafael Solano Landaeta is in custody on murder charges for the brutal beheading of his ex-girlfriend Karina Castro this past Friday. Castro, who was also a mother of two, had placed a restraining order against Landaeta in April, according to law enforcement sources. Landaeta also “has criminal priors,” a report stated.

Castro’s grandmother stated that Landaeta was “a diagnosed schizophrenic on meds” and “would use that as an excuse for his behavior.”

Unfortunately, this murder is not the only crime states have seen as a result of mass illegal immigration. Just last month, two Mexicans who entered the United States illegally were charged with the murder of a North Carolina sheriff’s deputy.

Another illegal immigrant was just sentenced 29 years in a U.S. prison for “violent” and “sadistic” home invasions in Texas. Not only are legal U.S. residents shelling out massive amounts of taxpayer dollars to provide for lawbreaking migrants, their cities see crimes committed by this population rising as well.

According to reports, the Biden administration has allowed several hundred suspected terrorists inside the United States as part of its poorly vetted Afghanistan refugee pool.

Out Of Control Crime Threatens To Bury Democrats In November,"All across the country, Americans are struggling to cope with a new era of violent crime.

Urban hubs such as Philadelphia are expected to surpass last year’s record-high homicides tally. Chicago residents can expect hundreds more killings before the end of the year. In California, smash-and-grab robberies are the new normal, while the number of break-ins and thefts in Las Vegas are on the up, embracing a whole new identity of what it means to be “Sin City.”

As police agencies shrink amid low funding and community support while the southern border remains wide open for terrorists and cartels, cities famous for their tourism and sightseeing have now been rendered unsafe.

This rise in violence could impact how voters cast their ballots in key battleground states this November, especially since Democrats have made defunding police and affordable bail for violent criminals central to their platforms.

It’s not hard for Americans to see that many of these crime waves are exacerbated by the lax criminal policies adopted by blue bureaucrats. Even polls, often manipulated by their corporate sponsors to reinforce pre-determined narratives, show that voters trust Republicans far more than Democrats to address their top concerns about the economy, inflation, and rising crime. According to an ABC News/Ipsos survey out last month, 32 percent of U.S. adults said Republicans would do a better job at handling crime, while only 21 percent said the same of Democrats. Thirty-five percent held no faith in either.

Voters have good reason, however, to trust Republicans when it comes to cleaning up crime in their neighborhoods when considering Democrats created the crisis in their communities today.

Democrat Legislatures Bring ‘The Purge’ From Hollywood Fantasy To Main Street Reality

The nation’s rising crime is no spontaneous trend happening by coincidence. The crime surge is a direct consequence of Democrat-controlled legislatures passing bill after bill to enable criminal behavior with heavier restrictions on police and lower penalties for delinquents.

In Washington, state Democrats barred high-speed pursuits except under extremely limited circumstances, such as suspicion of impaired driving or probable cause that the culprit is an escaped fugitive or was involved in a violent crime. The law was passed last year as part of a police reform package in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death the year prior.

“Since January of this year, more than 900 drivers have failed to stop for a Washington State Patrol trooper trying to pull them over,” the Northwest News Network reported in May. “The patrol and other police agencies around the state say they’ve never seen such blatant disregard for their lights and sirens.”

According to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, this summer, violent crime saw a more than 12 percent spike in 2021 from 2020, including 325 murders. The state lost nearly 500 officers at the same time.

In neighboring Oregon, state policymakers eliminated cash bail requirements for a series of offenses and reduced juvenile sentences. The state ranks 5th in the nation for carjackings, while Portland, Oregon’s largest city, saw a more than 200 percent murder spike last year from 2019.

Further south in Nevada, Democrats passed legislation to prohibit officers from arresting those charged with non-violent misdemeanors with few exceptions. Passed in September, the law became effective in October. Residents and businesses, including enterprises on the Las Vegas strip, are now suffering a sharp rise in property crime, which is up 15 percent from August last year.

Colorado Democrats passed a law in 2020 mandating police officers to intervene in certain circumstances related to colleague misbehavior with criminal consequences if they don’t. The law has made it easier to sue police officers directly while adding new restrictions in a blow to officer morale. Colorado has the third highest crime rate in the nation and leads in U.S. car thefts, with 661 per 100,000 vehicles stolen last year.

In Minnesota, Democrats rejected Republicans’ $200 million public safety package to invest in recruiting and retaining more police officers with resources to crack down on carjackings and repeat offenders. Instead, Democrats opted for a bill to provide police body cameras and embrace a “community-centered” approach to violent crime as opposed to stiffer penalties.

According to Neighborhood Scout, “Minneapolis has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes – from the smallest towns to the very largest cities.”

Democrat Politicians Can’t Escape Their Own Crime Wave

Even Democrat politicians have not escaped the crime wave sweeping their neighborhoods. Last week, Congresswoman Karen Bass, who is running for Los Angeles mayor, said her home was burglarized and two guns were stolen.

“LAPD was called, and I appreciate their assistance. At this time, it appears that only two firearms, despite being safely and securely stored, were stolen,” the Bass campaign said in a statement. “Cash, electronics, and other valuables were not. It’s unnerving and, unfortunately, it’s something that far too many Angelenos have faced.”

According to Fox News, data in April showed L.A. robberies up nearly 19 percent from last year, with car thefts up 40 percent, violent crime up more than 7 percent, and shootings up nearly 70 percent.

L.A. election officials, however, refused to place a referendum for the county’s leftist top prosecutor on the ballot this summer, claiming nearly 200,000 of the more than 715,000 signatures gathered were invalid. Only 566,857 were needed to force a recall. District Attorney George Gascon, who has frustrated residents with leniency for juveniles and refusal to pursue sentencing enhancements, will continue to serve through 2024.

In Philadelphia and Chicago, two democrats, a congresswoman and a state senator who support left-wing criminal justice reform were also each carjacked last year. In July, Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal was threatened by a man outside her Washington home.

Democrats Double Down

Instead of working to address voters’ concerns about crime in their communities, Democrats are doubling down on these soft-on-crime, defund the police policies, the candidates that parrot them, and siccing the FBI on the former president.

Just last week, President Joe Biden praised Wisconsin Democrat Senate nominee Mandela Barnes, who has a long history of calls for defunding the police, ending cash bail, and a vocal desire to abolish ICE in tweets.

Barnes joins a whole host of Democrat candidates, including Sens. Raphael Warnock and Mark Kelly who have shown their contempt for keeping voters safe by voting against Republican amendments designed to keep crime at bay, including increasing funding for law enforcement.

In former Chief Justice of North Carolina Cheri Beasley’s case, she ruled against the American people by letting child predators off the hook and murderers scheduled for the death penalty with lesser punishment.

In Pennsylvania, where voters say the economy, inflation, and crime, are their top issues, Democratic Senate nominee and current Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he wants to cut the prison population by a third. He also recently endorsed Philadelphia’s District Attorney Larry Krasner, who Pennsylvania Republicans threatened to impeach over his failure to properly address violent crime and who lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed to hold in contempt.

Meanwhile, Republicans led by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, plan to introduce new legislation aimed at reinforcing the need for rule of law on U.S. streets. Blackburn said in a tv appearance on Wednesday that includes “grants for law enforcement, more resources for law enforcement, for fighting some of these drug cases, fentanyl that get into the hands of gangs and cause additional problems in the cities.”

The legislative move comes shortly after two fatal crimes in her home state of Tennessee, including the brutal murder of a mother on a jog and the deaths of four people at the hands of a deranged shooter who live-streamed his killing spree, drew the attention of the country. Both of the alleged murderers were career criminals who were let out of prison early.

“We need tough-on-crime prosecutors, DAs. If you do the crime, you need to do the time,” Blackburn said in the teaser for her legislation.

Progressive prosecutors and weak-on-crime officials are fighting for violent criminals that are taking over our streets.

Actual Police Endorse Johnson After Barnes Faked Police Support,"The Milwaukee Police Association on Monday endorsed pro-law enforcement Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., for the November election, expressing their support for the incumbent over his anti-police opponent, Democrat Mandela Barnes.

“During these increasingly trying times, the over 1,400 men and women of the Milwaukee Police Association appreciate leaders like you who are willing to stand and be an advocate for Law Enforcement Professionals,” the Milwaukee Police Association wrote in its endorsement letter.

Johnson has made his pro-law-enforcement stance quite clear throughout his time in Congress. The senator has advocated for “better fund[ing]” for police, saying it’s dangerous for communities and police when law enforcement is “understaffed or defunded.” During National Police Week this past May, the Wisconsin senator stated, “With crime reaching record highs across the country and the increase in officers killed on the job, the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities deserve our support. Their heroism keeps our families safe and we thank the officers for their service.”

Johnson has also spoken out against the rise in crime perpetuated by “radical left, soft on crime policies,” stressing the need for strong police throughout Wisconsin. “It’s because the policies, the rhetoric of the radical left is dispiriting law enforcement. Who is going to keep us safe? How can we expect to protect our citizens in our communities if we attack the police? If we propose defunding?” Johnson said.

Just last month, Sen. Johnson hosted a roundtable on U.S. border security, drawing attention to the failed border policies of the Biden administration and voicing his support for secure borders through law enforcement.

Barnes — Johnson’s opponent for the November election — has quite a track record of opposing law enforcement. “Defunding the police only dreams of being as radical as a Donald Trump pardon,” Barnes tweeted in 2020, implying either his support for the “defund the police” movement or at least his belief that this radical stance is non-extremist. Barnes has also been photographed holding a T-shirt that says “Abolish ICE,” an anti-law enforcement movement that supports dismantling border security in the name of protecting human rights.

Despite his attempts to distance himself from “defund the police” and other anti-law-enforcement movements, Barnes has received multiple endorsements from groups that advocate for these policies. And when Barnes’ campaign released a list of his law enforcement endorsements, two of the names were removed, with those police officers stating they never endorsed him.

After seeing the rise in crime as a result of failed left-wing policies, Wisconsin law enforcers know that supporting a candidate like Barnes will not improve the safety of their state. That’s why a more than 1,400-member police association enthusiastically backs Johnson — while his opponent fakes police endorsements.

"If The Feds Go After A Pro-Life Dad, They'll Go After Anyone","On Sept. 23, Pennsylvania pro-life activist Mark Houck was arrested on federal criminal charges. The details of the alleged crime and the arrest itself remain disputed, but we know enough to make a couple of observations about our nation and the current political climate.

Houck was arrested in connection with an alleged assault on a volunteer at a Philadelphia abortion facility. Unsurprisingly, the accounts differ as to what occurred. The Department of Justice issued a press release stating that Houck twice assaulted the alleged victim because he was a volunteer at an abortion facility.

Notice that the press release describes not only the alleged action but an alleged motive. Of course, the press release had to state that the assault occurred because the alleged victim was a volunteer at an abortion facility. If that was not the motive, there would be no jurisdiction for the feds to be involved at all. We will get back to that rather questionable issue.

Houck and his family give quite a different account of the alleged assault. Apparently, the abortion facility volunteer was getting into the personal space of Houck’s 12-year-old son and saying vulgar, inappropriate things to him. This harassment by the volunteer toward a young child allegedly went on for weeks. Houck first intervened by telling the volunteer he did not have permission to speak to Houck’s minor child. When the volunteer persisted, Houck eventually shoved him away from his child. Allegedly the man fell but suffered no injuries.

Where the Federal Government’s Jurisdiction Ends

Already we have a federalism problem here. Perhaps we have become too quick to accept the existence of an elaborate regime of federal criminal law. But as we know from the Tenth Amendment, the federal government has only the limited powers enumerated in the Constitution, with any remaining powers being reserved to the states or the people. From this comes the accepted principle in our federalist republic that states have the general police power. Federal criminal statutes and prosecutions must be limited to cases where the Constitution grants enumerated powers, such as interstate activity or crimes involving foreign agents and national security.

In this case, what we have is a very uneventful assault, where one man pushed another man. Hardly the stuff of a federal crime. An assault is a run-of-the-mill crime, and it is up to states to criminalize and prosecute such routine offenses. It is only when the assault occurs in a discriminatory way — in this case, because the alleged victim works at an abortion facility — that the feds claim jurisdiction. It remains questionable whether access to abortion facilities and assaults that occur on these properties should be within the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities at all, but that goes beyond the scope of this essay.

A recent article on the incident explains that the Justice Department relies on the section of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act that “prohibits violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain or provide reproductive health services.”

When you look at the statutes, they may be invoked only when a victim was attacked because he was affiliated with the abortion facility or when the attack attempts to interfere with a person’s seeking of an abortion. If Houck’s account is at all true and there was a dispute related to the volunteer speaking to the minor child, then the necessary element for these FACE Act federal charges disappears entirely.

If Mr. Houck has any evidence that he first warned the volunteer not to talk to his son, there is no way the federal government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Houck pushed the man because he was a volunteer or that he was attempting to prevent anyone from obtaining an abortion by pushing the man. If Mr. Houck pushed the volunteer because of a dispute about the child, there is simply no material for a federal crime.

‘Rifles Pointed at Mark’

Besides the dubious federal criminal charges at issue, the circumstances of the arrest signal a growing crisis in our republic. While the circumstances of the arrest still need clarification, Houck’s wife claims that when the FBI came to arrest her husband, there were 25 to 30 FBI agents present.

She goes on to describe the early-morning scene. First, her husband allegedly told the agents “Please, I’m going to open the door, but, please, my children are in the home. I have seven babies in the house.” Mrs. Houck claimed “they had big, huge rifles pointed at Mark and pointed at me and kind of pointed throughout the house . . . [t]he kids were all just screaming. It was all just very scary and traumatic.” Apparently in this exchange, Mrs. Houck claims she asked for a warrant and was told “that they were going to take him whether they had a warrant or not.” Eventually, they did produce a warrant.

From the Houck residence to Mar-a-Lago, we need to ask a very important question: why are federal law enforcement agents conducting high-profile, heavily-armed raids and arrests on people who show no sign of violence, flight risk, or non-compliance? It appears that not only did Houck do nothing to make the FBI think he would be violent or noncompliant with their investigation, but that in fact, Houck reached out to the FBI to try to learn more and resolve the situation.

A recent news update revealed that the Philadelphia criminal authorities refused to press charges, that a civil complaint by the abortion volunteer against Houck was dismissed, and that shortly thereafter Houck received a “target letter” from the Department of Justice informing him of the federal criminal investigation. Houck’s attorney attempted to contact the DOJ to discuss the situation, but received no response until a large contingent of armed FBI agents came to his door last Friday.

These cases should greatly trouble normal Americans. All the available evidence indicates that Mr. Houck was an ordinary, pro-life activist, that there was a minor altercation with an abortion volunteer, and that the altercation likely had to do with the volunteer’s constant harassing of Houck’s minor child. There were no serious injuries, and the normal state authorities (the Philadelphia police and district attorney) never pressed charges.

We should be concerned that the FBI — who should be quite busy investigating drug cartels and thwarting of major human trafficking rings — is charging Houck with a federal crime that could carry substantial jail time. We should be concerned that there is a statute that even makes such a charge possible. And we should be concerned when this pro-life family man is apprehended by a large number of federal agents with guns drawn, as his wife and several children watch in horror.

This, frankly, is not the stuff of American life, liberty, and happiness. This is what we see when an out-of-control government regime is trying to send a message of intimidation and fear to its perceived ideological enemies. There did not need to be an armed raid on the home of Mark Houck because he pushed an abortion facility volunteer who was likely harassing his son. The Biden administration should already be concerned that the FBI is suffering from a legitimacy crisis in the eyes of the American people. Such terrifying misuses of federal law enforcement only justify that legitimacy crisis.

The Left’s Funny New Lie: It’s The ‘Red States’ With More Crime!,"Because Democrats know they’re completely untrustworthy when it comes to law enforcement, having turned virtually every major city into a rape and murder zone, they’ve made the obvious choice.

No, silly, they haven’t started arresting criminals. They’ve started lying.

It’s a lie told recently by Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and then repeated twice this week in The Washington Post. The latest came in a column by Dana Milbank. (Yes, someone actually named their son Dana Milbank.)

“Violent crime is generally worse in Republican-run states,” he wrote on Tuesday under the headline, “It’s just murder living in a red state.”

The source for that claim, the same one made by Newsom, is a report published earlier this year by the leftist outfit Third Way. The report observed that “murder rates are far higher in Trump-voting red states than Biden-voting blue states. And sometimes, murder rates are highest in cities with Republican mayors.”

To start, the point in correlating crime and Democrat policies has never been that “blue states” are violent hellholes. It was always that Democrat mayors and district attorneys are demonstrably anti-law enforcement, and more interested in racial “equity” than in prosecuting offenders. Again, that’s mayors and district attorneys, elected officials who serve on the city and county levels, not state. Of course, Republicans have tied every Democrat running for every office to the issue, but the exact line of attack was always in reference to county and city officials.

With that in mind, let’s look at the data compiled by Third Way. The report listed 10 states with the highest murder rates in the U.S. using data from 2020. “In fact, the top per capita murder rate states in 2020 were mostly those far from massive urban centers and Democratic mayors and governors,” the report said. “Eight of the top ten worst murder rate states voted for [Donald] Trump in 2020. None of those eight has supported a Democrat for president since 1996.” The authors of the report observed, “These red states are not generating ‘murder is out of control’ national headlines. They seem to generate no headlines at all.”

But for this to be a devastating blow to the Democrats-suck-on-crime narrative requires ignoring that in every state, including otherwise red ones, there are densely populated areas that tend to be blue. And it just so happens, more often than not, that’s where the surge in crime has taken place.

The No. 1 state on Third Way’s list is Mississippi. Sure enough, the statewide vote in the 2020 election was for Trump. But within the state, Hinds County residents voted for Joe Biden, 3 to 1. Mississippi’s biggest city, Jackson, is in Hinds County. You know where this is going.

Reporting on Jackson last year, CNN declared it “one of the deadliest U.S. cities.”

The mayor of Jackson is Chokwe Antar Lumumba, a Democrat. The district attorney is Jody Owens, a Democrat.

No. 2 on the list is Louisiana. Trump won that state, too. But on the more local level, he lost Orleans, the parish that contains New Orleans, the state’s most populous city. Residents there went for Biden almost 8 to 1.

“New Orleans had the highest homicide rate of any major city so far this year, with about 41 homicides per 100,000 residents.”— The Wall Street Journal, Sep. 16, 2022

The mayor of New Orleans is LaToya Cantrell, a Democrat. The district attorney is Jason Williams, also a Democrat.

No. 3 on the list is Kentucky, another red state that voted to elect Trump. But Kentucky’s biggest city Louisville is in Jefferson County and 60 percent of those voters supported Biden.

This is from Kentucky-based think tank Pegasus Institute in August: “In the last decade, the city of Louisville has seen unprecedented increases in shootings and homicides. 2020 became Louisville’s deadliest year on record, and 2021 have proven to continue that trend.” The organization reported last year that Louisville’s homicide rate was competing with the likes of Chicago and Philadelphia.

The mayor of Louisville is Greg Fischer, a Democrat. The district attorney is Thomas B. Wine. He is also a Democrat.

Next is Alabama at No. 4, another 2020 red state. But Biden won the most votes in the most populous county, also called Jefferson. He won 56 percent to Trump’s 43. Within Jefferson is the city of Birmingham, which has the third-highest murder rate in all of the U.S.

The mayor of Birmingham is Randall Woodfin. He’s a Democrat, just like the district attorney, Danny Carr.

In slot No. 5 is Missouri. Again, a Trump state. And again, with the county containing its biggest city, St. Louis, going for Biden, 61 percent to Trump’s 37. St. Louis has the fourth-highest murder rate in the country.

Mayor: Tishaura Jones, Democrat.

County prosecuting attorney: Wesley Bell, same.

No. 6 is South Carolina. Trump won that state, but Charleston County, with the city of North Charleston, went for Biden with 56 percent of the vote. North Charleston has the highest murder rate in the state.

Finally, here we have a city with a mayor, Keith Summey, from the Republican Party. The county solicitor — Charleston does not have a district attorney — is Scarlett Wilson, also a Republican.

Not that we’re keeping score, but that brings the number on this list of Republicans who might feasibly be held accountable for raging crime in their cities to a grand total of two. For Democrats, it’s so far 10.

The next two states on Third Way’s report, New Mexico and Georgia, went blue in 2020, so we’ll skip those.

No. 9 is Arkansas, which was red. But again, Pulaski County, with the state’s biggest city of Little Rock, went blue with 60 percent of voters choosing Biden. That city reportedly has one of the highest violent crime rates in the state. The mayor of Little Rock is Frank Scott, a Democrat. The county prosecutor, Larry Jegley, is a Democrat as well.

Lastly, at No. 10, is Tennessee. Another red state with a major blue county that went for Biden. That county here would be Shelby, with 64 percent of the vote going to the president. In Shelby is the city of Memphis, which, according to The New York Times, “is often ranked among the nation’s most violent cities.”

The mayor of Memphis is Jim Strickland, a Democrat. Steve Mulroy, a Democrat, is the recently-elected district attorney.

To recap, of the eight red states listed in Third Way’s report as being among the top 10 with the highest murder rate, the cities where all that murder is happening are run almost exclusively by Democrats. All but one had a Democrat mayor. And all but one had a Democrat responsible for pursuing criminal prosecutions.

Democrats know they’re terrible on law enforcement. Attempting to lie about it only makes the governments they run that more dangerous.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/12/the-lefts-funny-new-lie-its-the-red-states-with-more-crime/,2022-10-12
CNN Tries To Hide Truth About Criminals Crossing Border Illegally,"CNN’s Dana Bash is trying to make the number of dangerous criminals pouring over the southern U.S. border sound far lower than it really is.

“Less than 1 percent of migrants encountered at the border have a criminal record,” Bash said while interviewing Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake on Sunday, claiming to cite Department of Homeland Security figures.

“I’m going to have to disagree with you on that figure you just put out,” Lake countered. “We don’t know what their background is. There’s a reason they’re trying to get in unnoticed; it’s because they have a criminal background.”

“We know that [DHS has] tracked down terrorists, they have tracked down people wanted for murder,” Lake continued. “We’ve got people with rape records, you name it, we’ve got hardened criminals.”

“Let me just tell you that this stat that I just cited comes from the Department of Homeland Security, less than 1 percent of migrants,” Bash doubled down.

DANA BASH: DHS says less than 1 percent of migrants encountered at the border have a criminal record



KARI LAKE: I have to disagree with you on that figure … we have murders coming in, we have people with rape records

To the half-listening viewer, “less than 1 percent” sounds like a small figure. But when you consider that border enforcement officials have encountered more than 2 million illegal aliens pouring over our southern border so far during fiscal year 2022 — with another month to go before the year concludes — that figure begins to tell a fuller story.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 2,150,639 apprehensions on the U.S.-Mexico border between October 2021 and August 2022, the most on record and more than four times the total apprehensions recorded in 2020.

DHS is up to 2,000,000 migrant encounters in 2022. Their numbers show hundreds of violent criminals crossing every year and thousands of criminals overall. https://t.co/LRm7G8yZr3 pic.twitter.com/TRu8dUnLGO — Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky) October 16, 2022

CBP’s Office of Field Operations, which operates at ports of entry, reported 15,558 encounters of noncitizens “who have been convicted of crime, whether in the United States or abroad, so long as the conviction is for conduct which is deemed criminal by the United States,” during fiscal year 2022 so far. Border Patrol, which operates along the border between entry ports, reported 10,778. Combined, that’s more than 25,000 convicted criminals — a whopping figure, far more alarming and newsworthy than the “less than 1 percent” talking point parroted by CNN. For Americans, who count immigration among their top three concerns headed into the midterm elections, tens of thousands of criminals pouring over the border is no small figure.

Of the more than 10,000 criminals apprehended by Border Patrol this fiscal year, more than 1,000 had prior convictions for “assault, battery, [or] domestic violence,” 60 had been convicted of homicide or manslaughter, and more than 2,000 were convicted of “illegal drug possession [or] trafficking.” More than 300 had been convicted of “sexual offenses” and nearly 800 of “burglary, robbery, larceny, theft, [or] fraud.”

Just two weeks ago, a Guatemalan national in the U.S. illegally was arrested for stabbing eight people on the Las Vegas Strip. An illegal immigrant from Mexico is accused of fatally shooting his partner, two of her children, and two neighbors last month in McGregor, Texas. Earlier last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it had arrested an Ecuadorian man who had repeatedly entered the U.S. illegally and is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl in Ecuador. When a 10-year-old girl in Ohio made headlines for seeking an abortion after she was raped, her alleged rapist was revealed to be an illegal alien.

The significance of 25,000 convicted criminals crossing the southern border notwithstanding, merely looking at criminal records vastly undercounts the number of likely criminals the Biden administration is inviting to the border. Impunity rates in Mexico and Central American countries are ludicrously high, meaning the vast majority of people who commit crimes are never convicted.

As NBC News reported a year ago, “the think tank México Evalúa found that 94.8 percent of the cases reported in Mexico go unpunished.” Another group suggested that number was even higher, with only 1.3 percent of crimes in the country ever solved. The Associated Press cited one estimation that “as of 2020, almost nine of every 10 homicides in Mexico go unpunished.” Another group found that “Over a period of four years, prosecutors’ offices managed just 35 convictions nationally in a universe of more than 82,000 investigations of forced disappearance in Mexico.”

In Guatemala, the next most common country of citizenship among illegal immigrants encountered by Border Patrol, impunity rates are comparably high. Despite the efforts of a UN-backed commission targeting corruption and impunity, “94 percent of crimes went unpunished on average over the last decade in Guatemala,” according to the think tank InSight Crime. “In 2018 alone, the impunity rate was almost 98 percent.”

Those sky-high impunity rates suggest that the number of people arriving at the southern U.S. border who have committed crimes — which were likely never prosecuted by corrupt, backlogged law enforcement in their home countries — is far, far higher than the nice-sounding “less than 1 percent” figure rolling off of Bash’s tongue. Furthermore, any person who breaks into the United States illegally is automatically committing a crime by violating our immigration laws.

No matter how hard CNN and the rest of the corporate press try to spin the facts into a different story, they can’t deny this one: More criminals are illegally entering our country than ever before because illegal immigration is at an all-time high as a direct result of the Biden administration’s policies.

Courts Are Foiling Biden’s Trivial Attempt To Regulate ‘Ghost Guns’,"President Joe Biden’s push to change the rules regarding “ghost guns” and put serial numbers on gun parts may be hitting a major roadblock. Relying on the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June, a West Virginia federal district court judge ruled on Thursday that it is unconstitutional to ban guns without serial numbers. That is hardly the end of the story, however, as federal judges in Texas and North Dakota seem to have no problem with requiring serial numbers.

The West Virginia judge, U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin, isn’t some wild-eyed Trump nominee. He was nominated by Democrat President Bill Clinton.

Goodwin followed the reasoning of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote in his Bruen opinion: “Government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” It wasn’t until the 1968 Gun Control Act that all guns had to have unique serial numbers.

Democrats have pushed for serial numbers on all parts of guns, saying it’s a way to protect public safety and prevent violent crime. “This rule will make it harder for criminals and other prohibited persons to obtain untraceable guns,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland claimed in August. “It will help to ensure that law enforcement officers can retrieve the information they need to solve crimes. And it will help reduce the number of untraceable firearms flooding our communities.”

Biden’s expanded use of serial numbers is aimed at stopping the production of homemade guns, now called “ghost guns” by gun control advocates. Homemade guns have been around since even before the United States became a country, and it was never terribly difficult to make a gun with simple machine tools. But now their production has become nearly impossible to regulate. With 3-D metal printers, people can now make weapons that are indistinguishable from those purchased in stores.

But, in any case, despite what people see on TV shows such as “Law & Order,” serial numbers on guns don’t help law enforcement solve crimes.

In theory, if criminals leave registered guns at a crime scene, the serial numbers can be used to trace the weapons back to the perpetrators. Similarly, Biden claims ghost guns have “no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced.”

But in real life, guns are only left at the scene of a crime when the gunmen have been seriously injured or killed. With both the criminal and weapon present at the scene, police can solve these crimes without registration. In the exceedingly unusual instances where registered guns are left at the scene, they aren’t registered to the person who committed the crime.

Police in jurisdictions from Hawaii to Chicago to Pennsylvania to New York that have had registration for decades can’t point to any crimes they have been able to solve with it. Even entire countries such as Canada haven’t had success.

New York and Maryland spent tens of millions of dollars compiling a computer database that contained the unique ballistic “fingerprints” of each new gun sold over 15 years. But even these states, which strongly favor gun control, eventually abolished their systems because they never solved a single crime.

Despite Biden’s claims, his new ghost gun regulations are no more useful. Combined with Biden’s zero-tolerance policy for any paperwork mistakes by gun dealers, his new rule is quite nefarious. Biden wants to put gun dealers out of business if they make any paperwork mistake, no matter how trivial or inconsequential. With each part of a gun having a different serial number, just transferring a barrel from one gun to another requires redoing all the paperwork on both guns. He is adding significant costs to gun dealers and manufacturers and increasing the likelihood of mistakes that would put them out of business.

There is a possible argument for using serial numbers for tax purposes, to allow for easier proof of whether a gun has been taxed. The 1934 National Firearms Act imposed taxes on certain weapons such as machine guns. But licensed dealers can still make sure guns are properly taxed when sold, just as sales taxes are imposed on items at any other store.

Why do Democrats keep pushing a policy that costs so much and has no crime-reducing benefits? Someday, knowing who owns guns will help them to target their confiscation efforts. Mass registration will set the stage for future gun bans, but in the meantime, the courts may finally be bringing some sanity to gun control regulations.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/19/court-rulings-complicate-bidens-trivial-attempt-to-regulate-ghost-guns/,2022-10-19
HBO's '38 At The Garden' Is A Lie Of Omission About Asian Hate,"HBO’s recently released documentary short “38 at the Garden” tells the story of “an undrafted Harvard graduate” who “shocked fans, stunned his teammates and galvanized the Asian American community when he scored 38 points at Madison Square Garden against the Los Angeles Lakers” in February 2012. Unfortunately, it also juxtaposes Jeremy Lin’s “stature as a groundbreaking, cultural icon” with “the recent hate crimes against … Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.”

With left-wing activist Lisa Ling as an executive producer, there wasn’t a chance that a retrospective on “Linsanity” wouldn’t be hopelessly woke. But that’s no reason to spare the execrable “38 at the Garden” a well-deserved bashing.

The spectacle starts immediately, as the incredibly unfunny comedians Hasan Minhaj and Jenny Yang explain what most Americans think about Asians with no reference to polling or focus-group findings. With his Emmy and Peabody awards visible over his right shoulder, Minhaj lectures that someone viewed as “small, passive, diminutive, unathletic, and submissive” cannot be perceived as “brave, courageous, covetable, desirable, or a leader.” Yang gets more specific and says Asians are viewed as “dry cleaners,” “IT guys,” “emasculated, no-d-ck-having, no-luck-with-women-having dudes,” “dragon lady,” “sex workers,” and “masseuses’ happy endings.”

Given that people of Asian descent in the United States outperform all other groups in socioeconomic metrics such as out-of-wedlock births, divorce rates, life expectancy, educational attainment, and household income, it’s at least theoretically possible that non-Asian Americans admire the cohort’s penchant for hard work, knowledge and skill cultivation, strong family and community ties, and clean living. Someone should inform Minhaj and Yang.

But it’s Lin himself who — unintentionally, one hopes — commits the documentary’s worst foul. Dutifully parroting the dubious charge that white supremacists are running amok, targeting BIPOCs, he asserts that today, “It’s like the worst time to be an Asian American.”

Really?

Worse than in 1942, when liberal icon Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, sending 120,000 Japanese people — the majority, U.S. citizens — off to internment camps?

Or worse than the myriad large-scale atrocities and hate crimes committed against Asians across the country in the 19th and 20th centuries?

Lin didn’t learn much about U.S. history at Harvard, evidently. The bias and brutality Asians had to overcome in past centuries is a testament to their undaunted tenacity and America’s national progress in putting prejudice in its rearview mirror.

Besides, the narrative of white supremacy posing a risk to Asian Americans has no credibility. Earlier this month, in a detailed analysis, the Manhattan Institute’s Diane Yap concluded: “The refrain that most anti-Asian crimes are committed by white people is misleading, if not meaningless.” Severe methodological defects and the corporate media’s laziness and knee-jerk receptivity to any accusation that the United States is irredeemably racist aid the woke mob’s “attempt to redirect outrage.”

Yap also noted that a focus on rare “hate crimes” ignores important questions:

A more pertinent question would be: “Who is responsible for the greatest proportion of violent crimes against Asians?” The Criminal Victimization report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics provides a robust dataset, with over 180,000 violent attacks on Asians in 2018. The data indicate just how misleading the narrative of white-on-Asian violence really is. While black perpetrators account for 27.5 percent of violent attacks against Asians, Asians commit less than 0.1 percent of violent attacks against blacks, indicating little role for proximity. Most violent attacks against individuals of a particular racial group are committed by other members of that group — except for Asians, where a plurality is committed by blacks. In fact, blacks are responsible for 305 percent more violent crime against Asians than neighborhood demographics would predict, while whites and Hispanics commit significantly fewer attacks against Asians than would be expected.

“38 at the Garden’s” fatal flaw is the sin of omission. A considerable aspect of why Asian Americans have a more challenging time as of late is because of discriminatory policies they face in higher education. These policies are so egregious that on Oct. 31, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases that the Legal Insurrection Foundation believes “could end Affirmative Action as we know it.” Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina will challenge policies that “are discriminatory against students of Asian descent.”

Rather than addressing genuine race-based problems, the practitioners of identity politics construct imaginary biases and phantom threats as they advocate for left-wing policy agendas. Anything — even a heartwarming tale about an out-of-nowhere basketball player who briefly captured the nation’s attention — can be used to push the agenda of cultural Marxism.

Jeremy Lin deserves better than “38 at the Garden.” Asian Americans do, too.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/24/hbos-38-at-the-garden-is-one-big-lie-of-omission-about-asian-hate/,2022-10-24
Media Ignore Waukesha Parade Murder Trial Because It Exposes Democrats' Deadly Crime Policies,"At first glance, the trial of Waukesha Christmas Parade killer Darrell Brooks, Jr. seemed like a television news director’s dream: A horrific, sensational crime, an unhinged defendant representing himself while delivering a near-constant stream of in-court outbursts, and a no-nonsense, charismatic judge trying her best to keep things from devolving into total chaos.

If ever there was must-see TV, this was it. Only it wasn’t, because if there is one thing America’s national media desires more than covering a lengthy three-ring circus of a trial, it is suppressing anything that might reflect poorly on Democrats or their policies — especially this close to an election. As enticing as showing highlights of a shirtless Brooks pacing the courtroom and ranting about being a “sovereign citizen” might have been, doing so would have forced the media to admit the institutional failures that unleashed Brooks on the people of Waukesha.

Just five days before Brooks slammed his SUV into the parade, killing six people — including an 8-year-old boy — and injuring more than 60 others, he was freed from jail on just $1,000 bail even though he faced two open violent felony cases: One for firing a gun at his nephew and a friend at a crowded summertime party and another for using his SUV to run over his girlfriend’s foot during an argument two weeks before the massacre.

Six months earlier, he was also freed on a signature bond following a domestic violence arrest in Georgia. He had also been wanted in Nevada for six years for failing to comply with the state’s sex offender registry after a statutory sexual seduction conviction for impregnating a 15-year-old girl.

A reasonable person would presume that a man facing that many criminal charges in that many states would be held until trial, but there has never been anything reasonable about how the justice system has dealt with Darrell Brooks, Jr. From the time he was 17 years old and began committing serious felonies until almost literally the moment he committed mass murder, he was given break after break from a system that appeared hellbent on keeping him out of prison and on the streets.

His sickening crimes, highlighted by the tragicomic farce he made his trial, served as inconvenient reminders of the grave consequences of the left-wing approach to law and order. When the police are defunded, cash bail is eliminated, crimes aren’t prosecuted, and prison populations are cut in half, the Darrell Brooks’ of the world operate with no fear of any consequences for their increasingly sociopathic actions.

Brooks himself is the personification of the failure of leftist criminal justice reform, and to cover his trial would have been to acknowledge this devastating truth. The three nightly network newscasts devoted just two minutes each to reporting on Brooks’ conviction last week on all 76 charges he faced, and none of their reports mentioned the fact that Brooks was out on bail when he committed mass murder.

In Wisconsin, however, where the trial understandably generated enormous public interest, Democrats have found themselves unable to escape accountability. Incumbent Gov. Tony Evers, who is running for re-election four years after campaigning on a promise to halve the state’s prison population, saw his lead over tough-on-crime Republican challenger Tim Michels evaporate over the duration of the three-week trial. His lieutenant governor Mandela Barnes, who as a member of the Wisconsin Legislature authored a bill to eliminate cash bail and has repeatedly called for defunding the police, has been all but written off in his effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ron Johnson.

Johnson, long thought to be the most vulnerable Republican in the Senate, has built up a sizable polling lead almost entirely on the strength of Barnes’ vulnerability on the crime issue. In one of the most powerful ads of the race, the grandmother of a young girl badly injured in the Waukesha Christmas Parade directly ties the soft-on-crime policies Barnes supports with the tragedy.

Given the disastrous consequences for Democrats of publicizing their failures in the state in which they occurred, is it any wonder that the national media gave cover to other swing-state liberals like Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman and Ohio’s Tim Ryan by effectively suppressing what amounted to a three-week infomercial for rejecting their crime policies?

With each outburst by Brooks, who occasionally became so disruptive while defending himself that he had to be banished to an adjacent courtroom with a video link and a muted microphone, it became clearer that he never had any business being out of jail. By contrast, presiding judge Jennifer Dorow, a well-known tough-on-crime conservative, illustrated the ease with which monsters like Brooks can be dealt with if only one possesses the will to do so. She was so effective in shutting down his nonsensical arguments and shutting up his deranged ranting that many in Wisconsin wish she would run for higher office.

If Brooks was the personification of a failed criminal justice system, Judge Dorow represented the abiding faith that there are still people in it who care about maintaining law and order.

They just need to be voted into office.

New York's Soft-On-Crime Radicalism Could Ruin Democrats,"When crime came up during the recent New York gubernatorial debate, incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul told her Republican challenger Lee Zeldin, “I don’t know why that’s so important to you.” With murder, rape, and other violence plaguing the Big Apple under Hochul’s tenure, she made clear she does not want to talk about crime.

But the voters headed to the polls to cast their vote for New York’s governor today apparently care. In the Empire State, which has been a Democrat stronghold since the early ’80s, polling shows Zeldin has narrowed his once-19-point deficit to just 7 points. The latest survey from the Trafalgar Group — which has proved to be more reliable than most other polls, tools that tend to shape rather than reflect public opinion to aid Democrats and elicit campaign donations — showed the race at a tie.

Thanks to New York’s cashless bail laws, violent criminals have been free to roam the streets and commit even more crimes, resulting in murder or trauma to innocent people. Here are just a few examples from recent weeks.

Estranged Husband Executes Wife

Just last week, a man was charged with shooting his estranged wife in front of her children less than 24 hours after he was released from jail without bail. According to the New York Post, the accused perpetrator Adam Bennefield was arrested earlier this year after allegedly beating the same woman, Keaira Bennefield, which was caught on surveillance cameras in her house. The husband was charged with third-degree assault, fourth-degree criminal mischief, second-degree menacing, and second-degree unlawful imprisonment.

“He was arraigned in Cheektowaga Town Court on Oct. 4 but was released because state law prevented the judge from setting bail due to the low-level of the charges,” the New York Post reported. Following his release from jail without bail, Bennefield allegedly “ambushed [his wife] on a road and gunned her down” while she was taking her children, between the ages of 6 months and 9 years, to school.

McDonald’s Axe Attacker Arrested Again

Thirty-one-year-old Michael Palacios was arrested after witnesses said he wielded an axe at other customers and destroyed property in a McDonald’s in New York City, an ordeal that was caught on video. Palacios “was seen arguing with a group of men before pulling an ax out of his backpack and smashing a glass partition and pointing the ax at various customers,” Fox News reported. Despite this, he was released from jail without bail.

After his release, Palacios was reportedly arrested again “for graffiti, stealing a bike and evading police.” But once again, he was released from jail without bail.

Homeless Man Murders Father of Two

Alvin Charles, 43, a homeless man, was charged with murder for the fatal stabbing of a father of two, 43-year-old Tommy Bailey. At the time of the murder, Charles was on supervised release without bail “for allegedly stabbing a straphanger on an A train in Brooklyn” back in 2021.

“Brooklyn prosecutors had asked that Charles be held on $50,000 bail in that case, but Judge Jessica G. Earle-Gargan instead ordered that he be freed on supervised release,” according to the New York Post. “He was set to appear in court in the case later this month.”

Bailey’s neighbor Jaylin said that “if they [had] done something about it back then, Tommy would have still been alive and we wouldn’t be talking right now. His death is on their hands. No common sense. That’s sad.”

Hochul’s New York

Hochul doesn’t know why crime is “so important” to her opponent, but these examples make it obvious: Cashless bail letting criminals out on the streets has been a disaster and led to the murder of innocent New Yorkers the governor is supposed to serve.

The people of New York have the power to change this today though. They can vote for the status quo — someone who will uphold radical cashless bail and let more criminals back onto the streets. Or they can put a stop to Democrats’ reign over the Empire State and vote for a candidate who is adamantly against this bail radicalism and understands why keeping New Yorkers safe is indeed so important.

J6 Witch Hunt Is What Happens When Big Tech And Feds Team Up,"Google gave the feds the personal data of nearly 1,500 individuals based on cell phone location data indicating their presence near the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021. The Department of Justice sought substantially more information, as well, according to a recent court filing, including data on Jan. 6 cell phone users wholly outside the Capitol. These facts, coupled with Google’s apparent disregard for the privacy rights of its customers, expose the potential for the government and Big Tech to collaboratively target political enemies.

In response to the riot that erupted inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, following a rally at the National Mall and a peaceful protest outside the Capitol, the Department of Justice launched a massive investigation seeking to identify and prosecute the individuals who committed crimes that day. Just a week after the Jan. 6 riot, “the government sought and was granted a ‘geofence’ warrant for data held by Google.”

A “geofence” warrant compels tech companies, such as Google, to provide the identity of individuals whose cell phones were physically located within a defined geographical area during a specific time period. The Jan. 6 warrant served on Google compelled the tech giant to search all accounts to identify devices that appeared physically present on Jan. 6 from 2:00 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. in the “target location.” The “target location” or the “geofence” covered by the warrant included the Capitol building and the area immediately surrounding it, which together covered about four acres of land.

In total, Google identified 5,723 “unique devices” that “were or could have been within the geofence during the relevant time period.” Of the 5,723 devices, the federal government then obtained a warrant forcing Google to provide “the phone number, google account, or other identifying information” for more than 1,500 cell phones that appeared located completely in the geofence area or in cases where the user had later deleted the location data.

How extensively the government used the data obtained from Google in investigating the riot is unclear, but the records eventually led the Department of Justice to charge David Rhine with four federal crimes: entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly conduct in a Capitol building; and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.

Rhine pleaded not guilty, and his public defender filed a motion to suppress the data obtained from Google connecting Rhine’s cell phone location to the Capitol, as well as any evidence the federal government obtained as a result of identifying Rhine through the geofence warrant. In his motion to suppress, Rhine argued that the geofence warrant was overbroad and lacking in particularity in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Whether a geofence data search constitutes a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment remains hotly debated, and to date, only a few lower courts have addressed the issue. The handful of courts that have considered the issue have concluded the Fourth Amendment applies to requests for geofence data and thus the government must establish “probable cause” to obtain the data. And in upholding the geofence warrants in those cases, the courts have stressed the narrowness of the scope of the warrants at issue.

In contrast, here the government obtained the personal data of more than 1,500 people whose cell phones appeared to have been located within a four-acre area. This case will thus likely lead to significant developments in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence related to geofence searches.

It will likely be years, however, before there is any clarity on the Fourth Amendment question. But what the Rhine case reveals now is the danger that a partnership between an equally politicized federal government and Big Tech presents to disfavored groups.

The geofence warrant obtained by the federal government to investigate the Jan. 6 riot reached the personal data of more than 1,500 individuals who, according to Google’s estimation, were only 68 percent likely to have been present in the four-acre area consisting of the Capitol and its surrounding area. And even then, not all the areas outside the Capitol were off-limits. Further, while irrelevant to Rhine’s case, his attorney noted that, in addition to the personal data related to the 1,500-plus individuals, the “government later sought substantially more data from geofences in areas next to, but wholly outside of, the Capitol Building.”

The majority of individuals whose personal data was obtained by the federal government committed no crimes but likely attended the pro-Trump rally, making them political enemies of the Biden administration. Yet, because they were not charged with a crime, those American citizens will never know the government collected their personal information. And then there is the concern over what use the Biden administration may make of the information of innocent Americans it collected.

Equally concerning is the potential for the federal government to use geofence warrants only for disfavored suspects, or as a pretext to create an enemies list. The federal government sought geofence warrants for Jan. 6, but did they do so when St. John’s burned or to identify Antifa criminals? What about to identify the individual who planted pipe bombs at the RNC and DNC or to locate the vandals who targeted crisis pregnancy centers? Or might the Biden administration seek a geofence warrant to create a list of parents protesting school board meetings, using creative lawyering to devise a pretextual criminal investigation to justify the warrant?

In the past, Google has served as a check of sorts on overbroad data requests, as a Guardian article from last year highlighted. Then The Guardian warned of geofence warrants, suggesting that Texas law enforcement officials could use a pretext, “literally any other law on the books,” to obtain a list of cell phones connected to abortion facilities to target individuals under new abortion laws. A Google spokesman, however, told The Guardian that “the company has challenged many overly broad government requests.” “We use a rigorous process designed to honor our legal obligations while narrowing the scope of data disclosed,” the Google representative said in a statement.

Google also filed an amicus curiae, or friend of the court brief, in a criminal case the federal government brought against a bank robber, with the tech giant taking the position that a geofence search is a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and as such requires the government to obtain a warrant. To date, Google has not filed a similar brief in the Rhine case, and an email to the attorneys representing Google in the previous case, inquiring whether they intended to submit a brief in the Jan. 6 case, went unanswered.

Briefing in the Rhine case also revealed another anomaly, with Rhine’s attorney claiming that even before the government served a geofence warrant on Google, the tech giant actually preserved the location data of its users from the evenings of Jan. 6 and 7. According to Rhine’s attorney, Google preserved that data in violation of its own policies that represent to its “users that if they choose to delete Location History, that data is indeed gone (not preserved by Google).” Then, after the DOJ served the geofence warrant on Google, Google searched the preserved data for the government.

Whether the DOJ asked Google to preserve the location data is unknown, but given the cozy relationship between the government and Big Tech as demonstrated by the censorship of disfavored views, that is a distinct possibility. Either way, Google apparently ignored its own policies to help the government when it was a matter of potential crimes related to Jan. 6. One must wonder if Google would have done the same had the DOJ sought data related to the violence flowing over from a Black Lives Matter protest.

While the country waits for the courts to decide the constitutional question, the conversation should not be so limited because the Fourth Amendment represents but a sliver of the concerns geofence warrants raise.

"Save Your Family From Dems' Homicidal Hellholes, Buy A Gun","President Joe Biden told reporters over Thanksgiving that he can’t think of “a single solitary rationale” for why Americans might want to purchase a semi-automatic gun.

“The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick,” Biden said last week. “It has no socially redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.”

BIDEN: ""The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick!"" pic.twitter.com/3Q7zH4GJPj — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) November 24, 2022

I can think of at least one redeeming reason to keep semi-automatic firearms on the shelves. A gun could save you and your family’s lives from the crime wave that is quickly overtaking some of the nation’s most beloved cities.

Simply put, the U.S. is in the midst of a crime crisis.

Even corrupt corporate media outlets such as The Washington Post, which taunted Republicans for trying to turn the nation’s attention to violence in Democrat cities ahead of the midterms and ran articles claiming “violent crime is not soaring,” now readily admit that crime is transforming American cities into hurting, homicide-plagued hellholes.

The solution? Ideally, punishing and locking up criminals instead of letting offenders off the hook in the name of “equity.”

But just as gun control is ineffective against someone who has no problems breaking laws, harsh crackdowns — which are pivotal in combatting crime — won’t stop evil.

That’s why Americans, especially in crime-prone urban hubs run by soft-on-crime Democrats, should equip themselves with guns for self-defense.

A Gallup poll recently found that 46 percent of Americans have at least one gun in their household, and 33 percent say they personally own the firearm.

That’s the highest personal gun ownership recorded since 2011. That new decade-high is no surprise considering how gun and ammunition sales skyrocketed during the 2020 lockdowns and summer of rage riots.

What is surprising, after three years of tyrannical rule by the same bureaucrats and politicians who deliberately refuse to punish criminals, is that the number is not higher.

Cities and counties run by Democrat mayors and district attorneys are almost exclusively responsible for the murder rates in the nation’s top 10 most homicidal states. In 2021 alone, at least 14 Democrat-controlled urban hubs reported all-time high homicides.

Yet, Gallup reports that Republicans’ personal gun ownership (48 percent) outpaces Democrats’ firearm ownership (20 percent) by more than double. The gap increases even more significantly when you examine households; 66 percent of Republicans said they live in a household with a firearm, versus just 31 percent of Democrats.

Overall, it’s Americans in rural areas and Southerners who are most likely to own a gun or keep one in their house, not the people in the cities and counties often known for violence.

Proper use of a firearm in a situation where you are threatened can save your life, your limbs, and your property. It’s estimated that the legal use of firearms helps thwart an estimated 2.5 million crimes a year. That means, on average, the proper use of guns foils nearly 7,000 crimes a day.

Even when they aren’t in use, firearms can act as a deterrent for anyone who wishes you, your family, or your community ill.

[READ: After You Buy A Gun For Self-Defense, Here’s What To Do With It]

Democrats are busy defunding the police and rallying their colleagues to try to pass legislation that restricts Americans’ Second Amendment rights (something 9 percent fewer voters support now than in June). Meanwhile, innocent Americans, especially those in blue areas, are suffering.

The answer to this suffering isn’t more gun control, which Gallup says fewer Americans support now than even earlier this year. It’s getting more guns into the hands of law-abiding citizens who can no longer trust their representatives to keep them and their cities’ streets safe.

Don’t let Biden’s finger-wagging keep you from protecting your family from the consequences of Democrats’ soft-on-crime agenda. Buy a gun, learn how to use it properly, and join the millions of other Americans who know that the Second Amendment was included in the Constitution for a good reason.

"Hey Merrick Garland, Your 2024 Election Interference Is Showing","America dodged a bullet when Sens. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley blocked Merrick Garland from becoming a Supreme Court justice.

Now-Attorney General Garland has made it clear he is a partisan operative and has no interest in justice. He would have been a disaster on the Supreme Court. But instead of a permanent appointment to the court, Garland is inflicting lasting damage to the Justice Department.

Conservative lawmakers have been demanding Garland appoint a special counsel in the Hunter Biden probe for months now, but he has ignored their pleas. Instead, Garland appointed Jack Smith as a special counsel to investigate his boss’s top political opponent: Donald Trump.

Garland has Smith looking into the non-crimes of objecting to the results of a presidential election and keeping personal copies of presidential records. Both are expressly permitted by federal statutes and have been done by Democrats in years past. If Trump is in hot water for objecting to one election, then Democrats would have him beaten fourfold — see years 1969, 2001, 2005, and 2017, all years Democrats objected to the results of a presidential election. If Trump is in trouble for taking personal copies of his presidential records, then Bill Clinton would have gone to jail for stuffing in his sock drawer eight years of highly classified recordings of his presidency.

The situation is not only chilling but dangerous when the Justice Department opens a broad criminal probe into a leading presidential candidate for objecting to an election. It’s a clear First Amendment violation to punish those who dare question election results, and this fishing expedition is oppositional to our constitutional values of liberty and justice. They are looking for any past infraction instead of seeking justice by solving an actual crime. The emphasis, in this case, is the person, Trump, instead of any alleged crime. It is only a crime to object to presidential elections in Third World hellholes.

There are very real and violent crimes on which Garland and the Department of Justice should focus their attention. Our cities are experiencing violence and turmoil as stores are looted and carjackings run rampant — all thanks mostly to the leadership of Garland’s allies within the Democrat Party.

Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee recently released a shocking report detailing the mishandling of the FBI under the leadership of Chris Wray and Garland. It notes that “in addition to anti-life extremists targeting Supreme Court justices, anti-life fanatics have targeted, destroyed, or vandalized nearly 70 pro-life facilities, groups, and churches to further their political cause.”

“Despite this harassment and violence aimed at the Court and pro-life facilities, the Biden Administration has declined to enforce the law to protect Supreme Court justices and their families,” House Republicans wrote.

Furthermore, under Garland and Wray, the FBI and DOJ aren’t just refusing to prosecute people who carry out attacks on pro-life institutions; they are actively using the federal government to persecute pro-life individuals.

Garland’s choice of Smith as special counsel is also a troubling one. Mike Howell, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project and a former attorney for the House Oversight Committee, tweeted that “Jack Smith is well known and liked in leftist circles because of his role in the IRS scandal, working with Lois Lerner to illicitly target conservative groups.”

Indeed, Smith was the subject of a 2014 letter by top House Republicans that noted Smith “was closely involved in engaging with the IRS in the wake of Citizens United and political pressure from prominent Democrats to address perceived problems with the decision.”

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s report on the Lois Lerner scandal noted that Smith wanted the IRS to probe nonprofits based on an article in The New York Times.

Smith also has experience using the legal system to take out prominent Republicans. In 2010, Obama Attorney General Eric Holder picked Smith to run the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section. Smith proceeded to take out Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell as a potential Republican presidential candidate on bogus corruption charges.

The Supreme Court unanimously overturned McDonnell’s conviction. Even the liberals on the court believed the charges brought by Smith were a bridge too far. Imagine what he is willing to concoct against former President Trump.

Garland’s appointment of Smith will surely erode the American people’s belief that justice is fairly applied to everyone. Unlike keeping personal copies of presidential records, being an unregistered foreign agent is a crime. So is a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. And tax evasion. Experts have noted that Hunter Biden’s influence peddling for foreign officials amounts to a crime as the president’s son never registered under FARA. And there is smoking-gun evidence President Biden himself was in on Hunter’s racket.

This appointment amounts to election interference by targeting a Republican presidential candidate days after his announcement. The special counsel doesn’t even have to indict and imprison former President Trump to affect his campaign’s chances. Garland is many things, but he is not dumb. Garland knows very well that, like the Mueller probe, a special counsel investigation will unnecessarily drag on — and leave a dark political cloud over Trump while he’s running for president over the next two years.

The people running the government who insist they are concerned about “protecting our institutions” appear to be even more dedicated to destroying them from within. Congressional Republicans must investigate and hold Garland and the special counsel accountable. They must cut-off funding to Garland and Smith’s illegitimate political investigation of their boss’s political opponent.

This Book Will Help Students Understand Rising Antisemitism,"Israel B. Bitton’s new book, “A Brief and Visual History of Antisemitism,” shouldn’t be needed — but sadly, it is.

A substantial work two years in the making, the visually rich effort features a foreword by Israeli President Isaac Herzog. It’s aimed at all people, but it is particularly designed for seniors in high school as some of the images and discussion could be too intense for younger readers.

Former longtime Democratic New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, founder of Americans Against Antisemitism, was intimately involved in the creation of the book. He told me, “Knowledge is power. We wanted the book to be easy to read and follow.” And it is — even coming with “augmented reality bonus content” aimed at a generation that might not be as familiar as they should be with the long and sordid history of hate and violence directed against the Jewish people.

Hikind went on to note that in November alone, there were 45 hate crimes committed against Jews in New York City — almost three times as many as those committed against all other groups combined. Hikind also cited FBI Director Christopher Wray’s Nov. 17 testimony before Congress that “Antisemitism and violence that comes out of it is a persistent and present fact,” with the Jewish community “getting hit from all sides.” Wray then said 63 percent of religious hate crimes were motivated by antisemitism — a remarkable fact when considering that only 2.4 percent of Americans are Jewish.

The book runs 549 pages before hitting its densely packed endnotes, serving both as a well-documented resource book and a useful tool for the classroom. It’s divided into nine discrete units: Defining Antisemitism; Beginnings of Antisemitism; Proliferation of Antisemitism; Secularization of Antisemitism; Apex of Antisemitism; Easternization of Antisemitism; Politicization of Antisemitism; The Current Landscape; and Combating Antisemitism.

I queried Hikind about how antisemitism might be different today than it was when the infamous “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” was published in Russia in 1903. “There is no difference,” Hikind said, “The same thing Jews were accused of in the past are the same things they are accused of today.”

Hikind then noted that mass communication makes it much easier to spread the hate — that people like Kanye West (or “Ye”) and New York Nets star Kyrie Irving each have massive influence and can reach millions of people, many of whom “don’t want to be confused with the facts.” The danger is that celebrities can legitimize antisemitism, not only for mentally ill people but also for the frustrated and angry masses or the criminally inclined who do not need much of an excuse for violence.

In an illuminating section on the roots of modern antisemitism, the book details the Marxist origins of critical race theory (CRT). The practical effect is that “if whites are racists, and non-whites can’t be racists, then it follows that ‘white Jews’ are racist, too, especially whenever they take umbrage with antisemitism that comes from non-whites. After all … Jews must have done something to ‘deserve’ the hatred and ‘retribution’ since they were privileged.”

I asked Hikind if things are as bad today as they have been in the past, and he responded by recounting a recent call he got from a woman in her 70s from Queens who asked, “When will we know when it’s time to leave?” To that, Hikind recounted how over 700 to 1,000 years in Europe, Jews were welcomed in different nations at different times — Spain, Portugal, France, and England — until they weren’t. And then, in modern Europe, generally welcomed and even allowed to attend university until the Holocaust — with Hitler’s Germany organizing the murder of some 6 million Jews, including Hikind’s grandparents. His mother was sent to the Auschwitz extermination camp, where more than 1.1 million men, women, and children were killed.

When asked why antisemitism appears to be on the rise now, Hikind said, “Did something happen? We just seem to go through cycles. But when antisemitism reappears, we don’t do anything about it. And while we see it on both sides of the aisle, it’s especially frustrating that in places like New York, the vast majority of hate crimes against Jews are being perpetrated by minorities, not white supremacists, with the Biden administration only engaging in talk, talk, talk — only willing to call out hate from the far-right.”

"When Leaders Won't Stop Crime, People Like Texas Taco Guy Will","Image Credit KHOU 11/YouTube

For years now, cities have failed to combat rising violent crime. Citizens are fed up and, as a result, are taking action. Such was the case in Houston this weekend when a customer at a taqueria shot and killed an armed robber.

Video footage of the late-night stick-up shows an armed man, clothed in a black ski mask, demanding wallets from diners. As the robber makes his rounds, a male customer in one of the booths can be seen reaching for his concealed handgun before firing nine times into the criminal’s back. Once he ensured the robber was disarmed of what was later reported to be an airsoft gun, the customer returned the other patrons’ stolen goods.

The mysterious vigilante disappeared from the taco shop before law enforcement could question him.

CAUGHT ON VIDEO: A customer at a taqueria shot and killed a robber at the restaurant on S. Gessner in southwest Houston, police said.

Texas law allows for the use of deadly force against a person committing or trying to commit robbery, aggravated robbery, and attempted murder, among other things. Whether the unnamed customer will be charged with a crime for stopping one, however — something Twitter users hotly debated over the weekend — remains to be seen.

This shooting, regardless of legality, is what happens when cities don’t crack down on crime.

Like many other urban, Democrat-controlled hubs, Houston is governed by soft-on-crime politicians and policies that let criminals back onto the streets instead of keeping them behind bars.

Following the death of George Floyd in 2020, Houston was one of many U.S. cities that sought to make fundamental changes to its policing and criminal justice system in the name of so-called racial equity. As a result, Texas’ biggest city is in the middle of a rapid uptick in “brazen break-ins,” stabbings, shootings, road rage fights-turned-fatal, kidnappings, thefts, and other violent crimes.

In 2022 alone, the Houston Police Department reported at least 73,410 thefts, 14,256 burglaries (a weekly average of 325), and 420 homicides (averaging roughly eight per week). Last year’s homicides may have been slightly down from 2021, when law enforcement clocked 433 murders, but are still much higher than in previous years.

The Houston homicide rate is so high right now that the local Crime Stoppers chapter had to cease reading the names of murder victims at its annual “Day of Remembrance.”

Families of Houston murder victims blame the city’s Democrat judges for the “revolving courthouse doors.” Local law enforcement personnel and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott say those same judges played roles in reducing critical funding.

Harris County’s plan to defund law enforcement shows a complete disregard for the safety & security of the Texans they’re sworn to protect.



We’ll always ensure our officers have the resources necessary to keep our communities safe.



Texas defunds cities who defund our police. pic.twitter.com/yGcGgYQ8wF — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) August 23, 2022

Houstonians’ tax dollars are supposed to go to programs and people who give them security. Instead of punishing criminals to the fullest extent of the law, those tax dollars are diverted to so-called “outreach workers and violence interrupters.”

When city leaders won’t act and law enforcement is understaffed, citizens like the armed customer at El Ranchito #4 taqueria take matters into their own hands to protect themselves, their families, and others.

For those exercising their Second Amendment rights, that may seem like good news. But an uptick in self-defense shootings, no matter how justified, will likely not bode well with Democrats hungry for gun control.

Already, crime-negligent Houston leaders including Mayor Sylvester Turner and Police Chief Troy Finner are working to disarm citizens like the taco shop guy with a $1 million gun buyback program and the demonization of firearms.

Not only is that hypocritical and unjust, but it also proves that in cities run by politicians who neglect crime, the law-abiding citizens always lose.

'Tulsa King' Is An Allegory For America's Blue-To-Red Migration,"The ongoing trend of mass domestic migration from blue states to red states, especially in the wake of Covid, has fundamentally altered the source of economic activity and growth from coastal states such as California and New York to states like Florida and Texas. Furthermore, the majority of Americans no longer inhabit dense urban jungles such as New York City and Los Angeles but instead tend their gardens in the big open suburban sprawls of Atlanta, Houston, or Phoenix.

While many commentators speculate on the political shifts that result from this migration, there’s relatively little attention paid to the cultural shift that happens. The fact that red states are becoming more diverse and cosmopolitan while blue states become less vibrant makes for a great opportunity to explore these themes, yet most storytellers, filmmakers, and screenwriters seem rather oblivious to it.

With a few exceptions, most of them will continue presenting New York City, Los Angeles, and occasionally San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore as the veritable centers of the world. Not surprisingly, this has led many American audiences to tune out, no longer seeing themselves in the characters on the screen — the woke messaging doesn’t help either.

Finally, this status quo is being challenged by “Yellowstone” creator Taylor Sheridan in his newest TV series “Tulsa King,” which takes on the issue of the great American migration and the culture clash that ensues. While there’s certainly some conflict, the message of the show is refreshingly optimistic and profound.

The story centers on the elderly mafioso Dwight Manfredi (played by Sylvester Stallone) who leaves prison after serving a 25-year sentence. Immediately after his release, his crime family sends him off to Tulsa both as a form of exile and to exploit an opportunity. Despite his misgivings from the outset, Dwight makes the most of this move and eventually establishes himself as a veritable crime lord in his new city.

The premise is brilliant, and the first few episodes definitely benefit from this twist on the usual tropes of crime dramas. The scenery changes from the old, shadowy streets of New York City populated by well-dressed elites to the sunny prairies of Oklahoma occupied by casually dressed ranchers, middle-class suburbanites, and small-town yokels. Not only does Dwight have to adjust to the new physical environment, but, having missed the internet and iPhone revolution during his time in prison, he also has to learn the new ways people connect with one another.

As a result of his cunning and good fortune, Dwight is able to put together a motley, diverse crew who works for him and helps him fight against the biker gang that currently occupies Tulsa. Despite their widely divergent racial and economic backgrounds, these differences are largely incidental. They unite in a common purpose: to get what they want and not be under anyone’s thumb.

This idea is exemplified in Dwight along with the other main characters. His driver Tyson hopes to escape the mediocrity that plagues young men his age. His new partner in crime, Mitch Keller, is a washed-up bull rider and recovering “pillbilly” looking to be more than the cynical owner of a dive bar on the outskirts. Dwight’s old acquaintance from New York, Armand Truisi, looks to recover his lost manhood after fleeing New York City and hiding in anonymity in the Tulsa suburbs. And to a smaller degree, similar ambitions exist in the deadbeats who aim to do more than get high and languish at their medical pot dispensary.

As such, there are relatively few scenes of the gang bonding over Italian dinners and cigars. Instead, they come together to practice shooting, listen to country music, and smoke a joint. To be fair, the show could have used more of these moments and fewer heavy doses of family drama, but the point is made that one’s background matters less than one’s shared interest and the ability to adapt to new circumstances. In other words, it is diversity done right.

And because Stallone is the star, there are also plenty of male-centered themes at play in the show. Much like Rocky, and even Rambo in the later sequels, Dwight Manfredi can’t help but be a male authority figure to the people around him whether they like it or not. For this reason, his greatest regret is being largely absent while his daughter grew into adulthood. He also has a habit of giving advice to the people around him. There are poignant scenes between Tyson and his father, who’s understandably upset about his son drifting into a life of crime.

That said, the show does suffer from a few flaws, mainly its uneven tone and style. At first, it’s a comedy, showing a modern-day Rip Van Winkle clumsily start an Italian-style mafia in the heart of Oklahoma, but it increasingly becomes crime/family drama about an old gangster who’s trying to make up for past mistakes. Correspondingly, the characters change their personality and behavior in unnatural ways. For some reason, Sheridan and Stallone forget that what made the show interesting was the unsuspecting Oklahomans reacting to Dwight, not the “Godfather”/”Sopranos”/”Goodfellas” knock-offs in New York stewing over their grievances.

All this can be forgiven, however, because of the show’s larger portrayal of what’s happening all across the country and willingness to be fair about it. It acknowledges that future and present-day Americans are living in cities like Tulsa, not the big cities on the coasts. And while there might be differences between the blue-state newcomers and the red-state natives, there are surprisingly many similarities that bring these two groups together and help them thrive in a new kind of American community.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/20/tulsa-king-is-an-allegory-for-the-red-state-to-blue-state-migration-taking-place-in-america/,2023-01-20
"Without Black Lives Matter, Tyre Nichols Might Not Have Died","Two of the five police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols were hired by the Memphis Police Department after it relaxed its hiring requirements, a new report by The New York Post shows.

Tadarrius Bean and Demetrius Haley both joined the MPD in August 2020 after education qualifications to become an officer were dramatically lowered two years prior. The department nixed the required associate’s degree or 54 college credit hours for recruits in 2018 due to a lack of applicants.

“They’re desperate. They want police officers,” retired NYPD detective Mike Alcazar told the Post. “They’re going through it, they check off some boxes, saying, ‘Ok, they’re good enough, get them on.”

In fact, the department was so desperate for recruits it offered $15,000 signing bonuses in both 2021 and 2022, and waivers for applicants who had been convicted of felonies. Even this did not prevent the force from being down 500 officers in January 2022.

Back in September 2020, a month after Bean and Haley were hired, former Deputy Director of MPD Mike Ryall told the Memphis Commercial Appeal that the rise of violent crime in the city could be attributed to the police department’s understaffing and lack of manpower.

Bean and Haley were also hired during the summer of the George Floyd riots, a global protest movement organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the death of Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. The protests spread to more than 2,000 cities across America, causing more than $1 billion in property damage and killing at least 25 people. Such a movement, whose main mantra was “defund the police,” significantly damaged police morale.

According to a June 2021 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), the rate of retirement at police departments rose 45% in 2020 compared to the previous year, with a 20% increase in resignations. The hiring rate also dropped by 5%.

Simply put: police officers were quitting at unprecedented rates across the country to escape such a hostile environment, and departments were struggling to meet minimum staffing requirements. This coincided with a massive crime wave across America’s major cities.

“So at that very moment you’re hoping you can put police out there to try to deal with crime, you’re seeing the workforce shrinking with an unprecedented number of retirements and resignations,” PERF’s Executive Director Chuck Wexler told NPR.

While a shortage of recruits is no excuse for relaxing hiring standards for cops, it is a product of disastrous dynamics the Black Lives Matter movement and leftist elites have cultivated. There is a lot of power and money in stoking fears of racism and hatred. And it is all done at the cost of the safety of the American public, most especially black Americans like Nichols.

For sure, let the cops implicated in Nichols’ death be charged to the fullest extent of the law, but it is important to remember why officers of that quality were hired to those positions in the first place.

15 Whoppers Joe Biden Told During State Of The Union Address,"President Joe Biden mumbled through his second State of the Union address to a divided Congress on Tuesday night.

His aim wasn’t just to beg House Republicans to pass Democrats’ legislative wish lists. The president sought to convince Americans that the state of our union — crippled by inflation, overrun by drugs and migrants trafficked across the southern border, and in the midst of a debilitating culture war incited by left-wing aggression — isn’t in dire straits.

The speech was remarkably similar to last year’s address, riddled with lie after lie.

Here are 15 lies the president told during his 2023 State of the Union speech:

1. Chuck Schumer Is Minority Leader

Before his speech even began, Biden greeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as “Senate Minority Leader.” Schumer has been the majority leader since Biden took office in 2021.

Biden: ""Congratulations to Chuck Schumer, another term as Senate minority leader. You know, only this time you have a slightly bigger majority. You are the majority leader. Not that much bigger?"" pic.twitter.com/VlTFx9t9rH — Greg Price (@greg_price11) February 8, 2023

2. More Jobs Created in Two Years Than Any Other President

“I actually created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs,” Biden said. “More jobs created in two years than any president has created in four years. Because of you.”

Biden didn’t create new jobs, as he often likes to claim. The only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of Covid-19.

3. Fastest Growth in 40 Years

Biden also repeated his infamous lie that he initiated the “fastest job growth in 40 years.”

Records, however, show that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During approximately that same time period, the unemployment rate also declined by 8.3 percent.

In January alone, American payroll jobs under Biden fell by more than 2.5 million.

4. Inflation Is ‘Coming Down’

Another lie Biden repeated from previous speeches is that inflation in the U.S. “is coming down.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are suffering from gas prices still well above $3 per gallon, weathering a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021. Biden may not be responsible for the fastest job growth in the last four decades, but inflation under his watch rose at its fastest rate in 40 years.

[READ: Biden, Media Taunt Struggling Americans By Insisting 6.5% Inflation Is A Good Thing]

Biden tried to blame the nation’s economic misfortune on the pandemic and the “unfair and brutal war in Ukraine” but the truth is, inflation in the U.S. directly coincides with the time he took office.

5. Democracy Faced ‘Greatest Threat Since Civil War’ On Jan. 6

President Biden forgot about the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and the repeat episodes of violence at the Capitol when he claimed the riot on Jan. 6 was the “greatest threat since the Civil War.”

Look at McCarthy’s reaction as Biden repeats the lie that the Jan 6 riot was the greatest threat since the Civil War.

Biden made the same hyperbolic claim at his first State of the Union address before Congress in April.

6. I’m Responsible for the Largest Deficit Cut in U.S. History

Biden wants to take credit for cutting the national deficit “by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history” in his first two years in office.

“Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor,” Biden said.

The truth is, federal spending under Biden increased more than $10 trillion since his first month in office. That’s more than any other president spent in his first two years in U.S. history.

7. Republicans Are Trying to Cut Social Security

Biden pledged to halt desperately needed cuts to bloated entitlement programs as Congress debates raising the debt ceiling.

“If anyone tries to cut Social Security,” the president said, “I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.”

The Democrats’ reconciliation bill passed last summer, however, raided nearly $300 billion from Medicare to boost insurance companies by removing leverage from negotiations on drug prices.

""If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.""



This guy raided almost $300 billion from Medicare prescription drug spending to hand over to health insurance companies and green energy interests last year!!! — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) February 8, 2023

8. Fires Have Burned an Area the Size of Missouri

President Biden tried to claim more wood had been burned by forest fires than the area of the entire state of Missouri.

“More timber has been burned than I’ve observed from helicopters than the entire state of Missouri,” Biden said.

Biden on forest fires: ""More timber has been burned — that I’ve observed from helicopters — than the entire state of Missouri"" 🤔 pic.twitter.com/yXlPS3KHXY — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) February 8, 2023

In 2022, however, 7.5 million acres burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Missouri’s forests span 14 million acres, and the state itself is 44.6 million acres large.

The remark appears to have been made off-script from what the White House released as the president’s prepared speech.

9. Biden Repeats Claim Fast Food Workers Sign Noncompete Agreements

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could be seen laughing in the background when Biden complained fast food workers were signing noncompete agreements with employers.

“A cashier at a burger place can’t walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more,” Biden said.

Biden claims that McDonald’s cashiers sign noncompete agreements which prevent them from working for other burger chains. 😂 pic.twitter.com/cXyPHE7lvk — John Curtis (@Johnmcurtis) February 8, 2023

Biden made the same claim at a business roundtable in July 2020, earning the then-candidate a “false” rating from PolitiFact.

10. Biden Blames Crime Wave on Covid After Democrats Defunded Police

Biden blamed the coronavirus lockdowns for the nation’s recent crime wave.

Covid left scars, the president said, “like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.”

It was the Democrats’ rush to “defund police,” however, that left cities and neighborhoods vulnerable to criminals who remained free to roam the streets. Democrats in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and New York cut police funding by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the social justice fever that took over the country. More than a dozen cities saw the highest homicide rates ever reported as a result.

According to a poll from Politico last year, 3 in 4 Americans blamed the crime spree on the efforts to defund police.

11. I Re-Upped Funding for Cancer Research

One of Biden’s top priorities going into tonight’s speech was his “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, which allocates funding to cancer research and care.

“Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead,” Biden said.

Biden may have restarted the program to “provide more support for patients and families” but it was his pet legislation, the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act, that cut cancer research spending by nine times as much as his program is supposed to put toward it.

12. Immigration ‘Reform’ Will Secure the Border

Biden pointed to his “new border plan” as evidence that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding the U.S.

But his plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives, something several hecklers pointed out during his speech.

Biden said his “comprehensive immigration reform” would “fix” the national security threat that American border woes have become. In reality, that legislation would only encourage the millions of migrants overwhelming Border Patrol agents to keep paying the criminal organizations that control northern Mexico to escort them to the U.S.

13. Mass Shootings Went Down After Assault Weapon Ban

Biden claimed the federal assault weapons ban, which barred the manufacturing of semi-automatic rifles for civilian use from 1994 to 2004, caused mass shootings to drop.

“In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled,” Biden said.

That’s a lie based on a flawed study that claimed the ban reduced mass shooting deaths.

Accurate data recorded during the ban shows that more so-called mass shootings occurred during the firearm prohibition. Even after the ban expired, mass shootings did not increase, as Democrats suggested they would.

14. Life-Saving Pro-Life Laws Are Extreme

Biden wrongfully characterized pro-life legislation in several red states as “extreme” for limiting women’s ability to kill their unborn babies.

“Already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans,” he said.

In reality, it’s Biden’s abortion-on-demand throughout all nine of months of pregnancy agenda that is extreme. New polling suggests 7 in 10 Americans support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy.

Biden also criticized Republicans for trying to pass what he said is a “national abortion ban.”

As pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America noted, the GOP has not proposed a total ban on abortions. They’ve just worked to bring U.S. abortion law up to speed with other civilized countries, which recognize abortion beyond 15 weeks gestation as a barbaric practice.

15. ‘I’m Here to Be President for All Americans’

In addition to promising unity via bipartisan cooperation, Biden falsely claimed he is “here to be president for all Americans.”

Yet, the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him. His smears against “MAGA Republicans” shows he has no tolerance for conservative voters or their values.

A president for all wouldn’t sic his Department of Justice on parents concerned that their children’s education stays indoctrination free or a pro-life father who rightfully defended his son from a deranged abortion activist.

Democrat’s Extremist ‘White Supremacy’ Bill Would Silence Speech,"In January, Democrat Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee introduced the Leading Against White Supremacy Act of 2023. The bill is one of the most radical, unconstitutional pieces of legislation proposed in years.

The Leading Against White Supremacy Act aims to “prevent and prosecute white supremacy inspired hate crime and conspiracy to commit white supremacy inspired hate crime and to amend title 18, United States Code, to expand the scope of hate crimes.”

Under the proposed bill, “A person engages in a white supremacy inspired hate crime when white supremacy ideology has motivated the planning, development, preparation, or perpetration of actions that constituted a crime or were undertaken in furtherance of activity that, if effectuated, would have constituted a crime.”

In other words, Jackson Lee’s legislation would make any crime or an attempt to commit a crime that is arguably “motivated” by white supremacy ideology a hate crime, which would carry with it a harsher penalty than other crimes not motivated by “hate.”

On its own, this provision is extremely problematic. Although ideological views that are truly rooted in white supremacy are undeniably repugnant, Jackson Lee offers no definition of “white supremacy ideology” in the bill, opening the door to wild interpretations that could unjustly increase legal punishments for defendants in court.

Jackson Lee’s legislation doesn’t stop there, however. The most important part of the legislation is its “conspiracy” provision, which would make it illegal to “publish” material that inspires a crime deemed to be motivated by white supremacy — which, again, is not defined by the bill. The legislation specifically lists “social media platforms” as a form of publication.

According to the provisions in Jackson Lee’s bill, if a social media user were to post an article, video, or even just a short message on a website such as Facebook or Twitter, that person could be convicted of committing “a conspiracy to engage in white supremacy inspired hate crime” if someone else consumes that material and then commits a crime motivated by white supremacy.

It doesn’t appear to matter how crazy or mentally ill the person committing the crime is, either. So, under the bill, if a deranged mass shooter allegedly inspired by white supremacy TikTok videos and Facebook posts kills several people, any of the “white supremacy” materials “read, heard, or viewed” by the shooter could make the person who posted those materials guilty of conspiracy.

Some might be tempted to think this would only apply to the most extreme ideological and political views about white supremacy, but recent history has shown that many on the left have a far-reaching, extremely broad understanding of “white supremacy.”

For example, the National Education Association, America’s largest teachers union, claims that although “white supremacy culture” is typically “associated with violence perpetrated by the KKK and other white supremacist groups, it also describes a political ideology and systemic oppression that perpetuates and maintains the social, political, historical and/or industrial white domination.” The NEA further claims, “Organizations that are led by people of color or have a majority of people of color can also demonstrate characteristics of White Supremacy Culture.”

Popular left-wing publications such as The Intercept have suggested that “prominent conservatives” including Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Donald Trump, and Candace Owens propagate white supremacist ideology. Whistleblower documents reveal Google’s “anti-racism” initiative for the company’s employees featured a “White Supremacy Pyramid” that includes both Shapiro and Trump.

In November, ABC News published an article alleging that the “GOP’s white supremacist problems extend beyond Trump.” One columnist for The Hill claimed in November that “Republican officials keep stoking white supremacist tropes.”

Further, a long list of academics including Ruth Colker, a law professor at Ohio State University, has even called America’s founding document “The White Supremacist Constitution.” According to Colker, “The United States Constitution is a document that, during every era, has helped further white supremacy.”

With all of this in mind, it’s not hard to imagine how under the Leading Against White Supremacy Act, a Trump-supporting Republican expressing support for the Constitution on Twitter — a description that fits millions of Americans — could easily be caught up in a charge of “conspiracy to engage in white supremacy inspired hate crime.”

But as nutty as all of this is, Jackson Lee has somehow managed to go even further. Among the relevant kinds of “published material” covered under the Leading Against White Supremacy Act is “hate speech that vilifies or is otherwise directed against any non-White person or group.”

What exactly is “hate speech”? Jackson Lee’s bill doesn’t tell us. Perhaps political commentators writing an article such as this one, which arguably “vilifies” a “non-White person,” could someday find themselves guilty of conspiracy to engage in a white supremacy-inspired hate crime.

The purpose of Jackson Lee’s legislation is not to discourage white supremacy, a noble goal. It’s a blatantly unconstitutional, racist attempt to silence political and social speech.

"Crime Isn't Going Down, Democrat-Run Cities Just Don't Report It","Even while gangs increasingly mug, carjack, and gun people down on the streets of many major cities, fentanyl poisoning deaths take 100,000 American lives, and mass murder incidents happen with unsettling regularity, perceptions of crime are highly influenced by partisanship. Gallup finds that when a Democrat is president, Republicans see crime as more of a problem than do Democrats, with the reverse happening when a Republican is in the White House.

Competing narratives and poor information plague the national discussion over public safety. This makes it difficult to reach a political consensus on what should be done. Even as Gallup’s polling shows the belief that “crime is increasing locally is now at the highest point,” it notes, “In absolute terms, Americans have for decades exhibited a marked tendency to say that crime is increasing rather than decreasing, year in and year out.”

It’s difficult enough that public perception of crime is often untethered from reality, it’s even worse when the government agencies that are supposed to report, gather, and analyze crime are failing at an alarming rate.

The left-leaning criminal justice nonprofit The Marshall Project, in commenting on the FBI’s annual release of crime statistics last November, noted, “The nation’s most thorough crime data collection program concluded it’s possible crime went up, went down or stayed the same.” Why the uncertainty? It “largely stems from the fact that 2021’s data was more incomplete than any in recent memory. … This year about 7,000 police agencies, covering about 35% of the U.S. population were missing.” To address the massive holes in the data from large cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, the Justice Department simply made an estimate.

“In some cases,” Marshall noted, “the FBI didn’t even have enough information to make an estimation.”

Why the huge amount of missing arrest data? Two reasons. First, the FBI finally switched fully over to a new reporting system, the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The FBI had been accepting data in a format that was nearly 100 years old, and 2021 was the first year the reports from police departments — entirely voluntary — had to be in the new format. But there’s another disturbing reason some police departments don’t report data: It could make them or the left-wing politicians overseeing them look bad.

As a result, the FBI did not publish any state-level violent crime numbers for California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. Further, the entire West region lacked an estimate of violent crimes, murders, and aggravated assaults. Thus, when some, mostly on the left, argue that crime is going down, it’s a highly suspect claim.

I asked Julie Warren, my colleague at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, who works as the deputy director for the Right on Crime initiative, about persistent non-reporting of crime data by police departments. She said that a non-reporting department, such as the San Francisco Police Department, could be dissuaded from reporting arrests because the district attorney refuses to press charges on most arrestees, resulting in a dismal closure rate for the department — 100 suspects arrested, three charged, one convicted.

Until he was recalled in a July 8, 2022, election, San Francisco’s DA was Soros-backed radical leftist Chesa Boudin. One can easily imagine the San Francisco PD simply throwing in the towel on all but the most egregious crimes in the City by the Bay.

In addition, Soros DAs run several other major prosecutorial offices, with Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, St. Louis, New York, Baltimore, Albuquerque, Orlando, and three urban counties in Northern Virginia suffering increases in crime as DAs quickly allow the accused to walk.

Unsurprisingly, there’s a big overlap between entities that don’t report crime statistics to the FBI and Soros prosecutors — no report, no crime.

Yet, even with the incomplete 2021 FBI crime statistics showing what appears to be little change in crime rates from 2020 — murder up 4 percent, overall violent crime down 1 percent — only half of violent crimes are even reported. In addition to the FBI’s arrest database, since 1973, the Justice Department runs a separate crime victimization survey. This less well-known measure has consistently shown higher rates of violent crime than law enforcement agencies report to the FBI.

I asked Warren about this, and she noted that crime victims who live in high-risk communities where liberal DAs or basic cash bail policies operate have strong incentives not to report crime. Should they report the local gang member who robbed their shop or mugged them, the gang member, if arrested, will quickly make bail — being in a gang means having friends who will bail you out — and who will then come looking to exact revenge. The same goes for domestic violence victims whose abusive boyfriends may come back to beat them, or worse.

One solution to this problem would be to introduce risk assessments in bail. Risk assessments look at two things: the likelihood the defendant will show up for trial and the public safety risk the defendant poses to the community. Unfortunately, the left, as well as the bail bond industry, is almost universally opposed to risk assessments in bail, claiming that they are racially biased. While some risk assessments are essentially a proprietary black box and may contain a racial element in scoring, there are plenty of open-source risk assessments that do not use race or ethnicity.

Before a DA can decide to press charges, and before someone charged with a crime can make bail, they have to be arrested — or, even better, deterred from committing a crime in the first place. Unfortunately, the “Defund the Police” movement has reduced resources available for policing in some cities while simultaneously discouraging police from patrolling in high-crime areas.

Ja’Ron Smith, a former special assistant to President Trump for domestic policy who now leads Public Safety Solutions for America, a coalition dedicated to principles that solve violent crime, said:

It’s important to have the best data available so we can make educated decisions on how to best solve for violent crime. Crime is a local problem. Studies show that violent crime is highly concentrated amongst a very small network of people within each city, so we need to leverage data to create evidence-based policy solutions to make communities safer, rather than playing politics with people’s lives.

Seattle, Washington, has been at the forefront of anti-police policies. Since 2020, the Seattle Police Department lost 525 officers to resignations and retirement and is finding it increasingly difficult to find qualified recruits. Violent crime in 2022 was the highest in 15 years. Murders were up 24 percent in 2022 compared to the year before. Motor vehicle theft was up 30 percent, with almost 70 percent of vehicles never recovered. And last June, the city police’s sexual assault unit was so short of staff that it stopped working on new sexual assault cases.

Should the collapse in local policing continue in Seattle and other major cities around the nation, how long it might be before governors consider deploying the National Guard to back up overwhelmed law enforcement departments?",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/16/is-crime-going-down-or-have-democrat-run-cities-just-given-up-on-reporting-it/,2023-02-16
Tree Of Life Families Contradict Claims They Want Death Penalty,"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is rumored to have national political ambitions, claims he reversed himself to oppose the death penalty after talking to families of victims of the Tree of Life mass shooting, but 9 of the 11 victims’ families say they support the death penalty.

In 2018, in one of the deadliest attacks motivated by antisemitism in American history, a gunman opened fire in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh during a morning worship service, killing 11 members of the three congregations that met there.

Nearly one year after the shooting, federal prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty for alleged shooter Robert Bowers, who faces a 63-count indictment. At the time, Shapiro was Pennsylvania’s attorney general and told the public “the killer deserved to be put to death.”

“For more than a decade, including when I assumed office as Attorney General, I believed that the death penalty should be reserved for the most heinous crimes – but that it was, indeed, a just punishment for those crimes,” Shapiro told an activist crowd at Mosaic Community Church in West Philadelphia on Feb. 16.

Now governor, Shapiro announced mid-February that he won’t just extend his predecessor Tom Wolf’s moratorium on execution warrants, he will also work with the state’s General Assembly to wipe the death penalty from Pennsylvania law “for good.” He claimed his flip-flop would “make our system more fair and more just” and clear his conscience after his son asked him why it’s okay to use death as punishment.

The Democrat credited the families of victims of the Tree of Life shooting for his change of mind.

“I’ve spoken to victims, to families, to advocates, and to community leaders. I listened to the members of the Tree of Life community and was blown away by their courage and their fortitude. They told me, that even after all the pain and anguish, they did not want the killer put to death. He should spend the rest of his life in prison they said, but the state should not take his life as punishment for him taking the lives of their loved ones,” Shapiro said. “That moved me. And that’s stayed with me.”

During a segment with CNN’s Jake Tapper about his 180, Shapiro once again attributed his decision to the family members who lost their loved ones during the shooting.

“I witnessed the courage and the grace of the families in Pittsburgh, who had a loved one killed while they worshipped, who said to me, ‘please, please discourage them from pursuing the death penalty,’’ Shapiro said. “If they could take that position after suffering what they did, then I certainly needed to rethink my position and I did.”

Despite Shapiro’s claims, nine of 11 of the victims’ relatives favor execution if the accused shooter is found guilty. In a strongly worded letter to the editor of the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle in November 2022, relatives of the murdered Bernice and Sylvan Simon, Cecil and David Rosenthal, Rose Mallinger, Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Daniel Stein, and Melvin Wax chastised locals for suggesting the accused criminal should not die for the massacre.

“These views do not represent the vast majority of the victims’ families; they are, in fact, contrary to our views,” the families wrote. “The opinion the writer has stated is their opinion and theirs alone. Please don’t tell us how we should feel, what is best for us, what will comfort us and what will bring closure for the victims’ families. You can not and will not speak for us.”

Accepting a guilty plea from the alleged shooter, the relatives noted, “will rob us of our ‘day in court’ and will prevent the Justice Department from punishing the perpetrator to the full extent of the law, as we have sought for the past four-plus years.”

“We, the undersigned, will feel further violated by letting the defendant have the easy way out. His crimes deserve the death penalty,” the families concluded.

Only one of the victims’ family members, Miri Rabinowitz, wife of Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz, publicly opposed the death penalty for the antisemitic murderer because she didn’t want to “relive the horrific circumstances of Jerry’s murder through a trial.”

Her pleas for lifelong incarceration for the alleged murderer were joined by leaders of two of the three congregations that met in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood synagogue: Rabbi Jonathan Perlman of New Light Congregation and his wife, who met with and wrote the Trump administration’s DOJ about their concerns, and President Donna Coufal of the Dor Hadash Congregation, who begged the DOJ to spare her congregation from more attention than it already received.

The family of victim Irving Younger appears to have never taken a public stance on the death penalty and Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of Tree of Life Congregation refused to commit to one side of the debate.

Contrary to Shapiro’s claims on national television, what the Tree of Life families and survivors believe about whether Bowers should face death if he is convicted is at best mixed. As the victims’ families stated in November, “most families of Pittsburgh synagogue victims support the death penalty for the shooter” and refusing to grant them that will “cause further harm to the victims’ families and the community as a whole.”

Bowers’s trial is expected in April of this year. If he is found guilty of the crimes alleged in the indictment by a jury in his first trial, he will proceed to face a second panel of jurors, who will determine whether his crimes fit the punishment of execution.

The defense previously stated that if the death penalty is removed from the list of punishments Bowers may face, he will plead guilty and take life in prison without trial. So far, the Biden administration’s DOJ has kept with the Trump administration’s rejection of that offer.
