Unmasking The Mustachioed Menace Of Microaggression,"UCLA professor emeritus Val Rust believed he was just correcting grammar and spelling mistakes of students in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, but according to students who staged a sit-in protest Nov. 14 he was displaying a form of racial “microaggression” against minorities in his class.

Microaggression is a term first coined by Harvard Medical School psychiatrist Chester Pierce in the 1970s that, at least in original meaning, describes situational, spoken or behavioural slights (especially unintentional) that convey ignorance, hostility or dismissal toward individuals belonging to minority or marginalized groups.

Pierce is also quoted as saying that all children of five-years-old entering school are mentally ill. The reason they’re mentally ill, according to Pierce, is the children’s loyalty to their parents, the Founding Fathers, and belief in God or a Supernatural Being. The education system must seek to correct these mental illnesses, Pierce argues. Which is all to say that Pierce is certainly not one to overstate matters or let his rhetoric get away on him. (Not that anyone was worried about that, right)?

To look at how subtly microaggression may manifest, let’s take an example.

A middle-aged, white male in a city with a white majority offers his seat to a kindly-looking black lady of an older age on a crowded subway train; nobody looks twice, perhaps the lady even smiles as she accepts the offer.

But did you know that the male individual may well have committed microaggression?

Well anyway, he likely wouldn’t know if he had, by definition.

In offering his seat to the kindly-looking older black woman (or even, God forbid, thinking of her in those stereotypical terms), the white man has made hurtful assumptions about her needing the seat more than him including her identity as a woman, older individual and member of a minority. Even if none of these thoughts or impressions crossed the man’s mind or the woman’s, they have subtly-imbued the interaction with a harmful aspect, potentially causing or contributing to long-term feelings of marginalization, ‘otherness’ and psychological damage for the woman.

A number of other variables including the woman’s sexual orientation, socio-economic status and religion could make the seemingly-harmless and chivalrous interaction a double, triple or even quadruple microaggressive whammy.

You won’t know it when you see it

According to the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), “One of the most harmful things about microaggression is that it’s very difficult to point out when it’s actually happening. Frequently people realize that microaggression threats have happened only in retrospection.”

Microaggressive individuals not realizing they’re being that way is the whole part of what makes it so oppressive for those on the receiving end, dude.

The AAPD lists microaggressive instances against people with disabilities that include focusing on their disability as a defining characteristic of the individual, showing undue concern for their disability, or assuming an ability based on outer appearance of said ability.

“Why do you need a wheelchair? I saw you walk… You can walk, right?” to a person who uses a wheelchair for traversing longer distances is given as an example of microaggression.

There are a number of other ways to commit microaggression in a racial sense, according to Fordham University’s information guide for professors on its Center for Teaching Excellence webpage.

According to the guide racial microaggression in the academic environment may include continuing to mispronounce a name after being corrected, assuming Latinos speak Spanish, disregarding religious holidays, assuming a knowledge of American culture among students, assuming the gender of any student, assuming students use or are familiar with social media and giving assignments based on any assumptions of heterosexual orientation or a traditional family background.

So in other words direct physical and social persecution is less traumatic than subtle, unintended slights that may happen inadvertently and accrue long-term devastating psychological effects.

Microaggression also includes using examples in the classroom that push “heterosexist” terminology such as “magnets are attracted to each other like males and females.”

Apparently electricians engage in heterosexist oppression daily when asking their coworkers to pass a female or male connector.

Heck, plugging a lamp in the wall is basically a hate crime.

Professor Derald Sue of Columbia University, who tackled the topic in his book Racial Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender and Sexual Orientation makes the following claim:

“The invisibility of racial microaggressions may be more harmful to people of color than hate crimes or the overt and deliberate acts of White supremacists such as the Klan and Skinheads.”

That sounds like a reasonable assertion. About as reasonable as a brick through your window in 1960s Selma, Alabama.

So in other words, direct physical and social persecution is less traumatic than subtle, unintended slights that may happen inadvertently and accrue long-term devastating psychological effects.

Where do we turn to for wisdom in times like these but the ever-leftwards-winding corridors of Academia? Why, even that masculine-looking bro-merang on your face may be microaggressing the crap out of someone without you realizing it.

You guessed it, chump. Those who grew a mustache recently for Movember may be a witting or unwitting party to what has become a veritable cauldron of microaggression boiling with “sexist, racist, transphobic, and misinformed” characteristics, according to Ralph Haddad, student Health and Education Editor at the McGill Daily, the student newspaper at one of Canada’s most prestigious universities.

Then again, as anyone following the political culture up in the Great White North would know, political correctness and aggression by the radical left has reached a veritable art-form in Canada, particularly on university campuses.

Never leaving aside an opportunity to bash the immensely-successful prostate-cancer awareness and fundraising campaign, Haddad attacks Movember for its supposedly implicit racial microaggression due to higher rates of prostate cancer among black men than white (this seems to suggest Movember is not for black men, an odd claim, but maybe it’s just in the in the fine print on the website), exclusion of Mo Sistas, indication of class or demographic privilege (not elaborated on, just clearly true), and insufferable insult to women with mustaches or who wish to grow mustaches or not shave their legs in a No-Shave November alternative to Movember. Most of all, by catering only to “cisgender” males Movember stratifies individuals according to the concept of gender, which is the biggest crime of all.

According to the Feminist Hub Tumblr page: “If a person is cisgender (most people prefer that the ‘-ed’ on the end is dropped, same thing with ‘transgender’), it means that they are comfortable identifying with the gender they were (coercively) assigned at birth … Gender identity is how a person relates to those assigned genders; when there is no dissonance, that person is cisgender.”

No detail is provided on the nature of the at-birth coercion process. Presumably a small baby boy or girl is brainwashed with incantations or rituals by an evil white, Christian male heterosexual authority figure of some kind into believing he is a boy or girl and will grow up to be a man or woman, thus making this awful event occur as he or she ages. It’s not, you know, these babies differing male and female biological makeup or any of that guff.

It’s all a construct, dude. Open your eyes.

The comment board of the “Movember as Microaggression” certainly got into the spirit of things. Quite near the top one comment-leaver remarks that “I’m offended by the fact that you’re offended by the fact that he’s offended.” and another commenting “Why is the list written in a BLACK font? #LatentRacism.” Mr. Haddad did not draw quite the swell of impassioned protesters he may have dreamed about. It’s almost as if there are real problems in the world or something. Regardless, they’re probably mustache-related problems, so I’m sure he’s onto something.

There’s no doubt, however, that some items considered as microaggression are unacceptable, but its growing popularity as a concept is problematic.

On victimization

A Buzzfeed piece by Heben Nigatu in which Fordham students display cards of examples of microaggression they’ve faced contains examples of disturbing ignorance and in some cases blatant racism, but roundly fails to convince that all cases, including where no offence or slight was intended were examples of the mysterious plight of microaggression. Also, some examples are upsetting, some moreso humorous (see the young man displaying a caricature of laughing as he holds a sign reading “You’re Not REALLY Asian,” (13). Other examples are quite compelling, such as the young man holding a sign reading “The limited representation of my race in your classroom does not make me the voice of all Black People”) (15).

So, to be clear, in the example of the laughing student microaggression can occur anytime, anywhere. Students of various ethnic backgrounds may have worked happily together in a study group with this individual, believing they were wholly-free from the blight of microaggression, only to realize upon seeing their friend show up on Buzzfeed, that he had felt insulted by not *enough* proper recognition of the uniqueness of his ethnic and cultural identity. Got mind-reading? The next study session must have been fun. Talk about awkward.

The piece gets truly close to undermining its own concept, however, when it includes number eight with a Caucasian young lady holding a sign reading, “No, you’re white.” The idea of unintentional racial microaggression in many instances depends on white people not realizing they’re being dismissive, ignorant or stereotype-forming about other ethnicities. Being told “no, you’re white,” by a minority presumably to mean you can’t understand, appreciate or fully take part in a certain activity, interaction or topic seems to be precisely what Dr. Sue et. al are saying is the reality.

Professor Sue will this be on the test, or can students just turn in an interpretive, multicultural-themed quilt instead?

Cornell University details how many university students of Asian background have experienced microaggression in a report “Racial Microaggressions and Daily Well-Being Among Asian Americans,” published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology (Vol. 60:2). The report is authored by Anthony Ong, associate professor of human development in Cornell’s College of Human Ecology, Anthony Burrow, assistant professor of human development at Cornell, Thomas Fuller-Rowell, Ph. D. ’10 University of Wisconsin-Madison, Cornell graduate student Nicole Ja and our old friend Dr. Sue.

Professors (presumably white, heterosexual professors in particular, and certainly not Dr. Sue or associate professor Ong, one would hope) are also alarmingly at risk of the heinous misdemeanor of microaggression, especially ones who don’t know about microaggression. The non-condescending message here to professors of all disciplines trying to teach students about any number of other subjects is: educate yourselves, microfelons.

But thankfully not all the professors have been playing hooky at a keg party with the politically-correct Kool-Aid.

Critics of the theory such as Professor Kenneth Thomas of the University of Wisconsin – Madison point out that microaggression reinforces a victim mentality for people of colour, and is likely to actually decrease candid interaction between people of different racial groups, not increase it.

“The theory, in general, characterizes people of color as weak and vulnerable, and reinforces a culture of victimization instead of a culture of opportunity,” ­he said.

The American Psychological Association notes that Thomas is white after quoting him, but does not refer to the ethnicities of any of the other individuals quoted or mentioned in its article “Unmasking racial micro aggressions.” Apparently it was only relevant to mention in his case.

It used to be that a jerk was a jerk, but now a jerk has entire avenues of tripwires to watch out for, since any regular boorish behavior will be differently interpreted and scaled depending on whom it is directed towards or impacts.

It used to be that a jerk was a jerk, but now a jerk has entire avenues of tripwires to watch out for, since any regular boorish behavior will be differently interpreted and scaled depending on whom it is directed towards or impacts. A white, heterosexual male boss with an aggressive leadership style, for example, may be given a full pass for putting extra pressure on his white, heterosexual male employees, but may well find other interactions fraught with a spiderweb of unintended tensions and unease. Or to take a different example, a female boss with a strong leadership style may create an uncomfortable work environment for some male employees, but fearing the spectre of microaggression charges a male employee may be less likely to speak up in case their complaints are characterized as an unfair reaction against their boss as a woman, specifically.

The problem with terms and concepts like microaggression is that they lend an academic, politically-correct air to the whole topic of prejudice and to the language around the resolution of prejudice. If growing a mustache or calling someone a man or woman is just as potentially offensive and marginalizing as saying ‘you’re really pretty for a dark skin girl,’ (see Buzzfeed piece) then by what scale is microaggression to be judged or assessed?

When fanatical social leftists earnestly pool actual, disappointing instances of prejudice and exclusion together with growing facial hair to support cancer research or a professor correcting spelling mistakes, you know some student body or college dean somewhere has crossed the Rubicon of ridiculousness (in a motorboat).

Academics like Pierce and Sue do a disservice to the real Civil Rights Movement and distort its progress in society today. Then there are other public figures, such as Oprah most recently, who continue to insist that there is significant opposition to President Obama based on his race among the voting public. What this means, ultimately, is that you cannot disagree with someone unless they are another member of your supposedly ‘dominant’ group and that evidence of racism by some in a majority group will be used as evidence of racism by all in that majority group.

This interesting video from 20/20’s ‘What Would You Do,’ turns the tables on the typical microaggression scenario, as it were, by seeing what happens when a black man brings his white girlfriend with him to his barbershop in Harlem and is faced with an actress playing a black woman who is racist against whites.

And it doesn’t just end at your run-of-the-mill microaggression. In his bumbling, privileged stumble through life the menacing white heterosexual male in particular, no matter how outwardly kind and decent-seeming, may also have committed numerous microassaults, microinsults and microinvalidations.

Some forms of microaggression appear to require magic spells and unicorn blood derived from a Harry Potter spell, while others may in fact exist in a parallel universe where breathing is a crime.

Shave that mustache

There’s also an issue with collectivism.

According to Daily Kos blogger Kali Tal (hepshiba), her “favorite” microaggression, or microinvalidation, specifically, is when a minority individual testimony or research on or about other minority group members is biased. Although unfair to assume, there’s no reason that the member of a minority group has any less chance of being biased about his or her own group than a white individual does whose research or testimony considers other white individuals, nor (as 15 points out) is there any reason to believe the member of a minority group is representative or expert on others of their same “group.” These sources need to work on co-ordinating their storyline a bit more here and resolve the revolving issues around collectivism and individualism that their microaggressionassertions bring up and potentially worsen.

As the UCLA students staged their sit-in, graduate student Emily Le, in addition to defending Rust on the charges of racial microaggression and creating a racially hostile climate in his classroom, was nonplussed that demonstrators were claiming to speak on behalf of all students of colour. Whatever happened to the whole don’t judge one person as representative of the whole concept?

The definition of microaggression expands microaggresively each working day.

According to the Sloan Centre on Aging and Work at Boston College, even joking to an older colleague at work by calling him “gramps” can be a subtle and ultimately very damaging form of microaggression. Like much of supposed microaggression it seems to be a matter of context, although intent presumably doesn’t factor in, as supposedly both aggressor and victim may be unaware of the self-esteem and psychological damage being done.

Other everyday situations at work may be fraught with microaggression too, according to Rick Haberstroh with the Birmingham Business Journal. Trying to treat everyone the same is supposedly the root of much of the suffering, with typical microaggressive statements such as “I don’t see your color,” to a black colleague (Chris Matthews had better watch out, it seems) and “I’m not homophobic, I have gay friends” doing great damage.

Asking something such as “You are Jewish right? You don’t mind me using Jesus’ name in our company picnic prayer do you?”of a colleague is also potentiallymicroaggressive Haberstroh claims, although its opposite in assuming a Jewish individual was comfortable with that scenario seems the more likely to potentially offend or alienate and fall under the category of microaggression.

But hey, if it offends someone, somewhere, especially the one claiming to speak on behalf of others, just call it microaggression.

That seems to be the message here.

In a society where curiosity or ignorance about the differences of others becomes an unpardonable faux pas that must be minutely-corrected and poor or potentially-condescending behavior is read with unintended undertones and injustices throughout, how much respect and understanding will really be built between individuals of different ethnic backgrounds, cultures, faiths or orientations?

Oh, and shave that mustache dude, it’s microaggressing me like you wouldn’t believe.

"Nelson Mandela, Ronald Reagan And The Cold War","The death of Nelson Mandela has unleashed a flood of commentary on a man who now belongs to the ages. Unfortunately, too much of that commentary ignores the extent to which Mandela – and his winning battle against apartheid – was a part and product of his times.

Specifically, much of the punditry by American liberals has recast Mandela’s story as a simple morality play in which a great man was kept down by his oppressors with the help (or at least the indifference) of American and British conservatives, foremost among them Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. In this telling, Reagan and Thatcher are portrayed as having no good or defensible reason for their actions. Instead, the narrative holds that external pressure on South Africa by liberal entertainers and politicians – including economic sanctions imposed over President Reagan’s veto in 1986 – freed Mandela, who went on to prove his conservative critics wrong and earn the admiration of the world.

Not every element of this narrative is factually wrong, but it is missing so much critical context as to be grossly misleading. Reagan was wrong about Mandela but right about the world, and in judging Reagan, that was what really mattered; Mandela was wrong about the world but right about South Africa, and in judging Mandela, that was what really mattered.

To understand Mandela’s flaws, why he was greeted with skepticism on the Right, and why he deserves to be lionized for rising above that skepticism, you must first consider both the global context of the Cold War and its regional impact on Southern Africa. And contrary to the liberal narrative, it was the end of the Cold War and the end of the regional agony of southwest Africa that made Mandela’s release and the end of apartheid possible.

Southern Africa and the Cold War

It is easy to forget now, but as recently as the late 1970s, international Communism was on the upsurge in the aftermath of America’s humiliating withdrawal from Southeast Asia – and many observers at the time felt the Communists had the stronger hand than the West. As an ideology of class struggle, Communism most naturally appealed to the Third World, where the poor are often desperately so and tend to vastly outnumber the middle class. In Southeast Asia, following the North’s conquest of South Vietnam in April 1975, Pathet Lao took control of Laos in December 1975 and the Cambodian domino fell in 1976, leading to one of the worst genocides in world history over the next four years. In Central America, the Communists gained their first foothold on the American mainland when the Sandanistas overthrew the Somoza regime in Nicaragua in July 1979. In Central Asia, the Soviet Union itself invaded Afghanistan in December 1979.

But no region offered more opportunities for the expansion of Communist tyranny in the late 1970s and early 1980s than sub-Saharan Africa, in particular the southern quarter of the continent, which was beset with an alphabet soup of left-wing guerilla movements. South Africa’s immediate neighbor to the northeast, Mozambique, became independent from Portugal in 1975 after nearly a decade-long war of independence. Its new ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), declared Mozambique a Marxist-Leninist state in 1977, and set itself on a course of persecuting the churches and triggering a massive humanitarian crisis by shuttering the country’s many religiously-run hospitals. In response, a Rhodesian-backed resistance movement, the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), launched a civil war that would eventually claim the lives of nearly a million Mozambicans and created some 5 million refugees, about a third of Mozambique’s population. FRELIMO received Soviet support; while much of the West refused to support RENAMO due to its own savagery, the South African regime eventually became its primary source of support after the demise of Rhodesia and its replacement by Robert Mugabe’s regime in Zimbabwe.

Inland from Mozambique, and also bordering South Africa, lay Rhodesia, independent from Britain since 1965 and ruled by Ian Smith’s white-minority government. Rhodesia had declared its independence unilaterally, which was resisted by Great Britain (Rhodesia was never diplomatically recognized by South Africa, although its government ended up being effectively propped up by South Africa). Its white ruling regime faced a two-headed insurgency from the black majority population: the rural, Chinese-backed Maoist group ZANU, headed at the time by Robert Mugabe and Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, and Joshua Nkomo’s Soviet-backed ZAPU. In early 1978, under international pressure from – among others – the U.S. and South Africa, Smith agreed to a power-sharing agreement with moderate black Bishop Abel Muzorewa, an accord designed to ease Rhodesia into participation and ultimately majority control by the black majority, while explicitly preserving a political power base for the white minority (including guaranteed legislative seats) and empowering the moderate factions within the black majority. Unfortunately for Zimbabwe’s people, Mugabe and Nkomo rejected the agreement and refused to make peace, and Muzorewa wasn’t a strong enough leader to bring them to heel. By February 1980, the accord had been torn up and Mugabe elected President, where he remains today, with increasingly tragic consequences.

In the 1980s, Mugabe was not yet the full horror he would later become, but he was already a cautionary tale. In 1982, Mugabe sent troops into Mozambique on the side of FRELIMO, and would remain embroiled in its civil war until 1992. Also in 1982, Mugabe ejected Nkomo from his unity government, and Zimbabwe’s North Korean trained and officered Fifth Brigade, engaged in massacres of the Ndebele people, who were on the losing side of the ensuing ZANU-ZAPU feud that would last until 1987. Mugabe was also engaged in a long-running campaign to demonize white farmers (they would eventually face formal confiscation of their land beginning in 2000).

To the northwest of modern South Africa lies what was then the South African province of South-West Africa, now the independent state of Namibia. North of that lies Angola, which like Mozambique had won its independence from Portugal in 1975 (in other words, both Angola and Mozambique had also only emerged from white rule of their black populations in the mid-1970s). Independence was, there as well, followed by a vicious civil war between the Soviet and Cuban backed People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the South African-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas Savimbi. At the peak of the fighting in the late 70s and early 80s, Fidel Castro maintained anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000 Cuban troops in Angola, a major proportion of the fighting strength on the MPLA side. The CIA had sent covert aid to UNITA under the Ford Administration until the 1976 passage of the Clark Amendment, which banned aid to the combatants in Angola; eventually, in 1985, the Reagan Administration was able to obtain the repeal of the Clark Amendment and provide open support to UNITA.

Meanwhile, South African rule in South-West Africa had been challenged since 1966 by a war of independence launched by the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO). By the early 1980s, South-West Africa was in the crosshairs of both the regional and global power struggles between South Africa and the various Soviet-aligned forces in Angola; SWAPO aligned itself with MPLA and its Soviet and Cuban allies. Billions in Soviet aid flowed into SWAPO’s war against both the South Africans and UNITA. The wars in Angola and South-West Africa often spilled over each other’s borders and effectively merged into a single, wider war.

Moreover, given the history of Cold War conflicts from Korea to Vietnam to Hungary to Afghanistan, there were real reasons to worry that this situation would escalate, especially if things went badly for the Cubans. In 1981, the Soviet Union admitted it had military advisers in Angola, after two of them were killed in clashes with South African troops. That threat was one of the drivers of South Africa’s nuclear ambitions; its already-covert nuclear program, under Defence Minister P.W. Botha, went to ground in the late 1970s due to international pressure from both the U.S. and Soviet blocs, although South Africa would retain the warheads until the end of the 1980s.

The region’s various warring factions also had a destabilizing effect on Zambia, which sits to the north of Zimbabwe, as a result of the tendency of whichever faction was out of power in Rhodesia, Angola, South-West Africa or South Africa to decamp across the border into Zambia. And north of Zambia lay Tanzania, under the rule of Julius Nyerere; Nyerere went to war with Idi Amin’s regime in Uganda (to his north) in 1979, the Soviets backing Amin (who was aided by troops from Qaddafi’s Libya and Arafat’s PLO) while the Chinese backed Tanzania.

To put this in American terms, imagine that you were trying to rally support against Jim Crow in Florida, but the end of segregation in the rest of the region had resulted in oppression of whites and attempted genocide in South Carolina, a Marxist regime in Georgia, a civil war in Mississippi stoked by an army from Louisiana, and Alabama invading the panhandle arm-in-arm with an expeditionary force of Cuban Communists.

This was the world in which Botha became Prime Minister in 1978, and in which Nelson Mandela – held in a South African prison since 1962 and sentenced to life in 1964 for conspiring to overthrow the South African government – would increasingly become an international cause célèbre as the 1980s wore on. It was a region beset by one variety or other of Marxist movements (even UNITA had its own communistic leanings) and treated as a playground for foreign interference by a variety of players in the Cold War scene, first and foremost the Soviet Union and its allies. It was a region short on clean hands (as the roster of atrocities committed by virtually all the combatant forces in the various wars could attest) and long on corrupt and brutal governments (in Zimbabwe’s case, a government bent on racial revenge). South Africa was by no means regarded in Washington or London as a virtuous ally, but what it represented was the region’s strongest military and economic power and one that implacably opposed the region’s Marxist tilt.

Mandela The Communist Fellow-Traveler

In Reagan’s search for allies against Communist domination of southern Africa, it’s easy to see why Nelson Mandela would not have seemed a promising prospect. Because, for all his later merits, Mandela gave every impression of being cut from the same ideological and political cloth as Mugabe and the region’s other Communists and fellow-travelers.

The true extent to which Mandela was a believing and active Communist in the early 1960s, or during his imprisonment, remains a matter of some debate to this day. After his death, the modern South African Communist Party claimed “Comrade Mandela” as having once been an active leader of the Party, but then its self-serving motives in wanting as large a piece of his legacy as it could grasp are fairly obvious. But as Greg Myre at NPR observes, “Comrade Mandela” wasn’t that far from the truth:

Mandela’s…African National Congress has been closely aligned for decades with the South African Communist Party. Members of both organizations studied and received military training in the Soviet Union. And while Mandela and other ANC leaders called for a multiracial democracy, many members of his group viewed communist countries as more sympathetic to their cause than Western nations.



British historian Stephen Ellis published a 2011 paper citing documents from the South African Communist Party that state Mandela was one of the group’s leaders.



Whatever Mandela’s role may have been, his open alliance with the Communist Party was often cited by South Africa’s government and some conservatives in the United States as reason to be suspicious of him and the ANC’s intentions.



For years, the U.S. labeled the ANC a terrorist group because it carried out attacks against civilian targets in South Africa. And it was Mandela himself who established the ANC’s armed wing in the early 1960s before he was imprisoned.

Bill Keller at the New York Times elaborates:

Although Mandela’s African National Congress and the Communist Party were openly allied against apartheid, Mandela and the A.N.C. have always denied that the hero of South Africa’s liberation was himself a party member. But Ellis, drawing on testimony of former party members and newly available archives, made a convincing case that Mandela joined the party around 1960, several years before he was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the government.



…“Today, the A.N.C. officially claims still to be at the first stage … of a two-phase revolution,” Ellis told me in an email exchange. “This is a theory obtained directly from Soviet thinking.”



Indeed, the remnants of Communist protocol and jargon — “comrades” and “counterrevolutionaries” — live on in the platform and demeanor of South Africa’s ruling party.

Ellis’ work also shines light on the ANC:

His book also provides fresh detail on how the ANC’s military wing had bomb-making lessons from the IRA, and intelligence training from the East German Stasi, which it used to carry out brutal interrogations of suspected “spies” at secret prison camps.



…Its campaign of “sabotage” and bombings over the subsequent three decades claimed the lives of dozens of civilians, and led to the organisation being classed as a terrorist group by the US.



In his book, Professor Ellis, who also authored a publication on the Liberian civil war, elaborates on other murky aspects of the ANC’s past. One is that bomb-making experts from the IRA trained the ANC at a secret base in Angola in the late 1970s, a link disclosed last year in the posthumous memoirs of Kader Asmal, a South African politician of Indian extraction who was exiled in Ireland. He was a member of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement, which, Prof Mr Ellis says, in turn had close links to the British and South African Communist parties.



The IRA tutoring, which was allegedly brokered partly through Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, led to the ANC fighters improving their bombing skills considerably, thanks to the expertise of what Mr Ellis describes as “the world’s most sophisticated urban guerrilla force”.



Angola was also the base for “Quatro”, a notorious ANC detention centre, where dozens of the movement’s own supporters were tortured and sometimes killed as suspected spies by agents from their internal security service, some of whom were “barely teenagers”. East German trainers taught the internal security agents that anyone who challenged official ANC dogma should be viewed as a potential spy or traitor.

One of the more notorious episodes was the 1983 Church Street car bombing, which killed 19 people and wounded 217 at a South African Air Force facility. The bombing was pinned on the ANC by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which found it was authorized by ANC president Oliver Tambo. Tambo at the time stated that Church Street was a legitimate target. Botha offered Mandela release in 1985 if he would renounce violence; Mandela refused:

Mandela’s reply was read out by his daughter Zindzi, at a huge stadium in Soweto: “Let him renounce violence. Let him say that he will dismantle apartheid. Let him unban the people’s organization, the African National Congress. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people, are not free.”

This was a courageous stance, but it was also one that had to concern American policymakers who feared yet another civil war in the region. Peter Beinart argues that Mandela’s immersion in Communist ideology had the unusual effect of encouraging him to move beyond thinking along racial lines, a habit that would stand him in good stead when he sought national reconciliation. But even if this is so, exposure to Marxist thinking had no such effect on Mugabe or other African leftists, and there was no good reason to expect it of Mandela in 1985.

Mandela never really stopped being an America-bashing leftist even after his release; Andrew Kaczynski at Buzzfeed collects some quotes from his later years illustrating that point, as does Tim Graham at Newsbusters. Myre:

Mandela was at odds with U.S. foreign policy on multiple occasions.



He remained loyal to those who provided moral and financial support to his group during the years when the ANC had few friends in the West. This led Mandela to meet and praise leaders such as Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi.



The year after he was freed, Mandela called Castro “a source of inspiration to all freedom-loving people.”



Mandela also spoke out against the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and took issue with the U.S. campaign against Iran’s nuclear program.

Michael Moynihan notes Mandela’s lifelong callousness towards the human-rights victims of anti-American dictators, with specific recent examples from Iran.

Mandela would attain world renown as a “political prisoner,” and Reagan himself would demand Mandela’s release in his 1986 veto message:

[L]et me outline what we believe are necessary components of progress toward political peace.



First, a timetable for elimination of apartheid laws should be set.



Second, all political prisoners should be released.



Third, Nelson Mandela should be released to participate in the country’s political process.



Fourth, black political movements should be unbanned.



Fifth, both the Government and its opponents should begin a dialogue about constructing a political system that rests on the consent of the governed, where the rights of majorities and minorities and individuals are protected by law. And the dialogue should be initiated by those with power and authority, the South African Government itself.

But Mandela’s sentence to life imprisonment was unjust only because the system he sought to overthrow was unjust. He was not jailed for peaceable civil disobedience, which he had tried and seen crushed in the 1950s, but for conspiring to violent overthrow of the South African government – and he admitted at trial that he was guilty of precisely that:

“I do not deny that I planned sabotage. I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites.”

As Mandela justified himself at the time:

“We had either to accept inferiority or fight against it by violence. We chose the latter.” [Mandela and a co-defendant] strongly denied they were Communists. The charges against Mandela, former leader of the banned African National Congress, and the other accused include sabotage involving nearly two hundred incidents.



…Mandela spoke for nearly five hours. He said: “I do not deny that I planned sabotage. I did not do this in a spirit of recklessness. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment.”…



He concluded in June, 1961, that violence was inevitable and that it would be unrealistic for African leaders to continue a non-violent policy when the Government “met our demands with violence.”



He said: “This decision was not easily made. The decision was made to embark on violent forms of struggle. I felt morally obliged to do what I did.”

Thus, Mandela’s release nearly three decades later was not an admission by the government of his innocence or wrongful conviction, but a deliberate step towards reconciliation in spite of his guilt and in recognition of the ultimate justice of his grievances – a gesture that Mandela would reciprocate with a remarkable lack of bitterness despite those grievances.

Should Mandela be condemned for being an anti-American Communist sympathizer? Back in the 80s, Newt Gingrich was one of a group of young conservatives pressing Reagan for a harder anti-apartheid line. Newt, as he often does, frames his defense of Mandela today in the context of America’s own Founding Fathers:

[L]et me say to those conservatives who don’t want to honor Nelson Mandela, what would you have done?



Mandela was faced with a vicious apartheid regime that eliminated all rights for blacks and gave them no hope for the future. This was a regime which used secret police, prisons and military force to crush all efforts at seeking freedom by blacks.



What would you have done faced with that crushing government?



What would you do here in America if you had that kind of oppression?



Some of the people who are most opposed to oppression from Washington attack Mandela when he was opposed to oppression in his own country.



After years of preaching non-violence, using the political system, making his case as a defendant in court, Mandela resorted to violence against a government that was ruthless and violent in its suppression of free speech.



As Americans we celebrate the farmers at Lexington and Concord who used force to oppose British tyranny. We praise George Washington for spending eight years in the field fighting the British Army’s dictatorial assault on our freedom.



Patrick Henry said, “Give me liberty or give me death.”



Thomas Jefferson wrote and the Continental Congress adopted that “all men are created equal, and they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”



Doesn’t this apply to Nelson Mandela and his people?



Some conservatives say, ah, but he was a communist.



Actually Mandela was raised in a Methodist school, was a devout Christian, turned to communism in desperation only after South Africa was taken over by an extraordinarily racist government determined to eliminate all rights for blacks.



I would ask of his critics: where were some of these conservatives as allies against tyranny?



Where were the masses of conservatives opposing Apartheid? In a desperate struggle against an overpowering government, you accept the allies you have just as Washington was grateful for a French monarchy helping him defeat the British.

Keller takes a similar line:

The early collaboration of the A.N.C. with the Communists was a marriage of convenience for a movement that had few friends. The South African Communist Party and its patrons in Russia and China were a source of money and weapons for the largely feckless armed struggle, and for many, it meant solidarity with a cause larger than South Africa. Communist ideology undoubtedly seeped into the A.N.C., where it became part of a uniquely South African cocktail with African nationalism, Black Consciousness, religious liberalism and other, inchoate angers and resentments and yearnings.

The view of Gingrich and Keller view is the charitable one: that the Communist component of Mandela’s ANC was basically a marriage of necessity, like the Spanish and Chinese anti-Fascist alliances of 1937, or the Western alliance with Stalin a few years later. This is an important point – but the irony is that Newt’s defense of Mandela’s Communist ties is also the conservative defense of not taking a harder line against South Africa in the final decade of the Cold War, while Marxism and Soviet influence menaced the southern part of Africa. It is the sober realization that the long-term and wider cause of freedom may require short-term alliances of convenience with enemies of freedom. Liberals may reject the concept of alliances driven by interest rather than principle, but conservatives, long accepting of this reality and recognizing that the difference between a nation’s allies and its enemies is always a meaningful, should grant Mandela the same understanding as Reagan, FDR, and Washington in this respect: he made the allies he needed to advance a just cause.

Reagan and South Africa

Ronald Reagan had been a keen and interested observer of the African scene for years before his Presidency, and his assessment of South Africa was based on neither ignorance nor indifference, but instead reflected Reagan’s overall strategic view of the region.

Reagan’s own writings – his contemporaneous speeches and diaries, pre-Presidential radio commentaries and post-Presidential memoirs – reveal, first of all, that his attention was far more regularly focused on Angola than South Africa. That’s unsurprising: Angola was part of the larger regional and global proxy war against the expansion of Communist tyranny, whereas apartheid – after the demise of Rhodesia in 1979 – was sui generis, a problem unique to one country.

As to Reagan’s thinking about South Africa, four themes clearly emerge from his writings. First and foremost is the fact that the South African regime was both anti-Communist and pro-American (Reagan was fond of citing the fact that South Africa had been on our side in every 20th Century war and had, at least as of the beginning of his Presidency, never voted against the U.S. in the UN). Given the preeminence of Cold War geopolitics in Reagan’s approach to every corner of the world, that was obviously a paramount consideration.

Second, Reagan was fond of reminding his listeners that the United States was only a decade removed from the painful end of Jim Crow, and that perhaps Americans should be more humble and understanding of the difficulty in bringing an end to such abuses. In this sense, of course, he was at direct odds with American liberals and African-Americans in particular, who viewed the struggle of black South Africans as an extension of their own and – indeed – a litmus test for domestic commitment to civil rights. (Black Americans, of course, are by no means unique in pressing our foreign policy to areas of interest to them; Irish, Jewish and Cuban voters, among others, have long done the same). Yet Western liberals in this period had comparatively little interest in the suffering of black residents of Angola, Namibia, Mozambique or Zimbabwe.

Reagan was not shy about reminding other governments of their human rights violations, and he was not shy about the evils of apartheid. But he also understood from our own experience that while government force may be necessary to prop up systemic discrimination, curing it is a deeper social issue than removing a dictator or a totalitarian system.

Third, Reagan was concerned that South Africa’s black population was a powder keg of tribal rivalries and tensions that could explode if white rule was removed abruptly. This was not a far-fetched possibility, given the then-recent history of the region and the longer history of the tribal conflicts around the Cape (recall that the “national” boundaries of Africa mostly reflect the division of spoils among European colonizers, not national identities). While tribal tensions remain an enduring issue all over Africa, the fear that South Africa would go the way Yugoslavia went in the 1990s proved unfounded, in part due to the unifying influence and example of Mandela (as well as the disappearance of outsiders looking for proxies).

Fourth, Reagan was skeptical towards economic sanctions in general. Bear in mind, he had campaigned in 1980 against Jimmy Carter’s grain embargo against the Soviet Union – and nobody would accuse Reagan of having been soft on the Soviets. Rather, he saw the sanctions as counterproductive and more harmful to American farmers than to their target, and he got them repealed in April 1981. British sanctions against the white Rhodesians had been spectacularly unsuccessful and widely flouted. Granted, Reagan supported the continuance of sanctions against Castro’s Cuba – but Cuba is an island, and aside from impoverished Haiti and tiny Jamaica and the Bahamas, its closest neighbor is Florida. By contrast, as Reagan explained in his veto message in 1986, South Africa’s economy was deeply intertwined with that of its neighbors, and thus even if sanctions worked, they would play havoc on neighboring economies (and, it hardly needed be added, strengthen the influence of the Soviets in those economies):

The primary victims of an economic boycott of South Africa would be the very people we seek to help. Most of the workers who would lose jobs because of sanctions would be black workers. We do not believe the way to help the people of South Africa is to cripple the economy upon which they and their families depend for survival.



Alan Paton, South Africa’s great writer, for years the conscience of his country, has declared himself emphatically: ”I am totally opposed to disinvestment,” he says. ”It is primarily for a moral reason. Those who will pay most grievously for disinvestment will be the black workers of South Africa. I take very seriously the teachings of the Gospels, in particular the parables about giving drink to the thirsty and the food to the hungry. I will not help to cause any such suffering to any black person.” Nor will we.



Looking at a map, southern Africa is a single economic unit tied together by rails and roads. Zaire and its southern mining region depends upon South Africa for three-fourths of her food and petroleum. More than half the electric power that drives the capital of Mozambique comes from South Africa. Over one-third of the exports from Zambia and 65 percent of the exports of Zimbabwe leave the 13,000 workers from Swaziland, 19,000 from Botswana, 50,000 from Mozambique and 110,000 from the tiny landlocked country of Lesotho. Shut down these productive mines with sanctions and you have forced black mine workers out of their jobs and forced their families back in their home countries into destitution.



…As one African leader remarked recently, southern Africa is like a zebra: if the white parts are injured, the black parts will die, too. Western nations have poured billions in foreign aid and investment loans into southern Africa. Does it make sense to aid these countries with one hand and with the other to smash the industrial engine upon whch their future depends?

Reagan was not averse to putting pressure on South Africa, despite its status as an ally; as Peter Robinson notes, Reagan in 1985 unilaterally (by executive order) expanded U.S. military and diplomatic sanctions against South Africa, extending U.S. policies first put in place by President Kennedy around the time Mandela was first imprisoned. He deliberately chose a black ambassador to South Africa, Edward Perkins, in 1986 to send a message to Botha. But he believed economic sanctions could drive the region further into Soviet arms.

The Endgame

Causation is the most elusive of things in history, but just as U.S. relations with South Africa between 1975 and 1986 cannot be evaluated outside the context of the Cold War, the end of apartheid and the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in February 1990 and his rise from political prisoner to be elected South Africa’s head of state in May 1994 cannot be evaluated outside the context of the end of the Cold War (symbolized by the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and 1990 reunification of Germany) and the collapse of Soviet Communism, culminating in the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union itself. The timing of these events was not coincidental.

The crucial event was the signing on December 22, 1988 in New York of the Tripartite Accords, a peace treaty between South Africa, Cuba and Angola brokered by the outgoing Reagan Administration after seven years of diplomacy by Reagan’s long-time Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Chester Crocker (the point man for Reagan’s policies in South Africa, Namibia and Angola from 1981-88). The superpower groundwork for the Tripartite Accords was laid at a June 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Moscow. All parties involved recognized that declining Soviet ambitions in the region meant an end to funding for future Cuban and Angolan adventures; the South Africans recognized as well that this meant less American interest in supporting UNITA. It was time to make the best peace that could be had, and it ensured independence for Namibia and an end to both Cuban and South African military involvement in Angola and Namibia.

Events on the ground also favored a settlement at that point. In the spring of 1988, the armed forces of South Africa and UNITA faced off in battle against Cuba, Angola, and SWAPO at Cuito Cuanavale in southern Angola, the largest land battle in Africa since El Alamein. Both sides regarded the battle as a victory, the Cubans because the cream of Castro’s military forces had bailed out an Angolan offensive that had failed miserably the previous summer and gone over to the offensive against the South African army, the South Africans because the Cuban counter-offensive had ultimately been halted at a time when Cuba was running out of support from Moscow. Mandela himself, echoing the Cuban view of the battle, later described it as ““the turning point for the liberation of our continent — and of my people — from the scourge of apartheid.” Regardless of the military merits of these claims, the fact that both sides could claim a face-saving outcome greased the skids for the superpowers to use their financial leverage to force a settlement. It is noteworthy that Mandela regarded that settlement as intimately connected to the end of apartheid in South Africa.

After the Tripartite Accords, other dominos fell in place. Free elections in Namibia followed in 1989, giving power legitimately to SWAPO. With the loss of Soviet and South African support for the combatants, a new Mozambican Constitution allowing for multi-party elections was drafted in July 1989 and adopted in November 1990; a peace treaty between FRELIMO and RENAMO would be signed in 1992. Savimbi, who kept up the fight within Angola, would participate in elections in 1992, although he would eventually be killed a decade later, never having abandoned the sword. But for the most part, the region would still lean left, but would be on its own, free to make its own mistakes. Southern Africa has had a hard two decades since, ravaged by the AIDS epidemic and the decline of Zimbabwe into squalor, but it has nonetheless been an era of relative regional peace.

The end of Soviet-sponsored mayhem in the region was good news for its people, but bad news for a white South African regime whose usefulness to the United States and excuses for resisting racial progress were rapidly evaporating. As in corners of the globe from the Philippines to El Salvador to Yemen to Afghanistan, the end of Soviet and U.S. financing of proxy wars not only toppled Communist regimes, but also eliminated much of the value that alliances of convenience had provided to the United States. The de Klerk government, like Gorbachev in Moscow, recognized the new reality, and set out on the path of making its peace with Mandela accordingly. The end of apartheid is thus not a sour or discordant footnote to America’s Reagan-era victory in the Cold War, but one of the fruits of that victory and one that the Reagan Administration had hoped for and labored for.

The Healer

In the long run, it is by deeds that men are judged, and most of all by their use of power that the ideals of statesmen are tested. As Shakespeare wrote in Mark Antony’s funeral oration for Julius Caesar, “the evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.” In the final analysis, Nelson Mandela was one of those remarkable few whose good deeds would have an impact on the world long after his mistakes and sins faded into history. To a large extent, the reason for this is that Mandela’s character ultimately mattered more than his ideas. His willingness to choose the example of Lincoln in charity towards all and malice towards none, and the example of Washington in relinquishing power when he could have had it for life – rather than the examples of Mugabe, Castro, or Lenin – was the ultimate test of his character, and one he passed.

Reagan and others in the West erred in underestimating Mandela, not because they misunderstood his words or his allies, but because they misjudged the character of the man. After all, as a friend writes, “Those who believe Mandela was obviously a reconciliation-minded hero before 1990 willfully ignore the circumstances of nearly every one of his political type before him, from Mugabe to Nkrumah to Nasser to Indira Gandhi and much beyond. The list of left-wing figures who appealed to liberal principles while out of power, and then governed as bloody-minded authoritarians when in it, is long. In fact, it’s most of them. Caution that Mandela would prove yet another of their number, when his background was so drearily common in their ranks, was simply prediction born of empiricism.” It was common for Marxist revolutionaries – even Castro – to dissemble about their Marxism until they had consolidated power, and perilous to ignore that possibility.

Undoubtedly a factor in the failure to take the measure of Mandela was the lack of opportunities to observe a man who had been held in the most isolated of confinements since the Kennedy Administration. Almost none of the major policymakers in the West had met Mandela or knew anyone who had. Reagan had the opportunity to take the measure of African leaders, as he did of Gorbachev or Thatcher; he met with Mugabe and found him a droning blowhard while he was much more impressed with Mangosuthu “Gatsha” Buthulezi, the Zulu leader who bitterly opposed sanctions but was regarded by the ANC as a collaborator with Botha.

But nobody could meet Mandela. Instead, at most, they dealt with his wife Winnie – and while Winnie’s reputation in the West was higher in the 1980s than it would be subsequently, the fact remains that she was more intimately tied than her husband to human rights violations by the ANC during Mandela’s term of imprisonment, including the notorious practice of “necklacing” (torturing and executing black ‘collaborators’ with the white regime by burning oil-soaked tires around their necks). As the Guardian delicately put it at the time:

In 1986 she embarrassed the anti-apartheid community with the statement in a speech that “we shall liberate this country” with “our boxes of matches and our necklaces” interpreted as an implicit endorsement of the political killings by burning which did enormous damage to the anti-apartheid movement between 1984 and 1987.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ultimately concluded (p. 581 of its report) that Winnie was “politically and morally accountable” for “gross violations of human rights,” and Mandela would divorce her after his release. In retrospect, it is unsurprising that she did not always present the most convincing face to the West for her husband’s non-violence and forbearance.

Printing The Legend

The fall of the Soviet empire and the collapse of Communism worldwide vindicated Reagan and his allies beyond what anyone else had imagined in the 1980s. Leftists and liberals were left shell-shocked at how comprehensively their arguments had been discredited, and so it should surprise no one that they latched onto Mandela, their one moral victory in the Cold War’s denouement, their one claim to having been right while the conservatives were wrong. Their veneration of Mandela has only grown in the years since, secure in the understanding that telling his story longer and louder than the story of Reagan’s victory over worldwide Communism would teach a new generation a different calculus of the relative scope of the evils of apartheid and Communism. For Barack Obama, for example, talking about Mandela is much less uncomfortable than talking about Obama’s support at the time for the disastrously wrongheaded Nuclear Freeze movement.

But Mandela’s story and Reagan’s are inspiring enough in their own right without distortion, and while it may be historically unfortunate that they misjudged each other – just as Churchill misjudged Gandhi’s cause while Gandhi misjudged Churchill’s grander struggle against Hitler – in the end, both were vindicated in the causes that meant the most to them. History is big enough for both.

A Call To Reparations Is A Dangerous Call To Victimhood,"Ta-Nehisi Coates’ essay, The Case for Reparations, has been published to great fanfare. By journalistic standards it is a massive tome which does not deliver on the promise of “groundbreaking” original content. Nevertheless, in light of the noisy discussion the article has generated, it is worth examining the article’s actual content and considering its merits.

On my assessment, the essay accomplishes three things, one good, one bad, and one ugly. His argument for the contemporary relevance of historical racism is arresting and thought-provoking. This is the best part of the piece. The argument for reparations is unpersuasive, but perhaps (as Kevin Williamson has suggested) instructively so; by spelling out the argument for reparations Coates illustrates how weak it actually is.

Regrettably, much of the essay is really devoted to honey-tongued pandering to the pathologies of the left. This is unfortunately the part that most thrills Coates’ ecstatic admirers.

The Contemporary Significance of Historical Oppression

Coates has a gift for affecting more nuance than he really offers. It’s impressive how he manages to weave such elegant circles around such a brutally simple argument. In some ways this is irritating, but there are upsides. The eddies and side channels are really the most interesting part of this piece.

Hence his final conclusion: America owes them.

He takes us on an extended tour of black history, with the goal of establishing three things. First, racism was a very, very bad thing which did grave injustice to large numbers of black Americans. Second, America’s current prosperity was to a great extent made possible by slavery and other forms of exploitation. Third, black Americans today are struggling in a myriad of ways, and this is a fairly direct consequence of the injustices they have suffered. Hence his final conclusion: America owes them.

That slavery and racism were gravely unjust is obvious, but the essay still provides some historical perspective that may be useful. We are reminded that the legacy of obvious and deliberate oppression really can’t be written off as ancient history; there are plenty of people alive today who were once at the front lines in combatting racism, or in perpetuating it. Looked at against the backdrop of history, those wounds are still quite fresh. Even if we restrict our narrative to the history of our own relatively youthful country, the unhappy truth is that on racism has been a significant phenomenon for, unfortunately, the majority of our history.

Given how juvenile and peevish our modern-day discussions of race often become, it can be useful to dip back into that history once in awhile. In our eagerness to move on from the mistakes of the past, we can sometimes become a little impatient. It’s fairly normal for a society to require an extended period of time to fully come to terms with such a grim history of enslavement and oppression. Realizing that, we should try to engage erroneous liberal arguments with good humor.

Given how juvenile and peevish our modern-day discussions of race often become, it can be useful to dip back into that history once in awhile.

And in fact, Coates is fairly persuasive in his efforts to link the struggles of contemporary black Americans back to historical oppression. I say “fairly” because his argument is predictably incomplete. On the plus side, he does convict New Deal progressives of their complicity in the segregationist agenda of Southern Democrats, which allowed black Americans to be herded into segregated neighborhoods where became deeply entrenched in poverty. It’s good to see that history recounted in a high-profile publication. Later progressive policies (from the 1960’s and beyond) receive gentler treatment, which is unsurprising but also unfortunate; these are the policies that are most directly blighting the prospects of the poor today.

Anyone familiar with Coates’ work would have seen this coming; he has established in the past that he is unwilling to condone any criticism of contemporary black culture until historical grievances have all been adequately addressed. This of course is terrible news for the urban poor, since it disallows most of the conversations that would offer some chance of making their lives better. Still, conservative readers who are already familiar with the part of the story that Coates omits may find it enlightening to reflect on the extent to which the ravages of the Great Society were themselves a not-so-indirect consequence of historical racism. Although the grim effects of welfare dependence and widespread social collapse are now manifesting themselves across poorer demographics nationwide, few were hit as quickly or as catastrophically as the black community. There were reasons for that.

Owing not just to slavery, but also to twentieth-century discrimination, black Americans were in a particularly vulnerable position when Great Society reforms were instituted. Thanks to centuries of enslavement and oppression, they were already poor, ill-connected and segregated into mostly-black neighborhoods. It’s hardly surprising that the winds of cultural destruction wreaked particular devastation in their communities. Progressives don’t deserve to be given a pass for their ill-conceived policies, but it’s still valuable for conservatives to remember that racism is still relevant to the economic and cultural struggles of black Americans today.

The (Unpersuasive) Case for Reparations

It’s reasonable enough to argue that impoverished black Americans deserve particular solicitude from their compatriots. But in actively calling for reparations, Coates wildly overshoots.

It’s true, of course, that we can’t make history right just by eliminating racism today. We can’t make it right at all. That’s the first point.

He tries to generate sympathy for his cause by likening our legacy of historical oppression to a massive load of credit card debt, suggesting that overcoming the racist views of our forbears (assuming that we have) is merely analogous to bringing profligate habits under control. It doesn’t eliminate the debt. Reparations must be paid before we can truly have a clean historical slate.

It’s true, of course, that we can’t make history right just by eliminating racism today. We can’t make it right at all. That’s the first point. The second is that the living always inherit a complicated legacy from the dead. It’s not an argument for reparations. It’s just a regular part of the human experience.

The living always inherit a complicated legacy from the dead. It’s not an argument for reparations. It’s just a regular part of the human experience.

One major problem with Coates’ essay is that he says very little about reparations as such. His focus is almost entirely on documenting injustices done, and instilling an appreciation for black Americans’ contributions. As interesting as that might be, it sheds almost no light on the weirdness of trying to make up for centuries of oppression through one grand act of expiation. History is full of injustice, and the fortunes of particular individuals are always affected (in good ways and bad) by elements of their own background and family history that are beyond their control. That isn’t per se a defect in our own society. It’s how the world is.

Black Americans may (on average) be born into less advantaged circumstances than their white compatriots for historically explicable reasons, and we may reasonably lament that fact. We may regard it as an act of patriotism to help our struggling compatriots improve their lot. But there’s a reason why it isn’t standard practice to litigate inter-generationally on behalf of enormous, loosely-defined groups of people. It’s a process that would never end, and the effort would itself inevitably precipitate further injustice that would then call for further redress. That is why, as Williamson persuasively argues, we have to consider present-day individuals as individuals, and leave generalized historical injustice in the past.

Although he never provides an explicit discussion of the morality of reparations per se, Coates does seem to recognize that he needs to mark this particular historical injustice as distinctive or exceptional in order to justify such an unusual course of action. He tries to draw such a distinction, but it’s not compelling.

There’s a reason why it isn’t standard practice to litigate inter-generationally on behalf of enormous, loosely-defined groups of people.

Coates suggests that there is a deep causal relationship between America’s present wealth and the historical oppression of black Americans. Perhaps it’s true (he might suggest) that we all, in a contingent sense, owe our present existence to a variety of historical circumstances. We can’t ask the law to provide redress every time those prove personally disadvantageous. But, suppose our nation’s present prosperity is, in some deep and necessary way, predicated on injustice. Might that give us a more compelling reason to offer reparations to the exploited, or at least to their present-day, still-disadvantaged descendants? Might it really be necessary to do so, in order to enjoy our goods and freedoms without guilt?

The argument has great emotional appeal, because it is satisfying to suppose that benefitting black Americans might be seen as an act of justice and not of mercy or (worse) pity. There’s nothing patronizing about reparations if they can be seen as “back wages” due for services historically rendered. And, if today’s prosperous Americans are still reaping long-term benefits from those services, it’s not really unfair to ask them to pay the tab.

Conceptually it seems neat, but the argument really isn’t sound.

Conceptually it seems neat, but the argument really isn’t sound. First and most importantly, it’s just not the case that thriving democracies require a foundation in slavery and oppression. In fact, comparing the economic and political fortunes of countries or regions that relied heavily on slavery (such as Brazil) to regions that didn’t (such as Great Britain or the American north), one could quite plausibly make the argument that slavery is economically disadvantageous over the longer term.

Even mentioning this in the context of Coates’ hideous account of grave injustices done to black Americans (families broken, women raped, children lynched) seems almost irreverent, but what this really shows is the complete irrelevance of the entire line of discussion. The evil of slavery could never be justified by any economic or political benefit we may have derived from it, and no apology will be sufficient to right the wrong. By the same token, though, slavery is not written intrinsically into our economic or political DNA. We needn’t perform special ablutions in order to expel the demon; it is enough to repudiate it as completely as we can, and to endeavor to live up to higher American ideals.

The Moral Importance of Being American

Coates has set hearts on fire by assuring his readers that there are still a few morsels of consciousness-raising sweetness left in the race-relations goodie box.

Given the almost ludicrously effusive praise that has been lavished on Coates (documented here), one would assume that he must be extraordinary in some way. He is. Unfortunately, the part of the essay that has liberal souls quaking is really its most insidious element. Coates excels at giving effete, mostly white, mostly over-educated liberal progressives a sense of historical momentum. Few things are more satisfying to the progressive, or less useful to the struggling poor. In this instance, Coates has set hearts on fire by assuring his readers that there are still a few morsels of consciousness-raising sweetness left in the race-relations goodie box.

I have written before about the vitally important role the Civil Rights movement plays within the progressive psyche. For liberals, the desire to re-experience the satisfaction of racial rapprochement often takes priority over all manner of sound policy considerations; predictably, the (disproportionately black and Hispanic) poor pay the heaviest price for this selfishness. Liberals are delighted with Coates because he has assured them that another thrilling episode remains unwritten in the Civil Rights narrative that they so dearly love.

Fretting about triggering and hash-tagging is much more satisfying than sorting out grubby, plebian problems like scarcity and sin.

However much one admires the historical segments of his essay, it’s impossible not to smirk when Coates gets around to mentioning that the “reparations” he calls for might not really involve money so much as changed paradigms and raised consciousness. These, of course, are favorite liberal themes. Fretting about triggering and hash-tagging is much more satisfying than sorting out grubby, plebian problems like scarcity and sin. But here especially, the call for consciousness-raising is simply foolish. If a national conversation about race could fix the problems of urban poverty, it’s safe to say that those problems would be solved.

In my more charitable moments, I can actually believe that the liberal obsession with race has some roots in a genuine thirst for justice. Oppression is ugly and its effects still haunt us; liberals yearn to see the nation made new through one grand act of expiation. Through the collective will of the American people, the lingering scars of racial hatred should simply be erased and the field leveled; the shadows of the past should be vanquished through one great outburst of light.

If a national conversation about race could fix the problems of urban poverty, it’s safe to say that those problems would be solved.

I can see the appeal. But it isn’t possible, and the dream begets suggestions that are not just impracticable, but actually offensive. This is clearest in the final portion of Coates’ essay, in which he uses the precedent of Germany’s post-World War II reparations to Israel as a model for the kind of gesture he has in mind. He doesn’t seem to see how utterly inappropriate this comparison is.

This is true, in the first place, for practical reasons. Money can never really atone for murder, but at least the Holocaust was a recent, discrete event of limited duration. To some extent the losses could be counted, and actual survivors compensated.

Even more important, though, is the fact that these reparations were paid from one nation to another. Germans had harmed Jews, so Germany paid Israel. The line between oppressor and the oppressed was, if not exactly glowing, at least bright enough to give everyone some sense of justice. No such line exists in the case at hand.

Coates’ suggestion is not merely impracticable. It is injurious to the integrity of our society, and especially to the honor of those he claims to champion.

Black Americans are Americans. The history Coates reviews is part of our shared history, just as much as the Constitutional Convention, the Louisiana Purchase, Pearl Harbor or Woodstock. This heritage is rightly a source of pride and of shame to every citizen, but there is no way that We the People can collectively compensate a broad segment of our population for wrongs perpetrated against the dead. Even attempting to do this would imply that certain citizens are “victims” of history rather than its rightful inheritors, with the obvious further implication being that they have a lesser share of that patrimony. This seems to me like a grave insult that no patriotic American would want to accept.

Coates’ suggestion, therefore, is not merely impracticable and pie-in-the-sky. It is injurious to the integrity of our society, and especially to the honor of those he claims to champion. No reparation could truly make up for past injustices. They will stand forever as a stain on our history. At the same time, there can be no better repudiation of those sins than the acceptance of black Americans, neither as an underclass, nor as a protectorate, but rather as full-fledged citizens of our nation, with all the rights and responsibilities that that entails. We cannot “owe” them any more without effectively giving them less.

None of this is to say that we should turn a blind eye to entrenched poverty and social collapse. We should in every way be assiduous to find solutions, searching constantly for more effective ways to promote the thriving of our most disadvantaged citizens. But we should do this as Americans, eager to build a more just and more prosperous nation for all of our compatriots. Only that way can we heal the scars of dark ancestral sins.

Shelby Steele On Race And The Exhilaration And Terror Of Freedom,"One of the most vomitous and hideous regressions of American culture is the eager embrace of victimhood as a means of self-identification from Americans of seemingly all ages and races. Attendance is down at professional baseball games, perhaps because America’s new pastime is the effort to understand yourself as a victim of “income inequality,” “white privilege,” or some other dubious buzzword that substitutes for its more accurate descriptor – self-pity. Academic jargon and liberal sentimentalization provide a cover story for people who find perverse enjoyment in believing and acting as if they are victims. In their drive to illustrate the defeatism of their philosophy, “to be human is to be a victim,” they reject the empowerment accessible through an acknowledgement of their agency, and their ability of overcome adversity to achieve.

Shelby Steele, the great social critic and political commentator, makes the point that the Civil Rights Movement has such resounding beauty and inspirational force because it was entirely self-generated. Its spirit of dignity and integrity lived within an independent body. Martin Luther King, Fred Shuttlesworth, Rosa Parks, and the millions of activists and artists they represented received little governmental assistance. In fact, at most times, they encountered vicious government resistance. The heroes of the Civil Rights era were not people quick to identify as victims, but warriors willing to face down the most cruel and bloodthirsty enemy, and prevail. Steele, an African-American born and raised in Harvey, Illinois, is a veteran of the black freedom struggle, and now continues the work as a fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Comparing the Civil Rights personification of strength with the weakness of trigger warnings, seminars on white privilege, and the whining of occupiers, makes one wonder if a large portion of America has fallen under the spell of some difficult-to-diagnose disorder of the psyche. In such confusing times, it is wise to turn to a man whose brilliance and bravery qualifies him for the task of performing a psychiatric evaluation better than most. Recently, I had the honor and thrill of speaking with Shelby Steele – author of the classics The Content of Our Character, White Guilt, and a forthcoming book on “the polarization of America” – on the phone about race, conservatism, liberalism, President Obama, and the exhilaration and terror of freedom.

Steele quickly undressed the ethos of an unending episode of “America’s Biggest Loser” that seems to define our cultural transformation by going beyond politics, and directing a flashlight directly on the darker corners of human behavior: “One has to go to human nature. There’s a part of human nature when people – particularly young people or minorities – who have very little experience in the mainstream or experience being responsible for their own advancement in the mainstream, are afraid. In other words, they wonder if they won’t be able to make it on their own. When you go through six years of an economic downturn where jobs are scarce, people are insecure. Then, the idea that ‘I’m a victim of someone else’s greed or cruelty or indifference’, is seductive.”

“We say, ‘we’re for individual responsibility.’ Well, guess what? That’s not the most appealing position for a 23 year old straight out of college without a job.”

The seduction leads to a flirtation with self-abdication, and allows for the calming of self-doubt, but it conceives a certain brand of politics and political reform. Steele explains, “Once you say you are a victim, you can then say, ‘I’m going to get things. I’m going to get health care. I’m going to get subsidies here and there. I’m going to get’.” “It’s an incentive system and it’s effective,” Steele said with an anxious laugh, “and it makes me nervous for the conservative side, because we don’t offer those seductive, but empty promises. We say, ‘we’re for individual responsibility.’ Well, guess what? That’s not the most appealing position for a 23 year old straight out of college without a job. He wants to believe that income inequality is driving his reality, and if he believes that, he’s going to want the Democratic machinery to move him forward.”

In my conversation with David Mamet (a friend of Steele’s), the legendary playwright identified one of the tasks of a healthy society as giving young people the opportunity to pass tests, and steadily replace the “fear of matriculation” with the “memory of physical accomplishment.”

The understandable and universal fear of matriculation has morphed into a fear of meritocracy, and an emphasis on victimization, no matter how invented or convoluted, is the result. It provides an alibi for absence, and a trapdoor for escape from any system of responsibility, accountability, or judgment.

“… freedom is the most terrifying thing in the world, because what freedom says is, ‘It’s all on you now.’”

“As a black American, I saw very vividly in the 1960s when we won the Civil Rights legislation and Voting Rights – That constituted a real victory, and it gave us our first experience of freedom,” Steele explained. “We were vastly freer than we ever were before. What everybody at that time missed – I certainly did – is that freedom is the most terrifying thing in the world, because what freedom says is, ‘It’s all on you now.’ Freedom sits there in judgment of you, and makes you feel extremely inadequate if you don’t have the values and skills necessary to thrive in freedom. So, we were right away seduced by the idea that we can be spared the idea of individual responsibility with the Great Society. When we scream that we are victimized all the time, it spares us the terror of freedom.”

I once taught for several years at a predominantly black high school. The experience forced a collision between my ideology and reality, given that I was liberal and suffered from white guilt. Black students – like white students – fail or succeed according to their own merit, skill, and diligence, and the most important factor shaping their capacity for success is their familial upbringing. To continue to believe that black people are noble victims desperately in need of help in perpetuity is to relegate them to roles of infancy, and to transform white liberals, bureaucrats, and politicians into parents. The history of African Americans – from Duke Ellington to Barack Obama – is not only a history of oppression, but a history of accomplishment. Encouraging young black Americans to embrace victimhood and fear freedom is to encourage them to retreat back into the womb, but it is at the heart of the entire liberal program – a program that, in the soft language of pity and charity – calls black people “inferior.”

“… we were lucky enough to come along just before the seductive voice of white guilt started whispering to us that we were victims.”

“It’s worse than oppression was,” Steele said referring to the peddling of victimhood, “I grew up under segregation, and no one saw us as victims. No one cared about us one way or the other, which left us free to pursue our own lives, even if we were so constricted. In the community where I grew up, everybody had a father in the home. Everybody worked. This was a very poor, black neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago. Many of the children I grew up with became doctors and professors. The kid across the alley became the head of the FBI for Western America. One started a supermarket chain in Texas. There are so many enormously successful people, and that’s because we were lucky enough to come along just before the seductive voice of white guilt started whispering to us that we were victims. My parents certainly never gave an inch for that. You got good grades in school and you worked hard. If you weren’t getting good grades, it was on you. This is very simple, but it is very profound.”

The profundity and simplicity of rugged individualism is politically no match, according to Steele, for the “poetic truth” that “drives the left.” “It is a truth”, Steele said, “that bends the truth in order to make a certain point. So, this claim that America is still a structurally and systemically racist society is a poetic truth. There’s very little actual evidence to support that claim, but it is a claim that, given American history, seems plausible on its face. The left, then, wants to embrace that plausibility, wants to build a politics out of it, wants to pursue power out of it, wants to reconstruct society, and social engineer based on a perception of America that is no longer true.”

“The left, then, wants to embrace that plausibility, wants to build a politics out of it, wants to pursue power out of it, wants to reconstruct society, and social engineer based on a perception of America that is no longer true.”

One of the most amusing and infuriating ironies of American culture is that liberal pundits and boring politicians continually call for a “national conversation on race” in the middle of national conversations on race, whether they are provoked by George Zimmerman or Donald Sterling. There is the foul whiff of desperation surrounding the liberal transformation of isolated incidents into an indictment of America as white supremacist, a desperation that Steele submits is the result of the realization that “the left doesn’t have much else.” “Theirs is an ideology devoted to the uplift of the underdog. Well, what if there is no underdog, or if it is insignificant?” Steele asks before quickly answering his own question, “Then they are out of business. They will be unable to make a claim on power. So, as the society improves, ironically the left has to distort more and more to make us look far worse than we are. There has to be victims, because without them the left has to go away.”

Steele believes that the left feels empowered by the shifting demographics of America. “We’re becoming a much more varied, multicultural society. The left sees this as an opportunity to convince these people (immigrants, various ethnic groups) that they are victimized by the ‘one percent’ and ‘white privilege’, and if they can do that they will have political success. They are very imaginative at coming up with ways to consider people victims.”

The academic education of Shelby Steele uniquely qualifies him for scrutinizing and criticizing American culture, and it provides insight into his ability to seamlessly transgress boundaries between social and cultural topics, while it also partially accounts for his engaging essayistic voice, which combines social analysis with memoir style reflection on his own life. Steele earned a Master’s Degree in sociology from Southern Illinois University, and a Ph.D. in literature from the University of Utah. He claims to have taught his favorite book – Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man – dozens of times, and his penchant for picking up on the subtleties for narrative equips him with the intellectual tools necessary for deconstructing America’s complications and contradictions, especially as they pertain to race and politics.

“… what really saddens me is when you have young minorities figuring out new ways to play the victim, and asking for things like reparations.”

His 20/20 cultural vision enables him to sketch out reasons for pessimism and optimism. I asked him if he sees an endpoint to the victimization addiction. Will America eventually turn around and embrace freedom, with all of its rewards and troubles, or will the American people – black and white – continue to demand more subsidies, assistance, and protection? The latest essay from liberal literati god – Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has fashioned a literary personality resembling Jeremiah Wright, just without the sense of humor – called “The Case for Reparations” is already receiving effusive praise, and is perhaps a harbinger of the left’s downward trajectory. “It’s going to be awhile before all of this ends,” Steele explains, “especially when you have people like Coates, who is relatively young, and that’s what really saddens me is when you have young minorities figuring out new ways to play the victim, and asking for things like reparations. What are reparations going to do?” Steele asks with a tone of voice that betrays the absurdity of his rhetorical question, “Give me $25,000, so I can buy a Volkswagen? Reparations are not going to give anyone the skillset to handle freedom.”

In the seminal essay, “Superman Goes to the Supermarket,” Norman Mailer endorses John F. Kennedy for President by explaining how Presidents are as much cultural figures as they are political ones, and that they have as much influence on culture as they do on politics. Liberals of the victimhood disability, of which Mailer and Kennedy were not, are enjoying their moment right now, partially because of President Obama’s influence on American culture. “He’s pumped gas into this idea of victimization, and he’s found new groups to include,” Steele said. The President is an immensely successful man, but he’s “done nothing to get us beyond the trap,” Steele claims, “Because that’s the vote he depends upon.”

As the Obama Presidency awkwardly flutters toward the unforgiving smack of the pavement, liberalism might grow more desperate (arguing for reparations, telling white people to “check their privilege”, putting trigger warnings on Mark Twain books) to advance their narrative, and in doing so, “become more visible for the corruption that it is,” as Steele puts it, “because it is so ineffective.”

“They are cannibalistic,” Steele warns of the left, “They are weakening us.” Shelter is available for liberalism, however, and it is built by the growing absurdity of political correctness – An “application of power,” Steele calls, “naked moral intimidation.”

If political correctness collapses underneath its own oppressive weight, and the exposure Steele describes soon begins, room might open for the advancement of a “black conservative movement” Steele identifies as “growing and beginning to flourish,” despite the predictable stigmatization of “Uncle Tom” labeling and “sell out” branding. “The movement is entirely based on a rejection of victimhood, and an embrace of individual responsibility,” Steele said.

“Well, what Republican is going to say that? I don’t know any, because it takes tremendous courage.”

“Republicans have to stand up to minorities and say, ‘We care about you, and it is precisely because we care about you that we want you to know that you are not victims. There are opportunities for you all over this free society. Are they as lucrative as the ones in the wealthy precincts of society? Probably not, but they are valuable anyway,’ Steele said speaking in the voice he hopes Republicans soon adopt. He continued, his tone becoming more emphatic, “‘Why not organize a parents group and insist that the local school really educate your children with basic skills so that they can become competitive right away? Why not reinforce this at home? Why not do the old fashioned things that actually work instead of waiting around for fancy governmental intervention?’ Well, what Republican is going to say that? I don’t know any, because it takes tremendous courage.”

Among all the speculation over how Republicans can win support among non-white voters, Steele is seemingly alone in advocating for “frank talk” and not the “patronizing flank of victimhood.”

“America should be ashamed of itself over what its done with fifty years of patronization.”

“There’s no way the government is going to come into your house and guarantee that your kids are studying,” Steele said while explaining that his view is merely consistent with the self-reliance and self-sufficiency engendered and embodied by the Civil Rights Movement. “You have to join yourself with an ethic that makes you proud that you are doing that. We have gotten very far from that ethic, and there’s a vast underclass now of millions of lost people, who were never there when I was a kid during segregation. America should be ashamed of itself over what its done with fifty years of patronization.”

The honesty that leads to vulnerability, despite the insecurity that accompanies it, is the only way forward for a real positive message, and a victory for legitimate and promising anti-poverty programs. “People call the Republican party the ‘stupid party.’ Maybe Republicans are stupid, but it is the party that comes closest to articulating and representing the principles I cherish,” Steele said before turning to political strategy, “Start your speech by saying, ‘Half the people here will call me racist, let’s just get that out of the way right now. You need to take control of your own lives and realize that the new Civil Rights movement is not about income equality, but dignity. I’m here because I want to make a better America, and I want you to be an important part of that America.”

“Start your speech by saying, ‘Half the people here will call me racist, let’s just get that out of the way right now.'”

“We say that things are complicated usually when we’re just afraid to do them,” Steele said before concluding, “I think black Americans are definitely ready for the message of individual responsibility.”

To believe and behave otherwise is to act according to the “soft bigotry of low expectations.” Jim Crow stated that black people were inferior to whites, and therefore should be expelled from white society. The modern ideology of victimhood states that blacks are inferior to whites, and therefore need perpetual assistance from white society. Same master, different robe.

As the vision and brilliance of Shelby Steele makes clear, the battle between victimology and responsibility is not so much a clash between political parties, as it is theater in the war between the strength and cowardice both elemental to human nature. The worst part of the embrace and enjoyment of victimhood is that it surrenders all control of life to the people most adept at manipulation through the promise of rescue.

As Ralph Ellison wrote in Shelby Steele’s favorite book, Invisible Man, “Life is to be lived, not controlled.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates on Reparations: A Hammer in Search of a Nail,"Post-racial politics is officially over.

The hope that electing the first black president would put an end to the era of racial politics has long ago seemed quaint, along with many other exaggerated expectations for Barack Obama. But now we have proof that a whole new era of racial politics is just beginning.

The new era is heralded by a long article by Ta-Nehisi Coates in The Atlantic titled “The Case for Reparations.”

It’s not so much the article itself, but a reception for it that is so rapturous it borders on orgasmic. Mollie Hemingway collects some of the more embarrassing praise: the article is “revolutionary for the field of journalism” and “justifies the existence of magazines”; “‘Must read’ is nowhere near strong enough”; it is “a text that should be taught immediately” and “confirms his position as the greatest writer of our generation.”

God forbid that anyone should react that way to anything I ever write, because it’s a build-up no author could hope to make good on. Coates’s article, while impassioned and occasionally eloquent, kind of falls apart about three-quarters of the way through, as if he doesn’t really know where to go with it, and ends on an inconclusive note. So no, they won’t be teaching this text.

That’s why the reaction is so significant. It’s not that people were swept away by the overwhelming logic of the piece. Instead, they were ready and primed for something like it. The idea of reparations for slavery has been kicked around since—well, since 1865, and well before then. It has bubbled up a few times in the past couple of decades but without much enthusiasm. Now the enthusiasm seems to be here (at least, until Hillary decides she needs the votes of blue-collar whites). The question is: why?

A close reading of Coates gives us a good idea of the answer.

The first thing to note is that, despite its title, this is not actually a case for reparations. Coates never describes what reparations would consist of, who would pay them, who would be eligible for them, how the system would work, how it would avoid creating new victims of injustice—those caught on the wrong side of higher taxes or preferential treatment—or how anyone would make the political case for it. In other words, all the topics you would cover if you were actually, you know, making a case for reparations.

So what is the point of the article, if not that?

The first clue is that this argument is not about reparations for slavery, either. Coates devotes relatively little space to slavery and talks instead about “black reparations,” i.e., reparations for anyone who is black, presumably by anyone who is not black (though that’s one of the many issues that is left vague and unsettled). His case is about racism in general and how it has limited the opportunities that have historically been open to blacks in America.

This is a subject about which he writes eloquently and with sincere feeling. And it is definitely worth taking a good, hard look; there were many aspects of this story that I was already aware of, but a few that were new to me. So as a cri de coeur about the evils of racism and the unrepaired harm it has done to its victims and their descendants, the article is effective.

But racism, as such, is an offense that is general and diffuse, in many cases involving actions that are reprehensible but neither criminal nor tortious, and it seems impossible to devise a concrete, specific system of compensation for the victims. So Coates does not attempt to do so.

Instead, he gives us a spectacular punt.

Broach the topic of reparations today and a barrage of questions inevitably follows: Who will be paid? How much will they be paid? Who will pay? But if the practicalities, not the justice, of reparations are the true sticking point, there has for some time been the beginnings of a solution. For the past 25 years, Congressman John Conyers, Jr., who represents the Detroit area, has marked every session of Congress by introducing a bill calling for a congressional study of slavery and its lingering effects as well as recommendations for “appropriate remedies.”



A country curious about how reparations might actually work has an easy solution in Conyers’s bill, now called HR 40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. We would support this bill, submit the question to study, and then assess the possible solutions. But we are not interested….



No one can know what would come out of such a debate. Perhaps no number can fully capture the multi-century plunder of black people in America. Perhaps the number is so large that it can’t be imagined, let alone calculated and dispensed. But I believe that wrestling publicly with these questions matters as much as—if not more than—the specific answers that might be produce.

So this is not a case for reparations. It is a case for thinking about reparations, with such thinking to be done at a later time by other people. It’s like one of those UN negotiations where diplomats hold meeting at which they agree to hold more meetings.

But since reparations have been bounced around for so many years, this doesn’t seem quite adequate. If you want to add anything new to the discussion, you have to go farther. You have to actually demonstrate that this is a real, workable idea.

Yet the punt is instructive, because it tells us what this piece is actually about: it’s about making the case that America is guilty.

Coates doesn’t just offer up a long litany of injuries and injustices suffered by blacks due to slavery, segregation, and racism. He goes farther to claim that these injustices are inherent to the American system, that these evils are “the roots of American wealth and democracy.”

He never really attempts to demonstrate this. He provides a long list of moving anecdotes about individual victims of racism, but no systematic accounting of the overall role of slavery in the American economy and political system and no attempt to balance it against other (much larger) economic and ideological forces. Instead, he outsources this point to a few quotes from historians like the unreconstructed Marxist Eric Hobsbawm, who is cited for the claim that the Industrial Revolution was built on slavery (as opposed to, say, Watt and Boulton’s steam engine). Let’s just say that a guy who spent his career whitewashing the Soviet Union is not a good authority on the subject of slave labor.

Ideologically, far from slavery being somehow essential to America’s founding, many of America’s Founders knew that it contradicted their doctrine of individual rights and that the country would eventually have to reckon with the question of how to eliminate it. Economically, from the very beginning it was widely remarked upon—Alexis de Tocqueville discusses it at length in Democracy in America—that America’s slave states were much less productive than its free states. American agriculture was expanded, not by the plantations of the slaveholders, but by the homesteads of the pioneers; American industry was driven, not by slave labor, but by innovation, not by cotton but by steam engines and steel mills.

Coates cites figures about how dependent the America economy supposedly was on slavery, which would imply that the country should have undergone an economic collapse immediately after the Civil War, when quite the opposite happened. Indeed, in his telling of American history, the Civil War is inexplicable. You would think no white person wanted it.

In fact, the Civil War happened precisely because the balance of wealth and population was tipping against the slaveholding states. As Northern politicians sought to block the westward expansion of slavery, the Southern states saw that they would be a quickly shrinking minority in Congress, and they tried to get out of the Union before the inevitable moment when it would ban their “peculiar institution.”

But Coates gives us an utterly one-sided history in which America’s struggles over slavery, segregation, and racism are not taken seriously. He pursues his indictment of America with a prosecutor’s zeal, and he is not about to admit any evidence that would mitigate the guilt of the defendant.

In service to this indictment, he likes to play it both ways. Government-backed red-lining of mortgages to exclude black neighborhoods is part of the indictment, but so is the expansion of sub-prime mortgages into those same neighborhoods, which was promoted precisely as a remedy for the old red-lining. The exclusion of most Southern blacks from Social Security is part of the indictment, but so is the construction of high-rise public housing projects in black neighborhoods.

Coates keeps bumping into the ill effects of the welfare state’s attempt to combat black poverty, but he never confronts the implications. A huge motivator of the War on Poverty and the Great Society was precisely to provide compensation to blacks for the historical injustices of segregation and racism. The fact that this didn’t work out should surely be at the center of any attempt to grapple with the concept of reparations. But Coates skips past it.

Well, you know what they say: If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In this case, if you want a hammer, you have to make everything look like a nail.

That’s the best way to understand Coates’s case: he wants to be able to use the historical injustices of racism as a political hammer to accomplish—well, whatever he wants to accomplish. Hence the vagueness about what reparations would entail and how they would be implemented. He just wants the hammer, and he’ll decide later what should get pounded flat.

That’s the point of the Conyers proposal for a congressional commission on reparations. Coates presents this as an attempt merely to “study” the issue, which implies that he must think his audience is incredibly naive. Anyone who watches politics knows the purpose of this kind of commission. The whole game is to stack the commission with people who back your preferred approach, and then use the supposed authority of the commission’s recommendation to label opponents as unreasonable. Given the ability to staff such a commission, Democrats would treat reparations the way they treated the stimulus bill: as a great omnibus to be loaded with whatever welfare-state proposals they already wanted anyway.

The reparations commission is a hammer, meant to set up the argument that if you don’t go along with its welfare-state remedies, you must be a racist.

This is the wider sense in which the issue of reparations is a political hammer. Coates bills it as an attempt at racial healing, but again, he must think we’re naive. He knows that any attempt to set up a system of reparations will meet extensive resistance. And since the proposed reparations will almost certainly consist of an expansion of government and of the welfare state, with a concomitant expansion of taxes to pay for it, he must expect that reparations will be opposed specifically by Republicans.

I think that explains some of the renewed enthusiasm about reparations: it is an attempt to indefinitely extend the pattern of voting by racial blocs. Coates’s piece is best read alongside a recent analysis by Thomas Edsall in the New York Times. It bills itself as a kind of impartial and dispassionate examination of the idea that Republicans can win elections by appealing to the white vote alone without engaging in any outreach to minority voters, as opposed to the Democrats’ strategy of winning elections by appealing to a coalition of minority voters. The not-so-subtle theme of the piece is that Edsall is goading Republicans to please, please, please embrace their assigned role as the party of white people, letting Democrats keep a monopoly on the minority vote—in the hope that minority voters will eventually constitute a majority.

That is the deeper sense in which this is the beginning of a whole new era of racial politics. In the last two presidential contests, Democrats got a taste of how they could win elections by mobilizing racial blocs, but they also know that President Obama won’t be on the ballot again, so this moment will be difficult to recreate. That’s where the argument for reparations comes in. It is a perfectly divisive issue, meant to provoke a backlash among blue-collar whites and to be opposed by Republicans, and therefore to maintain the racial polarization of the electorate.

This is not just narrow electoral politics. It ties in to a deeper ideological goal of the left. If America was founded on slavery and racism, then the American system is inherently illegitimate, and every aspect of it is subject to being thrown out or fundamentally transformed. It’s all fair game. Specifically, every part of the economy is fair game. As Coates puts it: “The wealth gap [between blacks and whites] merely puts a number on something we feel but cannot say—that American prosperity was ill-gotten and selective in its distribution.” Capitalism is based on the security of the right to private property. But Coates’s argument is that all private wealth is presumed to be stolen goods subject to forfeiture to the state.

That’s a sweeping goal, to be sure, but it’s not really about ending racism or about what’s best for black people in America. If the injury suffered by blacks is poverty, the remedy should be a policy that helps them rise up out of poverty and accumulate wealth. Yet Coates keeps gliding away from any serious consideration of what such a policy would be. Worse, he goes out of his way to dismiss some of the known and established steps for climbing the rungs of the economic ladder. He dismisses the importance of marriage, fathers, homeownership, and the rest, on the grounds that it’s all an illusion nullified by white racism: “Adhering to middle-class norms has never shielded black people from plunder.” As for those blacks who have been successful by adhering to these values, they are “exceptional” and supposedly prove nothing about what is possible for everyone else.

Coates clearly comes to this discussion with a pre-existing animus against capitalism, and reparations just serves as another legal, political, and rhetorical hammer to attack it.

Yet that does not mean that we should dismiss his arguments. There is a lesson here for the right, and especially for those of us who are seeking to recast the free-market agenda to make it relevant to a wider audience. The legacy of segregation and racism—often backed by government intervention—is real, and we should take it seriously. But in some ways, the worst legacy is the degree to which capitalism and Americanism are already de-legitimized in the minds of many blacks. We’ve let the Democrats, the party of slavery and Jim Crow, win back the black vote, while the party of Lincoln let it slip away.

Yet capitalism was never the culprit behind racism. Segregation entailed systematic violations of private property rights, a refusal to enforce tort laws and the sanctity of contracts, and a vast network of economic regulations. It was not capitalism but an attempt to exclude a whole class of people from capitalism. And to exclude them from capitalism meant to exclude them from economic advancement and the accumulation of wealth.

If the actual injury to black Americans is exclusion from the benefits of capitalism, then the real remedy is greater inclusion in the capitalist system, the system of work, savings, ownership, entrepreneurship, and wealth-building.

That’s precisely the opposite of the solution suggested by Coates and his hyperventilating fans. Yet this is the kind of “reparations” that would actually do the most to improve the lives of blacks and put an end to America’s bitter history of adversarial racial politics.

Here’s The Worst Part of Thad Cochran’s Victory,"In Mississippi, decrepit perpetual incumbent Senator Thad Cochran narrowly won a primary run-off against a Tea Party challenger by appealing to black voters who normally back the Democrats. Without these votes, he probably would have lost by a good margin.

This has been denounced as a dirty trick, an attempt to tip the scales of a Republican primary by drawing in Democratic voters. But hey, dirty tricks are a part of politics, and people who get upset about it are usually angry because they didn’t think of it first.

What’s actually disturbing about Cochran’s reliance on black voters is the nature of his appeal—and what it says about the degeneration of racial politics.

Cochran appealed to black voters by pointing to the federal pork-barrel spending and welfare benefits he brings to the state. This kind of political pitch is as old as the hills. What is new is using it openly and specifically as a racial pitch. As a local observer tells The Guardian, Cochran’s campaign was “sending mailers to people in black Jackson neighborhoods touting Cochran’s supposed support of public schools, HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] funding, and ‘blight protection for minority communities,’ even as people in richer, whiter neighborhoods were getting Cochran mailers featuring all white men and Cochran touting his pro-NRA, anti-abortion cred, and his ‘more than 100’ votes against Obamacare.”

Meanwhile, Cochran did not exactly have a history of appealing to black voters in the state, as you might expect from a politician of his generation in Mississippi. This report writes off Cochran as a product of the “Southern Strategy” who is accustomed to employing “coded, ‘wink-wink’ racism.” That’s the spin of a left-leaning observer, of course, but it is fair to assume that this view would have widespread currency among the black Democrats who turned out to vote for Cochran. So they “voted almost exclusively for the federal money Cochran brings home—not for the party that abandoned African-Americans back in the 1960s.”

Is this what racial politics all boils down to—that it’s not about who is racist or who isn’t, but merely about who can deliver the federal dollars? This is more evidence, in case it was needed, that racial politics in America is no longer actually about race or racism. It has been co-opted as a bludgeon for supporters of the welfare state.

Yet this is an established part of the political landscape, and Republicans have to face up to their own failure of confront this weakness. The Cochran campaign’s attempt to appeal to black voters wasn’t exactly a secret; it was widely reported throughout the campaign. So the question is why Cochran’s small-government challenger, Chris McDaniel, couldn’t launch his own appeal to Mississippi’s black voters. As a state senator, McDaniel is no stranger to Mississippi politics, and if he had been successful in the primary, he would have had to be ready for a statewide general election campaign. Why didn’t he have the contacts, the arguments, and the credibility to make his own appeal to black voters?

Thad Cochran’s campaign was just cashing in on the fact that the left has managed to racialize free-market politics—and what’s really disturbing is that we let them do it.

Is The War On Drugs Racist?,"Are racist drug laws driving black incarceration rates? Might that help explain why blacks are 13 percent of the population but half of all prison inmates?

In 1986, in response to the crack cocaine epidemic that was crushing American inner cities, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which insti¬tuted harsher penalties for crack cocaine offenses than for powder cocaine offenses. For sentencing purposes, the law stipulated that one gram of crack cocaine be treated as equivalent to 100 grams of powder cocaine. Because crack cocaine offenders tended to be black and powder cocaine offenders tended to be white, critics of the law denounced it as racially biased in hindsight. But it’s worth remembering that black lawmakers led the initial effort to pass the legislation.

The harsher penalties for crack cocaine offenses were supported by most of the Congressional Black Caucus, including New York Representatives Major Owens of Brooklyn and Charles Rangel of Harlem, who at the time headed the House Select Com¬mittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. Crack was destroying black communities, and many black political leaders wanted dealers to face longer sentences. “Eleven of the twenty-one blacks who were then members of the House of Representatives voted in favor of the law which created the 100-to-1 crack–powder differential,” noted Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy. “In light of charges that the crack–powder distinction was enacted partly because of conscious or unconscious racism, it is noteworthy that none of the black members of Congress made that claim at the time the bill was initially discussed.” Kennedy added: “The absence of any charge by black members of Congress that the crack–powder differential was racially unfair speaks volumes; after all, several of these rep¬resentatives had long histories of distinguished opposition to any public policy that smacked of racial injustice. That several of these representatives demanded a crackdown on crack is also significant. It suggests that the initiative for what became the crack–powder distinction originated to some extent within the ranks of African-American congressional officials.”

Despite this history, the crack–powder sentencing disparity would, over the next quarter century, become one of the left’s favorite examples of America’s racist criminal justice system. Barack Obama criticized the law while running for president in 2008 and early in his first term moved to lessen the differential. That effort culminated in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which lowered the ratio to 18 to 1. This was no doubt great news for criminals, but what’s been lost in the discussion is whether such a change leaves law-abiding blacks better off. In 2009 blacks were 85 percent of crack offenders, and sentences for crack offenses averaged twenty-four months longer than those for powder cocaine. Civil rights groups and others who equate racial disparities with racism have used such data to decry the sentencing guidelines as racially unjust, yet they don’t seem overly concerned with whether blacks in the main are helped or hurt when crack dealers are locked up longer for pushing a substance that has devastated urban black neighborhoods. Why is their sympathy with the lawbreakers?

Black crime rates are vastly higher than white crime rates. And it’s hard to see how wishing away this reality, inventing conspiracy theories to explain it, or calling those who point it out “racist” will help improve the situation.

Celebrated left-wing academics like Michelle Alexander reluctantly acknowledge that “some black mayors, politicians, and lobbyists—as well as preachers, teachers, barbers, and ordinary folk—endorse ‘get tough’ tactics” by police and the courts that facilitate the high black incarceration rates that she laments. But is it any great shock that black people without advanced degrees have less sympathy for black thugs? The black homicide rate is seven times that of whites, and the George Zimmermans of the world are not the reason. Some 90 percent of black murder victims are killed by other blacks. Why should we care more about black criminals than their black victims? Still, Alexander dismisses tough-on-crime blacks as ignorant and “confused.”

Liberal elites would have us deny what black ghetto residents know to be the truth. These communities aren’t dangerous because of racist cops or judges or sentencing guidelines. They’re dangerous mainly due to black criminals preying on black victims. Nor is the racial disparity in prison inmates explained by the enforcement of drug laws. In 2006 blacks were 37.5 percent of the 1,274,600 people in state prisons, which house 88 percent of the nation’s prison population, explained Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute. “If you remove drug prisoners from that population, the percentage of black prisoners drops to 37 percent—half of a percentage point, hardly a significant difference.”

It’s true that drug prosecutions have risen markedly over the past thirty years. Drug offenders were 6.4 percent of state prison inmates in 1979 but had jumped to 20 percent by 2004. “Even so,” wrote Mac Donald, “violent and property offenders continue to dominate the ranks: in 2004, 52 percent of state prisoners were serving time for violence and 21 percent for property crimes, for a combined total over three and a half times that of state drug offenders.” Drug-war critics like to focus on federal prisons, where drug offenders climbed from 25 percent of the inmate population in 1980 to 47.6 percent in 2006. “But the federal system held just 12.3 percent of the nation’s prisoners in 2006,” noted Mac Donald. “So much for the claim that blacks are disproportionately imprisoned because of the war on drugs.”

The black inmate population reflects black criminality, not a racist criminal justice system, which currently is being run by one black man (Attorney General Holder) who reports to another (the president). Black crime rates are vastly higher than white crime rates. And it’s hard to see how wishing away this reality, inventing con¬spiracy theories to explain it, or calling those who point it out “racist” will help improve the situation.

Still Counting By Race At The University Of Texas,"The University of Texas has a long history of discriminating on the basis of race. In 1950, four years before the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered UT’s law school to admit black students, a rare desegregation ruling under the “separate but equal” regime. In 1950’s Sweatt v. Painter, the High Court concluded that Texas’ newly-established all-black law school (created in response to Heman Sweatt’s legal challenge) was not “substantially equal” to UT’s law school under the rubric of Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). As a result, UT’s law school opened its doors to black students. The precedent in Sweatt v. Painter is a painful reminder to Texans of the state’s race-conscious past, and the well-deserved source of shame for the Jim Crow era. In 2005, Travis County named the local courthouse, where a state judge rejected Sweatt’s path-breaking lawsuit, in his honor.

Alas, Texas has not learned the right lesson of history—the principle of color blindness. The University of Texas continues to discriminate on the basis of race, boasts about it, and expends considerable legal resources to defend the practice in court. The only difference is that UT’s goal is now achieving “diversity” by discriminating in favor of blacks and Latinos.

In all of life’s endeavors—athletics, scholastics, and commerce—different groups exhibit different outcomes.

In all of life’s endeavors—athletics, scholastics, and commerce—different groups exhibit different outcomes. In order to mask the differential in performance among racial and ethnic groups, in the 1960s colleges and universities nationwide began to practice “affirmative action” in admissions, to increase the number of “under-represented” minorities, mainly blacks and Latinos. “Affirmative action”—then and now—consists of giving an artificial boost to applicants of certain groups whose GPAs and test scores would not have qualified for admission on an objective, competitive basis. Often, the gap in qualifications between “under-represented” groups and the overall applicant pool is quite large, which explains the “need” for racial preferences if “diversity” (i.e., proportional representation) is to be achieved. Because in most contexts higher education admissions is a zero-sum game, admitting one (less-qualified) applicant on the basis of race results in denying admission to another (better-qualified) applicant. Predictably, as affirmative-action programs became more aggressive, and merit-based admissions became more competitive, the victims of reverse discrimination challenged the practice under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Supreme Court held in Brown forbids discrimination based on race. Jurisprudential chaos ensued.

Judicial Chaos Ensues

In 1978, the Supreme Court addressed affirmative action for the first time in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which unfortunately produced a split decision providing little useful guidance. The court held that a racial quota system that reserved 16 of 100 medical school seats for racial minorities at UC-Davis violated the rights of a white applicant who was denied admission despite better credentials than the minorities who were admitted, but it also stated race could be considered as one of many factors in order to promote diversity. Race is a “suspect classification” a state can take into account only if necessary and if “narrowly tailored” to further a “compelling governmental interest,” but the confusion spawned by Bakke centered on when and whether achieving diversity would qualify. As a practical matter, Bakke had no effect on existing preferences; colleges and universities continued to engage in reverse discrimination but were more subtle about it, eliminating naked quotas in lieu of “behind the scenes” preferences on the basis of race and ethnicity.

As a border state with mixed demographics, Texas faces political pressure to maintain a balanced student body at its flagship university.

As a border state with mixed demographics, Texas faces political pressure to maintain a balanced student body at its flagship university, UT-Austin. (Texas maintains an extensive state-supported higher education system; UT-Austin is the most competitive.) Following Bakke, UT (and especially UT’s highly-selective law school) continued to grant significant preferences to black and Latino applicants at the expense of white applicants—a practice that was successfully challenged in a 1992 lawsuit brought by Cheryl Hopwood, a white applicant denied admission to UT’s law school even though considerably less-qualified minorities were admitted. UT vigorously fought the Hopwood case, prevailing in an eight-day bench trial before U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in May 1994.

On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Hopwood scored the first victory in a legal challenge to a university’s affirmative action policy since Bakke. In a resounding opinion, the Fifth Circuit ruled in 1996 that the law school “may not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived effects of a hostile environment at the law school, …or to eliminate any present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school.” The U.S. Supreme Court denied review. Despite UT’s unhappiness with the Hopwood decision, the state of Texas yielded to the requirement of color blindness in admissions at all state-supported institutions—sort of, and for the time being.

Excellence Increases, and Leaders Are Aghast

In the immediate wake of Hopwood, the percentage of UT-Austin’s entering freshman class who were black and Latino declined from 4.1 and 14.5 percent, respectively, to 2.7 and 12.6 percent respectively. Asian enrollment, however, increased by 20 percent. (Remember the concept of a zero-sum game; high-performing Asians are the ultimate victims of affirmative action.) The quota-conscious higher education establishment was aghast. Unwilling to accept the reduction in black and Latino enrollment resulting from a strictly meritocratic admission policy, in 1997 the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 588, the so-called Top Ten Percent Law, which grants automatic admission to UT to all students in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. Due to the heavily-minority composition of Texas’ urban school districts, this clever subterfuge introduced substantial racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity into UT admissions without explicitly considering race. The Top Ten Percent Law restored the sought-after diversity at UT to pre-Hopwood levels (and then some). But the Top Ten Percent Law still didn’t produce enough blacks to suit UT, and came at the cost of lowering the median SAT scores of the entering classes, so UT introduced a “holistic” admission component to supplement the top 10 percent.

The University of Texas continues race discrimination, boasts about it, and expends considerable legal resources to defend the practice in court.

In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court re-addressed affirmative action in Grutter v. Bollinger, producing another badly-split decision (this one 5-4) that upheld the University of Michigan’s racial preferences with the controversial notion (advanced by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor) that race could be considered as a factor in admissions to achieve the mix of minority students necessary to realize the supposed educational benefits of diversity. The details were as elusive as the goal itself. The Grutter majority was tenuous and unstable, as evidenced by the fact that Justice Anthony Kennedy—normally a pivotal “swing vote”—dissented. While the Grutter rationale was inscrutable, the decision disapproved of Hopwood, leading UT to immediately renew the use of race in admissions—in addition to the 10 percent rule and “holistic” review. (Texas A&M University, Texas’ other major public university and UT’s main rival, chose to forgo racial preferences.) Of course, a legal challenge was inevitable.

Enter Abigail Noel Fisher, a white UT applicant who was denied even though black and Latino applicants with lower GPAs and test scores were admitted.

Enter Abigail Noel Fisher, a white applicant not in the top 10 percent of her high school class, who sought undergraduate admission to UT for the 2008 entering class and was denied even though black and Latino applicants with lower GPAs and test scores were admitted. She sued, claiming that, unlike the University of Michigan, UT had already achieved the requisite diversity through the Top Ten Percent Law and therefore did not need to use race as a factor in admission decisions. Fisher lost in the trial court and at the Fifth Circuit, but appealed her case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Fisher’s prospects appeared to be good because in the meantime Justice O’Connor had retired and was replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, a critic of affirmative action.

In 2013, the Supreme Court decided Fisher. The result was mixed. In a 7-1 decision written by Justice Kennedy, the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Circuit had failed to apply Grutter correctly, but instead of ruling in favor of Fisher, they remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit for further review. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Circuit had inappropriately deferred to UT (at one point expressly presuming that UT had “acted in good faith”) and had not applied the demanding “strict scrutiny” standard to require UT to prove that its consideration of race was “narrowly tailored” and “necessary.” In other words, UT had to prove it could not achieve a sufficient degree of diversity without racial preferences. The Supreme Court instructed the Fifth Circuit to reconsider the case “consistent with this opinion.”

Courts Continue to Endorse Discrimination

On remand, Fisher contended that the post-Hopwood adoption of the Top Ten Percent Law eliminated the need to take race into consideration. On July 15, 2014, the same Fifth Circuit panel issued its decision on remand, this time with a dissent. By a 2-1 vote, the panel ruled in favor of UT, not only accepting its undefined goal of a “critical mass” of minority students, but agreeing that the Top Ten Percent Law was inadequate because the minority students it produced came largely from “majority minority” high schools. Judge Emilio Garza forcefully dissented, accusing the majority of impermissibly deferring to UT’s position: “At best, the University’s attempted articulations of ‘critical mass’ before this court are subjective, circular, or tautological.” Garza mocked UT’s position: “[T]he University says its goal is not boosting minority enrollment numbers alone [which was accomplished without the use of race by the Top Ten Percent Law], but rather promoting the quality of minority enrollment—in short, diversity within diversity.”

In other words, UT will continue to discriminate on the basis of race until the courts finally step in and prevent it.

Judge’s Garza’s scathing dissent is an invitation for en banc review by the entire Fifth Circuit (which was narrowly denied in 2011) or reversal by the Supreme Court (which might overturn Grutter in the process) Fisher, whose legal challenge has been assisted by Edward Blum’s Project on Fair Representation, has vowed to exhaust all potential appeals. In the meantime, UT crows about its “victory” on remand. UT Austin President Bill Powers issued a statement, saying,“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling…. We remain committed to assembling a student body at [UT] that brings with it the educational benefits of diversity….” In other words, UT will continue to discriminate on the basis of race until the courts finally step in and prevent it. How ironic, that liberal California prohibits race-based affirmative action at state colleges (thanks to Proposition 209), whereas the flagship university of the nation’s largest Red State, Texas, continues to expend vast taxpayer resources defending its right to discriminate against white and Asian citizens.

UT has gone full circle since Sweatt v. Painter, but ended up in the same ignoble place. Discrimination based on race is wrong, regardless of the claimed educational or societal benefits. The principle of color blindness often interferes with transitory political judgments regarding “desirable” public policy. The defenders of discrimination in Brown and Sweatt—like UT in Fisher–predicted dire consequences if denied the use of race. They were wrong. The educational benefits of “diversity” are a chimera, and Abigail Fisher was a victim of state-sanctioned discrimination. Her lawsuit seeks to vindicate important civil rights—making the schoolhouse door equally open to all, regardless of race. Sixty-four years after Sweatt v. Painter, Texas should stop discriminating on the basis of race, once and for all.

Liberals Will Never Fulfill Dr. King’s Dream Of A Race-Blind Society,"Over the weekend there was a short “debate” between Jesse Jackson and Ben Carson. Within the exchange lies the real issue behind Ferguson.

According to the Left, the economic hardships blacks face are largely due to latent racism. According to Ben Carson, and many other conservatives (Larry Elder also comes to mind), big-government policies, not racism, are the primary force suppressing black advancement.

History shows Ben Carson is right, and Jesse Jackson is wrong. Let’s go back 50 years.

The Joseph Gantt Era

Joseph and Clara Gantt married in 1948. Soon after, Joseph Gantt went off to Korea to fight and never came home—until last week when his remains were finally identified. Joseph Gantt was a good man. Even though Joseph asked Clara to remarry if anything were to happen to him, she never could bring herself to do so.

Gantt, a black man, lived in a time where much of America was not kind to him. Segregation, open bigotry, and lack of employment prospects were widespread. Yet during Gantt’s time on earth, despite the oppression, blacks were making laudable advancements.

According to economist Walter Williams, “[f]rom 1900 to 1954, blacks were more active than whites in the labor market. Until about 1960, black male labor force participation in every age group was equal to or greater than that of whites … As early as 1900, the duration of black unemployment was 15 percent shorter than that of whites; today it’s about 30 percent longer.” According to economist Thomas Sowell, “[t]he poverty rate among black families fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent in 1960, during an era of virtually no major civil rights legislation or anti-poverty programs … In various skilled trades, the incomes of blacks relative to whites more than doubled between 1936 and 1959.”

Most important, back in Gantt’s day, his and Clara’s devotion to each other was the norm. In fact, from 1890 to 1940, the black marriage rate was slightly higher than that of whites. In 1950, only 9 percent of black families with children were headed by a single parent (today, roughly two-thirds of black children are now raised in single-parent families).

The End of the Joseph Gantt Era

Surely the way America treated blacks during Gantt’s lifetime was deplorable, and surely we have made many important advances since the Civil Rights era. Yet the point here is that black economic progress was advancing steadily during the first half of the twentieth century, but proceeded to flat-line in the 1960s and 70s.

If Gantt were to see black America today, he would be struck by both society’s progress and the black community’s backslide. This must mean racism is not the main contributing factor to the black community’s current ills. Sure, in today’s America white privilege exists, and so does racism. These are problems, but despite what the Left says, this is not what suppresses blacks economically.

What happened, then? Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1960s-era big government happened. Welfare laws were constructed that didn’t view black men and women as human beings in the image of God, but as useless children and at best tools for political gain.

Laws like the Davis Bacon Act, which barred federal contracts from paying less than union wages, pushed black men out of federally funded or -financed construction jobs at the behest of white unions; segregated public housing pushed blacks into inner-city ghettos where poverty was concentrated and its impact worsened; government handouts punished those who tried to work; and, most evil of all, men who had limited employment prospects were offered a way to feed their families via the federal government—as long as they packed up and left.

Back to Ferguson Today

This is why American leftists salivate over Ferguson. The Ferguson tragedy allows them to perpetuate the lie that failure in the black community is caused by racism, not a bloated federal government. If race tensions ceased, blacks might discover the Left as the sole engineer of the black community’s current condition. Worse for the Left, many blacks might discover the true face of the conservatism.

Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream was an America that judged blacks by the content of their character, not their skin color. For that to happen, we need economic equality among blacks and whites. Yet economic equity will only happen when the government gets out of the way and allows blacks to rise according to their own God-given talents.

Here is a short collection of policies, which Democrats largely oppose (aside from No. 4), that would help stop government from keeping black people down.

1. Help Broken Families

Programs that pay out more when dad is not around should be changed so that poor married couples receive an added benefit for being married. Taxes that penalize marriage among the poor should be scrapped. Don’t cut aid to single mothers, but raise aid to poor married couples. The states can start by looking at childcare and medical assistance programs. The federal government can immediately reform the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) so that the credit pays out more when dad sticks around.

2. Expand Labor Market Participation

The current push to raise the minimum wage is nothing more than another handout to unions, who don’t make minimum wage but receive wages indexed to the minimum wage. The group of people hurt most by minimum-wage laws are not business owners or fast-food consumers, but young black men, who find themselves the first to get priced out of the labor market. These entry-level jobs are important because they teach skills that allow a higher salary later in life. A better policy would be the expansion of the EITC, or replacing it with a similar measure that tops up the pay of the working poor.

There are many other policies that can help people get off the streets and into jobs. Barriers to entry for poor unskilled workers embodied in state licensure laws should be significantly reduced or done away with altogether. Congress should pass Rand Paul and Corey Booker’s plan to allow non-violent felons to seek jobs without disclosing their felony. America should allow more energy exploration on federal land. North Dakota is a boon to job-seekers only because its energy reserve largely sits upon private land. And Paul’s plan for economic freedom zones within urban areas (such as Detroit) should be implemented immediately

Improve Education Quality

The recent court case out of California proves what we’ve always known—teacher tenure hurts kids, and minority kids worst of all. Schools in wealthy areas face competition because wealthy parents have time and money to send their children to a private school if the public school underperforms. Poor area schools do not face this competition. Poor parents working several jobs and many long hours don’t have the time to even drive their child elsewhere, let alone pay for a different school. That’s why it’s time to put school choice in the hands of parents and students, through a school voucher program that—with a few safeguards—allowed competition in K-12 education.

At the state level, licensure laws that prevent professionals from teaching K-12 courses should be scrapped. These laws also serve teachers unions, not students.

4. End the Drug War

Young black men growing up in poor communities face a stark choice: Either they remain in low-performing high school, or they drop out of school and sell narcotics, making more money than their families have ever seen. This is partly why there is a race disparity in incarceration rates for drug-crimes. Worse, the young men caught selling drugs are sent to prison as nonviolent offenders, and leave prison violent and with limited opportunities.

Liberal-minded states like Colorado and Washington legalized pot to grow state revenue. High pot taxes mean the cartels and street violence stick around (because the shadow market still exists). Only conservatives will legalize marijuana for the sole purpose of breaking the back of the cartels, without mind to growing government.

The Democrats offer blacks top-down redistributive solutions that seem to assume blacks can’t make it without the government, although these offer blacks nothing more than a permanent position in the underclass, and a permanent position in the grievance wing of the Democrat Party. Conservatives offer blacks something so much better: Prosperity. That’s the fruition of King’s dream.

Love In The Time Of Terrorism,"Even with “Jihadi John” unmasked, there would still be plenty more where he came from. His anonymity has actually revealed three basics we shouldn’t forget: 1) He is male; 2) He has a penchant for violence and a fetish for publicly beheading people; and 3) He does not project an individual personality as much as he does the persona of a terrorist. The last point is key: finding a role that seems to earn other men’s awe is what aimless and aggressive young men often do.

It’s also a good guess that Jihadi John and his terrorist ilk live in a feral mindset. The idea of living a normal domesticated life—that is, working an honest job, and having primary loyalty to a home with loving wife and kids—seems not to be uppermost in JJ’s bloodthirsty mind. What are the chances such thoughts could be buried deep within a terrorist? Is it possible such a terrorist can be tamed? Let’s take this a step farther and dare to ask: What if these most violent men could actually learn to love home and hearth and desire never to stray again? I think it worth engaging in this thought experiment. The implications for understanding human motives, relationships, and behavior are vast.

And guess what? According to a 2001 essay by terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman, such a taming actually happened to members of the terrorist group Black September, a group that suddenly subsided from the public eye in the 1970s almost as quickly as it appeared.

So how on earth could this have happened? Perhaps first we should ask: Why would this have happened?

Do You Remember Black September?

Black September was the scourge of Munich during the 1972 Olympics. Even if you weren’t around then, you’ve probably seen the iconic photograph of the hooded terrorist on that Munich balcony. The group kidnapped and then killed 11 Israeli athletes and a German policeman. The world held its breath as the intense standoff and a botched rescue attempt were televised.

Thirteen years ago, Hoffman’s intriguing article for the Atlantic Monthly was entitled “All You Need Is Love.” In it, Hoffman described his conversation with a general in one of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s intelligence services. The general explained how the PLO deliberately dismantled Black September, the most dreaded terrorist organization in the world at the time.

Deliberately dismantled it? Well, yes. Black September was becoming more of a liability than an asset to the PLO during the 1970’s. Yasser Arafat, then chairman of the PLO and head of its al-Fatah faction, formed Black September as a covert—and therefore deniable—special PLO operation. The initial purpose of Black September was to exact revenge on Jordan for expelling Palestinians in September 1970, and to get headline coverage while doing so. Hoffman explained:

Black September’s first operation was the assassination, in November of 1971, of Jordan’s Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal, who was gunned down as he entered the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel in Cairo. While Tal lay dying, one of the assassins knelt and lapped with his tongue the blood flowing across the marble floor. That grisly scene, reported in The Times of London and other major newspapers, created an image of uncompromising violence and determination that was exactly what Arafat both wanted and needed.

The Munich Massacre of the Israeli athletes followed. And with it, the Palestinian cause rocketed high onto the world agenda. Black September continued with hijackings and bombings, but by fall 1974 Arafat was invited to address the United Nations General Assembly and the PLO had gained observer status there. So Black September had served its purpose and was seen as more of a liabililty than an asset. Arafat then ordered his chief of intelligence, Salah Khalaf, to “turn off” Black September.

‘A Reason to Live Rather than To Die’

Hoffman’s host had mulled over the options with Khalaf, whom he served as a deputy. How do you simply “turn off” a group of hardened terrorists (without killing them all)? Hoffman explained: “Finally they hit upon an idea. Why not simply marry them off? In other words, why not find a way to give these men—the most dedicated, competent, and implacable fighters in the entire PLO—a reason to live rather than to die?”

‘There, in a sort of PLO version of a college mixer, boy met girl, boy fell in love with girl, boy would, it was hoped, marry girl.’

They put a plan in motion, which began by scouring large Palestinian communities for the most attractive young Palestinian women they could find. They asked the women if they would come to Beirut “for a reason to be disclosed upon your arrival, but one decreed by no higher authority than Chairman Arafat himself.” About a hundred of these stunning young women were brought to Beiruit and, according to Hoffman: “There, in a sort of PLO version of a college mixer, boy met girl, boy fell in love with girl, boy would, it was hoped, marry girl.”

But wait! There’s more: “The hundred or so Black Septembrists were told that if they married these women, they would be paid $3,000; given an apartment in Beirut with a gas stove, a refrigerator, and a television; and employed by the PLO in some nonviolent capacity. Any of these couples that had a baby within a year would be rewarded with an additional $5,000.”

Did it work?

…as the general recounted, without exception the Black Septembrists fell in love, got married, settled down, and in most cases started a family.

But would they later be tempted to stray back to their terrorist ways? The PLO intelligence operatives factored in that possibility. They tested the men by periodically giving them passports to go to Western Europe on legitimate non-violent PLO business. And: “the general explained, not one of them would agree to travel abroad, for fear of being arrested and losing all that they had—that is, being deprived of their wives and children. ‘And so,’ my host told me, ‘that is how we shut down Black September.”

If you’re interested, you can read the article “The Deradicalization of Terrorists” in Salus Journal (2013) for an overview of recent studies on that topic. But I would guess Black September is likely the most successful and effective case because the terrorists had the blessing of superiors who worked in concert to change their environment and then offer them all they needed to live an alternative life that promised love, family, home, stability, and prosperity.

What Might This Tell Us about Men and Society?

This story tells us a lot about hierarchies, the power of personal relationships, human motives, and our utter need for a reason to live rather than a reason to die. In fact, this story actually smashes the feminist stereotype of “patriarchy.” Deprivation of sexual outlet, family, and work spells disaster for single men, and not because he lives in a particular type of culture or society, but because he is human, and because he is male. When the stability of close familial relationships and a sense of purpose are withheld from a man, he does not socialize well or at all. He tends to resort to a male herd, which too often means finding his place in a hierarchy. He also finds in this an outlet for his aggression, which is generated by aimlessness and pent-up frustration. It’s a violent brew, east or west. I dare say, we’ve seen some of such unrest recently in both the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and in Ferguson, Missouri, USA.

When the stability of close familial relationships and a sense of purpose are withheld from a man, he does not socialize well or at all.

The factors that went into changing the outlook of Black September members were both simple and complex. Simple because, at root, contentment comes from the sense of stability and belonging one gets from happy familial relationships. And simple also because a single man deprived of remunerative labor and a sexual outlet is more prone to violence than a married man with a home, wife, children, and stable work. The complexities in such situations have to do with how invested the man was with the violent gang or terrorist group he is a part of—the depth of his bonds and connections with the group, his devotion to the ideology if there is one, his lack of alternatives, the stability of the environment should he leave, and whether there are outside influences that can wean him away.

Clearly, if you are a young, single man who is part of a violent cult and all of a sudden the leaders of your cult “de-programs” you and offers you a life that promises love, family, and good employment, chances are you would grab the opportunity, especially as you sense all of your brethren doing the same. It seems a no-brainer.

Gender Theory and ‘Jihadi John’

This story flies in the face of the gender theory that’s been peddled for the past couple of generations and now is everywhere in our schools, colleges, the media, and Hollywood. According to its advocates, human beings play “gender roles” that are entirely a construct of society, and have nothing to do with nature. Gender theorists are hellbent on abolishing the natural family. They claim marriage promotes the gender roles that encourage “patriarchy”—or a male superiority complex—which they insist undermines women’s equality. I would expect them to look at the story of Black September and completely miss the point, instead complaining that the women were “rounded up” perhaps like “chattel to be married off.”

The feminist agenda, by tearing down the natural family, has spawned the violent behavior of guys like Jihadi John.

But I suggest we all take a good look at the masked “Jihadi John” for a real glimpse of what modern feminism and gender theory have to offer us at the end of the road. The feminist agenda, by tearing down the natural family, has spawned rather than spurned the violent behavior of guys like Jihadi John. Unfortunately, such feminists of today don’t take a long view. They seem nearsightedly focused on cases of domestic violence in the West. This not only gives them an unhealthy preoccupation with what goes on in other people’s bedrooms, but also blinds them to finding real solutions to the entire problem of male violence.

Of course one would have to try to understand men—rather than simply revile them—to accomplish that. Most interesting is how modern feminists are loath to express much outrage for the imposition of Sharia law in the West. How frequently do we hear the politically correct voices of “women’s equality” speak out against honor killings or genital mutilations of young girls, even when they take place within Western borders? Not much. They seem to have fallen in line—as we can see in the case of Rotherham—with British officials and media who turned a blind eye over the past 15 years to the brutal trafficking of about 1,400 girls.

Instead, our western feminists are preoccupied with dismantling the male-female bond, the father-child bond, and the mother-child bond. So their big target is marriage and families with biological connections. The goal is to get the state to serve as surrogate parents to us all. We can see this in a recent article by feminists who argue basically that workingclass single mothers shouldn’t even consider marriage which I discussed here. We can see it in the push for same-sex marriage, which in the end is little more than a bait-and-switch strategy to abolish family autonomy along with state-recognized marriage. We can also see this in the promotion of abortion that is no longer “rare” by severing the mother-child bond that women supposedly should feel good about.

The mascot of our bureaucratic feminists turns out to be “Julia,” their cardboard-cutout Stepford wife to the state as someone for us all to emulate. If we keep traveling this road—of policies that separate men from women and all of us from one another—where might we end up?

Why, at Jihadi John’s doorstep, of course. Where else?

Men and Marriage

We’d do well to reflect on the story of the tamed Black September terrorists when we consider the chaos of crime and violence around us. It applies to all situations in which men feel marginalized, humiliated, neglected, discarded, directionless, and misunderstood. Indeed, it seems men need women to love more than women appear to need men.

‘The denial of male nature in modern life warps and perverts the natural play of male aggression, leading to violence and pornography, to fear and exploitation of women.’

When this need is not met, they tend not to express frustration in words, but in destructive action. It might begin with gross inaction, but at a certain point the behavior in young, detached men can devolve into riots, looting, pillaging, killing, gangs, drug cartels, and the like. Leftists and feminists who are hellbent on abolishing the traditional family are of course loath to attribute such behaviors to fatherlessness and broken homes. They prefer to use the catch-all term “poverty,” and to deny there is a male nature or even a human nature.

Economist George Gilder delved into this irony in his fascinating book, “Men and Marriage” (1986): “the denial of male nature in modern life warps and perverts the natural play of male aggression, leading to violence and pornography, to fear and exploitation of women. . . The result is a society that at once denies the existence of natural male aggressiveness and is utterly preoccupied with it.”

Gilder examined a deep truth about men, something those PLO officials recognized when they went about “turning off” the savagery of the ruthless Black September terrorists: Without a sense of connection with family, young men are restless and prone to violence. But with it, they can feel settled. They can then channel their ambitions to constructive ends. Men and boys, particularly, need some kind of civilizing force that allows them to build rather than to destroy. That force is a relationship, especially one of love that truly integrates them into the human family. It’s a force that invites them to build a nest that nurtures the next generation, which they can see—for real—in the faces of their own children.

Gilder, in “Men and Marriage,” also noted: “Biology, anthropology, and history all tell the same essential story. Every society, each generation, faces an invasion by barbarians. They storm into the streets and schools, businesses and households of the land, and unless they are brought to heel, they rape and pillage, debauch and despoil the settlements of society. . . . Every society must figure out ways to bring them into the disciplines and duties of citizenship.”

when a man is given the opportunity for an intimate relationship that creates companionship and the promise of his own children, something astonishing can happen to him.

One of Gilder’s points most worth pondering in the West is this: “The only undeniable winners in the sexual revolution are powerful men.” A society that rejects traditional marriages and families cultivates the ground for destructive patterns of male hierarchies. These detached alpha males—enabled today by feminist women—don’t simply lord themselves over women but they especially lord themselves over other men. As dominated men’s frustrations grow, so does the threat of violence. In the West, women who play along with the sexual revolution, pretend to be oh-so-content with the hook-up culture while accommodating aimless male patterns of behavior, which approach their apex in cultures that promote polygamy and women-as-chattel. So we come full circle.

The men who run ISIS seem to practice a particularly harsh form of hierarchical dominance towards other men, as is the case in most intensely tribal cultures. With Sharia law there is an obvious attempt by the powerful men to lord over other men. We can see how the elites among them prevent and control access to relationships with women. We ought to ask: Whose purpose does veiling women really serve? Answer: Powerful men exerting their dominance over less powerful men, that’s who. And as if the veiling of women is not enough, ISIS has also made sure that in cattle markets the hindquarters of sheep and goats are covered up so men will not be able to view the animals’ genitalia and be reminded of things sexual. No doubt, those coverings—and the degrading message it presumes on sidelined single men—can only accentuate their frustrations.

The unvarnished truth is that when a man is given a purpose, and given the opportunity for an intimate relationship that creates companionship and the promise of his own children, something astonishing can happen to him. Suddenly the garbage of empty violence doesn’t smell so good to him anymore. When he has a sense of order and meaningful work to go along with a family, he has a place in the world and everything clicks—for everyone.

The Midterms Mean the Democratic Party Is Dying (Again),"Way back in 2005, following George W. Bush’s win in the presidential election, I looked at the long-term trends and forecast the death of the Democratic Party.

Yeah, I know. For a long time, that really didn’t hold up very well.

Things happened, as they naturally do, to make the Republicans look bad and to reverse their fortunes at the polls. President Bush waited too long to implement a full-scale counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq, so by the time he won the war there, the public had already written off the whole venture as a failure (a self-fulfilling prophecy, under the new president). And during this whole period, the Federal Reserve was inflating a housing bubble that would burst and precipitate a global financial crisis, which is not how you want to cap off the administration of a president from your party.

Yet now, suddenly, my old prediction is starting to look a whole lot better. If George W. Bush hurt the Republican Party, it has bounced back smartly—and Barack Obama has hurt the Democrats much worse. The effect is likely to have long and powerful repercussions, for one big reason: the Republican wave in the midterms carried over to governors and state legislatures, which are the farm teams for new political talent.

If we survey the damage, the least significant result of last week’s vote is the Republican takeover of the Senate. In the House of Representatives, Republicans now have a “hundred-year majority.” No, this is not a prediction that it will last 100 years, but the observation that it has been nearly 100 years—1928, to be exact—since the Republicans won this big a majority in the chamber of Congress that is meant to most closely represent the popular vote. To make that visual for you, check out the RealClearPolitics map of the election results by congressional district. Since 2000, it has been common to remark that these maps show “two Americas,” divided between rural red districts and coastal, urban blue districts. But this year’s midterm map looks a lot more like one America, with a few tiny holdout enclaves on the coasts and in the upper Midwest. (Basically, Minnesota.)

It’s when we turn to the state level that we see the big electoral shift.

Republicans will hold 31 of the country’s 50 governorships next year—perhaps 32, if late-counted ballots push Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell ahead of his independent challenger, Bill Walker. They will also hold between 67 and 69 of the 98 partisan state legislative chambers—more than at any point in history, according to the Republican State Leadership Committee.

Republicans now hold both the governorship and legislative majorities in 23 states, 24 if Parnell pulls through in Alaska, which means that they have the ability to write their own agenda in nearly half the states in the union. Democrats can do the same in only seven states.

RCP’s David Byler puts that in perspective, showing how it reverses Democratic dominance at the state level through most of the 20th century, including up through the 1980s. As he points out, this is the final dividend of the Republicans’ political takeover in the South, where Democrats now have a majority only in the Kentucky Senate (to the discomfiture of Rand Paul, who needed them to overturn a law that bars him from running both for president and for his Senate seat in 2016).

This has a big long-term impact because state and local governments are where rising young politicians gain experience, learn how to win elections and build a constituency, and establish the credentials they will use to rise to higher office. If Bill Clinton hadn’t been able to get elected as governor of Arkansas, for example, he would have had no basis to run for president. So just think how many young Democrats are now being shut out of the first steps of their political careers.

This election produced a whole roster of rising stars for the Republicans: Mia Love, Tim Scott, Joni Ernst, Tom Cotton, Elise Stefanik, and so on. Meanwhile, the Democrats had pinned their hopes on Wendy Davis’s campaign for governor of Texas. Instead, she went down to an ignominious defeat in one of the worst-run campaigns in the country, and Davis’s state Senate seat was taken by a Tea Party activist as Republicans continue their march toward a supermajority in the Texas legislature.

The only person I’ve seen singled out as a potential Democratic star in this cycle is Gina Raimondo, who was elected governor of Rhode Island. You are permitted to be skeptical about whether this is a good stepping stone to an illustrious national career.

That leaves the Democrats with basically no younger generation of leaders emerging, while the party’s fate is increasingly dependent on a bunch of septuagenarians.

Back in 2005, I briefly started a Democratic Party Death Watch (along with what ultimately proved more timely: a Republican Party Suicide Watch). These days, talking about a “death watch” for the Democrats almost seems in bad taste, given how the actuarial odds are stacked against the party’s elderly leadership.

There is another, more serious problem with the Democrats’ current plight. Having successful candidates on all levels of government means having politicians who have learned to appeal to a wide range of constituents and not just to left-leaning urban hipsters. After all, part of the Democrats’ current plight comes from electing a president who came of age as a hothouse plant, nurtured in the one-party rule of left-wing Chicago politics and then protected by the adulation of the press. He never really learned how to work with political opponents or assuage the concerns of voters outside his narrow partisan base. Those are the skills now being learned by Republicans who are winning races in formerly blue and purple states.

In this regard, Democrats seem to be in a downward spiral. You can see that in the way they have made no plans for changes in leadership or agenda after this year’s big failure. You can see why they wouldn’t: most of the Democrats who remain in Congress were elected from solid left-leaning states or districts. Let’s just say that Nancy Pelosi isn’t going to lose many voters in San Francisco by doggedly continuing to support ObamaCare.

It’s important to remember how Democrats bounced back in 2006, after my premature report of their demise: Nancy Pelosi went out and recruited a bunch of conservative Southern Democrats to run for seats in the House. You can see why that strategy ultimately failed. When they got to Washington, the role of these “conservative Democrats” was not to stand for the centrist policies they had campaigned on. Their role was to be foot soldiers for Pelosi and Ted Kennedy and Barney Frank and the rest of the far-left Democratic leadership. Their job was to lay down their political lives in order to cast partisan votes on legislation like ObamaCare.

The result was that most of these recruits got wiped out in 2010, and the last of them were mopped up this year.

There was a lot of crowing by Democrats in the past few election cycles that the Republicans were becoming a mere “regional party” that could only win majorities in the South. But the actual truth is that Democrats are being shut out of whole regions. This midterm election saw the defeat of the last white Southern Democrat in the House of Representatives. If Mary Landrieu loses her run-off in Louisiana, they will be extinct in the Senate, too.

Meanwhile, the new trend in Southern politics is black Republicans—which brings us to the trend that ought to really terrify Democrats. It’s not just that Republicans have a new crop of talented young politicians. It’s the fact that so many of them are from the three demographic groups on which Democrats have staked their future: blacks, Hispanic voters, and younger women.

That’s why it was so delicious to see Jon Stewart melting down over the new crop of Republican winners, who give the lie to the caricature of the Republicans as the party of old white men. And while Stewart tries to imply that this is just a temporary flirtation and that the Democrats’ key demographic groups will return to them in the end, there is still a distinct note of panic.

You can see the same sort of thing in Jamelle Bouie’s analysis of the significance of Tim Scott’s Senate win in South Carolina. He acknowledges the downside of the ghettoization of Democratic racial politics.

[B]lack politicians tend to represent black constituencies: Black mayors lead black cities, and black lawmakers are from black districts. In addition to material disadvantages—this often puts black politicians outside important donor networks, for example—it creates a key political problem: Because blacks are much more liberal than the median voter, black politicians are more likely to be outside of the political mainstream, making a statewide bid more difficult.

He also describes how Scott is not only able to appeal to white voters, but does so from a perspective that has a tradition among black voters, as well.

Scott isn’t pioneering a new kind of conservatism as much as he’s channeling an old tradition. Specifically, Scott is speaking in a language of black conservatism that would be familiar to figures like Booker T. Washington….



Go to a black church or barbershop, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find Republican-style boilerplate on taxes and “tyranny.” But you will hear people talk about self-reliance and community empowerment.

He goes on to point out that Tim Scott still lost among black voters, whose traditional loyalties to the Democratic Party are going to be hard to overcome. But what he doesn’t acknowledge is that Republicans don’t have to win a majority of the black vote. They just need to make slow and steady inroads by getting more and more of the kind of candidates who can appeal to this traditional “black conservatism.” They need to keep chipping away until they reach a critical mass at which the presumption of partisan loyalty is broken, and it is no longer taboo to be a black Republican.

The problem for Democrats isn’t that they are relying on a majority of the black and Hispanic vote. It’s that they are relying on a total death-grip on that vote. They need 90% of the black vote in every election and 75% of the Hispanic vote, and not just that, but a high voter turnout among those groups. So if the new crop of Republican leaders can manage to peel off just 10% or 20% of the vote among blacks and Hispanics, the Democratic Party would be pretty much doomed.

You can see this in the bizarre Democratic fallback position of consoling themselves with the support of people who didn’t vote.

Democrats have evidence that a mobilization strategy can pay off. In 2008 and 2012, they won by attracting millions of young, black, and Latino voters. In 2010 and 2014, with no presidential race on the ballot, many of those voters stayed home. 2016 is a presidential year, and the country will be less white than ever. The electorate could look more like the one from 2012 than like the one from 2014.

Similarly, on the state level, “Democrats insist that they are in position to win back many of these chambers in 2016, when more of their core voters—nonwhites, young voters, single women—are more likely to cast ballots.” What they mean is: we really, really hope that we can get black and Hispanic voters to keep voting for us monolithically, and to keep turning out with the kind of enthusiasm they showed in 2008 and 2012. And we need them to do it every time, because if they don’t, we get crushed like we did in 2010 and 2014.

That’s an awful lot of conditions that have to go exactly right, so look for Democrats to get crushed a lot more.

All of this highlights the importance of Republican efforts to take the “race card” away from the Democrats, because by this point, that’s all they have left. More widely, for all the anguish on the right over the past eight years about a pair of uninspiring presidential candidates and the challenges of pushing a pro-liberty agenda in the face of a hostile popular culture, the current results indicate that a lot of cultural and political factors must still be going our way. Watching Jon Stewart react to the election, for example, makes you wonder if he and his ilk have a lot less influence than we have been duped into thinking. Because like Stewart himself, the people who watch his show clearly aren’t numerous enough or engaged enough to actually turn out at the polls.

I don’t think the Democratic Party is really going to die quite yet. That’s partly because its collectivist, big-government ideology still enjoys so many reserves of support in the universities, in the media, and in the entertainment industry. It’s also because political parties have a tendency to eventually adapt and change the way they present themselves to voters (as Bill Clinton briefly did for Democrats in the 1990s).

But it would be nice for a period of Republican dominance to last long enough to undo some of the damage of the Obama era, and it would be extra nice to get beyond the ugly racialization of ideological divisions that has characterized the politics of the last 50 years.

It would be good for the country to have at least a few cycles in which the election map looks the way it did last week and makes us feel like we live, at least for a little while, in one America.

Four Things Conservatives Can Get Out Of Hip-Hop,"You have to guess a stranger’s musical tastes. You can’t speak with him. You get no glimpse to gauge demographics or fashion. You’re permitted just one piece of information: this mystery person’s political views.

He’s right of center.

That’s all you know. So how do you wager?

You could be dealing with a rural conservative, the kind people call “grassroots.” If so, you should bet on the chart-toppers who connect pop with country. Try Brantley Gilbert or Jason Aldean.

But what if the guy’s some suburban lawyer, an environmentalist Republican? Probably still digs the guys whose LPs he schlepped into his dorm room in the ‘70s. Is it The Who and Led Zeppelin or Joni Mitchell and James Taylor? Flip a coin.

If they’re a libertarian, you’re basically screwed. Their ideal playlist could range anywhere from Chris Tomlin (home-schooling mom) to Rage Against The Machine (high-schooler who skimmed “The Fountainhead”). Or you could have a paleoconservative who shelves string quartet CDs next to The New Criterion.

But, hey — at least there is one genre you can safely rule out. There is one kind of music that no kind of conservative is likely to love.

Hip-hop.

Now, the set of conservatives for whom Mike Huckabee is the best barometer is minuscule. But the pundit’s searing #HotTake on the R&B queen typifies a broader attitude. Most conservatives are almost completely unaware of the family of genres spanning hip-hop, rap, R&B, and neo-soul. And many others, like Huckabee, are just aware enough to vaguely rant that it’s ruining America.

Both perspectives are pervasive. But the first is a little lazy and the second is dead wrong. Hip-hop music is great. It’s the descendant of jazz by way of funk and soul. Its origins are uniquely American.

As with any genre, there is plenty of hip-hop that will rub conservatives the wrong way. As in any genre, there is some garbage — moral and musical. But also, as in any genre, there are sparkling gems that demand our attention.

Hit Pause for a Second

Let me be clear. I’m not making the silly claim that hip-hop is somehow a fundamentally conservative art form. It isn’t.

I’m not pretending that more than a few of its practitioners identify as conservatives. They don’t. Nor that its stars write their songs from conservative perspectives. Nor that those songs recommend conservative solutions.

I claim only two things. First, conservatives must either stop pretending they are serious about American culture or start engaging with one of its most prominent expressions. Second, when they open their ears, they will like hip-hop more than they ever expected.

Here we go.

1. Hip-Hop Celebrates Prosperity without Making It a Panacea

Like a slowly-turning ocean liner, the conservative movement has spent two years gradually pivoting towards a new focus: inequality of opportunity.

As conservatives keep unwinding our old habit of focusing too myopically on economics, Jay-Z’s lyrics help remind us that money is a necessary but not nearly sufficient part of fulfillment.

Same as always, conservatives are noting that reigning center-left orthodoxy has produced public schools and social service agencies that do too little for vulnerable Americans. But here’s the new addition. Conservatives have realized that this tragedy is not mitigated, and perhaps is even morally exacerbated, by the fact that incredible prosperity among wealthy people pulls up the national average.

We’re caricatured as claiming that a rising tide automatically lifts all boats. But we know better. Now conservative leaders are the ones highlighting the brutally regressive nature of the “recovery.” Yeah, we still cheer Horatio Alger stories louder than anybody. Proud to do so. But we also explicitly acknowledge they are far too difficult for children raised in marginalized communities to replicate.

Much of the best hip-hop music explores exactly this tension. “Hard Knock Life,” from the famed rapper Jay-Z, is a prime example. Jay spends some of the song relishing his personal success. “I went from lukewarm to hot,” he brags, “Sleeping on futons and cots to King size / ‘Green machines’ to green 5’s.” That last phrase, slickly comparing a popular kids’ tricycle to the BMW 5-series, showcases Jay-Z’s fantastic talent for rhymes.

But the tune is about more than his wealth. Subtitled “Ghetto Anthem,” the song intertwines Jay-Z’s boasts with lamentations on how few of his old neighbors will share in similar success. For people on the margins of society, even small personal triumphs don’t bring a sense of real ownership of society: “We live in hard knocks / We don’t take over, we borrow blocks.”

That’s a profound message. As conservatives keep unwinding our old habit of focusing too myopically on economics, Jay-Z’s lyrics help remind us that money is a necessary but not nearly sufficient part of fulfillment.

2. Hip-Hop Shows How ‘Upward Mobility’ Can Be Really Complicated

“All Falls Down” is an absurdly catchy single from the 2004 album that made Kanye West famous. In classic Kanye fashion, it combines soulful vocals and grooves with cutting social commentary.

In the first verse, ‘Ye channels the struggles of people who are pushed to pursue expensive education on the pledge that their lives will fall neatly in order:

Man I promise, she’s so self-conscious

She has no idea what she’s doing in college

That major that she majored in don’t make no money

But she won’t drop out, her parents will look at her funny

Now, tell me that ain’t insecure

The concept of school seemed so secure

Sophomore, three years, ain’t picked a career

She like, f — — it, I’ll just stay down here and do hair

Gee, think conservatives could relate to this? Republican politicians love pointing out how the old four-year college script has ceased to be a cure-all. Just recently, virtually every right-winger on Twitter pushed a Wall Street Journal piece on “The $140,000-a-Year Welding Job.” Rick freaking Santorum made this argument part of his stump speech!

It’s safe to say Kanye probably doesn’t share the nostalgia for mid-twentieth-century blue-collar life that helps drive this narrative on the Right. But this song certainly gives the higher-ed bubble — both economic and cultural — a human face.

In the track’s second verse, ‘Ye relates his own struggles with spending:

But I ain’t even gonna act holier than thou

Cause f — it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou

Before I had a house and I’d do it again

Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin’ a Benz

I want to act ballerific like it’s all terrific

I got a couple past due bills, I won’t get specific

I got a problem with spendin’ before I get it

We all self-conscious, I’m just the first to admit it

Before Kanye was famous for dubious antics and marrying a Kardashian, he made his name on sick lyrics like these. But the experience he’s describing is the key part for our purposes. Yeezy’s verse testifies to the gap between how sensible fiscal responsibility looks on paper and how difficult it can be to exercise. Prudence is easier to preach than to practice.

This is true for poor people in inner cities who are desperate to own a few nice things, it is true for spendthrift senators, and it is true for overeager middle-class surburbanites who will sign anything to get into McMansions. If conservatives really want to build a society that lives within its means, empathy for people in a tight spot will be at least as important as well-worn austere lectures.

3. Hip-Hop Renders Tough Social Issues with Nuance and Respect

“Dreamer” is a compelling track off an album with an epic title: “When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Sh-t Gold.” The hit album belongs to Atmosphere, a talented rapper-producer duo.

The song explores how hopeful ambition and cold realism compete for space in a single mom’s emotional life. Midway through the song, my favorite verse starts out with exposition:

Two years later, two months pregnant

Same daddy, same broke-ass situation

This time the doc said her heart might break

Praise God that the job got her health benefits straight

So far, this unwed mom-to-be seems like someone many conservatives would sooner chastise than cheer. But wait —

She believes in the right to choice

But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy

Makes more now a days on the day shift

Balanced that with night classes, take some

Time and space and make it all fit

Here’s the crux. The woman’s love for her daughter helps her dodge a pitfall of modern culture. She refrains from terminating her embryonic son. But who is to blame for the forces that made that choice difficult? Conservatives would be quick to point at the progressives who made abortion legal and intend to keep it that way. Rightly so. But there’s more to this story.

Scolds who condemn mothers for having ‘more children than they can afford’ should be very cautious about what they’re implying.

As Atmosphere immediately points out, another kid poses a huge financial hurdle. Thus does this song force us conservatives to remember that fiscal responsibility and deeper moral responsibility can sometimes point in opposite directions. It challenges us to rank those priorities—and I don’t think there’s any real question how that list ought to be ordered.

Scolds who condemn mothers for having “more children than they can afford” should be very cautious about what they’re implying. Pro-life Christians should be among the first to cheer families, whatever the parents’ incomes, and the last to scoff at them.

Conservatives will point out that the child’s father should bear much more responsibility — personal and financial — for his offspring. And the song’s protagonist agrees!

Raised her voice and made her point

Told that boy, go get employed

He put on his best shirt

Said he wasn’t comin’ back till he gets work

She knew what that part meant

So she swept every piece out that apartment

Lately, center-right commentators have started tackling the messy intersection of policy, culture, and family life. Have economic trends made many men unmarriageable? Should unwed parents work harder to stay together, or should moms move quickly to kick out deadbeat dads?

To their credit, conservative experts are asking these important questions despite their inconvenience. It’s where the data are leading them. But if wealthy, married white people are going to delve into these issues via symposiums and op-eds, they are obliged to humanize their understanding. They can start by exploring the music that does just that.

4. Hip-Hop Can Evolve Conservatives’ Nascent Awareness of Race

Our movement is waking up to racial issues. This is one of the most promising political developments of the last decade, because those issues are empirically still stalking this country.

The median black household commands net wealth of $11,000.

Let’s say you’re a middle-aged American who was born into the poorest fifth of households. Maybe you actually were; maybe you have to imagine. Well, if you are white, your chance of still being stuck in that bottom fifth today is just 23 percent. And if you’re black? Then your chance of still being poor skyrockets to 51 percent.

Here’s another data point. The median white household in the United States commands about $142,000 in net wealth. Not the arithmetic mean, which could be yanked way upward by a few billionaires, but the median. Half of all white families are worth less than $142,000, and half are worth more.

The median black household commands net wealth of $11,000.

Here’s a third fact with which conservatives may have more natural comfort. The average black student’s school ranks at just the 37th percentile in test scores nationwide. The average white student’s school? Sixty-third percentile.

These statistics raise limitless questions. Yet one thing is abundantly clear. A few decades of mostly left-wing, mostly big-government “reforms” have not fully expunged the racial animus that was once nestled deep in our nation. Stating this explicitly might help a Republican politician or it might hurt him, but it happens to be the case. Willful blindness is only an option for weaklings.

There’s good news here for everyone. Whether it’s our libertarian wing critiquing police power or establishment wonks agitating for school choice, our values will contribute to this conversation in ways that inexhaustibly pro-government voices cannot. As much as Al Sharpton may hate to hear this, it, too, has the virtue of being true.

A few decades of mostly left-wing, mostly big-government ‘reforms’ have not fully expunged the racial animus that was once nestled deep in our nation.

Indeed, many conservatives are warming to policy arguments that acknowledge racial disparities. But few of us seem to really grok how deep the roots of race extend into people’s lived experiences. If conservatives want participate credibly in this conversation, we must understand that race means much more to many Americans than simply one variable in a regression analysis. This will be even more vital if Republicans hope to break from the party’s pathetic past performances and seriously work to earn black Americans’ votes.

Innumerable tracks touch on these themes powerfully. One of my favorites is a collaboration track with Mos Def and Talib Kweli. Entitled “Thieves In The Night,” the song explores themes from inequality to our fraught system of criminal justice:

They say money’s the root of all evil but I can’t tell

You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills

Or is it the mindstate that’s ill?

Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build

Over money and religion there’s more blood to spill

The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal

What’s the deal?

A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke

But my language universal they be recitin’ my quotes

This is a unique track. I think you’ll like it.

The same goes for “Murder to Excellence,” an underrated offering from Kanye and Jay-Z’s 2011 joint album. Both rappers paint the scourge of inner-city homicide in painfully vivid and personal colors. Here’s ‘Ye, a native Chicagoan:

I’m from the murder capital where they murder for capital

Heard about at least three killings this afternoon

Looking at the news like “damn! I was just with him after school”

[…]

It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power

41 souls murdered in 50 hours

Later in the song, Kanye advances a hypothesis that conservatives won’t be down with. Teetering on the edge of conspiracy theory, he lays all the blame— even today—at the feet of willful, institutional racism:

In the past, if you picture events, like a black tie

What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?

What’s the life expectancy for black guys?

The system’s working effectively, that’s why!

Most Americans would attribute crime to personal immorality in addition to structural causes. But Kanye’s perspective is real. If conservatives set out to reunite the country with a vision that includes everyone, they must be at least acquainted with the reasons so many still feel the deck is almost inexorably stacked against them.

Let’s Be Real: Hip-Hop Won’t Change Everything

There you have it. Just five songs, five of my favorites from a massive family of genres that contain a whole lot of unlistenable crap—and a whole lot of brilliant art. But let’s not kid ourselves about this new undertaking.

The average Republican and the average rap fan probably understand shockingly little about each other’s backgrounds, each other’s mentalities, or each other’s daily lives.

Streaming some rap and neo-soul and R&B won’t reshape conservatives’ substantive agenda. Certainly not overnight, and perhaps not ever. Even if I get my wish and Tea Parties start digging into Tupac and Beyonce, they won’t find any new philosophical syllogisms or policy arguments embedded in the liner notes. As I admitted from the get-go, hip-hop and conservative values do not always go neatly together. Far from it!

But nobody thinks the main role of art is changing policy positions. And it certainly isn’t to paraphrase only what we already believe. In truth, we rely on literature and visual art and music for two primary things: entertainment and exposure. Exposure to different people, to different stories, to different versions of the world that might or might never exist. Exposure to cultivate empathy.

Why have conservatives historically been so quick to avoid hip-hop, anyway? Most of the factors that pearl-clutchers would point to seem like pretty dubious reasons. For example, the culprit can’t be hip-hop’s talk of irresponsible behavior. Practically every new pop-country hit contains a couple references to premarital sex or drinking and driving, yet these evils are not condemned as mortal sins. They’re nostalgically recounted as good-old-days mischief. It can’t be the obnoxious, ostentatious talk of wealth, or else these folks would be equally repulsed by “Real Housewives.”

No, conservatives’ distaste for rap likely flows from a simpler fact: The average Republican and the average rap fan probably understand shockingly little about each other’s backgrounds, each other’s mentalities, or each other’s daily lives. Conservatives hate hip-hop because they don’t get the people who love it.

That’s not healthy. We are all Americans. We’re all neighbors. We’re all children of God.

Tons of people love this particular kind of art. If you’re a remotely curious person, you should want to know why.

Nobody’s asking a Michele Bachmann die-hard and a 2 Chainz devotee to become best friends. But most of us are somewhere between these two poles. Moreover, folks, come on. It’s 2015. Near-total ignorance about how sizable chunks of America see the world should embarrass everyone on both sides of this divide. Listening to each other’s music is hardly a big ask, especially when that music kicks ass.

If there’s good music out there, you should want to be hearing it. If you don’t have an innate taste for this music, make a small effort anyway. Be open-minded and intentionally seek out the very best. Tons of people love this particular kind of art. If you’re a remotely curious person, you should want to know why.

And if that art also has the potential to challenge and deepen your worldview? Well, then it’s all the more imperative that conservatives give hip-hop a shot.

The Case For Colorblind Casting,"The controversy over the lack of Latinos in the Oscar-nominated film “Boyhood” has put a spotlight on an issue that has long been simmering in the world of entertainment. For decades the question of colorblind casting has been debated. Even the term itself betrays the age of the question, as it was coined before “colorblind” became a dirty word.

The basic dilemma is that many content creators believe the race of a character affects the story being told (and in some cases not the way they want), but at the same time almost everyone agrees that it is important to provide opportunities for minority actors and to reflect the diverse world in which we live. To bridge these ideas, we need to look carefully at how we tell stories and how we cast actors. We need a few guidelines to help us understand what race means when we are telling a story.

Acting and modeling are two of the very few professions in which the color of a potential employee’s skin may be taken into account in hiring. This can sometimes be a shocking and visceral reality behind the scenes of dramatic and advertising content.

Sometimes, Race Really Matters for Casting

Years ago, an advertising company hired my theater company to develop some short scenes exploring the branding of a product. After the scripts were done, we sat with a few of the execs to look at headshots of potential actors. There was one black actor I really liked for the lead, but when I put his photo on the table I was quickly told he wasn’t what they were looking for. This black actor did not fit the target demographic of the brand. I was stunned, almost angry. But I came to understand that such decisions are not only commonplace, but that they can often make a lot of sense.

Unlike almost every other line of work, there are times when taking the race of a performer into account is perfectly legitimate.

For better or worse, advertisers, keen on securing any advantage they can to make their product stand out, target products to racial groups. This usually means hiring members of those groups to play the product’s consumers. Films and plays often do the same thing. The Urban Theater Circuit for example, once known as the Chitlin Circuit, produces religious-themed musicals for the black community with black actors and is wildly successful. Race is central to their product. One of the Urban Theater Circuit’s biggest success stories is Tyler Perry, and race is just as central to his storytelling in movies and television.

The point is that, unlike almost every other line of work, there are times when taking the race of a performer into account is perfectly legitimate. However, this does not mean that a character or actor’s race must be considered in all instances. In fact, in most cases it is basically irrelevant.

When Race Does and Doesn’t Matter in Casting

In figuring out which situation is which, it is useful to break scripts into two basic types. The first is a script in which the race of the character is either specifically mentioned or which is set in a time or place that demands specific racial casting. These scripts we can call “contextually specific.” The second is a script in which no reference is made to race and the time and place set no specific demands. These we can call “contextually neutral.”

When a film or play is specifically exploring issues of race, it is perfectly acceptable to cast on that basis, just as it is when advertisers are targeting a demographic.

Scripts that are contextually specific are relatively rare. Most of our storytelling takes place in the present and is not focused on the issue of race. But there are still plenty of stories in which these conditions do exist. Each needs to be considered somewhat differently. In the case of historical period pieces, there is a lot of wiggle room in terms of racial casting. The hottest ticket in New York right now is “Hamilton” at the Public Theater, a musical in which a racially diverse cast plays many of the founding fathers. Likewise, the recent Broadway production of “The Best Man,” Gore Vidal’s drama set at a 1960s political convention, cast the black actor James Earl Jones as the sitting president. Obviously, these depictions are not historically accurate, but who cares? Audiences aren’t stymied by this disconnect, and actors deserve the right to embody historical figures even if they don’t exactly look like them.

This also applies to the controversy surrounding “Exodus: Gods and Kings.” Ridley Scott’s use of white actors to play ancient Egyptians, especially Joel Edgerton as Pharaoh Ramesses II, caused consternation in cultural critics who saw it as a whitewashing, or a reinforcing of white privilege. But Scott cast the actor he thought was best for the role in his script. If artists choose to focus on questions of race and privilege in their work, that’s their prerogative. But it’s not what Scott was doing. Scott was telling a seminal, ancient story told by people of every race across the globe. He has no responsibility to make it a statement on modern racial politics, and nobody should try to force him into doing that.

Contextually specific scripts in which race itself plays a significant role are a different story. In “Selma,” for example, it makes no sense for a non-black actor to play Martin Luther King Jr. or for a non-white actor to play Lyndon Johnson. Those racial identities are central to the story, and there is nothing wrong with that. When a film or play is specifically exploring issues of race, it is perfectly acceptable to cast on that basis, just as it is when advertisers are targeting a demographic. This is natural and to be expected. But the fact is such stories are very much the exception, not the rule.

For Most Scripts, Race Doesn’t Matter

The vast majority of scripts and stories fall into the contextually neutral category. Most dramas, thrillers, romantic comedies, etc., are set in the present and do not specifically deal with race. In these cases, race really has no business being considered at all. Directors should just be looking for the best performer for the part. When rumors surfaced that Idris Elba, a black actor, was being considered as the next James Bond, there were a few raised eyebrows. But there shouldn’t have been. There is nothing about the character of James Bond in the twenty-first century that demands he be of any certain race. In contextually neutral scripts such as the Bond series, an actor’s race should be irrelevant in casting.

There is nothing about the character of James Bond in the twenty-first century that demands he be of any certain race.

Now, some would argue that race is such an essential and incendiary element of our society that its effect can never be neutral. It can be argued that Elba as Bond imbues the story with specific and different elements for audiences. Likewise, casting an interracial couple in a RomCom could have an impact on the way in which audiences consider them, even if race in never mentioned in the story.

This is probably true. But it is not a legitimate reason for directors to consider race in hiring, for the simple reason that the impact in unknowable. For every audience member whose view of the work is profoundly affected (positively or negatively) by an actor’s race, there are audience members who don’t give it a second thought. So, since it is impossible to know what effect race is having on different observers, it is irrational to make decisions on that basis.

Another, and perhaps more important reason to disregard the potential impact of a performer’s race on audiences is that such considerations are entirely dependent on the mores of the production’s time. In 1924 when Eugene O’Neill premiered “All God’s Chillun” starring Paul Robeson, there was outrage over a scene where his white co-star kissed the black Robeson’s hand. Some contemporary writers and critics suggested recasting Robeson as a white man in blackface simply to avoid offending the sensibilities of the time. O’Neill refused. It wasn’t the story he was telling.

Give Artists Latitude to Tell Their Stories

Modern Progressive critics of “Boyhood” and film and drama in general would be wise to remember that. Our own rules about such things may be more enlightened than those of the 1920s, but they are by no means etched in un-erodable stone. Today’s artists must be given latitude, just as O’Neill was, to tell their stories as they see fit. Today’s social-justice warriors bristling at the fact that our screens and stages do not reflect the world as they wish it to be may not be as different from O’Neil’s racist critics as they imagine themselves to be.

Unless there is an obvious, compelling interest for racially biased casting, it should never be done.

As is so often the case with the question of race, our society ties itself in knots over issues that should be rather simple. Most of the time, there is no reason to consider the race of a performer in a film or a play. But sometimes there is a reason.

In far too many cases, marketing research and focus groups have the perverse effect of making content creators, who should be innovating, hew to the status quo. But unless there is an obvious, compelling interest for racially biased casting, it should never be done. Rather, we should trust in the power of talented performers of every race to reach out through the screen or stage and tell us stories of our world and ourselves.

Wanted: A Color-Blind Voting Rights Law,"This past week in Alabama Black Caucus v. Alabama, the United States Supreme Court, by a five-to-four decision—with Justice Stephen Breyer writing for the four liberal justices plus Justice Kennedy—struck down Alabama’s redistricting plan for its state Senate and House of Representatives under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The issue arose as a result of a confluence of two powerful factors. First, the inevitable shifts in population densities between censuses make current districts noncompliant with the Supreme Court’s exacting numerical identity standard for state district. The second is the change in legislative control from Democrats to Republicans, allowing Republicans to imitate the Democrats after the 2000 census—to create districts with equal populations that will let Republicans nab seats in excess of their percentage of popular support.

The most common technique to skew political power gives the opposition party a smaller number of seats in which they hold commanding majorities, while reserving for itself a larger number of seats with smaller yet still safe electoral majorities. Politically, a 55 to 45 percent margin is roughly 99 percent as safe and stable as, say, a 70 to 30 percent margin. Given the detailed knowledge of race and voting patterns, it’s duck soup for any computer-savvy political caucus to implement the program.

In a sensible world, the best counter to these dangerous tendencies uses explicit formal requirements to remove this unpleasant form of tit-for-tat politics. Two constraints, taken together, could achieve this result in a relatively simple fashion. The first is to stick with a requirement of rough numerical equality across districts. The second is to require relatively compact districts, which look more like simple squares than some grotesque 28-sided monster that white citizens (outnumbered by 4 to 1) consciously created in Tuskegee Alabama in 1957 to block the possibility that newly enfranchised black residents would soon take over local politics. Six years after Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court in Gomillion v. Lightfoot struck down this ploy under the Fifteenth Amendment, which provides that the “right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”

But now that the political tables are turned, the Supreme Court, under its version of Tuskegee Modern actively encourages the use of these same racially constructed districts to increase the influence of minority voters relative to white ones. Since the Fifteenth Amendment is quite useless for that purpose, all attention shifts to the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of Equal Protection under the laws, which was invoked in the stirring 1896 dissent of John Marshall Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson aimed to usher in a color-blind Constitution.

No longer, clearly. The Supreme Court has made a U-turn to a race-conscious Constitution. At the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the systematic exclusion of black citizens from the polls prompted the adoption of strong preclearance measures to prevent subtle rearguard actions by entrenched public officials determined to perpetuate the old order. Those days are long gone, and in 2012 a sharply divided Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder rightly struck down the much-expanded use of preclearance procedures long after segregationists had lost any control over the political process. Essentially the majority held the expanded preclearance proceedings as inappropriate overkill in the absence of any evidence of current racial bias in the administration of the voting laws—a no-brainer in light of the high rates of black participation throughout the South.

Shelby County should be read to hold that the Supreme Court should no longer use the Equal Protection Clause to maximize overall black political influence, however defined. Nonetheless, Black Caucus only expands the use of race-based redistricting. To get a grasp of the doctrinal confusion, consider the Court’s current Equal Protection jurisprudence.

Its argument starts off innocently enough: electoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when race is the “’predominant’ consideration in deciding ‘to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,’ and the use of race is not ‘narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.’” Next, that compelling state interest consists in “avoiding retrogression with respect to racial minorities’ ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice.” The odd word “retrogression” refers to language in the 2005 Voting Rights Act, which was intended to counter, at the very least, the possibility that the redistricting process might be used to increase the concentration of minority voters in the “majority-minority” districts. By reducing the minority votes, the anti-retrogression provision would stop any shrinkage in minority representation.

In Black Caucus, Alabama used, as it had to do, race at every stage in the process to create a new set of districts that it wanted to reflect the exact same black-white voting percentages in the prior reapportionment. Only a sophist could argue that these district lines were not motivated by race, given the use of systematic quotas. The sensible remedy is to nip the problem in the bud by striking down that raced-based process by using the population parity and compactness criteria mentioned above. Oddly enough, Justice Breyer thought that those tests were incomplete because they did not include “not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and protecting incumbents.” The first of these is a rough proxy for compactness, the second is an independent value that may advance the attachment of local citizens to the political process. The third looks to be an inexcusable form of self-protection in any institutional setting.

Nonetheless, Justice Breyer’s uncritical acceptance of the “compelling state” interest to allow minority members to elect candidates of their choice is sadly perverse. In most other contexts, the compelling state interest test is an exacting one, which roughly speaking, cuts back on protected constitutional interests in order to preserve domestic order and to protect the nation from foreign aggression. Some form of extrinsic necessity is required for a careful and limited abridgment of constitutional rights.

How then does the conscious advancement of the political influence of African-American voters count as a socially compelling interest as opposed to the latest partisan ploy in the endless round of skirmishes over political control? This heavy-handed technique is no longer needed as a counterweight against systematic forms of institutional racism. If Shelby County was correct to condemn overly intrusive preclearance provisions, the same response is appropriate to any federal standard that prefers one class of voters to another on the ground of race—indeed on any grounds at all.

In dealing with this issue, moreover, the Supreme Court seems to make some unexamined but highly dubious empirical assumptions that the means chosen will fit the ends in question. But the set of social considerations do not lend themselves to these easy calculations. The original goal of the 1965 VRA was to increase black participation to the level of white participation. That end has already been achieved, at which point the influence of formerly disenfranchised voters is felt in every district in which they vote. Winning elective office is always an arduous task of stitching together complex coalitions, minority voters included, assuming that they vote as a block, which they need not do.

It is therefore fair to ask why, once the vote has increased, is it better socially for minority voters to be part of winning coalitions in multiple districts or to be the dominant players in a smaller number of districts? Owing to the immense variations in local politics, only the foolhardy would be confident which way the balance tilts. Ignoring race in redistricting does not strip minority voters of influence. But it does reduce the influence of the Alabama Black Caucus, whose number decreases if black voters are dispersed through multiple districts, leading to a deep conflict of interest between the Black Caucus and ordinary black citizens. The Black Caucus is composed exclusively of blacks elected to public office. A rule that refuses to make race-conscious classifications will surely thin its ranks, but may also increase the overall influence of black voters who are parceled out across multiple districts.

What is clear, regrettably clear, is that maximizing black representation upsets the overall political configuration. The creation of more majority-minority districts will move the representatives of those districts to the left, given the strong level of black support for the Democratic Party. By the same token, the remaining majority-majority districts will become more conservative as their candidates for office need not worry about the political preferences of non-members. Looked at in the round, race-conscious rules in drawing district lines lead to increased polarization of politics. It is hard to see why the Equal Protection Clause requires this divisive form of politics.

Nor are we sure how this will play out. The Supreme Court struck down Alabama’s prior redistricting and ordered a new one. But the Court left it unclear exactly what principles shall govern this second go around. Is it really the case that the system will be unconstitutional unless Alabama maximizes the number of majority-minority districts with, say, 55 percent votes? Can it do less? If so, by how much? Can it achieve the same result by different means, stating explicitly that it is trying to increase the number of heavily majority-Democratic districts in order to maintain the Republican chokehold of the Alabama House and Senate? None of these alternatives are defensible as a matter of first principle.

This sorry episode once again validates a central theorem of constitutional law. Once a legal system goes off the rails on its major premises, it cannot undo the institutional damage by fine-tuning the rest of the system. Today, it is untenable to invoke the Equal Protection Clause when so many simple race-blind rules are available to handle districting. In the end, Justice Thomas’s sole dissent was right to call Alabama Black Caucus the latest installment in the “disastrous misadventure” of the Supreme Court’s voting rights case law. The Supreme Court should scrap its unsound Equal Protection case law and return to the simpler principles of Gomillion v. Lightfoot, which thankfully addresses a once terrible set of problems already solved by the political and legal process.

Weekend Cocktail: The Manhattan Madness Tournament,"NCAA Basketball has wound down, and America has learned yet again never to trust anyone from North Carolina. There were precious few people who predicted the course of the tournament. I’m given to understand that this year something like 99 percent of brackets perished ingloriously on the first night of the tourney. I’ve seen quite a few photos of crying fans and screaming Ashley Judds, which makes the whole affair seem altogether unpleasant.

I don’t follow the sport, but can’t begrudge anyone his or her passion. I have my own enthusiasms, after all. Happily, all the excitement gave me an idea (just in time for the start of baseball season): why not develop a bracketology more in keeping with my own interests?

To that end, welcome to MANHATTAN MADNESS.

There are few cocktails more deserving of in-depth study than the Manhattan. At its most essential, it consists of two parts whiskey to one part sweet vermouth, with several healthy dashes of Angostura bitters. It’s easy to prepare, and improves with quality ingredients. Boozy and complex, it appeals to the fellas and to the ladies. One is more than sufficient to set you on an even keel after a long day.

Because of its simplicity, the Manhattan lends itself to experimentation. There’s no shortage of alternate recipes out there. For my mini-tournament I identified eight promising variations, including what I consider the classic version.

Each drink was randomly seeded, to prevent my admittedly shameless bias from influencing the matchups. Unless otherwise noted, the individual ingredients and preparation methods were the same across each drink to at least take a stab at consistency.

Meet the Manhattan Madness Judging Panel

I also employed a panel of judges to help evaluate the contenders. These red-blooded, booze-loving Americans were tasked with sampling two drinks in a matchup and voting for the one they preferred, until a champion stood above the rest. Allow me to introduce the tasters:

These red-blooded, booze-loving Americans were tasked with sampling two drinks in a matchup and voting for the one they preferred, until a champion stood above the rest.

Andy: Andy is my uncle. His contributions have graced this column before—notably, his mint julep recipe.

Mary: My aunt, who I believe favors wine but can certainly appreciate a well-crafted cocktail—and the ones I make, as well.

Amanda: One of our oldest friends, who admittedly does not often hit the hard stuff. However, she’s a good sport and agreed to participate on the condition that I actually delivered an article about it.

Rachel (a.k.a. Mrs. Dewing): My wife, gracious as ever. She provides photography for these columns, the quality of which far outstrips the writing. She enjoys a mixed drink nearly as much as I do.

Neal: That’s me. I made the things; I was damn well going to sample them.

As the night went on, the tournament proved to hold some surprises. Perhaps they won’t be as vexing to you as the upsets in your bracket, but for me it was a hell of a ride.

Manhattan Madness Round One

Game 1: Classic Manhattan vs. Seattle Manhattan. FINAL RESULT: 3-2, Seattle.

This matchup pitted a drink that was all about fundamentals against an unorthodox recipe that stretched the bounds of what can reasonably be called a Manhattan.

Going in, the classic was heavily favored to win (by me). We tasted it first, and it received the expected high marks. A higher-proof rye like Rittenhouse stands up to mixing very well. The drink hit the right notes, especially with the male judges, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Seattle’s response. The flavorful oddball quickly won over the women, who due to my own lack of forethought comprised the majority of judges. Ultimately, the Seattle Manhattan’s smooth, sweet, distinct notes of coffee gave it the edge over the favorite.

Classic Manhattan

This is the Platonic ideal of a Manhattan.

2 parts Rittenhouse Bottled in Bond 100-proof rye

1 part Carpano Antica vermouth

3-4 heavy dashes Angostura bitters

cherry for garnish.

Add ice to a mixing glass. Add liquid ingredients. Stir smoothly for about 50 rotations, which will ensure it is ice-cold but not too diluted. Strain into cocktail glass and garnish with a maraschino cherry.

Andy: “Not much of a burn, really.”

Amanda: “I have a burn, in my esophagus.”

Andy: “I call it ‘warm.’”

Rachel: “The rye gives it some definite spice.”

Andy: “A sweet bouquet.”

Seattle Manhattan

3 parts Jim Beam bourbon

1 part espresso vodka (or coffee liqueur)

1 part kahlua

1 part sweet vermouth

Add ingredients to an ice-filled shaker. Shake gently for about 30 seconds, and strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with some whole coffee beans if you like.

Women judges: “Mmmmmm!”

Mary: “It’s smooth like the Kahlua, but I don’t really taste the Kahlua. I taste the espresso.”

Rachel: “It’s not too sweet.”

Neal: “Definitely tastes…all right.”

Andy: “I call it distracting.”

Game 2: Aged Manhattan vs. Bourbon Manhattan. FINAL RESULT: 3-2, Bourbon.

The Aged Manhattan is identical to the classic, but was left for ten days in a sealed bottle with charred oak staves to soak up their flavor. This speeds an aging process that would normally take months, and gives it a broader, richer flavor.

The Bourbon was simply the better-realized drink that night; but if the Aged cocktail could be refined and dial in to its potential, who can say what the results of a rematch might be?

The Bourbon Manhattan is a solid all-around contender. While rye is the classic base liquor, bourbon is perfectly suitable. The better the bourbon, the better the drink, and this Bourbon Manhattan was made with 10-year-old Russell’s Reserve to give it some more presence.

It was a close contest, and the judges were split. The Aged Manhattan did offer a unique, slightly oaked taste, with strong but not unpleasant notes of charcoal that put one in mind of a Scotch. The Bourbon was strong, smooth, and flavorful.

While the Aged definitely had a lot going for it, it had perhaps been incubating for just a couple days too long. It tasted good, just unbalanced. The Bourbon was simply the better-realized drink that night; but if the Aged cocktail could be refined and dial in to its potential, who can say what the results of a rematch might be? If sports were all about the numbers, nobody would have a reason to watch.

Aged Manhattan

2 parts Rittenhouse Bottled in Bond 100-proof rye

1 part Carpano Antica vermouth

3-4 heavy dashes Angostura bitters

cherry for garnish.

Aged for ten days using charred oak staves

Strain aged mixture through cheesecloth into mixing glass. Stir and strain as with Classic Manhattan.

Rachel: “It smells like a wood stove. I like it.”

Amanda: “It’s really different—I haven’t had one like that before.”

Andy: “I don’t taste as much of the smoke as I smell. It almost comes off like a Scotch. It has scotch-like tendencies.”

Mary: “Lots of different flavors at play.”

Neal: “It’s just not quite there; lots of potential but needs more work.”

Bourbon Manhattan

2 parts Russell’s Reserve 10-year-old bourbon

1 Carpano Antica vermouth

Andy: “Acceptable, though.”

Game 3: Black Manhattan vs. White Manhattan. FINAL RESULT: 5-0, Black

Sometimes random matches seem less than random, and a little too on the nose. This was all the computer’s fault. Given the news over the last few months, I was concerned that this matchup had the potential to be a source of several unfortunate jokes. Luckily, we resisted the impulse to yell things like “Drink up! Don’t puke!” or to endlessly quote “Blazing Saddles.” Strictly business, here, no politics.

It smelled great, but it tasted like generic cold medicine.

As it happened, this wasn’t even a contest. The White Manhattan stumbled out of the gate and never recovered. It was made using unaged whiskey, Benedictine, Dolin Blanc, and orange bitters. It smelled great, but it tasted like generic cold medicine.

The Black Manhattan’s use of the amaro Averna in place of sweet vermouth gave it a certain musty, herbal flavor that made it quite appealing to the judges. Using bourbon also gave it far more sweetness than the white whiskey, which needed Benedictine in order to avoid tasting like turpentine.

The Black Manhattan was, at least, not horrible. Hard to say whether it won on the merits or just drew an opponent that choked.

Black Manhattan

2 parts Jim Beam

1 part Averna

3-4 dashes Angostura bitters

cherry for garnish

Stir; strain.

Mary: “This smells like an old person’s closet…in a good way!”

Amanda: “It went down pretty easy. Maybe it’s musky? Maybe that’s why it smells…off? It’s pleasant, though.”

White Manhattan

3 parts unaged (white) whiskey

1 part Benedictine

1 part Dolin Blanc

3 dashes orange bitters

Stir; strain.

Rachel: “This smells like a public restroom air freshener. Or cleaning supplies.”

Mary: “It tastes like cough syrup.”

Neal: “Yeah, this is gross. Sorry. I followed the recipe…I’m mostly disappointed in myself.”

Game 4: Mystery Manhattan vs. Shaken Manhattan. Final Result: 5-0, Mystery

I was keen to get to this matchup, for one reason: I have long been an advocate against the Shaken Manhattan. I have a chip on my shoulder, and I freely admit it.

A standard Manhattan should never be shaken, yet at almost any bar that is what you’ll get when you order one.

A standard Manhattan should never be shaken, yet at almost any bar that is what you’ll get when you order one. You’re presented with a bowl of diluted, flavorless liquor that is devoid of character or bite. It may also have annoying bits of ice floating on top of it. Shaken Manhattans are inferior in every regard, and I hate them.

The Mystery Manhattan made short work of the watery, weak Shaken version. It stomped all over it, and then ground its face into the dirt and stole its milk money. Nobody liked the Shaken Manhattan. Nobody.

I wish I could say with any authority what is actually in the Mystery Manhattan, but aside from “a LOT of very strong alcohol” I can’t be sure. Based on the seasonal offering from Husk, a fine restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina, it has a good flavor. There’s a bit of the oak from the barrel and several other additions that come together to make it worth exploring.

A bottle of this concoction was placed in my hands one evening by the publisher of this esteemed online magazine of culture and opinion. He drew it from his own private reserve. The recipe is approximately reproduced below, but perhaps due to its high-octane nature the exact proportions related to me were somewhat…fuzzy.

Mystery Manhattan

Unverified demon whiskey

Hellfire

Madness

cherry for garnish

Stir, strain. Avoid open flames.

Mary: “I swear it just burned my nose hairs!”

Andy: “It’s… a sipping drink.”

Rachel: “I actually like the taste, compared to a regular Manhattan.”

Amanda: “It’s not bad it’s just…strong.”

Shaken Manhattan

2 parts Rittenhouse Bottled in Bond 100-proof rye

1 part Carpano Antica vermouth

3-4 heavy dashes Angostura bitters

cherry for garnish.

Shake vigorously for a few seconds, strain into a cocktail glass.

Rachel: “This is much more watery than the regular Manhattan. It doesn’t really have a burn at all.”

Amanda: “It does taste watery.”

Neal: “Just not enough presence.” [Spends five minutes explaining that shaken Manhattans are inferior and he knew this beforehand but wanted to prove it to everyone.]

Manhattan Madness Round Two

Advancing: Black vs. Seattle; Bourbon vs. Mystery

Round one concluded with several of my favorites discarded. The only event that didn’t hold a surprise for me was the inglorious defeat of the execrable Shaken Manhattan. Most shocking to me was the loss of the Classic Manhattan to the Seattle. Seattle wasn’t done yet, as events would prove.

To nurse my offended sensibilities, I made good use of the losers’ bracket.

To nurse my offended sensibilities, I made good use of the losers’ bracket. This was a far less complicated undertaking, and each contender was equally ranked—on a straight line into my mouth.

At this point, our judges knew what to expect from the remaining contenders. Some patterns had developed: a preference for sweet over spicy; for substantial taste; for some bite, but not too much.

Game 5: Black Manhattan vs. Seattle Manhattan. FINAL RESULT: 4-1, Seattle

The Black Manhattan took on Seattle with its herbal, slightly musty notes. While it made a good showing, ultimately the strength of Seattle’s configuration held. Perhaps still smarting from the earlier upset, one judge voted for Black. However, the writing was on the wall. Despite having more of an alcoholic presence, and hewing more closely to the standard Manhattan formulation, Black just couldn’t overcome Seattle’s pleasant, coffee-infused taste. Seattle won decisively.

Seattle

Rachel: “Yep, still like it!”

Amanda: “Yep.”

Mary: “Yes.”

Andy: “It actually tastes better this time.”

Neal: “It smells like a tootsie roll.”

Black

Mary: “Very burny.”

Amanda: “Which was that one up against last time? The White? Oh, no wonder it won.”

Andy: “Tough call, actually.”

Game 6: Bourbon Manhattan vs. Mystery Manhattan. FINAL RESULT: 5-0, Bourbon

The Bourbon Manhattan went into this round after just squeaking by the first round. It was pitted against a drink that had crushed its last competitor and wrung the life from it before tossing it aside like a crumpled grocery list.

This ended up a cocktail version of the Rumble in the Jungle with Bourbon playing the role of Muhammad Ali.

As it turned out, strength isn’t everything. This ended up a cocktail version of the Rumble in the Jungle with Bourbon playing the role of Muhammad Ali. The Bourbon proved to be more nimble on the tongue, and defied Mystery Manhattan’s attempt to roll over it.

One of the fundamental qualities of any cocktail is balance. In this case, balance beat brawn in a unanimous decision.

It is perhaps worth noting that on a whim I made a second batch of the Mystery Manhattan, but this time against all my deeply held beliefs I decided to shake it. This smoothed out the mix considerably, and made it much more palatable. It pains me to say it, but if a shaken Mystery Manhattan had been in the game, we might have a different result.

Mystery

Andy: “This is more intense the second time.”

Rachel: “It’s too intense.”

Mandy: “That’s moonshiney to me.”

Mary: “It feels like you could set it on fire.”

Andy: “We could try that if it loses!”

Bourbon

Everyone at once: “Yep.”

Rachel: “I like that bourbon one. I’m surprised, because I usually like the rye.”

Manhattan Madness Championship Round

Advancing: Bourbon vs. Seattle

Round two’s results were not as personally upsetting to me as Round one’s. No doubt this was partly a consequence of the aforementioned losers’ bracket I’d consumed, not to mention the normal course of sampling that comprised the competition. That’s a lot of words to say that by the final matchup of the evening I was well on my way to being terrifically drunk. Of course, that is very much the point of having more than a single Manhattan, if you want my honest opinion.

The judges were loosened up and ready to cap off an eventful tournament.

Game 7: Bourbon Manhattan vs. Seattle Manhattan. FINAL RESULT: 5-0, Bourbon

What a matchup! Here we have the Cinderella story, Seattle’s weird coffee-laden take on the cocktail dispatched the competition on the strength of its sweetness. Standing in opposition, Bourbon’s tweak of the classic formula won over the naysayers after a hotly contested first round.

What would happen? Who would reign supreme? I favored Seattle, based purely on a cynical guess that the women would pick the one that tasted more like candy.

Showing once again that my instincts for this sort of thing are pure garbage, Bourbon won in a unanimous decision. The judges all cited the balanced flavor of the classic version, but with a smoothness one expects from aged bourbon. To them, it just seemed to have more of what a Manhattan should be. While the Seattle was a delicious drink in its own right, it ultimately fell victim to its own showboating.

Victory went to a cocktail that relied on the fundamentals: good ingredients, careful preparation, and balanced composition: The Bourbon Manhattan.

Diversity Is Racist: The Absurd Reaction To Apple’s New Emojis,"In the history of tweets, Clorox’s April 9 tweet was not very interesting. It was just another banal corporate promotion meant to capitalize on a trending news story. “New emojis are alright but where’s the bleach,” Clorox said.

Yet the tweet was so “controversial” that Clorox had to tweet an apology:

Apparently some people thought Clorox wanted to bleach the skin color of Apple’s new diverse emojis. It appears Clorox just wanted what many emoji activists have been fighting for: an emoji that represents them.

Who can blame them? Activists have been campaigning for emojis that “look like me” for some time. Even MSNBC host Ronan Farrow devoted some time of his show in 2014 to ask, “Do you think there’s a limitation we’re suffering from in terms of the racial diversity of these emojis?”

If the racial makeup of emojis is a national issue worthy of cable news time, then we must have made progress on some of the larger racial issues. Still, it seemed a harmless campaign to add more diversity to cell phone keyboards.

A Racist In Every Tweet

But with racial issues, it is never that easy. As the reaction to the Clorox tweet shows, some people like to see racism everywhere. Paige Tutt, associate editor of MMR Magazine, wrote an article for the Washington Post’s PostEverything blog arguing that, “Apple has allowed for further racial segregation with these new emoji.” Tutt argues that now people will inevitably see race everywhere.

Because I’m black, should I now feel compelled to use the “appropriate” brown-skinned nail-painting emoji? Why would I use the white one? Now in simple text messages and tweets, I have to identify myself racially. I’ll now question other people’s emoji use when they’re speaking to me: Why is he sending me the black angel emoji specifically? Why is she sending me the black-girl emoji instead of the white one? What Apple has done is introduce race into everyday conversations where it doesn’t necessarily need to be.

She may be right, but this doesn’t mean there is a problem with the new emojis. It is a problem with people reading race into everything where there never was a racist intent or racist action. Sending a message with a black emoji doesn’t express a racist message. It doesn’t harm anyone. In fact, for a long time activists had been campaigning for more diversity. Now that there is more diversity, some are decrying that very diversity as racist.

Ultimately, though, it is a relatively trivial issue what an emoji looks like. In fact, the whole emoji controversy is about more than just race; it is also about a kind of ultra-sensitivity that millennials have about themselves and their self-worth.

Affirm Me, Or Else

Millennials who grew up in the era of participation trophies and valuing “self-esteem” over all else end up looking for affirmation everywhere—even on their cell-phone emoji keyboards. It is not enough for emojis to be diverse. They have to “look like me.” As Tutt wrote, “Sure, it’d be nice to see some emoji that look like me. But, at the end of the day, none of these really do.” Well, of course not. We all have different hairstyles and facial features. These emojis, anyway, look like cartoons with circular faces.

A redhead who goes by the name Ginger Parrot started a petition at Change.org for redheaded emojis, saying, “If you say you’re going to diversify, why not add a few red-haired emoji in the mix? Natural redheads may be rare at less than 2% of the world’s population, but that is 138,000,000 iPhones waiting to happen.”

Tutt noted that Apple didn’t actually create any new black emojis with radicalized features:

The blond-haired emoji man and the blue-eyed emoji princess are clearly white, but you can slip them into a darker-colored skin. These new figures aren’t emoji of color; they’re just white emoji wearing masks.



Understandably, Apple didn’t want to create caricatures, giving those emoji an afro or thicker lips. But the company had already done something similar. With the first batch of emoji, they clearly identified one character as Asian, giving it narrow eyes and a skull cap. Another was clearly identified as Middle Eastern, with browner skin and a turban.

Incidentally, Tutt was right that giving an emoji character afro-style features would indeed have begged controversy. In fact, about the turbaned character she mentioned, Ronan Farrow said, “It’s not a particularly nuanced portrayal.” Apple would be criticized for portraying a figure with radicalized or cultural (in the case of a turban) features or for not doing so.

Tech Limitations Bar Wider Options for Emojis

Yet there is also a good technical reason Apple hasn’t moved too quickly to introduce more emojis. Emojis must be standardized to appear on different operating systems. The Unicode Consortium is tasked with coming up with new symbols and getting them integrated across systems and fonts, and the symbols look different depending on font. If you type a lollypop into your text editing program, for example, it will display in black and white on most fonts. Apple and other operating systems have introduced color into their emojis for messaging.

As the Unicode Consortium says,

As with the examples of emoji characters representing food items above, an emoji character like U+1F474 OLDER MAN can vary in appearance depending on the font. Unicode does not require a particular racial or ethnic appearance—or for that matter, a particular hair style: bald or hirsute. However, because there are concerns regarding the emoji characters for people, proposals are being developed by Unicode Consortium members to provide more diversity. These proposals include investigation of use of the Fitzpatrick scale to allow greater diversity in the presentation of emoji characters.

If one company introduced new characters to their OS unilaterally, they wouldn’t show up on other systems. In fact, Apple’s new emojis, which also include homosexual relationships and families, don’t show up on old versions of the iPhone OS. The Huffington Post noted, for example, that when an emoji of a four-person family with two male parents is sent to an old version of iOS, the family is translated into four separate emojis of male faces. When darker-skinned emoji faces are sent, they are accompanied by aliens in black boxes.

Even characters sent from an iPhone look different when rendered on an Android. The white police officer on iOS is a black police officer on Android. The blond boy is a blonde girl. An angel with a halo over brown hair on iOS has blond hair on Android.

Emojis were never meant to represent every single person’s appearance. The “OLDER MAN” emoji is just an older man, not a “60-YEAR-OLD REDHEADED MAN WITH GLASSES.” The most basic emojis were just smiley yellow faces. As cell phones became more advanced, they started to include cartoonish human forms. Thus, the emojis began to take on the appearance of races. Apple’s new system uses bright yellow skin as the default for emojis—like the color of smiley faces, or Simpsons characters—and lets users pick one of five shades based on the Fitzpatrick scale. Some people thought the yellow default was meant to represent Asians, eliciting minor controversy.

Chill Out, People, and Smile

Continuing to expand the number and scope of emojis is a good thing. It expands our ability to convey different messages. If some people don’t want to send a certain emoji because they don’t like it or think it will be misunderstood, that is their choice. With so many characters on the keyboard, we can express a wide variety of messages as we see fit.

Tutt notes that some people have used the dark-skinned emojis to share racist messages. Such messages should be condemned, but they don’t say anything about the wisdom of introducing new emojis. They only say something about the person expressing the message. Even text can be used to share racist messages, yet that isn’t a condemnation of the printing press or the keyboard.

But would it be too much to hope that people become a little less judgmental and take things more lightly? If someone sends you a message with a smiling face, the first reaction shouldn’t be to analyze what message he or she was sending by the race of the face. The message of a smiling face is one of happiness, in any race.

Feminism’s Age of Ultron,"Last weekend, thousands of mindless drones appeared out of nowhere, bringing destruction upon the unsuspecting. In their vicious attack, they spoke with one voice, claiming that the violence they wrought was necessary for peace in the world.

Oh. Did you think I was referring to the plot of “Avengers: Age of Ultron”? I was actually referring to the feminist backlash on Twitter against the movie’s director, Joss Whedon. Supposed fans directed thousands of profanity-laced tweets at Whedon, many of which promised him bodily harm. What sparked the outrage? What was his sin against feminism? He ruined their “strong female character,” Natasha Romanoff, also known as Black Widow.

The backlash seems to have caught Whedon by surprise, and after it started he deleted his Twitter account. These hateful tweets must have been especially painful for Whedon, since he calls himself a feminist and has been one of the feminist movement’s darlings in the past because he’s created some notable “strong female characters.” He took a wrong turn this go round, however.

Feminists Perpetuate the Themes They Claim to Hate

The self-proclaimed feminists of Twitter (to borrow NPR’s phraseology) were on the defensive before the movie even opened because two of the movie’s stars, Jeremy Renner and Chris Evans, joked in an interview that Black Widow was a slut. The Internet feminists demanded an apology, and the chastised stars expressed sorrow for calling into question the morals of a fictional character. Feminists of the Twittersphere, however, maintain constant vigilance, and they watched “Age of Ultron” closely to make sure that their favorite “strong female character” received the treatment she deserved.

They were disappointed.

Should Whedon have given the Black Widow character a get-out-of-jail-free card just because she’s a woman?

Complaints against how Whedon, who both wrote and directed the movie, portrayed Romanoff fall into two categories. First, feminists took offense at Romanoff’s capture by Ultron, which turned her into a “damsel in distress.” Second, Romanoff calls herself a “monster” in one scene, in which she admits that she allowed herself to be sterilized to become a more effective assassin.

Regarding Romanoff’s capture, she doesn’t seem to be in too much distress, and she doesn’t act like much of a damsel. The feminists are the ones reinforcing the damsel-in-distress motif, not Whedon. Whedon has Romanoff kick butt before her capture, act inventively during it, and kick butt after her release. Her release isn’t even the main point of the mission. Sure, the team wants her back, but this isn’t a rescue-the-princess moment.

In fact, it seems that every other Avenger has been captured or in grave peril at some point in the course of these movies, and needed the help of someone else to get free. Should Whedon have given the Black Widow character a get-out-of-jail-free card just because she’s a woman? The feminists of Twitter impute evil motives to Whedon. The rest of us, on the other hand, saw an Avenger get into trouble, which is a pretty typical situation for an Avenger. It’s the feminist trolls who don’t believe in equality between the sexes, because there’s some things you can’t do to a “strong female character” in your movie.

Be a Man or You’re Not a Woman

Part of the problem is that some feminists have an incredibly narrow definition of “strong female character.” These feminists demand that their “strong female character” be a remorseless killer who has sex with people. They essentially want James Bond with breasts. This strikes me as a sort of trans-patriarchy. Women must take the traits of men that they hate in order to be strong. Making women act like men in order to succeed doesn’t sound like feminism to me. It sounds like an adolescent male’s fantasy, but that’s how less-than-thoughtful feminists define “strong female character.”

Maybe she can’t break people’s necks with her legs, and maybe she didn’t save the world from aliens, but she did manage to save Tony Stark’s soul.

Many tweets complained that Black Widow was the only “strong female character” in Marvel’s movies. Whedon’s TV series, “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” however, has three female characters who show strength in very different ways, yet each is flawed in different ways. It’s true that no female character has gotten her own movie yet, but Pepper Potts is a better strong character than Black Widow. Pepper is smart, hardworking, and brave. Maybe she can’t break people’s necks with her legs, and maybe she didn’t save the world from aliens, but she did manage to save Tony Stark’s soul. Being strong doesn’t always mean making other people suffer. Sometimes it means suffering in order to help other people.

It seems, however, that as far as the Internet’s feminists are concerned, one of the things that you can’t do is give a “strong female character” a tragic backstory. In “Age of Ultron,” Romanoff regrets her sterilization, and refers to herself as a “monster.” Whedon should have known that he, as a man, is not allowed to write about “reproductive health” even in fiction. The tweets flew fast and furious, denouncing Whedon for calling women monsters who cannot or choose not to have children.

Black Widow traded the ability to create life for the ability to snuff it out more effectively.

We learned in middle school that fictional characters don’t necessarily speak for the author. Did all these feminists miss that lesson? It’s more likely that these people are merely reacting because “triggers” allow people to act and say things without thought.

But back to Romanoff’s monstrous sterility. She explains that the reason for the sterilization was to ensure that a family wouldn’t distract her from killing people. Yeah, that is monstrous. She traded the ability to create life for the ability to snuff it out more effectively. The Russian government coerced her into making a really bad choice, and she has dealt with the emotional baggage ever since.

Of Monsters and Redemption

Of course, Whedon could have invented a different backstory for Black Widow, but one of the themes of the movie is brokenness, and sterilizing a young girl to turn her into a better assassin is fairly heartbreaking. In “Age of Ultron,” each of the Avengers experiences pain, regret, and fear. At some point in the movie, each Avenger is called a monster. Sometimes they call themselves that, as in the case of Black Widow, but sometimes they call each other that. Twitter’s feminists must not have noticed how often the word came up.

Whedon, however, offers a ray of hope. Just because you’re a monster doesn’t mean you have to stay that way. Hawkeye is the heart and soul of this movie, and at one point he gives a pep talk, in which he says it doesn’t matter what you’ve done, if you get out there and fight, you’re an Avenger. Even though the Avengers sometimes have to kill, they stand on the side of life. At the end of the movie, one of the new Avengers says of humanity, “There’s grace in their failings.” Whedon tries to send a message of encouragement in “Age of Ultron”: even though we’re a broken mess, we can transcend that brokenness if we stick together.

I’m not saying I thought the movie was excellent. I didn’t care for a few of Whedon’s choices in the movie—too many cheap jokes and whatnot. My biggest complaint about the movie, however, was that Whedon was a little too heavy-handed with his theme of transcending brokenness. But maybe he should have been even more obvious, because it seems that social media’s feminists just didn’t get it.

A Child’s Memory Of White Flight From Baltimore,"I watched it happen. It started when I was seven years old. Then I watched it happen again, 47 years later.

I saw Baltimore burn from my bedroom window in 1968. As a child, I lived in a Baltimore row-house neighborhood made up of working- and middle-class families. My parents’ house perched in a group at the top of a small hill that allowed us to see just over the roofs of other houses from the back bedroom windows.

From the tiny bedroom I shared with my sister, I got a clear view down to the harbor, which in 1968 was nothing but warehouses. Not much of a view, just open sky and rooftops, but on the Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve we could watch the fireworks display at Memorial Stadium from that back window. However, on those fateful nights in ’68 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King we watched the entire skyline of Baltimore on fire, a different kind of fireworks altogether.

My Civil Rights-Marching Parents

My parents were true–blue, old-fashioned Democrats. They marched for civil rights. My father was a leader in the teachers’ union uprisings of the 1960s and 1970s. All of the children in the family marched on the strike lines with our parents, my mother fervently hoping that the police would arrest her with my baby brother in her arms and Baltimore Sun photographers snapping photos.

They were devastated when they saw their city on fire.

A teacher at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute his entire career, my father supported Poly’s desegregation two years before Brown v. Board of Education and helped make it a reality in our city. My mother worked with NECO, the Northeast Community Organization in Baltimore, to fight for housing rights, to get street lights on dangerous corners, and to support political campaigns of Democrat candidates.

They wept when Kennedy was assassinated. They wept when King was assassinated. They were devastated when they saw their city on fire. Their hearts broke, and their will was finally shattered when Bobby Kennedy was assassinated.

White Flight Isn’t What You Might Think

Within one year of those riots, my grandparents moved out of their modest northeast Baltimore Clifton Park home they had built in the 1920s. Three years later, my family moved out of our Chinquapin Park row home. That would technically make my family part of the great “white flight” that occurred in many major cities in America during this era.

So much of what is being reported about Baltimore on news stations across this country is just not true or is only partially true.

In an article entitled “White flight decimated Baltimore businesses long before rioters showed up,” by Jake Flanagin, a New York-based journalist who blames white flight for all of the problems plaguing Baltimore, he states, “Because when we watch these events unfold on television screens or Twitter feeds, and ask ourselves, ‘Christ, how did it get this bad?’ we should already know the answer.”

The answer apparently is me and my family, except that like most things, it is never that simple. So much of what is being reported about Baltimore on news stations across this country is just not true or is only partially true. One of my mantras lately comes from an old Yiddish proverb, “A half-truth is a whole lie.” There are quite a few half-truths going around these days.

Racism Isn’t the Major Problem in Baltimore

I know that white racism is not the cause of Baltimore’s problems, although it is certainly the most politically correct and convenient answer. I will never deny that racism is part of our city’s history, but it is not the main cause of Baltimore’s problems today, especially considering consistent representation of blacks and Democrats in the political power structure of Baltimore for decades, two groups who are not supposed to have even a smidgen of racism.

I must deconstruct the lies upon which the narrative of white flight is built.

I know economic events added energy to so-called white flight and the various riots. Two of these events were the flight of heavy industry from the city itself (e.g., Bethlehem Steel, Maryland Shipbuilding, and Continental Can), along with the abandonment of other major employers in clothing and textiles to the surrounding counties where they were eager to retool their plants, usually with substantial subsidies from the welcoming local governments. Both had a major negative impact on employment in the city. Perhaps the move of McCormack Spice to Hunt Valley is the most compelling example.

I know policies and political ideologies pushed changes on Baltimore in the name of social justice that ultimately ended up creating more harm than good. Forced school busing was just one of these programs. The irreparable harm it caused is still evident in the city’s broken school system.

In just one article, I cannot adequately address all of the factors that have led to the multitude of problems in Baltimore and other failing cities, but I must deconstruct the lies upon which the narrative of white flight is built.

That Isn’t to Say Race Wasn’t a Factor

Before I do so, I will acknowledge that there were a certain percentage of whites who fled because of race aversion. People fear what they do not know; it is human nature, which can be adjusted with exposure and time. The segregation that existed in Baltimore meant many people on both sides did not know each other and therefore had fear. Fear often turns into anger and hatred; there was plenty of that being stoked in the 1960s, but much more than racism caused white flight.

A Black Panther leader said blacks needed to stop burning down their own neighborhoods and start destroying white neighborhoods.

The violent threats made against white families during and following the 68’ riots caused another percentage of whites to flee. Stokely Carmichael, aka Kwame Touré, a leader in the Black Panther party who promoted the concept of Black Power commented on Baltimore radio during the riots. My husband, who was a young father at the time, heard him say that blacks needed to stop burning down their own neighborhoods and start going up to places like McClean Blvd and cause destruction in white neighborhoods. My husband’s young family actually lived right off of McClean Blvd. Many men of the neighborhood, including my husband, went to Towson to buy guns out of fear and the need to protect their families. Luckily, none of those guns were put to use.

My father heard Carmichael’s threat, too. We did not live far from McClean Blvd, either. In spite of a daytime curfew on the whole city, my father started pulling out the camping equipment so our large family of young children could evacuate the city if needed. I asked him if we were going to get arrested for breaking the curfew. He assured me that we would not, because we would be heading out of the city. Luckily, we never had to put our camping equipment to use, either (I must admit I was a little disappointed at the time about not going camping).

Some Exploited White People, Too

After the riots, unscrupulous businessmen played upon people’s fears using the new housing desegregation laws. It was more financial fear than racial fear. There was a practice called blockbusting that occurred across Baltimore and other large cities. Men looking to make fast cash invested in a type of racial flipping. BlackPast.org describes blockbusting as follows:

After intentionally placing an African American homeowner onto a block [as my parents told me, generally not the doctors and lawyers from the black community], speculators solicited white owners with tales of impending depreciation. Fearful residents often sold their homes to these speculators well below market value. As white residents began to flee in great numbers, other white residents sold their homes at even lower prices, thus further depressing housing prices in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

One of the accusations of white flight being caused by deep racism was really based on deep fear of losing all financial stability. For most working- and middle-class families, their house is their greatest or only lifetime investment. For many of these families, the future value of their house is their main retirement income. The loss of their house’s value made their future look very bleak indeed, so people sold before losing everything, which is what the speculators told them would happen if they did not sell quickly.

Another falsehood is associated with the blockbusting practices of that era. I speak from eyewitness experience supported by stories my parents told me. An urban myth tries to explain what happened when the black families moved into those newly emptied houses. The following description also from BlackPast.org describes the currently accepted “truth”:

[The inflated cost of the suddenly available houses] placed an onerous burden on black homeowners. Already facing steep housing payments, they often found it difficult to get bank loans to make needed repairs on their new homes. Renters in these integrated enclaves faced similar difficulties, notably substandard living conditions imposed by slumlords who viewed these properties as expendable commodities ripe for exploitation. These problems exacerbated declining housing prices and equity loss.

That is exactly what everyone believes is an irrefutable truth, but I witnessed something different. Before the riots, my grandmother’s well-maintained neighborhood was a neighborhood of rose gardens and neighbors talking over the back fence, of bakeries and a walk to the local church on Sundays, of kids playing baseball in the side streets and the local family dog getting scraps from everyone up and down the block.

Did Slumlords or Residents Ruin Neighborhoods?

In less than a year, it no longer looked familiar. There were boarded-up windows and scary guys hanging on corners, trash in the alleys and chained dogs surrounded by piles of excrement in backyards, loud porch parties and screeching children fighting on the front street.

Then the bullets came through my grandparents’ front bedroom window one night, hitting the wall just above their bed.

My parents watched a young teen take a baseball bat to the uprights on the railing of the front porch across the street, a bat he used to systematically smash each upright until the porch looked like a mouth of broken and twisted teeth. This was not slumlord neglect, but purposeful destruction of a recently beautiful neighborhood.

Then the bullets came through my grandparents’ front bedroom window one night, hitting the wall just above their bed. Fear made my grandparents flee, too. The agent who bought the house for far less than it was worth advised my father to take the newel post statuette and the stained glass over the front door and windows, because they would be destroyed shortly after the house was occupied. Destruction of those beautiful art deco architectural elements is exactly what happened not much later.

There was no time for slumlord neglect to take place; that neighborhood was destroyed in a brief period. The point I am NOT trying to make is that these are the natural actions of all black people. Those times in Baltimore were different, and people’s experiences were different. Blacks and whites did not know yet how to react or adjust to the circumstances in which they found themselves. Certainly, there were many people who did not act that way, but that is what happened in that neighborhood. I looked up the last sale price on my grandparents’ house in 2012. It was around $5,000.00. That was probably the price it cost when first built in the 1920s.

The neighborhood of my childhood integrated peacefully and looks the same today as it did almost 50 years ago, but it was not targeted by blockbusting. A few white neighbors made some noise about integration and one took a black family to court for putting up a basketball hoop in the alley where we played and rode our bikes. My mother, who was head of the neighborhood association, defended that family in court. The complainer shut up. Life went on. People lived together in peace.

Forced Busing Wasn’t All It’s Cracked Up to Be

Then forced school busing started. My family fled Baltimore in 1971 after the failed experiment of forced school busing. My brothers and sister were in junior high school, I was in elementary school, and my younger brother who was only four was still at home. Our neighborhood had been a relatively safe place. Children had boundaries of three blocks in any direction from the house, but “Don’t cross The Alameda!” Children got into typical playground scuffles where we romped unsupervised. Kids walked to school and back with little fear.

Tough kids from poor neighborhoods used to the life on the streets bullied and beat up the middle-class kids who had no idea how to respond.

Busing did not affect my elementary school, which was peacefully integrating with black children from the neighborhood. Busing much more heavily affected junior highs and high schools. Students from poor black schools were bused to white, middle-class schools miles away from their neighborhoods, homes, and experiences. White middle-class students were bused to poor black schools also miles away from their neighborhoods, homes, and experiences.

This was supposed to equalize everything, but you cannot force people from either neighborhood to change overnight. The clashes were inevitable. Tough kids from poor neighborhoods used to the life on the streets bullied and beat up the middle-class kids who had no idea how to respond, at least at the junior high level.

I cannot speak from experience about what happened at the locally zoned high schools. Poly, where my father taught, and other citywide schools were a totally different situation, because those schools had already been admitting black, white, or any color of qualified student for over a decade.

Protecting Your Family Isn’t Racism

After months of my brothers and sister getting attacked, the final straw for my parents came one day when my little brother, a sweet, rather sickly little boy, was playing in the alley where we all played. He was riding his Big Wheel up and down behind the house. My mother periodically checked on him from the kitchen window. Then he didn’t pass by for a bit, and she went looking for him.

They kept poking him with sticks and shoving his Big Wheel with their foot, saying, ‘What you gonna do, white boy?’

She found him surrounded by several junior-high-age students who had been bused to the neighborhood school but were playing hooky. They would not let him go home. They kept poking him with sticks and shoving his Big Wheel with their foot, saying, “What you gonna do, white boy?” My mother found him choking in tears and now utterly afraid of a neighborhood that until that day had been utterly safe.

So we fled the city, too.White flight is not simple racism; sometimes it is just a simple choice to protect one’s family. My family had actively fought for civil rights in the schools, on the streets, and in our neighborhoods. They had tried to tear down the walls of segregation, but found instead that the children of Baltimore, black and white, were being smashed against those walls.Whites who hadn’t yet fled out of fear now fled the city to put their children in safe schools. Middle-class blacks who could flee did the same. Those who stayed, and who could afford it, found Catholic schools or private schools. The school system, once one of the best in the country, never recovered. The children left behind still suffer from a substandard education.

Some Baltimore Neighborhoods Survived, Some Did Not

Today, I live in Baltimore City. I am a city girl and, though my parents dragged me kicking and screaming to the country in 1971, I came back as soon as I could. I live only about a mile away from my grandparents’ original home in a similar row home, made by the same builder. I teach in the same system as my father did. My children go to city public schools.

Imagine what this woman had survived in life, only to be driven out of her beloved home by uncivil, unsupervised, angry Baltimore teens, just like those who burned and looted Baltimore this April.

My current neighborhood has somehow held on, mostly peacefully integrated and slowly returning to the type of neighborhood that I remembered my grandmother’s used to be. There are a few less-successful blocks here and there. Still, children do not play unsupervised baseball in the park across the street. Teens walking down the street view the sidewalk as a trash can. Sirens and sometimes gunfire split the night air. The old lady who lived down the street since the 1950s lives there no longer.

Miss Frieda’s house used to be graced with a lovely flower garden on her postage-stamp-size front yard. Overflowing flower pots lined the porch railing. She had been a Polish freedom fighter during World War II. She had survived the concentration camps. She came to America with her husband and settled in that house, where she raised her family, nursed her dying husband in her later years, and now lived alone where she wanted nothing more than to tend her flowers and visit John Paul II in Rome every few years.

My daughters and I met her while she was tending her garden. She took a liking to my girls and even gave them intricate handmade Christmas ornaments she folded out of paper, a craft she learned in Poland in childhood. She was a joyful and generous woman in spite of what she had experienced long ago.

Frieda was driven out of the neighborhood by local angry Baltimore youths who repeatedly stomped on her flowers, smashed her flower pots, broke a window, and finally made her fear for her safety. Imagine what this woman had survived in life, only to be driven out of her beloved home by uncivil, unsupervised, angry Baltimore teens, just like those who burned and looted Baltimore this April and who Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby appeased by saying, “This is your day.” Frieda’s escape was not white flight; it was flight from crime and uncivil behavior.

Let’s Have a Real Dialogue, Not a Monologue

On April 27, 2015, I listened to the sirens rush past my bedroom window all night, heading to another fire at the senior center less than a mile away, a center being built by a black church for local citizens. Baltimore was never the same after the ’68 riots, but I don’t think that will be the case today unless we keep listening to people like author Jake Flanagin or Al Sharpton, Loretta Lynch, Malik Shabazz, and even President Obama, who all keep pointing the finger instead of calling for healing or common ground.

Their supposed calls for dialogue are really a demand for monologue. The rest of us (meaning white people) had better shut up and accept the fact that we are all racist and everything is entirely the fault of white people, all white people. Then we should be made to pay (as Sharpton has so successfully modeled).

So what is true? I can only speak to what I know, but if we start including everyone’s stories and not just the politically correct stories or those that support “the narrative” being pushed by the Left as the only truth that matters, we may get closer to the actual whole truth.

Just putting in writing the things I actually witnessed in Baltimore in those troubled times will be enough to make some people hate me and call me a racist. I am willing to take that chance. Real dialogue, not just monologue, has to start with someone. I know I do not have the whole truth, but I do have a part of it and I may be that part’s only voice right now in Baltimore. Real truth, real dialogue, and real healing of our wounded city will only start when all legitimate voices are considered.

"In Washington, Motorcycle-Mounted Veterans Remember Their Own","Yesterday, nearly a million sunburned Americans converged on Washington DC’s National Mall for the Rolling Thunder Run, a combination memorial event and motorcycle rally held since 1988. Hundreds of thousands were mounted, roaring one at a time along the nation’s front yard; more than half a million watched from sidewalks, ice cream in hand, yelling and cheering from the sidelines. Wives rode pillion, and flags snapped and streamed behind the bikes: the Stars and Stripes; POW/MIA flags; Navy unit crests; Marine Corps colors; Ranger flags; the yellow and black of the Airborne.

Devoted to good Detroit steel and unmuffled V-twin combustion from Harley Davidsons built in the heartland America of small-town Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Missouri, these veterans celebrate every year, in booming engines and determined presence, the American fighting man. Rolling Thunder began when three veterans decided they had had enough of Vietnam veterans’ being ignored and shunned, tainted by their association with a lost war in a lost cause. The country has swung full circle: Washington can now barely contain the bikers and the crowds who come to celebrate them.

The rally began as a way to remember those lost and missing; it has evolved into the only real national celebration of our fallen. Tattoos and beards and black leather out in the sun, those men are all of us. These are our mounted patron saints, America’s own motorcycle gang, the best of who we are.

Why Do Americans Enlist?

War is always appealing to those who have never seen it. People join the military for reasons profound and pedestrian: some are driven to build money toward a college fund; some think the uniforms look cool; some are offered Hobson’s Choice: the Marines or jail. In the teenage years everyone is immortal, and some young people, in the words of Vietnam infantry officer Phil Caputo, having known nothing but security, comfort, and peace, hunger for danger, challenges and violence. Some really believe the Super Bowl ads: Be All You Can Be. Do you have what it takes to be a Marine? Don’t you want to be part of the global force for good? Wouldn’t it be cool to fly a fighter for the Air Force?

By raising your right hand, you become part of an unbroken line of warriors reaching back to George Washington.

Some buy in at the recruiter’s office, with the poster of a SEAL glaring down. Some get religion at boot camp, others aboard ship; some the first time they wear a uniform among old high-school friends; fewer while crouched behind a mud wall in the Third World, under fire and among their newest and closest brothers. By raising your right hand, you become part of an unbroken line of warriors reaching back to George Washington. You become part of something larger than yourself.

If you have served in the American military, you are relieved of at least one burden the teenager carries: you never have to prove anything to anyone again. You stood up and answered when the nation called. As the nation becomes softer, you have proven that you can be hard. As your peers take the easy way out, you went the other way. You stood to the test.

Kipling’s “women and horses and power and war” attract plenty of young men to that cause greater than themselves. Not all will see the elephant. Many will join, serve, and leave quietly. Others will never leave at all. In the end, people sleep peaceably in their beds at night because Orwell’s rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. Those rough men, their duty done, drove motorcycles down the Mall yesterday.

Follow Me Down the Riders’ Road

They started gathering early Sunday morning in the parking lot of the Pentagon, that building which sent them to war and their friends to early graves. Looking up from the rally point, these riders could see the Arlington gardens of white stone, thousands of acres of perfect, serried ranks where their brothers lie. Standing sentinel above those rows of crosses and Stars of David, looking out at Washington, is the house which came through the Washington family to Robert E. Lee, and which the Union took from him, its land appropriated for the graves of the Union fallen in the War Between the States.

They passed within feet of the National Archives, engine noise thrumming in the rooms that hold the Declaration of Independence and the Magna Carta.

Low and right of that house, riders could just see above the trees the American flag flying above the Iwo Jima Memorial, Joe Rosenthal’s photo come to life, commemorating the fallen of the Marine Corps’ wars. Carved into black stone on the base of that monument are the dates and wars in which Marines have fought….but only wars which are complete. Iraq and Afghanistan are absent.

The riders mounted up and roared into action at noon. Swinging out slowly, by the tens of thousands they streamed across Memorial Bridge, over the river George Washington knew as the Potowmack. Up that river came British warships during the War of 1812; down it floated the dead from the amphibious battle of Balls Bluff in 1861, some of whom washed ashore at Mount Vernon. It provides the backdrop to the Kennedy family’s celebration of their brother, the Kennedy Center for the arts, and it separates three states from one another and the Pentagon from their civilian masters. The Potomac flows around the memorial to Medal of Honor winner Teddy Roosevelt—his own island—and past the one to his cousin Franklin. It flows quietly past monuments to the U.S. Navy, to Lady Bird Johnson, to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to Thomas Jefferson.

The Harleys flowed, too. They passed monuments to America’s best moments and her worst: the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, the National Museum of African American History under construction, the White House, the Capitol, the National Museum of the American Indian. Black leather, black bandannas, black helmets, black motorcycles, black POW/MIA flags snapping in their breeze, they motored past the quiet white buildings of the United States: government agencies, art galleries. They passed within feet of the National Archives, engine noise thrumming in the rooms that hold the Declaration of Independence and the Magna Carta. They passed the block-long glass of the Air and Space Museum, the busiest museum in the world, a monument to the strength and can-do know-how of Americans who conquered the skies, won our wars and put men on the moon.

All of this is America. The roads of Rolling Thunder– Independence and Constitution – are bookends to the ideals for which these men joined and fought, and for which their friends died.

Sepulchers Abroad

If war is attractive to those who have never seen it, it is even more attractive to those who know they never will: the old people who send young men to fight and die in foreign lands. For the American military, every event is an away game.

For the American military, every event is an away game.

Our sepulchers to the fallen are therefore in foreign lands—and they are not graveyards. Our cathedrals are the Omaha and Utah beaches, the towering cool trees above the battleground at Chateau Thierry, nameless patches of Vietnam jungle, San Juan Hill, the seawall at Inchon, the ocean below Leyte Gulfm the trenches still visible in the Argonne Forest. It is the lot of our fighting forces to go to where the war is—ones ongoing, ones we started, ones we must end. That war is in another land, every time, a land where we understand neither the people nor the culture, nor the language nor their gods.

The essence of the American military is one question: Who were you with? Not What unit were you attached to? or Which service were you in? That word—who—is the key. The military is people, and a 92-year-old wheelchair-bound veteran of the 82nd Airborne’s jump into Normandy is blood kin to the beefy 82nd Airborne veteran of Vietnam, and to the skinny young man who just joined the Screaming Eagles last week. They are members of the tribe.

The Veterans Return Home

Returning to Virginia, the bikers did what Americans do. They shut down the bikes and men, women, and engines cooled. They gathered. Some went to visit their brothers in Bobby Lee’s backyard, leaving totems atop the cool white stone: rocks and unit patches and jump wings and bottles of Jack, cards and boots and bullet casings. They turned for the cameras and left space for their brother between their knees. They put their arms on one another’s shoulders and looked at the frozen lives, carved now into the nation’s stone. And they wept.

They put their arms on one another’s shoulders and looked at the frozen lives, carved now into the nation’s stone. And they wept.

They laughed and drank, and as night wore on the stories grew more intense and farther away, and those who were not there drifted to the side to watch as these men relived who they once were. They held each other, their bonds forged in Vietnam and Iraq and Lebanon and Afghanistan deeper than those to wives or children.

These are brothers from birth—the birth into adulthood. Joining the military is the last rite of passage to manhood in a country with precious few remaining, the last place to turn in the emasculated present to prove that you have what it takes. On being inducted into the tribe these men are pulled into a band of brothers. They participate in rites centuries old, sing hymns to fallen warriors, speak idiomatic shorthand only each other can understand. They burn ink into their bodies celebrating units and teams; they dress exactly alike, members of the tribe; they raise glasses in candlelight to the valor of men and machines in fights both celebrated and forgotten.

In fights abroad these men turn to one another, to the other Americans sent to put things right, brothers shoulder to shoulder. It is a precious thing, to be part of a tribe. The experience cannot be bought. The causes grow more opaque with each new war; the tribe, therefore, grows more tight and strong. Americans fight for country, which means this: they fight for each other.

Why Planned Parenthood Really Trashes OTC Birth Control,"“While there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization.” — Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood (Planned Parenthood performs about a third of the 1.1 million abortions that occur in the United States every year).

GOP Sens. Cory Gardner and Kelly Ayotte have recently proposed a bill that provides incentives for birth-control pill manufacturers to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter (OTC) status. Oddly enough, Planned Parenthood objects.

Planned Parenthood claims that the proposed bill would gut the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) birth-control mandate. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said, “This bill is a sham and an insult to women… It would give women fewer birth control options and force women to pay twice for their birth control.”

In response, Reason’s Elizabeth Nolan Brown aptly pointed out that the bill was no such thing: (1) just because one type of birth-control pill is available OTC doesn’t mean all forms of the pill will be; (2) just because a drug is OTC doesn’t mean it can’t also be available via a prescription (think of allergy drugs); (3) there’s no reason to think the birth-control mandate doesn’t cover OTC contraception (it already covers Plan B, which is OTC); and (4) the ACA’s birth-control mandate does nothing for poor uninsured women, who have the most to gain from OTC access (women on Medicaid already had full birth-control coverage, and the mandate only applies to private insurance).

In short, despite Planned Parenthood’s rhetoric about looking out for women, its opposition to the Gardner-Ayotte bill appears baseless. Brown muses that the mere possibility of removing the ACA’s mandate makes a highly-politicized Planned Parenthood reject the proposed bill. S.E. Cupp believes Planned Parenthood is rejecting the Gardner-Ayotte proposal because Republicans authored it. National Review’s Jillian Kay Melchior believes Planned Parenthood opposes the measure because it “makes” $1.2 billion per year from contraceptive services (actually, the organization’s total revenue is about $1.2 billion a year).

But there is a much deeper explanation, driven by the rational behavior of an organization seeking to maximize financial gain. To begin to understand why Planned Parenthood opposes OTC birth control, one must look to an obscure New York Times article from the mid-90s, which details post-Soviet Romania’s miserable abortion-culture.

The Romanian Connection

In 1995, Romania had 2.2 abortions for every live birth. Minimal consumer-choice at the state-run system, coupled with low payouts to health professionals when they provided birth control and high rewards when they provided abortions, allowed the state-run system to undersupply birth control and oversupply abortion, causing untold misery for Romanian women.

That same foul cocktail applies to poor, disproportionately minority women in urban areas attempting to access family planning in today’s America. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), a government agency, says that between 2007 and 2010, nearly 36 percent of all abortions in the United States were performed on black fetuses, even though blacks make up only 12.8 percent of the population. Overall, more than half of American abortions between 2007 and 2010 were of minority fetuses.

Poverty alone is not the explanation: there are almost twice as many poor whites as there are poor blacks in America, yet black women who live below the federal poverty line contribute to 14 percent of the nation’s abortions, while poor white women contribute to only 11.7 percent of the nation’s abortions. The real explanation is found in identifying this group’s family-planning provider, and that provider’s incentives.

Inadequate Contraceptive Access

The Left always reminds us of the correlation between unplanned pregnancies and the abortion rate, and points out that greater birth-control access among the poor would stem the tide of abortion. After billions of dollars funding contraceptive access for poor women with high unintended pregnancy rates to show for it, the Left now says that if conservatives really cared about abortion, we would advocate for greater use of Long-Acting-Reversible-Contraceptives (LARCs), such as the intrauterine device (IUD).

According to the Left’s story-telling, poor women deal with unique stresses that make it hard for them to rely on traditional forms of birth control, and this explains why traditional birth-control methods have been relatively ineffective for poor women, as compared to their better-off peers. If these devices carry a prohibitive cost and destroy human embryos, too bad for taxpayers, and too bad for religious conservatives.

Yet the Left (as usual) has a problem. This line of analysis doesn’t begin to explain why the rate of unplanned pregnancies among America’s poor rose dramatically in the mid-90s (see chart). Did the stress associated with poverty dramatically increase?

As well-off women saw rates of unintended pregnancies continue to decline, women of lesser means saw their unintended pregnancy rate skyrocket. According to the American Prospect, the average abortion patient used to be “[a] middle-class, white high-school or college student with no children whose bright future could be derailed by motherhood,” while today she is more likely “a twenty something single mother of color.” An unexplained “[l]oss of [birth control] access for poorer [minority] women” occurred in the 1990s.

What if the primary provider of that birth control access is to blame?

According to The Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood’s research arm, “minority women, women who are poor, and women with little education are more likely than women overall to report dissatisfaction with either their contraceptive method or provider.” Oddly enough, Planned Parenthood is the primary provider of family planning for poor, disproportionately minority, urban women.

In other words, the Left is right about birth-control access being substandard among certain populations, but wrong about everything else. What if the primary provider of that birth control access is to blame?

Remember the high rate of black abortions in America? If poor black women disproportionately rely on a certain provider because they are disproportionately located in urban areas (due to federal housing policies of the ’50s and ’60s that concentrated poor blacks in urban areas), it would make sense that this provider’s actions would disproportionately affect poor blacks.

So Planned Parenthood’s veiled opposition to OTC birth-control pills would be rational, if it depended upon reduced consumer choice among its target market. The following details the similarities between mid-90s Romania and Planned Parenthood’s services to poor women in modern-day urban U.S.A.

How Planned Parenthood Reduces Consumer Choice

Romanian women in the mid-90s faced little consumer choice, and Planned Parenthood’s target market experiences reduced consumer choice.

1. Planned Parenthood Dominates Urban Areas

After Roe v. Wade, abortion became one of the most unregulated areas of American commerce. Low barriers to entry and high profit margins led providers to flood the market. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, decided in 1992, allowed states to regulate the abortion industry more closely, to ensure that women made more informed decisions before having abortions, and also to better protect women’s health.

After Casey, Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share increased dramatically, to commanding a third of the U.S. market today.

When states began regulating abortion within the limits Casey had defined, the fixed costs associated with providing abortions began rising in the early ’90s. This pushed many non-specialized providers out of the market, and gave Planned Parenthood a dominant position in abortion market-share.

Before Casey, Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share was flat year-on-year, holding less than a tenth of the market. After Casey, Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share increased dramatically, to commanding a third of the U.S. market today (or 40 percent of all reported abortions). Planned Parenthood’s revenues reflected this growth: though flat in the early ’90s, it saw a consistent yearly uptick after the Casey decision.

Amy Hagstrom-Miller, operator of an independent chain of abortion clinics in Texas and Maryland, was quoted saying, “This is not the Planned Parenthood we all grew up with… they now have more of a business approach, much more aggressive… [t]hey’re not unlike other big national chains… They put local independent businesses in a tough situation.”

According to The Wall Street Journal, “Ms. Hagstrom-Miller competes with Planned Parenthood for abortion patients – and finds it deeply frustrating… She does not receive the government grants or tax-deductible contributions that bolster Planned Parenthood, and says she can’t match the nonprofit’s budget for advertising or clinic upgrades … She has carved her own niche by touting her care as more holistic — and by charging $425 for a first-trimester surgery at her Austin clinic, compared with $475 at the local Planned Parenthood.”

As the number of abortion providers dropped, more providers located in densely populated urban areas, where fixed costs could be offset by higher volumes.

Consolidation in the U.S. abortion industry also had geographic consequences. As the number of abortion providers dropped, more providers located in densely populated urban areas, where fixed costs could be offset by higher volumes.

Title X also assists Planned Parenthood’s focus on urban areas (no matter whether a Planned Parenthood clinic provides actual abortion-services or just abortion referral). Passed by Congress and signed by President Nixon in 1970, Title X offers grants for organizations that provide birth control to low-income women. Title X creates a further incentive for urban location, as grant amounts are predicated on the provider’s proximity to poor populations (the closer a Title X grantee is to the greatest number of poor people, the larger the grant amount). Almost a third of Title X expenditure goes to Planned Parenthood, its biggest recipient, to the tune of $70 million as of 2010.

2. Planned Parenthood Targets Poor Women Who Depend on Publicly Funded Care

Poor and minority women in urban areas—the women experiencing high rates of unintended pregnancies—are Planned Parenthood’s customer base. Seventy-nine percent of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. The “vast majority” of the organization’s female patients lack private health insurance, meaning they rely on Medicaid (federal and state-sponsored health insurance for the poor) or are uninsured. Planned Parenthood brags that “only 3% of Planned Parenthood patients can afford the full cost of their care and, for many, Planned Parenthood functions as their primary care provider.”

In many urban areas, Planned Parenthood is one of the few providers that accepts Medicaid.

For a poor woman who is uninsured, her primary hope of family planning services is a Title X-funded clinic. This clinic is likely to be a Planned Parenthood affiliate, as Planned Parenthood receives the largest portion of Title X funding. This means uninsured women have little choice about where they receive family planning services.

A Guttmacher study found that 6 in 10 women who visited a “specialty contraceptive clinic” (a Title X grantee) considered the clinic their “usual source of medical care.” Four in 10 women surveyed considered the clinic their “only source of health care.” The study (which included 22 clinics) only targeted communities known to have multiple Title X grantees, or “safety-net providers.” This means the proportion of women for whom Planned Parenthood clinics are their only avenue to healthcare is probably much higher nationally.

If a poor woman of childbearing age doesn’t have private insurance but is insured, she receives Medicaid. In many urban areas, Planned Parenthood is one of the few providers that accepts Medicaid. The absence of competition here is due to two factors.

First, Medicaid’s under-compensation of doctors and hospitals leads most medical providers to reject Medicaid altogether. In urban areas, where there is likely to be a higher-than-average concentration of Medicaid recipients, a provider’s incentive to not accept Medicaid is magnified. (By the way, this inherent flaw in Medicaid explains recent stories of emergency-room visits rising after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion).

Planned Parenthood can uniquely afford to accept Medicaid because it also receives Title X, a funding source other potential providers either don’t receive or don’t receive to the same degree.

Second, Planned Parenthood can uniquely afford to accept Medicaid because it also receives Title X, a funding source other potential non-specialized health providers (hospitals, etc.) either don’t receive or don’t receive to the same degree.

Some conservatives have long accused Title X of freeing up more money for abortions. More accurately, Title X serves as an extra incentive for Planned Parenthood to accept Medicaid. Title X tops-up Medicaid’s subpar payouts by not only covering fixed costs but also allowing Title X grantees to receive special Medicaid pricing. Planned Parenthood lobby groups specifically point out that Title X is necessary because Medicaid doesn’t provide adequate compensation for their services.

So both Title X and Medicaid are necessary for Planned Parenthood to remain viable. Planned Parenthood, a billion-dollar organization, receives almost half of its yearly funding from government: $540 million in fiscal year 2013, of which $70 million (as of 2011) comes from Title X and $387 million (as of 2011) comes from Medicaid.

Abortions Generate Higher Profits Than Birth Control Does

As a rational economic actor that seeks to maximize financial gains, financial incentives drive Planned Parenthood’s actions. Some will stop here and point out that Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit organization. First, this is a legal classification only (the National Football League was a nonprofit until last year). Just because an organization is a nonprofit doesn’t mean it will not behave rationally, attempting to reduce costs and increase revenue. Instead of rewarding financial gains to a shareholder, a nonprofit plugs its financial gains into higher salaries and bigger benefits for its employees (Richards makes half a million dollars every year as Planned Parenthood’s president).

Instead rewarding financial gains to a shareholder, a nonprofit plugs its financial gains into higher salaries and bigger benefits for its employees.

Second, though the national organization is flush with cash, many local Planned Parenthood “affiliates” (Planned Parenthood operates a franchise model) are highly cost-sensitive, to the point where several have fraudulently overbilled Medicaid. Because of the franchise model, clinics must be independently financially-viable.

In mid-90s Romania, health workers who provided family planning made little offloading contraception, but were heavily compensated when providing abortion. Planned Parenthood clinics’ near-monopolistic power over poor urban women provides an overwhelming incentive to undersupply birth control. In doing so, its affiliates push their high-margin product—abortion.

1. An Incentive to Undersupply Birth Control

Planned Parenthood has an incentive to undersupply birth control to its captive market of poor urban women who depend on publicly funded care. For uninsured women, the organization’s clinics face a marginal (per service rendered) loss when supplying birth control under Title X’s grant-based system.

Although Planned Parenthood may make money when supplying birth control under Medicaid, margins are often razor thin.

Title X’s grant-based funding means that, after a certain point—conceivably when Planned Parenthood feels it has given out enough birth control to satisfy the government and ensure future grant awards—the marginal cost of distributing birth control hugely outweighs the marginal benefit.

Although Planned Parenthood may make money when supplying birth control under Medicaid, margins are often razor thin (the exact compensation rate depends on the state, but note here that Planned Parenthood’s real interest in the ACA is Medicaid expansion). This explains contraception mailer programs that attempt to eliminate the administrative costs of a clinic visit—costs that prevent a customer from returning for another supply. If the mailer program does accept Medicaid, it is better than undersupplying the market, but many Planned Parenthood affiliates’ mailers do not accept Medicaid—again, because Medicaid may barely cover costs, and because some states disallow such a program because it is open to waste, fraud, and abuse.

Further, for all Planned Parenthood’s hype about preventative birth control, the organization does a subpar job at putting preventative birth control in the hands of its customers. In 2012, 40 percent of the “contraceptive services” provided by Planned Parenthood consisted of emergency contraception (such as Plan B, which most likely carries higher margins than ordinary birth control).

Even left-leaning blogs lament stories of young women being pressured to make costly “donations” for basic contraceptive services. They also note that financial incentives could lead Planned Parenthood to offload forms of birth control that are less effective or safe compared to other alternatives.

So Planned Parenthood loses money distributing birth control to uninsured women, and gains little by distributing birth control through Medicaid. Planned Parenthood’s failure to meet demand for birth control reduces costs, and also stimulates demand for abortion. When Planned Parenthood doesn’t adequately meet customer demand for birth control, its customers, with nowhere else to turn, come back for the high-margin product.

2. Abortion Is Planned Parenthood’s Premium Product

Planned Parenthood makes a good deal of money, on the margin (per service rendered), when providing abortion services. Abortion is usually paid for out-of-pocket, to the tune of around $500, and carries high margins for providers. According to Guttmacher, around 65 percent of women who receive abortions lack private insurance (they are either uninsured, 33 percent, or received Medicaid, 31 percent).

The vast majority of abortions Planned Parenthood sells are paid out-of-pocket.

How do poor women afford to pay for abortion themselves? When an unplanned pregnancy is only a remote possibility, women are cost-sensitive towards expensive, but effective, contraception (especially when they can receive less-effective contraception at little to no cost). But when women face an unplanned pregnancy, they are less cost-sensitive. Also, while the male involved typically does not contribute to the birth-control bill, he will contribute to an abortion, as he is on the hook for support payments if the unplanned pregnancy is brought to term. The vast majority of abortions Planned Parenthood sells are paid out-of-pocket.

While Planned Parenthood claims that only 3 percent of its services are abortions, the organization calculates this number by counting every little thing it does as a separate “service” (a pack of pills, a sexually transmitted disease test, and an exam are three separate services). In fact, 1 in 10 Planned Parenthood customers receive abortion services. Again, the organization is the clear market-leader in abortions, commanding about 30-40 percent of the U.S. abortion market.

Yet, even more important than the volume of abortions compared to other services, Planned Parenthood makes the most money, on the margin, when it provides abortions. In criticizing Planned Parenthood’s claim that only 3 percent of its services consist of abortion, Slate calls abortion Planned Parenthood’s “premium product,” likening it to a store that sells luxury watches, and refers to Planned Parenthood’s “3% number” as “the most meaningless abortion statistic ever.”

Slate calls abortion Planned Parenthood’s ‘premium product,’ likening it to a store that sells luxury watches.

Media Matters and PolitiFact have pointed out that abortion services, which bring in about $165 million per year, only make up “less than 15 percent of Planned Parenthood’s annual revenue.” But this analysis is overly simplistic. Looking at the national organization as of several years ago, around $320 million in revenues comes from clinics, of which $165 million is due to abortion services. Private donations provide $223 million, and $487 million comes from Title X and Medicaid. The portion of this revenue generating the greatest boost to the bottom line, aside from donations, is abortion-services.

And the national organization’s revenue from abortion matters little. As mentioned above, Planned Parenthood follows a franchise business model—like Burger King and McDonalds—so clinics must be self-sustaining apart from the national organization. This is important, because this means incentives and financial concerns at the clinic level have the greatest sway on organizational behavior.

Around 50 percent of the organization’s clinic revenue is generated from abortion (a more conservative estimate puts this figure at 37 percent, which is high nonetheless). If you factor in Title X grants and Medicaid billings, the figure is brought down to 20 percent, yet Title X and Medicaid are sources of revenue that don’t provide much income after costs. Again, keep in mind that, compared to other clinic-level revenue-sources, abortion contributes the most to the bottom line after costs are factored in.

Abby Johnson, a former director of Planned Parenthood’s clinic in Bryan, Texas, and Planned Parenthood “Employee of the Year” in 2008, claims that Planned Parenthood clinics projected the same number of female customers year to year, but consistently called for an increase in abortion sales. Johnson recounts that, one year, the organization doubled its abortions target over the previous period (while the market size and customer base was largely expected to stay the same).

Because franchisees must be completely self-sustaining, local clinics face immense pressure to cut costs.

And Planned Parenthood is highly cost-sensitive regarding abortions. Because franchisees must be completely self-sustaining, local clinics face immense pressure to cut costs. When Johnson was an employee, a visiting abortion doctor used an ultrasound device to identify ectopic pregnancies and prevent perforating the uterus. This was a first for Johnson because Planned Parenthood does not use an ultrasound device unless state law requires it.

When Johnson asked her superiors why Planned Parenthood didn’t use ultrasound, her superiors contended this was too costly, and would add an extra five minutes to each procedure. Her clinic needed to do between 25 and 50 abortions per day to remain profitable. Johnson also recounts how, ideally, an experienced physician could perform 75 abortions per day, and how the clinic wanted to have a woman on and off the table in no more than five minutes.

Planned Parenthood’s Conflicting Interests

At the end of the day, Planned Parenthood has a business model, very much akin to HP or Apple, and abortion is essential to it. Just as HP sells its printers at cost so it can make huge profits on printer ink, Planned Parenthood provides most of its services at cost, but profits when customers need abortions.

Just as HP sells its printers at cost so it can make huge profits on printer ink, Planned Parenthood provides most of its services at cost, but profits when customers need abortions.

Just as Apple uses its stores not as profit centers, but as extenders of the Apple brand that give potential customers hands-on knowledge about Apple products, most Planned Parenthood clinics only provide abortion referral and function at cost, but refer abortions to the profit-generating clinic that provides them.

Yet an organization that carries both contraception and abortion faces an inherent conflict of interest, as abortion and birth control are, to some extent at least, competing services. A monopoly magnifies this ability to push one service over another, as the case of Romania shows.

Just as a single gas station in a remote area can get away with selling only premium gasoline, while gas stations with competitors must offer more choice, so is it with Planned Parenthood. Because poor urban women have nowhere else to receive birth control, they are forced to frequent an organization that has a vested interest in seeing them eventually pay more to have abortions.

Planned Parenthood can’t have it both ways. The organization consistently decries the lack of family planning access for rural women while its customer base experiences the highest rate of unplanned pregnancies in America—a far worse rate than that among rural women who supposedly don’t have any family planning access at all.

The Solution: More Consumer Choice

Advocates for abortion have long contended that we need more birth-control access and education if we want to stem the tide of abortion. What if they are right, but their chosen agent of birth-control distribution is doing a terrible job?

Planned Parenthood then steers this captive market towards its abortion services by not providing adequate birth-control choice and access, because abortion is Planned Parenthood’s premium product.

In Romania in the mid-90s, a government-run health monopoly meant consumers had little choice. And Romanian doctors were poorly compensated when providing birth control, but heavily compensated for performing abortions. The result was a higher rate of abortions than live births, and misery for Romanian women. In America, many poor urban women have little choice aside from Planned Parenthood, and abortions make the most money for Planned Parenthood franchisees, after costs.

This also helps to explain the high black abortion rate in America. Poor black women disproportionately reside in urban areas, and in urban areas a poor woman’s primary avenue to healthcare is Planned Parenthood, which disproportionately services poor black women. Planned Parenthood then steers this captive market towards its abortion services by not providing adequate birth-control choice and access, because abortion is Planned Parenthood’s premium product. Planned Parenthood’s quest for financial gain drives the high black abortion rate.

What is to be done? Poor, urban women need more choice. Bill Clinton said abortion should be “safe, legal and rare,” and that women should always have the “choice” of abortion. For many poor American women, abortion is not safe, it is not rare, and there is little choice.

Next Steps for Policymakers

The solution must be to break Planned Parenthood’s monopoly over the lives of poor urban women, providing poor urban women with greater choice.

First, Congress should reform Medicaid, so poor urban women have more medical choices. Doctors should be compensated fairly so more providers accept Medicaid payment, and recipients should have more health-care choice and ownership. Even better than just reforming Medicaid, which doesn’t cover all of America’s poor, Congress should pass the American Enterprise Institute’s comprehensive health-reform plan (“The Best of Both Worlds”). This plan would cover all Americans faster than Obamacare, while sticking to market-based principles.

Planned Parenthood should be hauled in front of Congress and questioned about its birth-control programs and incentives.

Second, Title X should be completely shifted away from a grant system to a fee-for-service program. As part of this, grantees should be rewarded for good results. For example, Title X funds used for family planning should be predicated on a female patient receiving consistent (not one-time) birth-control services and not experiencing an unplanned pregnancy by a specified later date.

Further, because of the inherent conflict of interest involved in birth-control distribution and providing abortion-services, policymakers should consider a Glass-Steagall regime for family planning: in other words, the same reproductive care provider can’t offer both abortion and birth control. This would stop Title X dollars from going to abortion providers, or at the very least would vet Title X recipients who also sell abortion-related products and services (through increased record-keeping and disclosure requirements).

Third, Planned Parenthood should be hauled in front of Congress and questioned about its birth-control programs and incentives. If subsequent congressional investigation finds Planned Parenthood is placing profit over its patients health needs, it should no longer receive assistance from taxpayers. ‘

Finally, Congress should pass the Gardner-Ayotte bill, and do everything possible to increase the prospect of OTC birth control. This could reduce unintended pregnancies dramatically, especially among uninsured women, and would allow poor women choices outside of Planned Parenthood. Ironically, the greatest enemy to Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest “pro-choice” advocate, might be more consumer choice for its customer base.

States have a role to play, as well. California is still in the process of implementing a law allowing pharmacists to prescribe the birth-control pill. A Republican legislator has just introduced a similar measure in Oregon. More states should follow suit. This so-called “behind the counter access” would increase consumer choice, damaging Planned Parenthood.

This is not a partisan issue or a pro-life issue. If Planned Parenthood’s behavior is harming women, something should be done about it. As Thomas Jefferson said about American slavery: “Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that His justice cannot sleep forever.”

"If Rachel Dolezal Isn’t Black, How Is Caitlyn Jenner A Woman?","Spokane NAACP president Rachel Dolezal, a professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University, was outed earlier this week by her parents as being white.

In what has to be one of the more bizarre news stories of 2015, Dolezal pretended for years to be black. Social media accounts posted pictures of a black man who she said was her father (he’s not). She regularly wrote about her black son Izaiah (he’s actually her adopted brother).

It also appears as though she repeatedly lied about being the victim of race-based hate crimes. She claims to have been the victim of at least nine separate hate crimes.

As you might expect, this story has gotten a lot of attention, namely because Dolezal isn’t black. She’s white. Very white. According to her parents, her heritage is primarily German and Czech. Naturally, people are a bit shocked that a white person would so brazenly pretend to be black for so many years.

There seems to be little argument, on both the Right and Left, that Dolezal appears to have some serious psychological issues to sort out. Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post tweeted that he agreed that she is “mentally disturbed“:

After reading this, I have to agree —> http://t.co/OdkRRJcKEn https://t.co/xdB5gCSD8m



Jonathan Capehart (@CapehartJ) June 12, 2015

He’s not alone. Just search for “dolezal crazy” or “dolezal nuts” on Twitter for a sampling of the near-universal opinion that she’s nuts. Try as I may, I can’t find any person of any notoriety defending Dolezal’s bravery or courage.

Which of course brings us to Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner.

How, exactly is what Dolezal did any different than what Jenner is currently doing? Rachel Dolezal is not black, and Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman (putting aside the basic biological facts of how sex-selection and chromosomes work, Jenner’s not even undergone the so-called sex change surgery; by all accounts, his equipment is still intact). Rachel Dolezal changing her wardrobe, her makeup, and her hair do not make her black. Pretty much everyone seems to agree on that, for obvious reasons. You don’t turn red into blue by magically declaring that red is now blue.

And yet, the Left and the media would have us believe that Bruce Jenner can become a woman by…changing his name, his wardrobe, his makeup, and his hair. How can you logically square the belief that Jenner is a hero while Dolezal is a mental case? Well, you can’t.

Take Jonathan Capehart, for example, who’s outraged by Dolezal’s con job:

White person running chap of NAACP? No problem. White person pretending to be black and running chap of NAACP. BIG problem.



Jonathan Capehart (@CapehartJ) June 12, 2015

I agree with him. The whole thing is bonkers, and there’s something just not right about Dolezal’s long-running race hoax. So I asked Capehart if he’d be bothered if Jenner took over the Girl Scouts:

.@CapehartJ Would it be a big problem if Caitlyn Jenner ended up running the Girl Scouts?



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 12, 2015

FTLOG, Caitlyn Jenner is not ""pretending"" to be a woman. Move along… https://t.co/BbWGFCSFRL



Jonathan Capehart (@CapehartJ) June 12, 2015

Wait, wait? How can anyone with even the most tenuous grip on reality possibly argue that Jenner, who’s undergone zero surgery (not that that can change one’s chromosomes, which are entirely responsible for determining one’s sex), is not pretending to be a woman? How can you not see the glaring similarities between Jenner’s shtick and Dolezal’s? Nearly overnight, it would appear that the long-standing ideas of race as a social construct and gender as a biological construct have been flipped on their heads.

In a 2013 essay for The Atlantic, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates explained the social, not biological, foundation of race in the modern age:

Our notion of what constitutes “white” and what constitutes “black” is a product of social context. It is utterly impossible to look at the delineation of a “Southern race” and not see the Civil War, the creation of an “Irish race” and not think of Cromwell’s ethnic cleansing, the creation of a “Jewish race” and not see anti-Semitism. There is no fixed sense of “whiteness” or “blackness,” not even today.

He makes a great point. We know precisely the definition of male (an X and a Y chromosome) and female (two X chromosomes)–or at least we did before society lost its collective mind–but is it possible to give a precise, quantifiable definition of black or white? Coates argues that you can’t, because so much of it depends on the social and historical context of a given culture:

Race is no more dependent on skin color today than it was on “Frankishness” in Emerson’s day. Over history of race has taken geography, language, and vague impressions as its basis.

Which brings us right back to Rachel Dolezal. She’s no hero. She’s a fraud, and likely one in need of serious mental help. She deliberately lived out a charade. At least in this instance, society seems to recognize that you cannot change who you are merely by playing dress-up and declaring that white is now black.

There will be no reality shows for Rachel Dolezal. No prime-time interviews. No photo-shopped magazine covers. Nobody will declare that Dolezal is brave, courageous, or worthy of being placed on a pedestal as a heroine. She will not be lauded by ESPN during its annual gala. There will be no Arthur Ashe Courage Awards given to Rachel Dolezal.

This is America in 2015, and the Dolezal and Jenner cases teach a valuable lesson about media relations: if you want to be celebrated for identity fraud, stick with gender and leave the race card at home.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/12/if-rachel-dolezal-isnt-black-how-is-caitlyn-jenner-a-woman/,2015-06-12
"No, The Difference Between Dolezal And Jenner Is Not ‘Fraud’","Last week, it was revealed that Spokane NAACP president Rachel Dolezal, who had represented herself as black for the better part of a decade, was not actually black. Dolezal’s biological parents, both white, announced that Dolezal, too, was also quite white. And shortly after that, the Internet exploded.

In a post that has garnered quite a bit of attention, I asked how what Dolezal did was really all that different than what Bruce Jenner did: namely, playing dress-up in order to hide one’s true identity. In Dolezal’s case, she changed her hair, her make-up, and her wardrobe in order to give the impression that she was black. In Jenner’s case, he changed his hair, his make-up, and his wardrobe in order to give the impression that he is a female.

Dolezal was born white but wanted people to believe she was black. Jenner was born a man but wants people to believe he is a woman. The only difference between these two is the extent to which society is willing to accept their delusions.

A number of people took great exception to my article comparing the two individuals. I’m going to single out what Nick Gillespie at Reason wrote, because I think it’s fairly representative of the “the difference between the two is fraud” genre of explanation:

[Dolezal] has been misrepresenting herself as black when in fact she was born white. Her life is built upon a lie that she knows is a lie. That also explains reactions like those of Marc Lamont Hill above. Even if she is good at her job (which she appears to be, at least according to the NAACP), Hill argues she owes it to her constituents to be clear that she wasn’t born black. Perhaps more succinctly: Dolezal’s crime isn’t that she wants to identify as black, it’s that she’s denying the plain reality of her past (and doing so because to come clean would cause major problems for her).

Gillespie’s entire explanation rests on a rather obvious tautology: Caitlyn Jenner identifies as a woman, therefore there’s nothing at all fraudulent or deceptive or delusional about Jenner claiming that he’s a woman. Or, more simply: it’s okay for Jenner to adopt an identity wholly at odds with reality, history, and biology, but it’s not okay for Dolezal to adopt an identity wholly at odds with reality, history, and biology.

In order to accept Gillespie’s tortured logic, you have to believe that the statement “I am a woman,” from a person who is most certainly not a woman is not deceitful. Keep in mind that not only was Bruce Jenner born a man, he still has all the anatomical accoutrements associated with being a man since he has not undergone so-called sex change surgery. He is a man. To declare otherwise is nonsensical.

When Jenner declares, “I am a woman,” what he is actually saying is “I have feelings and emotions that society tends to associate with women.” However, he cannot actually feel like a woman because he is not, in fact, a woman. He has no concept of what it feels like to be a woman. As D.C. McAllister detailed for The Federalist, Jenner has experienced none of the things that actual women feel as a result of being female:

The celebration of Jenner “becoming a woman” is a fantasy. It’s artificial. It’s make-believe. It’s not authentic at all. It’s a mirage. Jenner has always fantasized that he’s a woman, dreaming of the possibilities of becoming what he imagines himself to be. But possibilities in life are only fantasies when they aren’t rooted in something real. You can’t become a woman without being a girl, complete with XX chromosomes that determine our sex. The man posing as a woman on the cover of Vanity Fair is a delusional mockery of every woman who knows what it’s like to be a girl with all the pains, humiliations, and joys of actually growing up and becoming a woman—and each one of us, in different ways, has faced it bravely through every stage.

Gillespie then builds on his tautology by saying that the big difference between Jenner and Dolezal is that Jenner doesn’t deny he was born a man, whereas Dolezal went out of her way to give the impression that she was born black, going so far as to claim that a black man was her father. This explanation poses a rather serious problem for transgender people, because under Gillespie’s standard, any transgender individual who does not immediately identify as such prior to each and every human interaction is committing fraud.

Why is that the case? Because, according to Gillespie, giving the impression that you are X when you are actually Y is the definition of fraud and deception. And the only way to avoid giving the wrong impression if you are a man masquerading as a woman is to disclose your birth sex–I was born a man but now I identify as a woman–prior to any and all interaction with all other people for the remainder of your days on earth. Unlike Jenner, not all transgender people are given a national platform to announce their transition. Are those who don’t immediately out themselves as transgender “frauds” a la Dolezal? Gillespie’s rationalization would certainly seem to suggest that’s the case.

Let’s also apply the same announcement standard to Dolezal: had she announced her “transition” a decade ago, would she be no less delusional? Would that announcement suddenly make her a black person? I presume most people would say no, that would not make her a black person. Those people would be correct, because Rachel Dolezal is not black, no matter how much she protests to the contrary.

Gillespie’s rationale, however, requires the opposition conclusion. His rationale requires us to accept her declaration just so long as she admits she was born white.

“Dolezal’s crime isn’t that she wants to identify as black,” he wrote, “it’s that she’s denying the plain reality of her past.”

Using that logic, as well as the logic that Bruce Jenner’s declaration that he’s a woman makes him a woman, Rachel Dolezal must therefore become a black person upon the declaration that she identifies as a black person. Gillespie’s tortured explanation about how the two individuals are different doesn’t represent basic reason so much as it does obvious circular reasoning.

The real difference between Jenner and Dolezal is not fraud or deception, because they are both living out a lie. They are both delusional. The real difference is the extent to which society is willing to go along with their charades. The Danish author Hans Christian Anderson prophetically captured this dynamic 178 years ago:

As the emperor proceeded down the street, everyone exclaimed, “Goodness, the emperor’s new clothes are incredibly beautiful! The finest he’s ever worn! What a perfect fit!” No one wanted to admit that the emperor was naked, for that would make the person seem stupid or unfit for his or her job.



At last a small child said, “But he doesn’t have anything on!”



“Goodness!” said the child’s father. Then he turned to his neighbor. “Just listen to what this innocent child said,” he whispered, repeating the child’s comment.



One person whispered to another, and then another and another. Soon everyone was shouting, “But he doesn’t have anything on!”

The difference between Jenner and Dolezal is not fraud. The difference between the two is that Jenner has an influential army to help carry the hem of the cloak that isn’t there.

Dylann Roof Doesn’t Represent Millennials,"Since news broke last Wednesday evening that depraved 21 year-old Dylann Roof murdered nine innocent worshippers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, we’ve heard a myriad of responses from the American media. The prevailing sentiment is, of course, disappointment at yet another senseless tragedy, although many lawmakers and media pundits wasted no time in exploiting the tragedy to push an agenda for gun control. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as the protocol for Democrats has become, in the words of Rahm Emmanuel, to never let “a serious crisis go to waste.”

Roof, who admitted that he wished to start a “race war,” explicitly targeted African-Americans at an historically black church with significant ties to the civil rights movement. Throughout the past few days, traces of Roof’s deep-seeded, violently racist ideology have been found in his personal writings and photos. Indeed, the striking racial dynamics of this massacre have not only distinguished it from most other mass shootings of recent memory, but have also provoked some more outrageous responses from leftist thinkers who want you to believe America didn’t need Roof to start a race war.

Dylann Roof: Your Average White Millennial?

In a Washington Post article titled “Charleston, Dylann Roof, and the racism of millennials,” Editor Karen Attiah makes a bold claim:

Roof, who was born in 1994, violently shatters one particularly entrenched myth that society holds about racism — that today’s millennials are more tolerant than their parents, and that racism will magically die out as previous generations pass on.

Attiah’s justification for extrapolating Roof to represent an entire generation? She cites one single study by the General Social Survey, which includes five measures of racial prejudice and compares millennials’ answers to those of the respondents from the last three generations. The study, analyzed by the Post here, has been referenced by many liberal blogs to prove that the millennial generation is “just as racist” as previous generations.

Of course, implicit in the “just as racist” charge is the belief that their parents are, as a whole, racist. But the study itself provides little support for characterizing either generation as racially intolerant.

If a real generational problem of racial intolerance existed, those numbers should be much, much higher.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the study results: In various ways, the study essentially asks whether white millennials think black people are lazier, less intelligent, and less motivated than whites, whether or not they approve of interracial marriage, and whether they would live in a neighborhood that’s 50 percent African-American.

For both Generation X and Millennials, only about 10 percent of respondents would oppose interracial marriage or living in a half-black neighborhood. About 2 in 10 think blacks are naturally less intelligent, while 3 in 10 say they’re lazier. The study found the most prejudice (about 40 percent) in the belief that black people are less well off because of a lack of motivation.

It’s important to realize that studies and surveys are not foolproof evidence for anything. And while these results indicate that some small minorities of the white millennial population subscribe to bigoted stereotypes about black people, they hardly validate Attiah’s sweeping charge of racism. This isn’t to say we young folks are perfect; every generation and every race will always have members who hold these views. But if a real generational problem of racial intolerance existed, those numbers should be much, much higher.

And for every study that purports to show the racism of millennials, there’s one to suggest that millennials are indeed more Progressive than generations past. This frequently cited 2010 Pew Research study details many of these differences. Even this research study done by MTV, which has evolved into a massive purveyor of the liberal agenda, reveals that millennials hold overwhelmingly positive and tolerant attitudes toward racial equality and diversity.

Tolerance Isn’t Limited To Race

Many leftist thinkers like Attiah seize on studies like these to refute the frequent claims that millennials are the most tolerant and diverse generation in recent American history. It’s all a myth, they say, an ignorant fantasy. Millennials—especially white millennials—aren’t really better than those crotchety old folks of yesterday.

Millennials do show an unparalleled commitment to tolerance on a whole slew of issues.

The truth is, however, that millennials do show an unparalleled commitment to tolerance on a whole slew of issues, from religion and abortion to illegal immigration. The fact that similarities might exist between millennials and Generation X on the one issue of racial stereotypes doesn’t disprove the “myth” of the progressive millennial.

Gay rights sticks out as the most striking example. Within the last ten years—the decade in which millennials have come of age—gay marriage has gone from a laughable fantasy to being legal in 37 states. Indeed, it’s hard to believe that without the revolutionary views of millennials, gay marriage could be on the very brink of nationwide legalization as it is today. And the statistics are there to back that up: by and large, millennials are the most supportive of the LGBT agenda, from gay marriage to non-traditional “gender identity,” and even to promiscuous sexual behavior. What’s more is that it’s white people who outstrip minorities in their sympathy for these issues.

If Millennials Have a Race Problem, Whose Fault Is It?

But let’s say that the liberals are right, that these numbers indicate a race problem for millennials, and that Roof is a product of the intolerance of his generation. Who’s to blame, and what should we do about it?

Millennials have actually grown up positively surrounded by liberal ideas.

Shockingly, the consensus among liberals in the wake of the shooting has been that Republican policies and ideas are largely responsible for the racism present in American society. Of course! How could it not be those racist, sexist, all-kinds-of-phobic right-wingers indoctrinating white millennials over at Fox News? Mystery solved!

Not so fast. With just a few seconds of deeper thought, one can see the absurdity of this allegation. A clear majority of millennials are politically liberal, and have probably never seen Fox News beyond whatever Jon Stewart mocks on “The Daily Show.” On the contrary, millennials have actually grown up positively surrounded by liberal ideas.

The overwhelming liberal bias in mainstream cable networks and newspapers, for instance, has been well documented over the years, evidenced by records of campaign donations from network employees as well as virtually all empirical studies done to date. Millennials are also gathering more and more of their daily news from social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, platforms which are similarly dominated by progressives. And even greater still is the bias present in American academia. Studies have concluded that anywhere from 50 percent to 70 percent of college professors are unabashedly liberal, whereas the most generous estimates of conservative professors hover around 15 percent. A quick Google search will also yield countless of instances of liberal preferences beginning even earlier, in high schools and grade schools across the country.

Given all of the exposure millennials have toward liberal thought, how can it be that conservatives at Fox News managed to hoodwink an entire generation into being racially intolerant? No, if liberals feel that millennials aren’t progressive enough, yet the Left has the most access to millennials, then the logical conclusion is that a reflection on their own teachings and activism is in order.

If liberals feel millennials aren’t progressive enough, yet the Left has the most access to millennials, then the logical conclusion is that a reflection on their own teachings and activism is in order.

It’s entirely possible that liberal positions on political issues are giving young Americans the wrong ideas. Liberals show unwavering support for affirmative action, which is predicated on the belief that black people and other minorities, for whatever reason, can’t succeed in school to the degree that whites can, despite the fact that they have enjoyed considerable success in every professional field. Liberals oppose voter ID laws, arguing they disenfranchise minorities, and some like Hillary Clinton even call for automatic registration and weeks-long period of early voting. The takeaway from this? White people are able to register, obtain a photo ID, and get to the polls on election day, but minorities simply aren’t.

As the recent Confederate flag controversy–spurred by the Charleston shooting–has shown, it’s not just America anymore. We now have “White America” and “Black America,” two distinct entities pitted against each other, made up of members who think and behave the exact same way. (Interestingly, it’s predominantly been white Northeastern liberals calling for “White America” to answer for its supposed crimes. One would have thought that the minority members of “Black America” possessed enough agency and ability to do that themselves if they wanted to. But I digress.)

Ultimately, this all helps illustrate what has become the foundation of modern liberalism. Various aspects of your identity—your race, gender, sexuality—automatically determine your worldview, and if you dare tread outside the ideological confines of your little box, you simply can’t be tolerated. Just look at how liberals treat black Republicans, like Clarence Thomas or Ben Carson. They’re self-hating Uncle Toms who are so stupid they don’t even know what’s in their own best interest. The same goes for female and gay Republicans, too. Remind me again who the intolerant ones are?

One thing is clear: If the reaction to Charleston over the past week tells us anything, it’s that we didn’t need Dylann Roof to start a race war. It appears we’re already in the midst of one.

Rachel Dolezal Is a Lose-Lose For The Left,"We may need a new law in political philosophy—call it The Law of Diminishing Marginalized Absurdity. It would go something like this: “All reductio ad absurdi, given enough cultural change, will inevitably become someone’s conventional wisdom.”

Witness the recent spectacle of Spokane NAACP President Rachel Dolezal being outed as a woman who was born white, despite portraying herself as black.

Let’s not mince words. In my view, while one can defend other such identity-shifting exercises on the grounds of psychology or gender essentialism, Dolezal’s behavior is so absurd it may render satire of the far Left simply impossible. I also suspect, depressingly enough, it will become a strategy of many college counselors at posh private schools to tell their charges to claim transraciality to get the benefits of affirmative action without actually fitting its requirements.

Oh, perverse incentives, what would we do without you?

Setting these depressing and amusing prospects aside, however, one rather substantial question looms in the Dolezal case: How can the far Left get out of this one? I ask this because Dolezal’s case seems to open an ideological Pandora’s Box for leftists, insofar as they must adopt one of two equally unattractive alternatives in deciding whether her deception is deception. Neither of those alternatives leads them anywhere pleasant. In fact, Dolezal is a perfect case study for the glaring inconsistencies lying at the core of left-wing racial dogma.

The First Option Reinforces Racial Profiling

To illustrate this, consider each of the two potential leftist responses one could give to Dolezal’s case. This may require some imagination, but never fear: I will try to illustrate the logic as vividly as possible.

First, imagine that the hypothetical leftist looks at Dolezal’s case and, seeing a case of the Jenners, concludes that no, transraciality is real, and that Dolezal was really a black woman trapped in a white woman’s body. See, for example, this discussion with MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry:



Several inconvenient questions immediately present themselves. Firstly, if a white person can be black on the inside, it follows that a black person can be white on the inside, or that an Asian person can be Hispanic on the inside, or that a lilywhite Oklahoma woman can be a Native American on the inside, or any number of other racially dualistic nightmares.

At bare minimum, this would seem to make affirmative action impossible to administer in any objective fashion. How are we to know, for instance, that the black students admitted to Harvard or Yale universities aren’t secretly psychologically white? What does being psychologically white mean, for that matter? Are we going to ask students to pass some sort of psychological “blackness” test to claim the affiliation? How much of being psychologically black involves simply conforming to stereotypes? Are these stereotypes actually accurate? If so, why accuse any and all stereotyping—even the positive sort—of being racist, if it’s actually a useful yardstick? If not, then again, what do we use as a yardstick, if not actual biological racial background?

This Also Destroys Privilege Theory

Secondly, even if a cosmetically white person were black on the inside, to hear leftists tell it, they would never in their right mind want to admit to this, let alone act it out, simply because that would remove all the privileges that (leftists assume) accrue to a white identity. In societies that oppress racial minorities, racial minorities tend to go out of their way to pretend to be the majority, not the other way round. Witness the dubious claims that black people bleach their skin to appear white. If a white person is willing to live as a black person, then evidence suggests at minimum that being black is safe. A more cynical observer might even question whether the advantages of black identity—say, a claim to victim identity—could motivate such a choice.

If a white person is willing to live as a black person, then evidence suggests at minimum that being black is safe.

Furthermore, this raises the question of why educated black people wouldn’t just claim to be white on the inside, especially if they buy into the left’s narrative that blacks are targeted by police, and other authority figures, more frequently. Imagine a version of the McKinney pool party incident where Cpl. David Eric Casebolt was informed by his targets that no, no, they were transracial and actually white. If the left-wing narrative is true, this should’ve sent him scurrying in a world where race is purely a psychological or social construct. If it didn’t, what are we to make of this? That Casebolt was, in this case, actually not racist? That he was transracist? What?

Furthermore, if race is purely a psychological or social construct, that seems to raise an even more inconvenient point: in such a world, race becomes not an immutable characteristic, but a choice. To say this would undermine the rationale for civil-rights laws is putting it mildly. It would eviscerate that rationale, because choices are typically seen as much more reasonable to discourage than simply being born the wrong way. What if studies showed that choosing to be a certain race made people worse off, on average? Could the government ban that choice? Would we call that genocide, or simply heavy-handed paternalism?

In other words, to accept Dolezal’s identity at face value, you have to be willing to sacrifice affirmative action and pretty much any appearance-based standard by which to judge racial identity, and transform race into something purely cultural, at which point it loses its most persuasive claim to being a protected class: namely, its immutability.

Or We Can Destroy Race as a Cultural Construct

But the alternative is no better. Let’s say you, as a leftist, have thought it through and realize all of the above, and decide instead to condemn Dolezal as a fraud. Fair enough. In that case, we have to conclude that skin color is the minimum necessary condition to belong to a certain race. In practice, this means any and all cultural elements of racial expression are utterly irrelevant to one’s racial identity. Neil DeGrasse Tyson is always going to blacker than Eminem, even if he doesn’t behave in a stereotypically black way, just because he was born with the right skin color.

With culture taken off the table as a racial determinant, they need to start finding actual biological bases for the racial disparities they like to talk about.

This thoroughly demolishes the sociological idea that race is a social construct, at minimum. It may even shift our ideas of racial justice to a much older paradigm of colorblindness, rather than the current left-wing attitude that white guilt should be the norm. After all, if race solely refers to the melanin content of one’s skin while cultural factors are dismissed as irrelevant, then we would seem to have no grounds to conclude that race should be relevant to how we view each other. It’s simply a cosmetic trait, like a birthmark or hair color, and thus we should treat it the same way. In Stephen Colbert’s parlance, we should “not see race.”

Of course, sociologists would recoil from this argument, since it would put much of their field out of business. However, with culture taken off the table as a racial determinant, they need to start finding actual biological bases for the racial disparities they like to talk about. Unfortunately for them, if that happens, you will be able to hear Charles Murray cackling at a thousand paces.

Why? Because at that point, suddenly the questions raised by Murray’s book “The Bell Curve” become live ones again. Even if Murray’s particular hypothesis were proven wrong, in a world where race is treated as a biological fact rather than a cultural one suddenly racial biological determinism of the kind that motivated early eugenicists would become a legitimate field of study again.

Perhaps such a field of study would find nothing other than melanin content as a relevant biological consideration, in which case, we return to colorblindness. Or perhaps it would unearth politically inconvenient data that would justify any number of racist policies (and not just against blacks) on the grounds of data-driven empiricism. Which, needless to say, would not make Al Sharpton happy.

In other words, to admit that race is biological and immutable, rather than culturally or socially imposed, is to raise the questions of just what the biological characteristics of different races are, and whether those differences have any relevance to public policy—questions an entire cottage industry of leftists has tried for years to suppress.

In short, when you look at the Dolezal case, there is no way for the Left to get out of it that doesn’t involve dismantling at least some element of their race-related policy regime. Behind door No. 1, you find a refutation of privilege theory and the collapse of affirmative action. Behind door No. 2, you find colorblindness at best, and scientific racism at worst. Conservatives who are tired of the Left’s incoherent race baiting owe Rachel Dolezal a debt of gratitude. She has become a living reductio ad absurdum, who shows the agonies of the modern race-obsessed Left in cold black and white.

Disparate Impact: Anthony Kennedy’s Economic Time Bomb,"Chief Justice John Roberts stole the spotlight when he swooped in to save Obamacare from the English language. The conservative backlash was predictable, brief, and damning, which is a shame. We could have saved that energy for Justice Anthony Kennedy, who issued an opinion in another case that will prove far more consequential in the lives of everyday Americans.

While Roberts’ decision can be reversed through legislation, Kennedy affirmed a dubious legal theory that only the courts can remedy. In so doing, the libertarian darling has upheld the college bubble and immanentized the eschaton of a future housing crash.

What Is Disparate Impact?

Like many bad ideas, this one traces back to Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society and terrible jurisprudence. As passed by Congress, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is straightforward, unobjectionable, and just: it outlaws racial discrimination in employment matters. But in the hands of an activist court, the passage transmogrified into one of Big Government’s most effective cudgels for greater regulatory power.

The regulation led formerly segregated companies, such as the North Carolina-based Duke Power Electric Company, to integrate the workforce. One way to prevent the reimplementation of the Good Ol’ Boy network was to create aptitude metrics to ensure that promotions were given in a fair measure. Duke adopted a simple requirement: employees could move on to management with the help of a high-school diploma, as well as a passing grade on a test designed to ensure plant safety and basic math skills. It sought to address the high-school graduation gap between black and white workers by offering to subsidize the educations of its employees. Still, 14 black applicants failed to meet the standards. Willie Griggs and 12 other black workers took the company to court.

The company argued it did its due diligence, since it rejected every worker, white or black, that failed to qualify. The justices found that regardless of what the Civil Rights Act said, the spirit of the law (that most artful of phrases) dictated that if blacks failed to meet a standard at a similar rate to whites, the standards themselves were racist—a legal doctrine known as disparate impact.

The theory proved an immediate boon to trial lawyers and government regulators, but by the 1980s the courts appeared to be going wobbly. Companies began pointing out that disparate-impact suits threatened their ability to hire quality workers and the Supreme Court started to rule in favor of the meritocracy. In stepped Ted Kennedy. He amended the 1991 Civil Rights Act to include disparate-impact theory, knowing that no Republican would dare oppose.

Credentialism over Meritocracy

Disparate impact laid the foundation for the college bubble and the depreciating value of the high-school education, enshrining the baccalaureate degree as the barrier of entry to the middle class. The irony would be lost on Chief Justice Warren Burger, who thought that eliminating tests would liberate the working man.

Companies fearful of disparate-impact lawsuits began relying on colleges to whittle down their applicant pool.

“What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification,” he wrote in Griggs. “Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the common sense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.”

Burger’s ruling simply changed the nature of who the “masters of reality” were, sparking the first major onslaught of outsourcing the country would see. Companies fearful of disparate-impact lawsuits began relying on colleges to whittle down their applicant pool.

In the pre-Griggs world, companies used aptitude tests to screen applicants—an approach borrowed from the military during World War II. Exams worked for the employer because they were simple, cheap and, most of all, effective, favoring raw talent above all else. “Despite their imperfections, tests and criteria such as those at issue in Griggs (which are heavily…dependent on cognitive ability) remain the best predictors of performance for jobs at all levels of complexity,” University of Pennsylvania professor Amy Wax found.

If businesses were allowed to recruit and screen candidates using testing, workers could start working earlier, advance quicker, and do it debt-free.

Test scores at matriculation are a near-perfect predictor of class rank come graduation—a testament to the fact that students are learning less now that institutions have lowered their standards. Research has found a strong correlation between master of business administration entrance exams and final grades. If businesses were allowed to recruit and screen candidates using testing, workers could start working earlier, advance quicker, and do it debt-free.

Businesses, however, can no longer afford to administer aptitude tests under the constant threat of lawsuits from those who fail. The influx of student loans coupled with the college degree’s emergence as the ticket to the middle class freed colleges from keeping admittance affordable.

How Disparate Impact Hurts Black Men

“We began using college education as a screening device for being reasonably productive, and it’s incredibly wasteful of time and money,” Wax told me in a 2013 interview. “Ironically, this overtly seems to be hurting black men because they do not go to college at the same rate as whites or Asians or black females.”

‘This overtly seems to be hurting black men because they do not go to college at the same rate as whites or Asians or black females.’

No group has been hurt more by this arrangement than black men, those Griggs was supposed to help. Burger noted in Griggs that white workers had an innate advantage because 34 percent of white males in North Carolina had high-school diplomas, nearly double that of blacks. The baccalaureate’s degrees gap is about the same today among black and white men, and is even larger between men and women.

“The court decision accomplished very little in blunting biased company hiring practices. In fact, it’s probably true that it’s only helped make discrimination more rampant,” an editorial at the Vault Education blog says.

The employment factors aren’t just limited to the private sector. Employment tests remain a mainstay in public safety, but the standard is starting to erode there, as well. The beauty of disparate impact is that it never has to be consistent. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) has been forced to hire women who failed the entrance exam because it was too physical and minorities who have failed the entrance exam because it is too cerebral.

Who Needs Competent Firefighters?

The Department of Justice under the Bush administration sued the New York City Fire Department because minorities did not perform well on its 1999 and 2002 entrance exams. More than 20 firefighters developed the tests’ 85 multiple-choice questions focused on math and the proper way to combat fires. The New York Times interviewed no firefighters in its coverage, but gave the floor to University of Michigan constitutional law professor Richard Primus. Condescension, not egalitarianism bled through the page.

The last thing we need is a fire department filled with professionals.

“Much of what appears on written exams for firefighters is legitimately material that we should want firefighters to know,” he said, but some of it tends to be knowledge that “firefighting junkies have, even though it is not really necessary for fighting fires.”

The last thing we need is a fire department filled with professionals. One imagines he would dismiss any fireman who showed up at the University of Michigan in 2013 to decry the fact that only nine of the law school’s 188 professors is black. One hopes the professor will protest if the president’s next Supreme Court nominee is a fireman whose sole knowledge of the Bill of Rights is that there are ten amendments. Only constitution junkies know what disparate impact is, and we don’t want to give them a leg up.

Judge Nicholas Garaufis agreed in a typo-riddled opinion—at one point, he admitted that plaintiffs “did not asses [sic] the reading level of the Academy’s training materials”—that declared the tests racist. He awarded the failed firefighter plaintiffs nearly $129 million and appointed Obama Securities and Exchange Commission chief Mary Jo White to develop a test short on words and high on “more visual elements like photos and drawings.” White, an attorney known in FDNY circles for forcing the department to hire women who had failed the physical 30 years earlier, ditched questions about math and equipment and opted to test for “establishing and maintaining relationships”—no doubt the most important skill in extinguishing five-alarm blazes.

“They said that because we communicate verbally at the scene of a fire, that’s what’s important. But, in order to…communicate intelligently, you have to read the manual and understand the material,” FDNY Deputy Chief Paul Mannix said of the judge’s dismissal of reading comprehension on the firefighting exam.

‘Ideologues are making a dangerous job more dangerous all because they don’t like the way the fire department looks. If diversity is your number-one goal, then safety and competence can’t be.’

Mannix heads Merit Matters, a group he started after the Department of Justice launched the disparate-impact suit. Merit Matters is dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are not created equal, that certain individuals possess certain traits that make for the ideal firefighter and that those realities should trump political idealism that declares everyone the same.

“We now have females claiming that the FDNY’s physical test has a disparate impact because women don’t pass often enough. They say that it’s discriminatory that women don’t have 50 percent of the jobs. They say that most of the job doesn’t require brute strength. They’re right, but every once in a while the line between life and death depends on my ability to tear a metal gate from a window frame,” he said. “Ideologues are making a dangerous job more dangerous all because they don’t like the way the fire department looks. If diversity is your number-one goal, then safety and competence can’t be.”

Disparate Impact and the Coming Housing Bubble

Firefighting has played an enormous role in disparate impact of late. The Supreme Court affirmed in Ricci v. DeStefano that the New Haven Fire Department violated the equal-protection clause when it nullified the results of a promotion exam because not enough minority firefighters passed. The decision so spooked the Obama administration that it dropped a $200 million whistleblower suit against St. Paul, Minnesota, if the city agreed not to bring Gallagher v. Magner, a disparate-impact lawsuit, to the Supreme Court. They should have had more faith in Justice Kennedy, who cited the suit approvingly in his decision extending disparate impact to housing.

Regulators and trial lawyers used disparate impact to sue banks and lenders for denying home loans to people with bad credit because blacks had worse average credit rates than whites.

“Although the Court is reluctant to approve or disapprove a case that is not pending, it should be noted that Magner was decided without the cautionary standards announced in this opinion and, in all events, the case was settled by the parties before an ultimate determination of disparate-impact liability,” Kennedy writes. “Were standards for proceeding with disparate-impact suits not to incorporate at least the safeguards discussed here…that, in turn, would set our Nation back in its quest to reduce the salience of race in our social and economic system.”

The truth is, disparate impact has long been applied beyond the job market, where it was originally established. The federal government has sued insurance companies for raising premiums on houses with deficient roofing because it turned out that the shoddier structures were largely occupied by black people. Insurers opted to drop coverage in the area altogether, rather than take on the risk of paying out inflated roofing claims. With Justice Kennedy’s blessing, that’s not an option anymore.

Regulators and trial lawyers used disparate impact to sue banks and lenders for denying home loans to people with bad credit at the turn of the century because blacks had worse average credit rates than whites. Lenders opted against pulling out of the market and decided to double down and give wild mortgages to bad borrowers—a practice that resulted in 2007’s financial collapse. We can expect similar results now that Kennedy has entrenched disparate impact in housing. He has taken a regulatory assumption and established it as precedent. No lender will dare run afoul of that.

Soon, Kennedy will make gay marriage the law of the land. The media and certain thought leaders will laud him as a man dedicated to liberty and freedom above all else. His real legacy is disparate impact and eminent domain.

How To Start Your Professional Wardrobe,"So you’ve graduated. You’ve either snagged your first job or you are on the active hunt. Wherever you are on your career journey, one obstacle everyone must tackle is wrangling the professional wardrobe.

It’s not an easy feat. There are a slew of variables, unknowns, and we certainly can’t ignore the expense. What kind of office environment will you be working in? Is the dress code casual? Will you be attending client meetings, industry events, or conferences? Before you go out and buy everything or concede and wear your mother’s hand-me-downs, my best advice is to start with the basics.

Fortunately, the basics are simple. Whether worn individually or grouped together, a gray suit (pants and blazer), a black pencil skirt, a white Oxford shirt, your existing accessories and a great pair of black shoes can easily soothe your wardrobe anxiety and provide you with endless style options, all while stretching your hard-earned dollar.

Start with a Grey Suit

One of the best wardrobe investments one can make is purchasing the versatile and always-in-fashion gray suit. Here’s a darker one from J. Crew.

Or a lighter one:

Aside from the obvious—wearing the suit pants and blazer together—one can style these two pieces multiple ways. First off, gray pairs well with almost anything. One can easily pair the gray slacks with a black top and black shoes. Want to go a different direction? Pair with navy or royal blue. The hues definitely complement one another and create a unique look. Go nautical! Add gold jewelry and a white scarf. Want something a bit more understated? Trade in silver jewelry or pearls, and the outfit becomes an immediate classic. See this styling from Ann Taylor:

Now, grab that gray blazer. No wardrobe is complete without a reliable suit jacket. Simply reverse the suggestions shared above and add black or navy pants. Wear the gray blazer with a black skirt and white Oxford shirt. Want something more colorful? Gray pairs well with almost any color, so shop your closet and see what makes a great match. Is it causal Friday? Rock your blazer with a nice t-shirt and a pair of jeans. J. Crew again:

Here’s another suggestion from Laura Harari of Edgify Me, via Glamour magazine:

The blazer will help you along on that crisp morning commute, protect you from the ridiculous office air conditioning, and in the event you run into an office principal, you still look tailored and polished.

Do yourself and your closet a favor: get a black pencil skirt. A black pencil skirt is a staple in the professional world. Pair just about any shirt or blouse already in your closet, and you’ll be ready to face the day. Here’s one at Macy’s:

And another at Ann Taylor Loft:

Just note, when selecting a skirt, it’s important that the skirt fits your body type. So, if this style doesn’t fit your shape, an A-line skirt would be equally fabulous. Bridgette Raes has the idea:

The unprecedented and most traditional piece of professional staples is the white Oxford shirt. It didn’t gain its popularity for nothing. It’s so versatile that everyone, men and women, make it a standard of their weekly office-wear rotation. It goes with just about everything. It will easily pair with all of your gray suit and black pencil skirt combinations, or drape simply over a pair of leggings or skinny jeans. Ralph Lauren has some ideas.

Wear the shirt completely buttoned and add a short necklace that lays directly under the collar. Or grab a white or colored camisole, button the shirt just partially, allowing the shirt to gap and the camisole to show, too. If your work environment is more casual, roll up the sleeves or tie a knot with the two front tails.

Once you have these items secured, its then time to interject your personality and one of the easiest ways of doing that is through your accessories. Scour your closet and jewelry box, because you probably already have great items on hand to play up and showcase your own personal flair. A good go-to is jewelry. A statement piece, a long or short necklace, will instantly add interest and excitement to your wardrobe. Adding a colorful belt, a patterned scarf, or even a great pair of colored shoes will take your outfit from boring to future boss. Have fun with creating new looks, mix and match your options, and you’ll give your closet an instant upgrade. Here are some ideas:

Lastly, no outfit is complete without the perfect pair of shoes. It has been said, “Give a girl the right pair of shoes, and she can conquer the world!” Your shoe choice can really make or break your outfit, so be deliberate with your purchase. You can’t go wrong with a simple pair of black pumps or flats, like these from Banana Republic.

While shopping, be cognizant of what they are made out of, for some shoes can quickly show a lot of wear and tear (i.e. suede or cloth-covered are just asking for that accidental coffee spill). Additionally, make sure they are comfortable and that you can walk in them. I’m all for a high heel, but stumbling around the office or grimacing from the pain is no fun for anyone, especially your feet!

As you progress through your career, so will your professional wardrobe. But, regardless of time, these wardrobe basics will continue to remain as your go-to staples. Keep these items on a rotation, and your professional wardrobe will be on its own road to success.

"George Takei Clarifies: Actually, ‘Black Face’ Isn’t Racist At All","After getting pilloried on social media today for referring to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as a “clown in black face,” Hollywood has-been George Takei took to Facebook to…double down on his comments. Seriously:

“‘Blackface’ is a lesser known theatrical term for a white actor who blackens his face to play a black buffoon,” Takei wrote. “In traditional theater lingo, and in my view and intent, that is not racist.”

Dude. DUDE. Yes, yes it is. That’s kind of the definition of racist. You essentially called the only black member of the U.S. Supreme Court a race traitor for the crime of stating that…dignity and humanity are bestowed on mankind by God, not government. And then to top it all off, you also explicitly likened him to a “black buffoon.”

“I feel Justice Thomas has abdicated and abandoned his African American heritage,” Takei continued, “by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings.”

For starters, that’s not what Thomas claimed at all. Only an addled drama queen with severely limited reading comprehension and a desire to assume the worst about people who disagree with him could have come to that conclusion (for those who may have been triggered by this sentence, “drama queen” is a lesser known theatrical term for an emotional headcase with no perspective and a crippling case of narcissism).

And who in their right mind, while claiming to totally not be a dirty racist, says things like, “[That black man] abdicated and abandoned his African American heritage”? Seriously, who does that? Clarence Thomas can no more “abdicate” his heritage as an African-American than Rachel Dolezal can claim that heritage for herself.

Where in the world does George Freaking Takei get off deciding that he’s the new arbiter of American blackness? In what universe does that make any sense?

As of this afternoon, there had been a near-universal progressive blackout of Takei’s black face comments about Thomas. Now that he’s doubled down and declared that 1) the term “black face” totally isn’t racist you guys, and 2) Thomas is a race traitor, pretending that Takei isn’t willfully peddling racism is going to get a whole lot more difficult.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/02/george-takei-clarifies-actually-black-face-isnt-racist-at-all/,2015-07-02
George Takei: Clarence Thomas Is A 'Clown In Black Face',"In a nasty, racist rant captured by a Fox affiliate in Arizona, former Star Trek actor-turned-gay rights activist George Takei lashed out at Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, calling him a “clown in black face.”

Takei’s explosive verbal diarrhea, which can be witnessed in full here courtesy of Newsbusters, was prompted by Thomas’ dissent to the Supreme Court’s Obergefell ruling which declared gay marriage to be a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. Here is the excerpt of Thomas’ dissent that led to Takei’s meltdown:

Human dignity has long been understood in this country to be innate. When the Framers proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence that “all men are created equal” and “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,” they referred to a vision of mankind in which all humans are created in the image of God and therefore of inherent worth. That vision is the foundation upon which

this Nation was built.



The corollary of that principle is that human dignity cannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away.

Because he is a simple man with a simple mind incapable of basic reading comprehension, Takei took this to mean that Thomas was denying the indignity of slavery. So how did Takei respond? Like this:

TAKEI: He is a clown in black face sitting on the Supreme Court. He gets me that angry. He doesn’t belong there. And for him to say, slaves have dignity. I mean, doesn’t he know that slaves were in chains? That they were whipped on the back. If he saw the movie 12 Years a Slave, you know, they were raped. And he says they had dignity as slaves or – My parents lost everything that they worked for, in the middle of their lives, in their 30s. His business, my father’s business, our home, our freedom and we’re supposed to call that dignified? Marched out of our homes at gun point. I mean, this man does not belong on the Supreme Court. He is an embarrassment. He is a disgrace to America.

Oh my. Rather than somehow defending or dismissing the institution of slavery, Thomas actually elucidated the logic that formed the foundation of the abolition movement to end American slavery once and for all: that humanity and dignity come not from government, but from God, who makes all men in His image.

It is this fact — that we are all created in the divine image of our Creator — that demands that government recognize the rights of all people, regardless of their color or creed. Government, after all, does not create natural rights. It is merely granted the authority to safeguard them. What Thomas noted was that while slave owners could demean and degrade their slaves, they could never wrest from them the dignity inherent in being a child of God. Far from minimizing the evils of slavery, Thomas was highlighting the revolutionary truth that led to America’s founding: “that all men are created equal, [and] that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.”

Takei, however, did not grasp this fairly elementary historical point. Rather than taking Thomas’ logic and asserting that it requires the right of marriage to be available to all people — Takei’s preferred outcome — Takei went in the exact opposite direction and basically called Clarence Thomas a race traitor for having the audacity to have an opinion not handed down to him by the government. I’m not old enough to remember what life was like when the government thought black people were not entitled to their own opinions, but Clarence Thomas certainly is. Unlike George Takei, Thomas didn’t just read about or observe vile, state-sanctioned discrimination against African-Americans; Thomas experienced it first-hand.

The New York Times noted in a book review of Thomas’ “My Grandfather’s Son” how Thomas experienced the evils of anti-black racism:

His critics might not be moved by his political arguments, but his memoir gives them a man, not a caricature, to attack. Justice Thomas faced enormous obstacles in life. His deadbeat father, referred to only as C, abandoned his family to a life of poverty so extreme that the children did not put sugar on their cereal. Daddy, whose small fuel-oil business provided a modest income, sent Clarence to Catholic schools, but the harsh racial environment in Georgia put enormous pressure on black children trying to move further than their parents.



As one of only two black students at his seminary school, Justice Thomas experienced panic, followed by “a constant state of controlled anxiety.” The fear of failure haunted him in a way that no white child could understand, or black parents either, accustomed to living behind the walls of segregation that were now falling down.

Thomas was a teenager by the time his hometown of Savannah was desegregated. He almost certainly remembers separate water fountains, movie theaters, schools, and buses. He didn’t just hear about Jim Crow laws; he lived under them. To Thomas, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. wasn’t just a brave man on the television, he was the preacher around the corner preparing to change American history forever. Savannah, after all, is home to the church where King, Jr. first practiced his historic “I Have A Dream” speech.

If @GeorgeTakei were Ted Nugent, and Clarence Thomas were Obama, we'd be having a whole different conversation about his ""blackface"" comment

As disgusting as Takei’s comments are, they almost certainly spring from the popular belief among many gay rights activists that the gay rights movement is the rightful heir of the Civil Rights movement, and that those who are attracted to members of the same sex have experienced the same struggles and suffering experienced by African-Americans. As a result, by disagreeing with Takei on whether a right to gay marriage can be found in the Constitution, Thomas is also denying the necessity of the Civil Rights movement. In this regard, perhaps it is Takei who needs the history of anti-black discrimination in America explained to him.

To put things into perspective for a moment, black men and women were kidnapped from their homes, separated from their families, and shoved in the cargo holds of boats. Those few who survived the voyage across the Atlantic were then chained and marched to the top of a platform where they were sold like cattle. They were beaten, raped, and enslaved. The United States government denied their very humanity. And even after the United States fought its bloodiest war in history in order to acknowledge and ensure their freedom, they were treated as foreigners in their own land for another century. They were denied the right to vote, the right to sit on a jury, and a right to defend themselves from violence. They were forced to endure show trials where they were judged not by their peers, but by individuals who believed their skin tone was their destiny. To this day they continue to be profiled not by their actions, but by their mere appearance.

I do not doubt for a moment the struggles and hardships experienced by homosexual men and women in this country, but it strains credulity to compare those struggles to what millions upon millions of black people were forced to endure for centuries. Out of one side of his mouth Takei claims the mantle of the American Civil Rights movement, while out of the other he spews vicious racial slurs and accusations of racial treason at a man who remembers what it was like to have the boot of Jim Crow on his neck.

Clarence Thomas does not need George Takei to patronizingly explain to him how hard life was (and is) for many black people. Thomas may not have legions of Facebook followers clamoring for his next pun or picture posted by an army of comedic writers on his payroll, but he is one thing that Takei is not: a black person with a God-given right to his own opinion. And maybe that fact is what makes Takei so angry.

Is It Racism To Say ‘All Lives Matter’?,"The summer after my freshman year of high school, my parents decided to move from Waukesha, Wisconsin, to Mobile, Alabama. Although I was very sad to leave my boyhood home and all my goodhearted Midwestern friends, I was also 15 years old and had hatched a theory in my adolescent mind that moving to the Deep South would mean attention from southern girls, who would no doubt be swooning after the mysterious new guy from a faraway land.

My parents enrolled me in the big public school in downtown Mobile, and I spent much of that summer learning to appreciate air conditioning and daydreaming about all the beautiful young women that I would meet when the school year started.

It didn’t take me long to realize that my Yankee accent was not as alluring as my delusional teenage mind had imagined. I was swallowed up in a huge high school that was much more diverse than my lily-white Wisconsin school. The majority of students in my new school were black, but all sorts of races were represented there. I wasn’t even the guy from the “faraway land”—that designation probably belonged the small group of Vietnamese immigrants at the school.

By the time I was a senior, I had worked up the courage to ask out the smartest girl in my class. I wasn’t even discouraged (for very long) when I once overheard her father telling her that he didn’t approve of the “Yankee Jew-boy” she was dating. A few years later, he gave me permission to marry her, so I guess he didn’t hold my heritage against me for long.

It took me a long time to fit in, but I learned a lot about myself and the world during that time. Race in America, it turned out, was much more complicated than the namby-pamby version I learned in my civics classes.

Racism Isn’t Unique to America

I learned firsthand that there is a lot of truth in the old saying about American race relations: “In the North they love the race, but hate the person; in the South they love the person, but hate the race.” This is to say that, while the North is much more segregated by race in both the schools and cities, folks generally don’t say anything that is overtly racist. Meanwhile, in the South where folks are generally more racially integrated, you tend to hear more overt racism. In short, the North exhibits more institutional racism, the South a more individual kind.

When I lived in Senegal, I learned about Wolof racism against the Serers and Fula.

I have since lived all over the country—and abroad for a few years—and I have learned that you cannot escape racism. It is a quality that is not unique to any region or people or country. When I lived in Senegal, I learned about Wolof racism against the Serers and Fula. Everyone pretty much hated the Lebanese businessmen who ran shops in Dakar and the snobby French tourists who populated the Senegalese beaches in the winters.

So when I read the headlines about the flack Hillary Clinton was getting for saying “all lives matter” at a black church in Missouri, which repeated themselves when Martin O’Malley said the same at Netroots Nation, I have to say I was sympathetic to the critics. It was not just because I found it enjoyable to see a hiccup in Clinton’s carefully scripted campaign/coronation. I was sympathetic because I think she, like so many Americans on the Right and Left, simply don’t get it. We still have a problem with racism. And we need to say that.

The Media Isn’t Helping Heal Racism

A big part of the problem is the media. Much has been written about the modern journalistic impulse to “narrativize” unique events by imbuing them with broader socio-cultural implications, sometimes to the detriment of the actual facts. One need not think too long to come up with a bevy of recent racially charged news stories where facts have been embellished—or outright fabricated—in order to serve a political or ideological agenda.

Why would the news media focus on a symbol of racism more than what appeared to be actual racist crimes?

Perhaps this is why I was initially skeptical of the Time headline I read recently: “Another Black Church Burns in the South, the 8th in 10 Days.” I didn’t have to do much research to have my suspicions confirmed. All I had to do was read the story. Turns out, of the eight churches that have burned, over half were not arson, but “several have been blamed preliminarily on lightning.” But the damage was done. The Time headline has been accompanied by a whole host of similar headlines. #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches is now trending on Twitter.

To complicate matters, Mark Tooley at the Institute for Religion and Democracy has uncovered some troubling statistical data which suggest that there are about 20 church arsons in America every month. About 20 percent of these are black churches. So after finding out that the article was egregiously misleading, it would have been easy to dismiss it as click- and race-bait and go about my daily business without another thought.

But something still bothered me. If it is true that there have been a few cases of black church arson in the last week, why wasn’t I hearing more about it? It seemed to me that I had seen a lot more headlines about the Confederate flag than I had seen about the black churches burning. Why would the news media focus on a symbol of racism more than what appeared to be actual racist crimes?

And I’m not just imagining disparity in the coverage. According to Google trends, over the several days during the Confederate flag brouhaha, the American public was about 20 times more likely to see a news headline about the “Confederate flag” than they were to see one about arson at a black church:

Even worse, news the debate surrounding the Confederate flag far overshadowed the news about the eight black worshippers who were killed by a committed racist at church in June.

Of course, the true victims of this journalistic dishonesty and misplaced priorities are not the readers who are gullible enough to believe the false narratives, but rather future victims of racism whose cries will fall on deaf ears because no one trusts the veracity of the stories that they are reading.

President Obama has repeatedly urged Americans to begin a “national dialogue” on race. If we had integrity in reporting, perhaps the dialogue could move past bickering over whether reports of racism are actually true.

The Heritage of Ta-Nehisi Coates,"When he set out to interview James Baldwin for his oral history of the civil rights movement, Who Speaks for the Negro? (1965), Robert Penn Warren knew that the challenge would be to get any straightforward answers out of him. “In general, in Baldwin’s utterances, written or spoken,” he explained, “there is a tendency to pull away from the specific issue which might provoke analysis, toward one more general … toward the absolute, the eschatological.” Forewarned is forearmed, but in this case it was not enough: Baldwin’s pivot maneuver was invincible. “For example, when I asked him about the obligation of the Negro, he countered by saying he wasn’t sure what a Negro is. What is a Negro?” With quiet amusement, Warren admitted, “That is, indeed, a more charged and fascinating question than the one I had asked.”

That Ta-Nehisi Coates has the same ultra-macroscopic tendency as his hero can be seen in the highly recognizable style of conclusion with which he often ends his blog posts at The Atlantic: short, sweeping, indefinite, ponderous. Like Baldwin, Coates prefers to back up from the original question so far that, by the time he is finished, he is off in the exosphere:

Aren’t all nations problems? Aren’t all families? Aren’t all people?



Likely the fight was always muddy and dizzying. Likely nothing was ever clean.



We don’t always get to choose the means through which we acquire knowledge. Ignorance is not a weapon.

Those kickers come from posts about civic virtue, The Bell Curve, and Aaron Sorkin—the reader can guess which is which.

The Close Connection Between Coates and Baldwin

Coates’s new book, Between the World and Me, is full of the same sort of pronouncements: “The entire narrative of this country argues against the truth of who you are.” “You have to make your peace with the chaos.” “The pursuit of knowing was freedom to me.” But beneath the orotundities, there is a thesis, which, whatever else you want to say about it, is not at all vague. He believes that white Americans lead a charmed life, which he calls the Dream, which is sustained by the deliberate “plunder” (his self-proclaimed buzzword) of black Americans. The mechanics of this plunder are subtle:

I came to see the streets and the schools as arms of the same beast. One enjoyed the official power of the state while the other enjoyed its implicit sanction. But fear and violence were the weaponry of both. Fail in the streets and the crews would catch you slipping and take your body. Fail in the schools and you would be suspended and sent back to those same streets, where they would take your body. And I began to see these two arms in relation—those who failed in the schools justified their destruction in the streets. The society could say, “He should have stayed in school,” and then wash its hands of him.

“No one directly proclaimed that schools were designed to sanctify failure and destruction,” he admits. The word that comes next is “But.”

This, too, is pure Baldwin. “Black people were killing each other every Saturday night out on Lenox Avenue, when I was growing up,” Baldwin wrote in 1970,

and no one explained to them, or to me, that it was intended that they should; that they were penned where they were, like animals, in order that they should consider themselves no better than animals. Everything supported this sense of reality, nothing denied it; and so one was ready, when it came time to go to work, to be treated as a slave.

Since the end of Jim Crow, authors who have asserted that white America is not just misguided but actively wicked in its dealings with black America have tended to grow hazy when it comes to what benefit, exactly, white America derives from this villainy. Here we see why: Generally it is the least plausible link in an already tenuous logical chain. In Baldwin’s case, one can only say that if there was a conspiracy to make diligent worker bees of black urban males, it has not gone to plan. In the annals of cui bono, this ranks with the time the head of SNCC said we were in Vietnam “for the rice supplies.”

With Coates, the central weakness of his argument is that everything always comes back to the violence of ‘the streets.’

With Coates, the central weakness of his argument is that everything always comes back to the violence of “the streets.” School, to him, is just a meaningless hurdle designed to furnish a pretext for white indifference to that violence. The “daily everyday violence that folks live under” puts the April 2015 riots in Baltimore beyond condemnation. What “daily everyday” violence, and at whose hands? That the perpetrators are mostly young and black can be surmised from the list of little violence-avoiding choices that, Coates says, tyrannized his mental life as a child—what to wear, where to sit at lunch, what route to take to and from school, with what friends from what neighborhoods. Then there is this story he tells about his mother:

When your grandmother was sixteen years old a young man knocked on her door. The young man was your Nana Jo’s boyfriend. No one else was home. Ma allowed this young man to sit and wait until your Nana Jo returned. But your great-grandmother got there first. She asked the young man to leave. Then she beat your grandmother terrifically, one last time, so that she might remember how easily she could lose her body.

And here the weakness becomes plain, because the connection that Coates keeps trying to insinuate into existence between the black violence he has observed and the white menace he has postulated just snaps. White supremacy did not invent the rule that young women should generally keep male callers on the doorstep when they are home alone. The danger against which this rule is a precaution is not a racial one.

Once the reader pulls on this string, the whole web starts to unravel, because the connection between white supremacy and the other violence Coates describes is not very well substantiated either. If suburbia is to blame for young Ta-Nehisi getting beat up on his way home from school, it is only in the most abstract, cosmic sense. And at what metaphysical remove does it become fair to write, as Coates does, that the Baltimore street toughs of his youth “in their large rings and medallions, their big puffy coats and full-length fur-collared leathers … their armor against their world,” were “girding themselves against the ghosts of the bad old days when the Mississippi mob gathered round their grandfathers”? A damned rarefied one—the same one from which Baldwin blamed white people for the assassination of Malcolm X because “whoever did it was formed in the crucible of the American Republic.”

The Invisible Victims of Progressive Policy

But abstract, cosmic blame is just what Coates refuses to be satisfied with. His case is grounded in policy, as he often reminds us. He is not speaking metaphorically when he says that America has grown rich by seizing black people’s wealth. His favorite example is redlining, which kept government-backed mortgages out of black neighborhoods in the decades between the New Deal and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The main character of Coates’s famous “Case for Reparations” article is a 91-year-old Chicagoan named Clyde Ross, whose inability to get a federally insured home loan in the 1960s led him to buy a house “on contract,” an arrangement where one missed payment could leave a person with no equity and no house. Coates is eloquent on the toll this took on Ross, who worked second and third jobs to keep up his payments: “Money and time that Ross wanted to give to his children went instead to enrich white speculators.”

The fears that sent the Pearlmans running from their home on Kerwin Street were not self-generated, nor did they come from the scare tactics of real-estate blockbusters.

Since Coates is interested in housing policy and in sad stories, I wonder what he thinks of the fate of Saul and Gertrude Pearlman, two of the tens of thousands of Jews who vacated the neighborhoods of Dorchester and Mattapan (or “Murdapan,” as it has come to be known) in the wake of the federal government’s decision to make it easier rather than harder for black buyers to get home loans—a policy reversal which Coates has not troubled to note, as far as I can see. Beginning in 1968, the city of Boston put a private consortium, the Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group, in charge of implementing this new federal policy, and B-BURG took to it with a zeal born of avarice and fear. (In the wake of the King assassination riots, the business community were “shaking like quivering boys,” Mayor Kevin White later recalled.) Within five years of receiving their first batch of subsidized B-BURG homeowners—half of whom would soon lose their houses to foreclosure or abandonment, and some of whom never made a single payment on their loans—the formerly thriving neighborhoods of Dorchester and Mattapan went from having 40,000 Jews to fewer than 2,500.[1]

In his book, Coates cavalierly attributes “white flight” to “self-generated fears that compelled the people who think they are white to flee the cities and into the Dream.” The fears that sent the Pearlmans running from their home on Kerwin Street were not self-generated, nor did they come from the scare tactics of real-estate blockbusters. They came from experiences like being trussed up for hours while intruders with hunting knives ransacked their home for nonexistent valuables, and from hearing their kindhearted black neighbour say, “You’re older, Jewish, and vulnerable. It’s over for you here.”

Were the Jews of Mattapan “plundered”? What about the victims, direct and indirect, of the Community Reinvestment Act, the debauch of credit standards in the housing market, the racial quotas imposed on the mortgage giants, and all of the other programs that it was hoped would close the black–white gap in housing wealth which, Coates may be surprised to learn, he is not the first person to notice? That the federal government took from the Pearlmans something of great value is impossible to deny; whether it was of greater value than what was taken from Clyde Ross is impossible to say. Nevertheless, I would refrain from using Coates’s favorite word in this context, if only because I cherish hopes of maintaining some boundaries to its definition.

Beware Coates’ Campaign of Deception through Diction

The danger in allowing “plunder” to become a nonsense term is foreshadowed by the fate of its cousin epithet “neo-colonialism.” Because “neo-colonial” has no stable definition—it could describe literally any interaction between the West and the Third World—African despots have used it to condemn anything they don’t like. With this magic word, it is possible to cancel entire investment projects, send aid shipments back, put inconvenient charity groups on planes home. The word’s flexibility also means that rulers can refrain from applying it to exploitative things that they do like, including some of the less savory Chinese operations on the continent. The word “neo-colonialism” thus becomes what every word becomes when it is subordinated to politics: an expression of raw arbitrary power.

The word ‘neo-colonialism’ thus becomes what every word becomes when it is subordinated to politics: an expression of raw arbitrary power.

Coates uses the word “plunder” for a grab-bag of tragedies, misfortunes, and annoyances: an eviction he witnesses in Chicago, presumably over chronic non-payment of bills; the “killing fields” of inner city gang violence; the “inescapable robbery of time” in “the moments we spend readying the mask, or readying ourselves to accept half as much”; and, somewhat off-topic, “the damming of seas for voltage, the extraction of coal, the transmuting of oil into food.” But these things are not plunder.

Plunder is what Britain did to Ireland. It is what Thaddeus Stevens wanted to do to the prostrate South. (Would a Congressman Coates have opposed him?) Coates justifies his moth-antenna sensitivity to “plunder” on the logic that “there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such.” But if you had asked an English parliamentarian to defend the Penal Laws, he would have freely admitted that the immiseration of the Irish was the whole point. The idea was to render them incapable of starting yet another savage civil war—not, in itself, an unworthy goal, though the means were unacceptable. Nor did Thad Stevens consider “confiscation” a slur. Plunder is a venerable and useful concept. In Coates’s hands, it is a stick to beat his enemies with.

It may be that Coates is not familiar with all of this history. There is quite a lot of history he doesn’t know, by his own admission. In December 2012, it notoriously came up in an interview that Coates had never heard of Saint Augustine—which would have been fine, except that earlier that very day he posted an item on his blog arguing that Christian holidays are no less “made-up” than Kwanzaa. People who have never heard of Augustine are not necessarily ignorant in an objective sense. They may not even be ignorant in the contextual sense that they should not be senior editors of national magazines. But people who have never heard of Augustine probably should not go around pronouncing on the made-up-ness of Christmas and Easter. (This gap may also help explain Coates’s surprise at the Christian forgiveness on display in Charleston.)

Coates sometimes wields old quotations the way fundamentalists wield Bible verses, as if the words themselves had incantatory power.

Then again, an autodidact’s knowledge is always irregular, and even his critics must allow that Coates’s willingness to admit what he doesn’t know is one of his most admirable qualities. Another is contagious enthusiasm, also an amateur’s virtue. But Coates has the flaws as well as the gifts of a born autodidact. His veneration of primary sources verges on the superstitious, and he sometimes wields old quotations the way fundamentalists wield Bible verses, as if the words themselves had incantatory power. In just two years Coates cited Mississippi’s secession ordinance seven times on his blog, always by way of proving that the Civil War was about slavery—which it was, but one paragraph from a fundamentally propagandistic document is not quite the debunking Coates made it out to be. Why assume that Confederates would pour out their innermost motivations, shorn of all politically motivated misdirection, into this particular document? Coates does not explain. For him it is enough that the words are “what actual Confederates were saying.”

There is one quotation from John C. Calhoun that Coates uses over and over again in the same fashion—in his book, in the “Reparations” article, in his blog series on the Civil War:

With us the two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black; and all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals.

Why has Coates fixated (if that is not too strong a word) on this quotation in particular, as if there were not a hundred other racist Calhoun quotes to choose from? Perhaps because it shows Calhoun trying to substitute race for class, and that is precisely Coates’s own game. Like the Fanonists of his father’s generation, who cast the Third World in the role of the proletariat, there is something distinctly Marxist about Ta-Nehisi Coates. You can hear it in his harping on “plunder” and exploitation, in his hard-nosed rejection of bourgeois sentimentality, in his conviction that all suffering is the product of some elite class’s self-serving design, and more recently in his aggressive atheism.

The adulation Coates receives from the mainstream press proves we have lost our collective antibodies to the most destructive ideology of the twentieth century.

If you ever want to send a chill up your own spine, replace “black people” with “the working class” in one of Coates’s angrier effusions. “The Dream rests on the worker’s back, the bedding made from our bodies … The Dreamers accept this as the cost of doing business, accept the bodies of the working class as currency … The worker is naked before the elements of the world, and this nakedness is not an error but the correct and intended result of policy.” It is no coincidence, comrade! This is why the adulation Coates receives from the mainstream press is so disturbing: not because a fashionable pundit is being praised out of proportion to his talent—that happens all the time—but because it proves we have lost our collective antibodies to the most destructive ideology of the twentieth century. Have the Atlantic readers who find “plunder” such an interesting concept never heard the lyrics to “Solidarity Forever”? (“They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn …”) Do they not remember how that story ends?

This legacy casts an ominous shadow over the most remarked-upon anecdote in Between the World and Me, the story of the woman who pushed Coates’s son on an Upper West Side escalator:

You were almost five years old. The theater was crowded, and when we came out we rode a set of escalators down to the ground floor. As we came off, you were moving at the dawdling speed of a small child. A white woman pushed you and said, “Come on!” Many things now happened at once. There was the reaction of any parent when a stranger lays a hand on the body of his or her child. And there was my own insecurity in my ability to protect your black body. And more: There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew, for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action. But I was not out on my part of Flatbush.… I turned and spoke to this woman, and my words were hot with all of the moment and all of my history. She shrunk back, shocked.

“She would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush.” He does not say that she would not have pushed him if he’d been white, but that she would not have pushed him if they’d been in his neck of Brooklyn. Why? “Because she would be afraid.” Afraid of what? Of getting her head kicked in, presumably. Something about the way Coates contemplates this possibility suggests that, for all his protestations, he quite likes the idea that other people’s lives should be hemmed in by this kind of “penalty.” Maybe virtue without terror is impotent after all. “In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage,” Coates writes. I will stack America’s ideological heritage against his any day, in any measurement he chooses—but most especially in bodies destroyed.

Donald Trump is the GOP’s Black Lives Matter,"After reading most of the “Donald Trump is the Republican’s Bernie Sanders” think pieces from the last week, I am left believing that the analogy is fundamentally flawed. The basic notion is that both Sanders and Trump represent the angry and unpredictable wings of their respective parties. This is doubtless true of Trump, but is it true of Sanders? It probably isn’t. In fact, Donald Trump is more similar to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, in theory and in practice, than he is to Sanders in several important ways.

The clearest similarity between Trump and BLM is the havoc they might cause in the general election. A Trump third-party run could destroy the GOP nominee; likewise, a significant drop in black support and turnout could doom any Democrat. Both Trump and BLM are very aware that they hold these cards, and both are playing them effectively.

Bernie Sanders is a career politician who will be a good soldier come the convention and the general election. He will make a stirring speech, in which he praises the moderate as the only sensible choice. He will stump for the nominee and his supporters will go with him. Sanders is playing a very traditional role in national Democratic politics. One played by Dean, Bradley, and Tsongas in the past. Trump is not playing that role, nor is BLM, neither of which have committed to supporting either party’s eventual candidate.

Tensions Between Trump Supporters And The GOP Base Are Escalating

This fear that a vital presidential election could be undermined is resulting in an increasingly nasty tension between mainstream supporters of the GOP and Trump supporters. This tension isnmirrored on the Left by stalwart Democrats and BLM activists. There is no such tension between Sanders and Clinton supporters. Sanders isn’t going to cause hurt feelings. Trump and BLM already have.

Part of the difficulty for both party establishments is that Trump and BLM are very light on policy and heavy on emotional appeals.

Mending these wounds won’t be easy on either side. How far will the GOP go to accommodate Trump and his loud loyalists? How willing will the Democrats be to run a national election centered on BLM’s demands to destroy white supremacy?

Part of the difficulty for both party establishments is that Trump and BLM are very light on policy and heavy on emotional appeals. Both focus on how broken our country is. For Trump it’s “the American dream is dead,” for BLM it’s “the country is based on and steeped in white supremacy.” As many have pointed out, Trump’s appeal is based on burning down the establishment. So is BLM’s. In both cases this can lead to a hopelessness among their supporters that is poisonous to the positive message presidential candidates must pronounce.

There is a long time until Election Day, but right now it is difficult to see hardline Trump supporters embracing Bush or Rubio. BLM activists don’t seem much closer to closing ranks with Clinton or Sanders. There are two essential demographics in play here.

For Republicans, the working class, white male was the missing link in 2012. It is a segment of the population that the GOP must motivate more effectively than Romney did. This group is Trump’s bread and butter. For the Obama-era Democratic coalition, black turnout made the difference between presidential victories and midterm congressional shellackings. Right now, BLM has enormous sway over this group.

It is the direct appeal to these respective demographic groups that scares the party establishments. Swaying independents is meaningless for both sides if they fail to secure these key blocs. That’s why right now both primaries are being driven by these non-traditional political forces.

No Republican candidate can avoid being asked about Trump, and all must respond to his wild, off-the-cuff rhetoric. While this gives them the chance to appear level-headed and reasonable, it also sucks the oxygen out of the campaign. No other Republican has been able to bring forth the issues and agendas they want to talk about. As for Clinton, Sanders, and O’Malley, each has been made to kowtow to a radical black social and political movement in ways that, for obvious reasons, President Obama is immune to.

Both Are Using Racist Rhetoric

The final, and very important link between Trump and BLM is the over-the-top racial rhetoric employed by both. Trump’s recent statements about Mexican immigrants and past comments about blacks would disqualify any other GOP candidate. In fact, among the majority of voters in both parties it probably already has.

But for Trump supporters, his racist comments are a big part of his appeal.

But for Trump supporters, his racist comments are a big part of his appeal. Every time Trump asserts that political correctness is the biggest problem facing the country, his supporters and everyone else know exactly what he means.

For the relatively small number of white voters who feel that the pendulum of racial justice has swung too far, Trump is a champion. His candidacy promises not only to staunch the flow of brown people into the United States, but to give cover to white racial grievance in general.

BLM is playing almost exactly the same role in the Democratic primary. Hijacking a Bernie Sanders rally and telling thousands of Seattle’s most progressive, white people that they are racist sends a very similar message. BLM accuses Democrats of failing to accept that our country’s biggest problem is white supremacy. Trump is telling his supporters, and the electorate at large, that the country has gone to hell. BLM is telling them it always has been hell. In both cases, race and ethnicity are central to the message.

How Much More Damage Will We See?

How each party handles these movements and mollifies their supporters will go a long way towards determining their success in 2016. At the moment neither side seems to have a handle on exactly how to do this. We are seeing very different tactics being applied.

BLM isn’t going anywhere. The question is how much damage will they continue to do.

Trump has become an object of scorn, not only to several fellow candidates but to the traditional conservative establishment and news media. The attacks have not been subtle, but most of Trump’s supporters are not tucking in with a mellow Shiraz and perusing National Review. The post-debate spat with Megyn Kelly appears to have been more damaging. She is a familiar and appealing face to some Trump supporters and agnostics (if there are any).

It is not unreasonable for the GOP establishment to believe that a few more moments like this may do enough harm to neutralize him. And one big advantage they have is that Trump is not a social movement, he is a cult of personality. Once he is gone he will be gone, off getting his mug in the tabloids some other way. Some of his supporters might take their ball and go home, refusing to support the nominee, but most will likely see the chance at Republican control over congress and the Presidency as too good to pass up.

In the short term, the Democrats have an easier task with BLM. Scolding them is not an option for anyone. For a white, Democratic candidate, lecturing black people on the proper way to secure social justice is approximately the equivalent of having a Confederate flag tattoo. The central theme of today’s liberal approach to race is that whites must listen more and talk less. But as a presidential candidate, eventually you have to talk. Proxies, such as Obama and Sen. Corey Booker, can be useful, but the candidates themselves will have to start adopting some of the language and policies of BLM. In many ways they already have.

In the longer term this becomes a dangerous play for Democrats. Outside of the urban enclaves of progressive elites and the downtrodden, a campaign centered on destroying white supremacy could be a very, very tough sell. At some point the BLM movement is going to have to make the choice that Occupy Wall Street never did. It will have to endorse a candidate and policies that represent a compromise. Traditionally, such moderation has not been a hallmark of progressive movements.

Donald Trump and BLM have both risen to prominence as a result of unique circumstances. The former, from an overpopulated and disjointed Republican field, the latter from increased attention on government violence towards blacks.

The GOP field will contract, and as it does Trump will become more isolated. The question is whether the damage will have already been done. BLM isn’t going anywhere. The question is how much damage will they continue to do.

Hillary To ‘Black Lives Matter’ Activists: Maybe I’ll Just Talk To White People,"Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement finally got some face time with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and things did not go well. Footage from the conversation, which took place in New Hampshire on August 11, was finally released late Monday night and shows Hillary getting testy with the black activists.

“The piece that’s most important, and I stand here in your space and I say this as respectfully as I can,” Julius Jones, one of the activists, said to Hillary Clinton, “but if you don’t tell black people what we need to do, then we won’t tell you all what you need to do.”

“Well, I’m not telling you,” Clinton responded. “I’m just telling you to tell me.”

“What I mean to say is that this is and has always been a white problem of violence,” Jones continued. “There’s not much that we can do [as black people] to stop the violence against us.”

That’s when the conversation got awkward.

“Respectfully, if that is your position, then I will talk only to white people about how we are going to deal with the very real problems,” Clinton snapped back, eliciting a wide-eyed look of horror from Daunasia Yancey, the founder of Black Lives Matter in Boston who was standing directly to Hillary Clinton’s left.

“That’s not why I mean. That’s not what I mean. That’s not what I mean,” Jones told Clinton. “What you just said is a form of victim blaming. You were saying what the Black Lives Matter movement needs to do to change white hearts is–”

“Look, I don’t believe you change hearts,” Clinton shot back. “I believe you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate. You’re not going to change every heart. You’re not.”

Jones talked about his encounter with Clinton during an MSNBC appearance on Monday night. Jones said Clinton’s emphasis on policy change was interesting given her role in setting up mass incarceration policy in the U.S.

“She doesn’t actually believe you can change hearts in the United States and that the way to effect change is through systemic change. And at the same time she was also ducking personal responsibility for the role that her and her family played in it, too,” Jones told host Melissa Harris-Parry. “She doesn’t actually feel like you can move this issue forward other than through policy even though the policy mistakes that she and the Clintons made got us in large degree to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration.”

Hillary has also repeatedly called for more police & tougher prison sentences. #HollupHillary http://t.co/6XXb5Olpsn pic.twitter.com/FVuUwjw0iD — BlackLivesMatterBOS (@BLM_Boston) August 18, 2015

Why ‘Black Lives Matter’ Isn’t Going To Fix Our Problems,"If I were Hillary Clinton I would have begged the Secret Service just to get a little lazy one day, and allow Black Lives Matter to take over a speaking engagement. How hard can it be to look solemn and concerned while uninvited guests pontificate? Let them say their bit, and then thank them for sharing what’s in their hearts. Make some vague reference to forming a committee. Be sure not to say anything about valuing all lives, because that just makes you a total jerk-wad.

Off-script isn’t Hillary’s style, as we all know. But she couldn’t put off Black Lives Matter forever, so she offered to have a heart-to-heart with a select group of activists. Now the whole nation gets to watch as she wrangles with activists Julius Jones and Daunasia Yancey over the question: does anybody here have an idea what to do about, you know, anything?

Black Lives Matter is admittedly a little agenda-lite. Though their website does have a list of demands, keeping it updated obviously hasn’t been a priority. (Good news, though! You won’t have to scroll to read them all.) It’s unsurprising that the conversation with Hillary largely foundered over the issue of whether it’s wrong for a white woman to advise black activists to explain what, on a level of policy, they actually want.

I too am a white woman, but I’m going to go a bit further than Clinton. I’ve drawn up a practical agenda for Black Lives Matter, which would be beneficial to impoverished minorities nationwide. My advice? Pack it in.

Black Lives Matter Is A Blunt Instrument

There are real problems with our justice system, but Black Lives Matter isn’t going to fix them. It’s a blunt instrument, where precision tools are needed. It specializes in making an impact by flinging selected incidents into the public eye. But that strategy is of limited value in addressing the real problems of black Americans; indeed, it is far more likely to do harm. A prudent policy initiative is unlikely to take root in the shadow of Black Lives Matter’s surging indignation. (Note how many times Jones and Clinton fret over how everyone in the conversation is “feeling”.) Blunt force trauma can be an effective tool for stopping a zombie, but if you’re attempting open heart surgery, a meat mallet isn’t what you need.

Blunt force trauma can be an effective tool for stopping a zombie, but if you’re attempting open heart surgery, a meat mallet isn’t what you need.

Angry people are hard to placate, and in this case, the anger is understandable. In American cities today, blacks are disproportionately incarcerated and shot by the police. They are also disproportionately criminal. And they are disproportionately victimized by criminals. It’s actually somewhat remarkable that the same demographic could be on the unhappy end of law enforcement in almost every possible way.

If you look at the problem from that angle, and maybe squint just a little, you can almost see how it would make sense to suppose that our justice system is actually designed as a mechanism for keeping the black man down. After all, if the purpose of all this punishing “justice” were to secure public safety, wouldn’t you expect urban neighborhoods to be safe? Instead they are awash in drugs and crime. And didn’t we just “go to war with” and “get tough on” those things?

It’s puzzling. I don’t blame Black Lives Matter for being suspicious when politicians pledge their goodwill.

Want Less Violent Death? Hire More Police.

Black Lives Matters regularly reminds us that young, black men are being gunned down in in the streets. This is true. But most of the time, it’s not a policeman who pulls the trigger. Homicide is the leading cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34.

Black Lives Matter has responded to the situation by calling for “a decrease in law-enforcement spending at the local, state and federal levels.” That would make sense if the police were actually an instrument of class oppression, but in the real world, it will mean more violent death.

White privilege, of the most offensive kind, has indeed contributed to the creation a toxic, violence-riddled urban culture.

This doesn’t need to degenerate into a kindergarten-level blame game. Of course, young men should not kill each other, but the fact that they do reflects badly on many people, and also on the system as a whole. America has something of a grim “tradition” of winking at black homicide, extending back to post-Reconstruction South when (as William Stuntz documents in his authoritative book on criminal justice) blacks who killed other blacks were rarely prosecuted or even pursued by the justice system. Similar cultural attitudes prevailed when Southern blacks started migrating in large numbers to the major cities. So long as black violence remained a localized phenomenon, elite whites weren’t greatly bothered about it. White privilege, of the most offensive kind, has indeed contributed to the creation a toxic, violence-riddled urban culture.

Poor blacks have paid the price for this indifference, as Jill Leovy illustrates in her gripping book, Ghettoside. In the absence of real law enforcement, Leovy argues, a reckless kind of honor culture tends to spring up, and young men embrace violence as a substitute for true order. This can easily spawn a vicious cycle; residents increasingly see the police as ineffectual, so their willingness to cooperate goes down. Few detectives will persist in the face of so many obstacles, and the incentives to do so are minimal. No one cares about the young, anonymous victims of “gang violence”. No one, that is, except the countless poor families that have been devastated by the scourge of urban homicide.

How Much Do Black Lives Matter, Again?

When police forces are large, both crime and incarceration rates drop. This is a reasonably consistent statistical trend across multiple decades and regions. If we want to atone for past mistakes, and affirm the value of black life, we should spurn the advice of Black Lives Matter and hire more policemen.

Black Lives Matter is hardly giving the police force the kind of profile it would need to attract that talent.

Of course it is also important to structure the police force properly, giving support to good detectives and ensuring that cops use their time appropriately. When the Justice Department investigated the Ferguson PD, they found substantial evidence of bureaucratic pressure to generate revenue through tickets and citations. Viewed through the lens of Ferguson’s ransacked streets, it seems obvious that these priorities were tragically misplaced. Yes, we want people to respect the law. But if policemen in poor neighborhoods aren’t clearing murders, and are issuing scores of tickets and fines, is it any wonder the residents become antagonistic?

There are some racist cops in America, and sometimes they abuse their power. Black Lives Matter specializes in drawing the public’s attention to this phenomenon. (Of course it’s telling that they made their name on a case in which the evidence didn’t support their narrative. Do activists appreciate the irony of using frenzied media-mobs to persecute individuals before the facts have been gathered?) But before we bury the police under piles of restrictions, we should consider. What kinds of people are likely to end up on the force if it becomes a miserable, hyper-regulated job that nobody respects? By contrast, what sort of people do we need if we want to see crimes solved? Good detectives need to be smart, dedicated and tough. Black Lives Matter is hardly giving the police force the kind of profile it would need to attract that talent.

Before packing up, perhaps Black Lives Matter should consider apologizing to Darren Wilson for unjustifiably ruining his life. One way to value black life would be by assuring good cops that America has their backs, as they protect the people who are most at risk.

Wanted: A Justice System That Pursues Justice

After crime, there is punishment. Mass incarceration has become the other major issue on the agenda of Black Lives Matter. Why are so many black men incarcerated? What can we do to get them back home with their families?

One thing we could do, of course, is just open the gates and let the captives free. If indeed (following the logic of the “New Jim Crow”) our penal system exists primarily for purposes of racially-based class oppression, that is exactly what we should do. Realistically, though, most people are in prison for a reason. Even if that reason doesn’t always justify incarceration, it would be foolhardy in the extreme to start freeing inmates en masse.

Quite often, the system is “efficient” in exactly the place it should not be.

What young men need is fathers, and that problem predates the surge in black incarceration. Looking at the system itself, though, what is really needed is stability. A system of law and order ought to leave the public with a sense of order. Ours is too moody, which is partly why people don’t trust it.

As Stuntz shows, our justice system suffers from a kind of bipolar disorder. Looking over the last century we can see that it has at times been too lenient, while at other times it is too harsh. How much time you serve for dealing drugs or offing your housemate will vary widely, depending on the year in which your malfeasance occurs. And, to be sure, other should-be-irrelevant factors may also come into play. Race can be one. Age, income, sex and education level might also make a difference in how you fare, once you find yourself in the belly of the legal beast. For instance, it’s a bad idea to get yourself arrested if you happen to be too poor to afford bail and a defense attorney. The dispossessed have a hard time navigating the ins and outs of our technocratic legal machine.

Clearly, these are not good justifications for denying people careful attention in bureaucratic decisions that will change the course of their whole lives. But mistakes happen, and one reason they do is because the court system is so overloaded. Neither public defenders nor district attorneys can afford to linger too long over a particular case. No doubt this will come as an absolute shock to Federalist readers, but overworked bureaucrats don’t always display perfect prudence and unimpeachable integrity.

Lady Justice is meant to be blind. Black Lives Matter would have us fix her by donning black-tinted glasses.

Quite often, the system is “efficient” in exactly the place it should not be: pressuring poorly-represented detainees into accepting plea bargains without a thorough investigation of the facts. Stuntz also notes that while policing and courts are generally funded locally, the state picks up the tab for incarceration. Our prison system may be hugely burdensome for taxpayers, but for a local bureaucrat, there’s a fiendish logic to pressing for quick, lightly-investigated convictions.

These are all significant problems, and the list continues. Our penal system could do more to reduce recidivism and help people go straight. Better addiction treatment programs, combined with smarter sentencing, might enable more convicts to pull their lives together and become productive citizens. Some states are already working on this, with encouraging results. Saving money on incarceration might enable us to improve our policing and our courts.

Beat Your Sledge-Hammers Into Scalpels

It’s understandable that poor blacks are frustrated with our justice system. To make things better, however, we have to be realistic about the actual problems. The system needs surgery, not a full frontal assault. Nothing will be fixed with a sledge-hammer like Black Lives Matter.

If politicians are pressured into making some grand, sweeping gestures in the name of racial justice, it’s quite unlikely that we will end up with a system focused on criminal justice. That of course is what our nation actually needs, especially for the sake of impoverished minorities, who suffer the most from widespread lawlessness.

Lady Justice is meant to be blind. Black Lives Matter would have us fix her by donning black-tinted glasses. Does that sound like an effective strategy?

"No, Black Lives Matter Isn’t About Hurting Cops","Remember when the media punditry swore the Tea Party was driven by secret racism? Remember how people reported racist signs at Tea Party rallies and protests? Remember how the punditry tried to connect the Tea Party with Jared Lee Loughner when he shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six people?

Now we hear that the Black Lives Matter movement is also racist, “promotes the execution of police officers,” as one commentator put it, and has racist or violent signage. Bill O’Reilly boldly declared it a “hate group.” Now some in the media have also implied the Black Lives Matter movement may be to blame for the murder of a Texas police officer, Darren Goforth.

Pundits on the Left who tried to dismiss the Tea Party as a mere racist Republican reaction to a black president were misguided. Those on the Right who chalk up the growing momentum behind Black Lives Matter to racism or a desire to hurt cops are making the same mistake. Black Lives Matter’s main point is to draw attention to police misconduct and the lack of police accountability—particularly as it disproportionately affects black Americans. This is a goal that libertarians, conservatives, liberals, and progressives should care about.

This Is Called the Part to Whole Fallacy

BLM activists’ proposed policy reforms include curbing the excessive use of police force, demilitarization, use of police body cameras, ending racial profiling and “stop and frisk” tactics, addressing over-criminalization, and improving training for police officers. Can reasonable people quibble over the particulars of BLM’s policy platform? Sure. But you don’t have to agree with every policy idea some activists propose to appreciate the main goal of the movement.

You don’t have to agree with every policy idea some activists propose to appreciate the main goal of the movement.

Instead of focusing on BLM’s primary purpose, many in the media have applied the words of some activists to the entire movement or erroneously connected unrelated violent events to BLM—just like some news organizations did with the Tea Party.

For instance, commentators often point to some Minneapolis BLM activists who chanted “pigs in a blanket, fry em’ like bacon” as evidence that the entire movement wants to harm cops. Also, although no evidence connects the tragic killing of Goforth to the BLM movement, pundits have blamed it nonetheless.

In reaction to this labeling of BLM as racist and violent, Fox News contributor and talk radio host Richard Fowler told Fox’s Megyn Kelly: “I don’t think we’re watching the same Black Lives Matter movement. I think if you talk to any of the organizers on the ground, both in Ferguson, in Baltimore, and New York, they will tell you they’re a nonviolent movement. That all they want to do is end the disparities.”

Decentralized Movements Represent a Spectrum

What many fail to realize is that social movements are decentralized heterogeneous coalitions—meaning that different types of people can be drawn to the same movement, sometimes for different reasons. One shouldn’t label an entire movement by the comments and actions of just a few activists—as Fox News contributor Mary Katherine Ham rightfully pointed out. The key is identifying the glue that holds the movement together. In my dissertation on the Tea Party movement, I found several distinct clusters of Tea Partiers, with racial anxieties motivating only a minority slice. But by and large, the overwhelming majority really was about small government.

Different types of people can be drawn to the same movement, sometimes for different reasons.

The same applies to Black Lives Matter: it’s a decentralized movement in which the central thrust focuses on police abuse in the United States, particularly as it disproportionately affects African-Americans.

We—all Americans—should listen to Black Lives Matter. Reform is needed. Surely, this is not just about racial prejudice. Police abuse and lack of accountability affect people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, as white Michigan resident Deven Guilford would tell you if he hadn’t been killed by a cop after flashing his high beams at a police vehicle. At the same time, we should be capable of recognizing that justice in this country is not yet applied without regard to race (i.e., see here), and we should applaud efforts to move society in the right direction.

Conservative pundits balked when some of their colleagues on the Left smeared the Tea Party as a racist movement instead of recognizing it as an effort to reign in big government. They would now do well to take a long, hard look in the mirror with respect to their own coverage of the Black Lives Matter movement and recognize it as an opportunity to make change for the better.

The Contradiction Of Claiming Samus Aran Is Trans,"Transgendered game developer Brianna Wu recently caused something of a stir in the gaming community with his transparent attempt to transform his Tumblr headcanon into reality. I speak of his article, “Metroid’s Samus Aran is a Trans-Woman. Deal With It.” It garnered several well-written rebuttals, with two highlights being Brandon Morse at this very site, and a piece by Anthony Lee at Techraptor.

I have no intention of trying to one-up their thorough demolitions of Wu’s factual claim. Rather, I want to delve a bit into the fascinating philosophical biases that Wu, otherwise known as John Flynt, displays in his follow-up article, “Well, That Escalated Quickly: A Samus Followup.”

That post is probably the most blatant piece of nerd baiting since Gawker’s official pronouncement that playing “Magic: The Gathering” makes you undatable. Consider this passage, where Wu rebuts what is probably the most common argument against his claim:

The most harmful, damaging argument by far is that by claiming Samus is a transgender woman, I am somehow taking away her legacy as a strong female character. This, put bluntly, is blatantly transphobic and terrible. Cisgender women do not have a monopoly on the female perspective. Neither do white women or straight women.

Yesterday, Idris Elba was trending because many white people were unable to see him as James Bond. Clearly, if you can’t imagine Bond as a black person, you have unconscious bias against black people. Similarly, if you can’t imagine Samus as a transgender woman, you have unconscious bias against transgender women.

The heading on this section is: “Transgender women are women, period,” but Wu’s actual argument does everything it can to undermine that idea.

Male Genitalia Is Now Considered a Birth Defect

Let’s accept that the heading is correct, and men who choose to undergo surgery to approximate biological femininity actually have been women all along. If that is so, then we face an interesting question: If women are women, regardless of sex assigned at birth (as Wu posits), then the surgical transformation would be a mere formality that brings the body into conformity with the person’s natural state. In other words, according to this line of argument, being born with the wrong set of genitals is essentially a birth defect.

We don’t speak of people who have cleft palette surgery as ‘jaw-conforming.’

How do we talk about people who have had birth defects corrected by surgery? Well, we don’t speak of people born with extra limbs who’ve had them removed as “trans-two armers.” We don’t speak of people who have cleft palette surgery as “jaw-conforming.” We certainly don’t insist on people who’ve had tumors removed as being “de-tumored persons.”

The reason is fairly obvious: In all of these cases, we recognize precisely what Wu’s heading suggests—that the “birth defect” does not reflect on the person’s essential qualities. So just as a person born with a cleft palette is still a person, even before the palette is fixed, a woman born with superfluous genitals is still a woman even before the genitals are removed. In short: a woman is a woman is a woman, whatever abnormal features she might have had at birth.

But if this is true, then here’s a simple question: Who cares if Samus Aran is specifically a transgendered woman? It’s not like we’re talking about a case like Quasimodo in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” or Erik in “The Phantom of the Opera,” where a character’s inborn physical abnormality defines how he or she relates to the world.

In the Metroid universe, Samus passes as a physical woman any time she needs to, and the rest of the universe relates to her as such. If you accept the theory that transgendered women are indistinguishable from women who are born that way, being transgender adds absolutely no content to Samus Aran as a character.

Either Trans Women Are Different Or They Aren’t

I say if you accept that theory because, on the strength of the evidence, Wu clearly does not. Consider his point that “cisgender women do not have a monopoly on the female perspective [and] neither do white women or straight women.”

Being white or straight is immutable, whereas inborn biological sex, according to most trans people, is not.

Right away, you should be able to spot that one of these things is not like the other. True, race can be faked by the likes of Shaun King and Rachel Dolezal, but once exposed, we all know that these people are fakes. Similarly, light-skinned blacks who “pass” as white are universally acknowledged to be biologically black, even if they choose to adopt all the cultural markers of whiteness.

Similarly, sexual orientation seems difficult to fake, and when a person previously thought to be straight “comes out” as gay, the presumption is that they are simply acknowledging biological reality rather than altering it. Put bluntly, being white or straight is immutable, whereas inborn biological sex, according to most trans people, is not.

Furthermore, to get to Wu’s second point about Elba being potentially the first black James Bond, the rationale for a black Bond is far clearer than the rationale for a trans Samus Aran. That is, James Bond is a role model to many, and the reason people care about creating role models for non-white or non-straight people is because those traits are immutable, and might permanently alter one’s perspective on the world in a way they cannot shed. Creating distinctive role models for them is, therefore, a way of acknowledging their common humanity. Cosmetic features, like fashion choices or surgically altered disfigurements, are accorded much less moral weight.

Most transgendered women don’t seek to be viewed as immutably different from their cisgendered counterparts.

However, most transgendered women don’t seek to be viewed as immutably different from their cisgendered counterparts. Quite the opposite. In fact, if Samus Aran were a real person, Wu’s writing an article “outing” her as born male would probably be seen as extremely unethical, precisely because the transgendered community believes her inborn genitalia are an irrelevance compared with the psychological reality of who she is. Yet Wu wants to be seen as a radically pro-trans writer for outing Samus because it’s a slap against the “monopoly” cisgendered women hold on the female experience.

But if this slap is needed, then in Wu’s world that must mean there is something immutably different about transgendered women. They’re not just cisgendered women born with birth defects that prevent their true gender from being acknowledged. They’re different from cisgendered women in the same way black women are different from white women, or lesbian women are different from straight women. But if there is a difference between “transgendered women” and “cisgendered women” that we’re bound to respect as a moral matter, that seems to destroy the entire philosophical basis for gender revisionism in the first place.

The Point Is to Destroy Womanhood

What immutable characteristic can they claim? True, transwomen and transmen can’t conceive children, but if sterility is an immutable trait of the transgendered, then every man who gets a vasectomy, and every woman who gets her tubes tied, is becoming “trans.” This is obviously absurd, which leaves only the fact of having been born with the wrong genitals. But if this does somehow make you inextricably different from inborn women, then inborn sex organs clearly do matter. A few people I went to college with openly acknowledged this reality, and claimed there were actually five genders: male, female, transwoman, transman, and agender.

Isn’t the surgery implicitly a sign of shame in the same way a black person dying his or her skin white would be?

But if this “different gender” theory is true, then why pretend to be a woman, to the point of surgically altering yourself to be indistinguishable from one, in the first place? Why not call yourself a crossdresser, or a transsexual, or (heaven forfend), a tomgirl? In fact, isn’t the surgery implicitly a sign of shame in the same way a black person dying his or her skin white would be?

I’ve played dumb thus far, but the reason for Wu’s attempt to use the “cis” and “trans” prefixes as weasel words to claim bigotry is bloody obvious. It is, in fact, an attempt to render the entire idea of womanhood incoherent, so Wu can have his victim cake and eat it, too. Whatever he might say about his detractors, in being so stubbornly insistent that Samus Aran has to be transgendered, it is he who is revealing a failure of imagination.

Imagine a Muslim stating that, even though he had experienced religious persecution, he could not identify with Shylock in “Merchant of Venice” unless Shylock was reinterpreted to be Muslim rather than Jewish. We would recognize this as a bigoted failure of imagination. So, too, is Wu’s inability to see anything identifiable in a cisgendered woman who has also been assumed to be male, simply because she (Samus) had the gall to be born female, rather than made that way by surgical edict. Indeed, Wu’s loathing and resentment for the cisgendered and their “monopoly” comes through loud and clear in both his articles, not least of all in his contemptuous injunction to readers to “deal with” Samus’ alleged transgender status. In fact, a more honest version of his first headline might be: “Metroid’s Samus Aran is our character. Deal with it.”

Let me be quite clear. I have written articles defending the transgendered community in the past, but that was motivated by a belief that the argument that one is transgendered boils down to an acquiescence in the face of a higher natural order—in this case, psychological or neuroscientific reality. If it is, instead, used as Wu is doing—to appropriate not just certain female characters, but to discredit the entire concept of femininity—then I think it deserves no sympathy from anyone.

Metroid’s Samus Aran remains canonically a born woman. She remains a role model for millions of girls. If some people born male happen to identify with her as well, it’s of no concern to me, but that identification must be born from the belief that Samus is a woman, and that they, too, seek to be included as women. Not, as Brianna Wu is, as victim complexes in search of a cause.

Planned Parenthood’s ‘Vital’ Work Means Killing Black Babies,"Planned Parenthood will hold a press conference today talking about the “vital” work the nation’s largest abortion provider has done for African-Americans. The organization says it wants to highlight the “vital reproductive and sexual health care services” it provides to black women.

The sad irony is that Planned Parenthood’s “vital” work includes targeting black lives to terminate in the womb.

African-Americans make up 13.2 percent of the U.S. population, yet they account for 30 percent of all abortions. A closer look at Planned Parenthood clinic locations reveals that the abortion provider tends to cluster its offices in low-income zip codes or areas that have a high minority population.

About 50 percent of Planned Parenthood’s patients are enrolled in Medicaid. To put that in context, about 1 in 5 people are enrolled in Medicaid nationwide, which means that most of the people who visit Planned Parenthood are these 20 percent who rely on federal funds to pay for their health care. The disproportionate number of low-income patients and the high number of black abortions make it clear that Planned Parenthood deliberately targets for abortion the children of low-income, minority women.

It’s no surprise that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was a huge advocate for eugenics and wanted to discourage those who she deemed as “unfit” from reproducing. She pushed contraceptives and abortions onto minorities and low-income families in order to slow their birth rates. She was also a guest speaker for the Ku Klux Klan and a fanatical supporter of Nazi sterilization laws.

Recently, a group of black pastors spoke out against Sanger and asked the Smithsonian to remove her bust from the museum’s “Struggle For Justice” exhibit in the National Portrait Gallery:

Ironically, Sanger’s bust is featured in the NPG’s ‘Struggle for Justice’ exhibit, alongside two of America’s most celebrated and authentic champions of equal rights – Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. If Sanger had her way, MLK and Rosa Parks would not have been born.

Though the museum agreed that some of her views are “controversial” and that her affiliations to the eugenics movement “raises questions,” they deemed her likeness worthy of remaining on display. If Sanger could see the impact that Planned Parenthood made in slowing down black birth rates, she would undoubtedly be proud of the organization she founded.

Planned Parenthood’s work is indeed “vital” to the black community, but in the worst way possible. They’re targeting black women and keeping them dependent on abortion-on-demand to fulfill their contraceptive needs. Planned Parenthood is killing black babies at a higher rate than any other race in the U.S., which certainly seems to fulfill the goal of their racist founder to minimize the black population.

The press conference is occurring on the eve of a major congressional oversight hearing, which will investigate how Planned Parenthood spends the $450 million it receives from taxpayers each year. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, is scheduled to testify as a witness.

Let White Parents Embarrass Themselves On YouTube,"We’ve all seen these videos. White parents sing a parody version of a popular rap song and alter the lyrics to highlight the triumphs and trials of raising a family. Admittedly, they can be sometimes painful to watch. There’s something about the mashup of two very different worlds: rap culture and middle-class white families that make us laugh. We laugh half out of amusement and half out of embarrassment for them.

Recently, they’ve come under attack as perpetuating contemporary blackface. In a piece for Salon, Sarah Watts lambasts these YouTubing parents:

But as a white woman, it would be tone-deaf of me to assume that there’s nothing problematic about me taking a black person’s lived experience and making it cutesy and palatable for a mostly-white audience. Snoop Dogg’s “Gin and Juice” isn’t about Trick or Treating with his family; the song is about Snoop’s teen days in Long Beach, which belong to him — warts and all. De-contextualizing his music and obscuring the history behind it is a form of erasure and, let’s be honest here, a form of racism. Similarly, adopting the mannerisms, dress, and slang of black artists, like the white rappers in popular YouTube parenting raps — that’s racism as well. It’s little better than contemporary blackface.

The video that she takes aim at is by the Holderness Family, of #XmasJammies fame. One of their more recent videos is their own version of LMFAO’s “Party Anthem,” and it pokes fun at helicopter parenting. Set in a park, parents are filmed hovering over their children with hand sanitizer and tissues. They’ve swapped out the words to better fit the comic situation. “Everyday I’m hustlin’,” now becomes: “everyday I’m hoverin’,” as a mom is filmed slathering sunscreen on her child’s face.

While Watts is right that de-contextualizing art can be a form of erasure, the fame from the videos within the “White Parents Parody” genre has yet to eclipse the fame of the original songs. In fact, it’s probably had the opposite effect from what Watts describes. These videos introduce songs to people who otherwise may have never heard them. My own parents, who laugh and repeatedly share these videos on Facebook, will often Google the original song being parodied and listen to it all the way through, while comparing the differences between the two versions. Exposing people like my parents to a different culture through silly parody videos isn’t a bad thing. Nor does it erase the value of the original work.

The song that the Copter Mommy video parodies isn’t a story of struggle or oppression. It’s not an anthem about Snoop Dogs struggle in Long Beach. It’s about partying in a club:

Party rock is in this house tonight



Everybody just have a good time



And we gonna make you lose your mind […]



We just wanna see you, shake that!

Covering up these words with a tale of how overly protective parents are stifling the development of their children isn’t drowning out a message of black struggle. In fact, it takes a silly song about partying in a club and uses it to highlight problematic parenting behaviors.

Watts goes on:

It might seem like a stretch to compare something that’s meant to be clean fun to something as insidious as blackface. But surprisingly, a lot of the same elements of blackface performance are actually at play in videos like “I’m a Mom,” “Parent Rap,” “Dad Life,” and the ever-popular “#Xmas Jammies” that went ridiculously viral at the end of 2013. According to Eric Lott, author of “Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class,” blackface is defined as a practice in which white people “caricature blacks for sport and profit.” In all of these videos, white people not only imitate black vernacular (using phrases like “errday,” “hizzle,” “stone cold player,” and “you best get ready,”) but they also borrow mannerisms typically seen in gangsta rap videos.

Watts’s assessment that these parents are imitating characteristics commonly associated with black culture, particularly with rappers, is true. However this isn’t an example of blackface.

Historically, blackface was used to minimize black people in theater and film by portraying them in an exaggeratedly ridiculous manner. Black actors were commonly denied access to the stage unless they were painted in blackface makeup, or white actors would replace black ones altogether and paint themselves in grease and burnt cork in order to appear black.

These videos aren’t barring black entertainers from the bandwidth of YouTube, nor are they mocking blacking people. They’re mocking themselves. Yes, they mimic characteristics of most rap videos, but it’s clear that their intentions aren’t to make fun of other cultures. The whole point of their videos is to show how ridiculous their own culture is. Protecting your child from the dangers of the monkey bars seems even more insane when contrasted with the easygoing nature of the “Party Rock Anthem” that the video is set to.

Let white parents embarrass themselves on YouTube. It’s good for us all.

It’s Time For Republicans To Chase Black Voters,"Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Jason Riley argued this week that Republicans need to seize the moment and develop an agenda to court black voters. Riley’s plan is ambitious, and he knows it: he hopes to get 20 to 25 percent of the black vote for the next Republican nominee. Is that expectation ludicrous? Maybe not.

Hillary Clinton is struggling. Bernie Sanders is rising, but he hasn’t yet been successful in solidifying the black portion of the party’s base. After eight years with a black family in the White House, it seems reasonable to suppose black voters have seen the best the Democratic Party has to offer them. Pretty crummy party, eh?

Black voters have not prospered under the Obama administration. They are more broke and unemployed than ever. Is it really futile to make the case that we can do better?

Courting the black vote could pay great political dividends. It’s also the right thing to do, and the pitch will be most successful coming from a candidate who understands why. There are three excellent reasons to court black voters more aggressively. First, we might pick up some votes! Second, even modest gains on this front will throw Democrats into a panic. Third, a positive message about race would likely appeal to many whites, especially coming on the heels of the angry and polarizing rhetoric of Donald Trump.

We Can Win Black Voters

Republicans are used to assuming black voters will overwhelmingly favor the Democrats. They don’t expect support from that quarter. It stands to reason, then, that anything they can get will be a gain.

Liberals have a bad habit of appeasing their own need for racial righteousness at the expense of actual, living minorities who get trapped in a dependent underclass.

But, truthfully, it really isn’t hard to argue that conservatives are better equipped to help minorities thrive. Black intellectuals like Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, and Jason Riley have been making the case for a long time, and their argument is powerful. While rhetorical dandies like Ta-Nehisi Coates delight elite progressives with their soulful despair, black conservatives can explain how the grim conditions in predominantly black regions are mostly the evil fruit of failed paternalistic policies. Progressive liberals have a bad habit of appeasing their own need for racial righteousness at the expense of actual, living minorities who get trapped in a dependent underclass.

Coates’ most recent book makes the contrast of perspectives particularly stark. As he sees it, the problems with our society are basically cosmic and there’s not much we can do about them except weep. Soulfully. (We may also be able to give a half-hearted endorsement of some pie-in-the-sky symbolic gestures such as “reparations.”) You can see why this would appeal to liberals. It’s more comfortable to agree that the problem is cosmic than to survey our 50-year-old Great Society and say, “Guys, we seriously screwed this up.”

Surely the pitch is worth making.

To figures like Riley and Sowell, the problem is neither cosmic nor insoluble. Bad policy has spurred a hideous wave of social breakdown. Better policy might help reverse those trends, and we can articulate what those policies should be. Reform the welfare system, and do away with racial quotas in education and employment. Improve policing in high-crime areas and make sensible, prudent reforms to our penal system (as conservative states are already doing). Most importantly, pursue the kind of economic agenda that would open jobs and opportunities for everyone.

Who do you want to support, black voters? A party that has so despaired of improvement that they’re singing dirges about America’s Racist Soul? Or a party with real ideas about what’s gone wrong and how we can fix it? Given recent trends, we can’t expect a majority, but it’s a powerful argument. Surely the pitch is worth making.

Yes, Democrats, the Sky Can Fall

It shames me as an American to see how the Democrats take black voters for granted. It shames me further when Republicans can’t be bothered to protest. Wouldn’t it be fun to puncture that balloon of Democratic entitlement, and make our rivals feel they should at least have to work for those votes?

The great thing about this game is that a very partial victory would really be a win.

This would be a beautiful time to take the offensive, because Democrats are already shaken up. Hillary is on the ropes, and the stable is frighteningly empty. Black Lives Matter is making things hard on the racial front by trumpeting a more radical message than most mainstream voters want to hear. Why not intensify the nightmare with another challenge to the mainstream Democratic narrative in the form of a hopeful and reasonable-sounding appeal from the Right?

The great thing about this game is that a very partial victory would really be a win. Democrats can’t settle for just being fairly popular among black voters. They need the overwhelming majority. Their electoral calculus depends on that, which is an Achilles heel we should exploit. On top of that, claiming the mantle of the not-racist party is hugely significant to the Democrats’ moral narrative. If we challenge them for that mantle, it might spark a crisis of confidence, of the sort that could really put their party into disarray. Riley’s “20 percent” would be a landslide defeat, from the perspective of Democratic strategists who are used to counting on a solid 90 percent of the black vote.

Too often, conservatives just seem defensive and flat-footed when racial questions arise. That makes it easy for Democrats to claim the high ground, misapplying historical injustices as an excuse for continuing strategies that have long since proven ineffectual. Why do we let them get away with this? It’s time to stop reacting, and pay black Americans the compliment of courting their votes.

Most Whites Crave Inclusivism

Ironically, the biggest pay-off of this strategy might be with white voters, many of whom are less enthusiastic than A.O. Scott about the ever-receding horizon of white guilt. By targeting their economic and cultural message to the people believed to be most hostile to it, conservatives can prove their integrity to voters from all backgrounds.

By targeting their economic and cultural message to the people believed to be most hostile to it, conservatives can prove their integrity to voters from all backgrounds.

Democrats will try to present a Republican racial message as desperate, defensive, and, of course, bigoted. That’s why it’s essential to make this appeal with confidence, ignoring the screeching that will inevitably come from Salon and Mother Jones. Don’t bother about the NAACP. Disregard the ranting of Jamilah Lemieux and Marc Lamont Hill. Speak to black voters directly by targeting speeches and ads that specifically address them and their concerns.

Ironically, Trump may have set the stage perfectly for this appeal, by drawing out concerns about racism in the party. Voters who were embarrassed by the Trump episode (and alarmed by the specter of a new, more aggressive white identity politics) will warm to a candidate with a deliberately positive racial message. Watching Trump get buried in a wave of conservative inclusivism would also drive home for voters that no, murderous Mexicans and ugly women really aren’t favorite conservative themes.

Often, conservatives make racial rhetoric more difficult than it needs to be. It’s possible to believe in personal responsibility and to agree that some people’s circumstances are much harder than others’. It’s possible to support a society that values character over skin color, but also to recognize that bad political choices have effectively scratched open the wounds of racial injustice, which might otherwise have been nearly healed by now.

In short, it is possible to be prudent and sensitive about racial issues without further attacking minorities’ dignity by infantilizing them. Conservatives can walk this line. In today’s political climate, we are in fact the only ones who can.

For far too long, Democrats have sown racial angst and reaped electoral victories. To our shame, we haven’t fought very hard. Fellow conservatives, it is time. Let’s build a party so aggressively inclusive that racists won’t want to be seen with us.

We Can’t Reform Our Justice System Without Lifting Families,"Common-sense criminal sentencing reform is gaining momentum. Presidential candidate Jeb Bush and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins are among the signers of the Right on Crime Statement of Principles, which argues for applying “conservative principles to criminal justice policy” as “vital to achieving a cost-effective system that protects citizens, restores victims, and reforms wrongdoers.” Earlier this year, a collation of extraordinary political bedfellows—ranging from Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz—published a book of essays titled, “Solutions: American Leaders Speak Out on Criminal Justice Reform.”

What’s going on? Perkins, a former police officer, knows firsthand what is at stake when sentences are arbitrary, harsh, and simply unjust. He explains why so many political and other leaders are coming together on this critical issue.

Writing in 2013 about how to deal with nonviolent criminals, Perkins said, “Violent and career criminals must be locked up to protect society, and we must also exclude offenders whose crimes endanger their own children … But for many nonviolent offenders, we should do all we can to keep families together while maintaining public safety.”

One of us (Ken Blackwell) has been active in the “Fair Justice” movement, and noted recently, “Over the last decade, states like Texas, Utah, Georgia, and my home state of Ohio have been leaders in criminal justice reform, embracing policies that focus prison beds on serious and violent offenders. The results of these initiatives are staggering: lower costs for taxpayers alongside declining rates of incarceration, recidivism, arrest, and crime rates have continued to fall to decade lows.”

Don’t Forget Families

Encouraging violent criminal behavior through excessive punishment and long and close association of the non-violent with the violent is not only unjust but unwise. Yet in considering how we deal with offenders of all kinds, we have to confront a grim reality: A disproportionate number of offenders are African-American. Why? Is it because there’s something innate in black men that leads them into lives of crime?

‘Relative to other groups, blacks commit more crimes.’

Of course not. Racial injustice plays a role in the incarceration of so many black men, but so does what Kay Hymowitz, writing in The Atlantic earlier this month, calls “the breakdown of the black family.” She notes, “Relative to other groups, blacks commit more crimes. To understand why is to tackle some very hard-to-talk-about realities of black family life.”

Hymowitz, a senior fellow at The Manhattan Institute, observes that “violent criminals continue to make up by far the largest cohort of the freshman class of prisoners—black, white, and Hispanic … The numbers are shocking but it seems worth noting that compared to other advanced nations, the United States also has by far the highest homicide rates even after years of decline.” Why? The black family’s deconstruction has a profound and undeniable correlative effect. We quote Hymowitz here at length:

Children suffer when their parents go to prison … the suffering of black children (accelerates by their) growing up in chaotic families, though that suffering is itself highly correlated with the scourge of ghetto crime and incarceration. Seventy-two percent of black children are born to unmarried mothers. The majority of those children will see contact with their fathers “drop sharply”; within a few years, about a third of dads will basically just disappear. Children don’t take well to the succession of partners, step- and half-siblings that follow their parents’ breakup. Studies, not just a few, but a slew of them, connect “multi-partner fertility” and father absence to behavior problems, aggression, and later criminality among boys even when controlling for race and income. Doesn’t that suggest black-family disruption could have some bearing on crime and incarceration rates?

Of course! Boys raised without involved, committed, and loving fathers who model and teach honorable behavior but who, instead, obtain their moral instruction from the streets will be much more prone to crime than otherwise.

Children Need Their Fathers

“Four decades of research and hundreds of studies have proven what should be obvious to everyone,” writes Skye Loyd at Parenting.com. “The more involved a dad is, the more successful his children will be. A father’s influence can determine a child’s social life, grades at school, and future achievements.”

It’s clear that fatherhood, perhaps most especially in the black community, is not what it should be.

The social science data demonstrate that “Boys close to their fathers have better attitudes about intimacy and the prospect of their own married lives than boys who do not feel close to their fathers, while adolescents who live without their father are more likely to engage in greater and earlier sexual activity, are more likely to become pregnant as a teenager, and are more likely to have a child outside of marriage.”

“Good fathering is characterized by warmth,” writes Dr. Jim Henderson. That’s why, in part, “Recognition of the importance of fathers to children’s development is increasing. Fathers play many roles: supporting the mother-infant relationship, nurturing, acting as mother surrogate, encouraging separation and individuation, setting up core sexual identify and developing sex role, and encouraging the development of conscience.”

Yet it’s clear that fatherhood, perhaps most especially in the black community, is not what it should be. According to Phillip Jackson, executive director of the Black Star Project, “Father absence in the African American communities, across America, has hit those communities with the force of 100 hurricane Katrinas. It is literally decimating our communities and we have no adequate response to it.”

In a study published earlier this year, Marriage and Religion Research Institute (MARRI) scholars Pat Fagan and Christina Hadford found that “Today, only 17 percent of black teenagers reach age 17 in a family with both their biological parents married. In no state does this percentage exceed 30 percent.”

More Government Programs Aren’t the Answer

In a subsequent study, MARRI (a department within Family Research Council) notes that expanded or new government programs are not the answer:

Top-down government reform has largely failed and will likely continue to fail until leaders of other institutions in society (not just policymakers) promote intact married families, the strongest generator of educated youth, low delinquency, economic growth, and sexual mores. Major federal and state public policy outcomes illustrate government’s incompetence as an independent actor in maintaining social order, as well as its dependence on the intact married family for the achievement of its policy goals. Government will continue to fail to reduce these social problems as long as it sees itself as the primary actor. Other major institutions – churches, schools and universities, and even businesses – all need to play their role in restoring and supporting marriage where it is most vulnerable: among the poor.

Sentencing reform is needed. FRC’s friends at Justice Fellowship, a division of the late Chuck Colson’s Prison Fellowship, have some great ideas about how to “reform the criminal justice system so communities are safer, victims are respected, and lives are transformed,” and we urge all concerned with this key issue to visit their website to learn more. Criminal justice reform must get a fair and open hearing as Congress and the administration consider how to proceed.

Yet too much crime, whether violent or not, is committed both against and by men in the black community. That’s largely because, without a dad in the home, African-American boys are far too often raised amidst pain, brokenness, loneliness, and danger. Restoring the black family surely must be a priority for churches and all races and ethnicities throughout our country.

For an example of what one church can do to help strengthen the African-American family, go to the First Baptist Church of Glen Arden’s Shabach! Ministries website.

How Wesleyan’s Attempt To Stamp Out Words Inflames Them,"For anyone interested in freedom of the press, October 18, 2015 is a day that deserves to live in infamy. That night, for what may be the first time in the United States, the student government of an elite American university stripped funding from that university’s campus paper—for the offense of running a conservative op-ed.

The Wesleyan Argus (the campus paper of my alma mater) published the op-ed in question on September 14. Conservative student columnist Bryan Stascavage’s article was titled “Why Black Lives Matter Isn’t What You Think.” Stascavage, who, by his own admission, was conflicted about his opinions on the movement, raised some rather moderate concerns about its propensity towards excusing, or even encouraging, violence toward police officers. He invited students to question if a more considered approach to police violence was necessary.

For his efforts, he was branded a racist, and a group of radical “student of color” activists started a petition to defund the campus paper that published his piece, and—and I swear I’m not making this up—to burn any copies of the paper found carrying the offending article. Yes, apparently publishing an op-ed that was merely undecided about the question of #BlackLivesMatter was enough for some activists to argue for book burning and press closure.

Next, the Student Government Crackdown

In an act that transforms their credibility into a metaphorical Roman candle, the Wesleyan Student Assembly apparently agreed, and slashed the Argus’s funding from $30,000 to $13,000 while imposing measures obviously meant to punish this indiscretion. Jezebel, of all publications, explains the madness best:

In addition to getting their funding largely chopped, the Argus will now compete against other Wesleyan publications for university funding. [Argus Editor-in-Chief Rebecca] Brill explains: ‘As the resolution is now, the publications with the most readership (this would be found out via Google Analytics) would each get 7 work study positions (stipends of $90 per month) and $800 to be used toward Facebook credit or website updates. The third and fourth place publications would be selected in a student vote for the publications of their choice—these would get 3 work study positions (also $90/month) and $200 for Facebook credit or site updates.’ If left unchanged, these resolutions would go into effect next fall.



That one dumb opinion piece could be the impetus for such drastic change at a major university is a testament to the fact that words matter. It’s therefore incredible, and incredibly ironic, that the newspaper is being penalized so harshly.

That student radicals could bully Wesleyan’s student government into imposing this nakedly political type of punishment for dissent rightly shocks the conscience. The irony here is that, if the radicals had ever bothered to think, they would realize their supposed “cure” for the offense of publishing controversial content will actually make the problem far worse. Had the Argus editors—including Brill, as you will see shortly—had a bit more guts, they could have thrown this precise point in the radicals’ face.

The Argus Editors Are Wimps

Sometime before this brouhaha happened, the Argus gave up the fight for its right to publish as it pleases. I know this because, partially as an “attaboy” to embattled columnist Stascavage, and partially to show the sheltered students of Wesleyan what conservative campus commentary used to look like, I submitted my own op-ed to the Argus on this topic some weeks ago. It was substantially less kind than Stascavage’s.

Wesleyan’s own president, Michael Roth, courageously denounced the effort as an attempt to muzzle discussion.

At first, the Argus seemed content to let me make my point, as Tess Morgan, one of its two editors in chief, cheerily informed me that the piece would publish by Tuesday, October 6 (the Argus publishes biweekly). Good on her! After all, Wesleyan’s own president, Michael Roth, had courageously denounced the effort as an attempt to muzzle discussion, and even a leftist rag like Gawker couldn’t contain its contempt for the activists. There was really nothing left for a self-respecting journalist to do but defy them as loudly as possible.

This would have happened, had not Brill’s timid, self-immolating hand intervened. Less than 12 hours before the publication date, Brill informed me they were actually not running the piece, but were in fact declining it because it contained “coded or offensive language.” Angry and puzzled, I fired back with a sharply worded warning that I would be taking it to a national audience in view of their refusal.

Apparently showing guts in the face of even “offensive” writers was too much for the Argus, however, because I received this hilarious reply from Brill shortly thereafter:

You are of course entitled to do as you see fit, but I’d like to clarify that we are not refraining from publishing your letter due to the view it expresses. We are comfortable publishing unpopular view point in both the Opinion and Letter to the Editor sections. Rather, we object to some of the implicitly racist language your letter uses, namely, the word ‘thuggish.’ If you’re willing to revise some of your wording, we will happily reconsider publishing this.

Firstly, note that a straightforward refusal to publish the piece became a meek request for changing a word the instant Brill’s decision was shown to have consequences. Secondly, at the risk of spoiling my own piece, I should mention that (among other things) it compares #BlackLivesMatter to Robert Mugabe, and denounces the movement straightforwardly as a “fascist hate group.”

Such viciousness as this, mirabile dictu, Brill was quite comfortable publishing, but the word “thuggish?” That was a bridge too far. I don’t think The Onion could come up with a more absurd example of how the legalism of speech policing can miss the forest for the trees.

Let the Flame Wars Begin

Now, I don’t say all this merely to show the extent to which Brill’s spine seems to be made, as Rush Limbaugh might say, from linguini. I also want to illustrate how the Argus could have used a piece like mine to make its case, and in not doing so, lost the one talking point that could have saved the existing state of affairs.

He who draws the most traffic wins.

Return to Jezebel’s summary above for a moment, and consider this: newspapers’ funding will now be determined by an apparently straightforward use of Google Analytics. In other words, he who draws the most traffic wins. Now, I can’t speak for the current student body, but when I was a student at Wesleyan, multiple Argus editors told me that my purposefully inflammatory column was the only thing that brought in readership. I would almost be willing to bet one of my own limbs that Stascavage’s supposedly offensive op-ed and the ensuing fallout brought in a flood of traffic to the Argus website. Had my piece been published, I suspect it would have transformed that flood of outraged clicks into a deluge.

In other words, running op-eds like mine and Stascavage’s, rather than functionally illiterate calls for policies like prohibiting paper towels, is the surest means for the Argus to maintain its perch atop Wesleyan’s campus paper hierarchy. Anyone who is familiar with a “Slate pitch” can attest to the economic value of controversy in web traffic. Furthermore, the number of people who read the paper’s print edition makes absolutely no difference to the paper’s analytics numbers, which only measure eyeballs that arrive via the Internet. So even if some activist whose dreadlocks smell of months without the caress of shampoo were to pitch every printed copy of the Argus into the nearest wastepaper bin from now until the end of time, it wouldn’t penalize the paper in any serious way.

Banning Words Is Counterproductive

To conclude, therefore, the new plan actually forces the Argus to publish more of the sort of content that offended #BlackLivesMatter activists, while simultaneously robbing their book-burning pressure tactics of relevance. This was supposed to punish them?

The new plan actually forces the Argus to publish more of the sort of content that offended #BlackLivesMatter activists.

In an alternate universe, Brill and her fellow editors could have made precisely this case to the Wesleyan Student Assembly. They could have brandished copies of Stascavage’s piece, or of mine, and asked their sniveling detractors, “This is what the campus paper will have to read like under your plan, so is this what you want? We don’t want to have to publish only this, but we will.” They could have used hard economic logic to shatter the red, black, and green colored glasses of their critics, and sent these vandals scurrying back to the safe refuge of dorm rooms reeking in Chronic.

Instead, in trying to please everyone, they allowed a policy to pass that practically requires them to please no one, often and loudly. I mourn their lack of courage, but having seen them invite the Gods of the Copybook headings into Wesleyan, I do not mourn the results.

Oh, and for anyone who wants to know what sort of article will drive traffic, I reproduce the piece I sent to the Argus below. Study it well, you illiberal thugs. This is the future your policy requires.

***

In my years since graduating Wesleyan, I have often been asked by people of all political persuasions how I could stand going here. While I’ve made no bones about my frustrations with the student body, I have always defended the experience as a difficult but ultimately rewarding ideological trial by fire, without which my ideas would be substantially weaker. I even wrote a (qualified) defense of so-called liberal bias in no less a publication than National Review making precisely this point. I have even told conservative students who I have interviewed for admission that this is the most important educational experience they can get, if they can stand it.

I am profoundly thankful that none of those students ended up attending, because judging by what happens to campus dissenters now, I’d never forgive myself if they had.

To be on the Left and be accused of misunderstanding journalism by Gawker is rather like being lectured on human rights by Robert Mugabe.

The recent attempt to silence not only conservative columnist Bryan Stascavage, but the entire Argus, is a national scarlet letter which I believe the university will struggle to shed for years. It is so thoroughly indefensible that even Gawker sneered at the people responsible. To be on the Left and be accused of misunderstanding journalism by Gawker is rather like being lectured on human rights by Robert Mugabe: You have to have f–ked up so profoundly that even the worst actors on the planet can only regard you with slack-jawed awe.

Wesleyan used to know how to handle racial controversies like this, if not with grace, then at least without destroying the foundations of campus discourse. I found myself at the center of a similar controversy when I wrote for the Argus and questioned the credentials of former professor Melanye Price my senior year. I’m proud to say that even though I myself was threatened with everything from libel lawsuits to physical violence for my article, my dissenters at least had the good sense not to attempt this kind of shoddy guilt by association toward the campus paper. They recognized the difference between attacking someone’s views, and attacking a neutral platform that allowed them to air those views.

Similarly, when the Cardinal Conservatives held an affirmative action bake sale in 2011, yes, there were tendentious outcries about the event being sanctioned, but no one tried to argue that the entire idea of public demonstrations should be shut down, or that campus space should only be usable for demonstrations by Students of Color (SOC) as restitution.

But now, even as Wesleyan’s average SAT scores have risen, the student body’s capacity to behave like civilized people has plummeted. Let’s be clear: Compared with what I used to write in the Argus, Bryan Stascavage’s piece on #BlackLivesMatter reads like a Ta-Nehisi Coates column. It is evenhanded, thoughtful, and inviting of dialogue to a fault. Yet according to the minutes of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA), apparently student activists believe it “was not fact-based, and perhaps even openly racist.” Furthermore, they want us to know that “Black Lives Matter is not something that can be negotiated.”

Only in the bizarre alternate moral universe in which Wesleyan resides could such behavior be greeted by anything but incredulous laughter. But fine, you want “fact-based?” Here are some facts:

#BlackLivesMatter activist King Noble publicly declared “open season on killing whites and police.” #BlackLivesMatter has used the writings of Assata Shakur in its training manuals. On the #BlackLivesMatter Twitter, activists can be seen wearing shirts proclaiming “Assata taught me.” Pro-Black Lives Matter Atlantic columnist Adrienne Green has even listed Shakur as a “black leader” while defending the movement. #BlackLivesMatter co-founder Alicia Garza candidly lionized Shakur in an op ed for The Feminist Wire. Shakur, a former member of the Black Liberation Army, is a convicted bank robber and cop-killer who is currently hiding in Cuba to evade arrest. #BlackLivesMatter has harbored proven race charlatan Shaun King long after his appropriation of black identity was exposed, for nakedly political reasons. #Blacklivesmatter sponsored a panel discussion that included former Black Panther Party chairman Malik Shabazz. Shabazz, besides being another advocate of the murder of cops, is listed as a “racist” hate group leader by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Based on the above, I would say the arguments for burning the Argus, stripping its funding, and demanding it only include columnists of one race echo the arguments of fascist hate groups, but that wouldn’t be accurate, because on the evidence, #BlackLivesMatter is a fascist hate group. Full stop.

So really, the group’s supporters are right that fascism “cannot be negotiated.” It must be crushed. I hope Wesleyan’s Students of Color (SOC) will recognize that in defending this movement and its thuggish intimidation tactics, they only drive home more fully why the Argus would hesitate to publish their missives. Because if this is who they support, they clearly have nothing of value to say.

FINALLY: Rachel Dolezal Just Admitted That She’s White,"Rachel Dolezal, the former professor and NAACP president who pretended for years to be black, finally admitted that she is actually a white person.

During an appearance on the daytime television show The Real, Dolezal came clean and admitted what everyone else had known for months: she is a white person who was born to two other white people.

“You’re not black,” host Jeannie Mai said to Dolezal, who is white. “You weren’t born black, so when you say you are black, it makes it hard for people to understand where you’re coming from,”

“Right, and that’s why I said I acknowledge that I was biologically born white, to white parents,” Dolezal said to cheers and applause from the studio audience. “But I identify as black,” she continued.

Dolezal made headlines earlier this year when reports surfaced that she was not, in fact, black. Dolezal, who previously served as the chapter president for the Spokane NAACP, spent years pretending to be a black person. She claimed a black man as her father on social media. Dolezal also regularly wrote about her black son Iziah, who was actually her adopted brother. Dolezal, a graduate of Howard University, previously taught classes on Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University.

Virginia Campus Protestors Need To Get A Life,"The nationwide hysteria that has been boiling on college campuses around the country has arrived in Richmond, Virginia. On November 12, around 30 “student activists” crowded the office of Michael Rao, president of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), my alma mater, presenting a list of demands.

The protests at Yale University, the University of Missouri, and various other colleges across the country have been driven not by facts but a kind of paranoid narcissism. Alternately presenting themselves as militant social-justice warriors one moment and shrieking babies in need of “safe spaces” the next, a strident faction of American college students have come under the conviction that our universities are hotbeds of racism, white supremacy, and discrimination. The mob that took over Rao’s office did not disappoint on this front:

Their main concern is a lack of black professors at VCU. They say it’s often difficult for them to deal with educators who don’t understand their cultural concerns or the experience driving their thoughts and world view.



A lack of black professors also means that other students are missing out on a valuable educational point of view.



VCU says 5 percent of its professors are black. Fifteen percent of the student body is black



Coupled with their classroom concerns is a feeling of being an outsider on campus because there is no effort being made to foster a community for black students, they said…



Among the demands are to double the number of black faculty members to 10 percent of the total number of professors by 2017, to have at least one of every three candidates interviewing for a faculty position be black, and to create a position to make sure the policies are being implemented.

As a graduate of VCU, I can affirm with complete sincerity that these “concerns” and “feelings” are absurd and laughable, the product not of legitimate grievances but of excessive and shameless vanity.

There Can Be Few Legitimate Complaints

For starters, the “lack of black professors” at VCU has almost certainly done nothing to alienate any of these students. It is virtually guaranteed that every single professor at VCU is consciously and deliberately attentive to every minority student in his or her classes. Even by public university standards, VCU is extremely liberal, and it is outlandish to assume that the majority of black students on campus have been treated any way other than respectfully and competently by the faculty. (Indeed, any unprofessional behavior on the part of VCU’s faculty is almost certain to lean liberal.)

It is virtually guaranteed that every single professor at VCU is consciously and deliberately attentive to every minority student in his or her classes.

One could argue that even if black students are treated fairly by their instructors, then they still have a legitimate grievance over the low number of black professors on campus: they need to hear from professors who “understand their cultural concerns” and their “thoughts and worldview.” But this assumes that black professors inherently and inevitably bring a certain worldview along with them. The students seem to believe, in other words, that every black instructor thinks and behaves identically.

This is, of course, perfectly nonsensical: skin color does not determine thoughts, nor is it guaranteed that one’s skin color produces a cultural experience similar to that of another person with similarly colored skin. Indeed, most of my professors at VCU were white, and it’s doubtful many of them understood my “cultural concerns,” much less agreed with them.

Go Take Your Privilege Elsewhere

As for the notion that VCU’s black students feel like “outsiders on campus,” this, too, is nothing more than superficial navel-gazing. Virginia Commonwealth University is, like most public universities in the country, relentlessly and almost maniacally devoted to celebrating as much “diversity” as it can get its hands on, and its highly liberal student body is doubtlessly committed to as much racial inclusiveness as is humanly possible.

Virginia Commonwealth University is almost maniacally devoted to celebrating as much ‘diversity’ as it can get its hands on.

The concern that the college is giving “no effort” towards fostering a “community for black students” is itself profoundly narrow-minded and shortsighted. The point of college is not to balkanize oneself by predetermined criteria like skin color but to expose oneself to a much wider and more uncertain world than the one from which one came.

VCU’s student activists are engaging in a petty, shallow identity politics. Spurred on by the histrionic outbursts of students at Yale, the University of Missouri, and elsewhere, they have convinced themselves they are the victims of injustice and wrongdoing when in fact they are among the most comfortable and privileged people on the planet, attending a clean, modern university with an eager faculty and countless resources at their disposal.

Frustrated at the lack of oppression over which they might rebel, they have been reduced to creating their own imagined oppression in order to stage an ego-soaked faux-revolution. They are responding to the signals of a silly victim culture, not reality.

Rao should have told the students in no uncertain terms: “This is delusional. Leave my office at once and go back to the classes you are paying to attend.” Sadly, that kind of commonsense authority is sorely lacking on most college campuses, and VCU appears to be no different.

Campus Racial Conflicts Are White People’s Fault,"Race protestors have presented a list of demands at universities across the nation, demanding an “end to systemic and structural racism on campus.” The problem here isn’t just the demands, which resemble something born of a Progressive wet dream, but the premise—and as long as white people accept that premise, they have only themselves to blame for future racial conflicts.

The presumption of institutionalized racism has become an indisputable creed of the Left, but most of the evidence presented doesn’t prove racism at all. Whether it’s housing, arrest statistics, or college acceptance and hiring, inequality of outcome does not equal racism, and to assume it does is to ignore the various complexities of the black community that have nothing to do with white oppression or privilege.

Yet white (and black) Americans accept this premise—the belief that our country’s institutions are fundamentally bigoted. This deferential capitulation to a false narrative has created and encouraged racial strife in our nation, and it will continue as long as white people allow white guilt to color the truth. This white guilt is a form of self-redemption in which whites create policy and engage in actions to prove they’re innocent of racism.

Give Us Your Stuff, You Bigots

Just look at the protestors’ demands: They include higher rates of college admission for black students, hiring more black faculty, more authority given to black faculty and administrators, free education for poor black students, and “divestment from prisons and investments in communities,” i.e., wealth redistribution. In other words, this has nothing to do with “systemic racism” and everything to do with advancing a “black power” agenda.

This has nothing to do with ‘systemic racism’ and everything to do with advancing a ‘black power’ agenda.

Protestors are using threats, intimidation, and manipulation of white guilt to get what they want, and they’re succeeding because white people are playing right into their hands. They don’t want to appear to perpetrate white supremacy, and they desperately want to reestablish the legitimacy of America’s institutions by proving they’re not racists, so they bow to the demands of the intimidators. This has only fueled more conflict, and whites have only themselves to blame.

Shelby Steele, an African-American author and a research fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, makes this point in his 2006 book “White Guilt,” a must-read for anyone trying to understand racial conflict in our country today. Steele explains that racism continues in America, not because there is actual global racism, but because of white guilt.

White guilt is not just a feeling of misplaced guilt, but whites accepting they are guilty of racism and therefore having to continually prove they’re not. This, of course, is an impossible task, because you can never prove a negative.

White Guilt Equals Black Power

In “White Guilt,” Steele makes the following observation:

When I visit university campuses today, black students often tell me that racism is everywhere around them, that the university is a racist institution. When I ask for specific examples of racist events or acts of discrimination, I invariably get nothing at all or references to some small slight that requires the most labored interpretation to be seen as racist. Global racism allows these students to feel aggrieved by racism even as they live on campuses notorious for almost totalitarian regimes of political correctness—and to feel more aggrieved than black students did forty years ago, before the civil rights victories.



This is because their feeling of racial aggrievement is calibrated to the degree of white guilt on university campuses and not to actual racism. When I ask if they feel racially aggrieved away from campus at their summer jobs, they often look surprised, as if the question is not relevant. But then most say they don’t see as much racism at their summer jobs.



Global racism prevails precisely where whites and institutions most aggressively search for moral authority around race. Even announcements of a new commitment to ‘diversity’ within an institution will very likely increase feelings of racial aggrievement in minorities.



We blacks always experience white guilt as an incentive, almost a command, to somehow exhibit racial woundedness and animus.

This last statement is a powerful indictment of race-baiting blacks who demand redress for perceived racism, but it makes sense. The more whites act as if they’re guilty of racism, the more opportunistic blacks (and liberal elites) will use that “guilt” to gain power by manipulating the system to get what they want—free education, affirmative action, more “equality” in hiring (i.e., more minorities being selected, not based on merit, but on the color of their skin).

An Agenda of Power

The campus uprisings today have less to do with perceived racism and more to do with promoting an agenda of power. This is evident from the protestors’ list of demands. The strategy is to use white guilt and political correctness to achieve goals that are not so easily attained through legitimate means.

This agenda, combined with students who are easily offended, creates a powder keg of strife. The spotlight is on overcoming “racism,” but the real agenda has nothing to do with actual racism. The goal is to advance black power in the name of social justice and bring about opportunity, not through personal responsibility, but through intimidation and threats.

The only way to push against this agenda is to reject the very notion of white guilt and to refuse to give in to politically correct control. The more America’s institutions yield to the notion that they’re racist, the more race-baiters with an agenda will acquire power and control. When that happens, freedom in America will be lost.

You Can Support The Police And Racial Justice,"Is it rational for black men to fear they may be killed by police? The Washington Post has just released a new, groundbreaking study on police violence that may help answer that question. It investigates every fatal police shooting in the United States in 2015. You can see the data here.

Plenty of arresting details come out of this study. Those who followed the Tamir Rice case may be interested to know that realistic-looking toy guns were involved in fully 3 percent of the shootings. Almost 10 percent of victims were unarmed when they were killed, and a very disproportionate number of these were black. About a quarter of the suspects were fleeing when they were shot, while a quarter struggled with mental illness.

The headliner, though, is something we already knew: a lot of Americans get killed in police shootings. As of Christmas Eve, police in America had fatally shot 979 people across the United States. (The Guardian, with a similar study, puts the number over 1,000.)

That’s a lot, when you consider that multiple European countries can count on one hand the number of fatal police shootings each year. Every country is different, of course, in innumerable ways. Nevertheless, such enormous disparities should prompt some probing questions.

Are Cops Racist?

This of course is the question on everyone’s mind. The study won’t definitively answer it, but it may help flesh out the picture of what’s really happening in America’s more crime-ridden districts.

Some contend this data puts to rest any reasonable concern about widespread racial bias in America’s police departments. It’s true of course that young, black men are far more likely to be shot and killed by police. That’s easily explicable, however, in terms of disproportionate crime rates, and there’s no evidence that white-on-black violence is in at all disproportionate to levels of crime. David French summarizes the argument neatly as follows:

Crime doesn’t break down on neat, proportionate demographic lines. Criminals are overwhelmingly male (police killed very few women this year, but no one argues that law enforcement is sexist), and violent criminals are disproportionately black. In fact, blacks ‘commit homicide at close to eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined.’ Even worse, ‘among males between the ages of 14 and 17, the interracial homicide commission gap is nearly tenfold.’ In 2014, for example, while black Americans constituted only about 13 percent of the population, they represented a majority of the homicide and robbery arrests. 82 percent of all gun deaths in the black community are from homicide. For whites, 77 percent of gun deaths are suicides.

On face, this is a compelling argument. Blacks commit more violent crimes (dramatically more, in fact) than whites. Is it surprising they are disproportionately shot by police? If anything, racial disparities should be seen as a good sign, that police are going after the folks who are really committing crimes.

So if you’re raising a black son in America (so the logic goes), you should simply teach him to be a law-abiding citizen. That should be protection enough from the hazards of law-enforcement.

Black Lives Matter May Still Have A Point

As usual, the obvious explanation is a little too obvious. Let’s consider a slightly more nuanced explanation of the data, which may give some credence to the anxieties of Black Lives Matter, without assuming that police officers are raging bigots.

Black men really are responsible for a wildly disproportionate number of America’s homicides. In some neighborhoods, these mostly go unsolved. They are primarily committed in the context of gang rivalries, and police find these cases challenging to close, because available witnesses are too afraid to testify. (Their families live in these neighborhoods, and are liable to be targeted if witnesses come forward.)

Many of the cops who patrol these neighborhoods are really just doing their time until they can get a better assignment.

Law enforcement tends to be less aggressive about prosecuting “insider violence” (committed among mafiosos, gangsters, or members of criminal organizations). That’s readily understandable, of course. We all realize that violence is an occupational hazard of being a criminal, and most of us would agree that a police force should prioritize the safety of the law-abiding.

Still, one consequence is that the cycle of vengeance tends to continue, since gangsters have a high level of confidence they can (literally) get away with murder.

The police that work these neighborhoods are frequently undertrained and overwhelmed. There are some quiet, mostly unsung heroes who go on working the cases with few thanks, under harrowing conditions. But many of the cops who patrol these neighborhoods are really just doing their time until they can get a better assignment.

Others may care, but just not be up to the difficult task of imposing order on violence-riddled subcultures. They’re genuinely scared for their own lives. So (particularly if the climate of their department has not discouraged this) they get skittish, and sometimes make bad decisions. When guys with guns are making erratic decisions, people die.

Are Statistics Victimizing Law-Abiding Innocents?

Now, let’s return to the question of statistics. We know that lots of black men commit crimes, and that lots of black men are shot by the police. At first glance, the rough parity seems to make sense.

We needn’t see the police as racist in order to suspect that a youngster like Rice would have had better odds if he’d been white.

Thinking more about the dynamics of neighborhoods in which these shootings take place, we might want to ask more questions. Are the people getting shot the same ones who are committing crimes? The majority probably are, but remember, we’re talking about neighborhoods in which homicides are committed in large numbers, but mostly not solved, while too many officers remain undertrained and skittish.

It isn’t silly for innocent people who “look like criminals” in obvious ways (like being young, black, and male) to worry they may be at significantly greater risk of being mistaken for criminals, even if they aren’t doing anything illegal.

Taking all of this into account, we should probably be interested in the fact that unarmed black men are seven times more likely than whites to be fatally shot by police. Unarmed doesn’t mean innocent, of course, but that’s still a very big number.

Is it really strange that residents of high-crime neighborhoods often view the police with fear and resentment? Is it wrong for parents to feel that it might be dangerous to let their black sons play with water pistols or wear hoodies? That’s a depressing thought.

We needn’t see the police as racist in order to suspect that a youngster like Rice would have had better odds if he’d been white. That’s a grim thought, too.

More Resources and Higher Standards

Let’s be clear. An 18-year-old black man is in far more danger than I am of being shot by the police. That likely holds even if we’re standing on the same street corner, behaving the same way. At the same time, black men are far more likely to be shot by other black men than by cops.

We should be bothered by a justice climate that leaves even law-abiding blacks feeling personally threatened, with some justification.

Those two facts are related. Insofar as police make bad mistakes, that’s largely because they’re being asked to tackle big problems with limited resources. They deserve to be cut some slack (though, crucially, not an infinite amount).

We don’t have to choose between a pro-police stance and a pro-racial-justice stance. We should support law enforcement and the rights of minorities. Even if we agree that most police officers probably aren’t personally bigoted, we should be bothered by a justice climate that leaves even law-abiding blacks feeling personally threatened, with some justification.

It’s a problem, and instead of mulling over the complexities of moral responsibility, we should be looking for ways to address it. The most obvious conclusion is that we should invest more resources in better-quality law enforcement in high-crime areas.

Real police reform is going to involve a lot of tit-for-tat. Raise salaries, so police forces can recruit talent more aggressively, and push for merit-based pay scales that reward the sorts of officers who do useful and needed things (de-escalating tense neighborhood situations, closing homicides). Invest more in training programs that help officers learn to defuse tense situations, and to keep themselves safe without using excessive force.

Law-abiding Americans should be able to move safely through public spaces, regardless of what they look like.

At the same time, strip union contracts of provisions that hinder Internal Affairs divisions from investigating use-of-force complaints. (If you think this will frighten talented people away from policing, consider that juries in general are very sympathetic to cops, even despite the public relations fiascos of the past few years. They are reluctant to convict cops unless the abuse of power is truly egregious.)

If you’re wondering where the money will come from to pay for these improvements, consider that both crime and incarceration are very expensive. By reducing both, effective policing tends to pay for itself.

Raise transparency with body and dashboard cameras, and respond seriously to complaints of low-level police bullying. Think of this as the flip side of the “broken window” theory: bully cops can do far more damage to the force’s reputation than immediate ramifications might suggest.

Crucially, we must get away from using the police as a major source of revenue. As Ferguson, Missouri, clearly shows us, pressuring cops to act as your niggling tax-collectors is not worth it given the cost in public resentment and reduced police effectiveness.

Law-abiding Americans should be able to move safely through public spaces, regardless of what they look like. Black kids shouldn’t have to get tutorials from their parents about staying safe from cops. Shouldn’t we all be able to agree on these things? Let’s support our police by giving them the resources they need, and demanding that they be the good guys.

"The Cam Newton Hate Is Over Showboating, Not Race","The Super Bowl doesn’t kick off for another ten days, but we already have our first dumb play. On Wednesday, Cam Newton, the consensus MVP pick of every expert on the planet, told the Charlotte Observer that all the vitriol directed at him by opposing fans and players is essentially the result of him being black.

I’m gonna throw the challenge flag on that one, and there’s no way I lose the challenge, assuming these aren’t replacement refs.

Here’s the direct quote Cam gave to the Charlotte Observer when discussing the criticism he’s faced this year for the way he plays the game: “I’ve said this since day one. I’m an African-American quarterback. That may scare a lot of people because they haven’t seen nothing that they can compare it to.”

Cam would a perfectly valid point if the year were 1950, but in 2016, when 70 percent of the players in the league are black, it seems a little silly to play the race card. This is like saying nobody likes you at the Country Music Awards because you’re white. (Although it could happen to Rachel Dolezal.)

Hello: Black Stars Are Nothing New to Football

As far as the “we’ve never seen a quarterback like him” claim, he’s all the way wrong on that, too. Randall Cunningham was a scrambling QB with a big arm. Michael Vick was one of the most dangerous QBs (and dog sitters) we’ve ever seen. And let’s not forget Warren Moon, Steve McNair, Russell Wilson, and Doug Williams. All black quarterbacks, all stud players, all embraced by the league and its fans.

Newton is the sixth black quarterback to start a Super Bowl, and his appearance in this year’s game marks the fourth straight year we’ve had a black QB starting.

Newton is the sixth black quarterback to start a Super Bowl, and his appearance in this year’s game marks the fourth straight year we’ve had a black QB starting for a Super Bowl team. So to say he’s scaring fans because they’ve never seen anything like him is a blanket accusation about other races, not his own.

The one thing Cam is doing that’s unique to him is dancing after just about every big play he makes. His dance of choice is called The Dab, which is meant to represent someone coughing after taking a hit of marijuana. When Cam “Dabs,” it infuriates some opponents—and I’m gonna go out on a limb and say it’s not because of his pro-weed stance. (I’ve got the league’s list of failed drug tests to back me up.)

You see, to a lot of players, Cam Newton plays like a showboating a–hole. And in the heat of battle there are no white showboating a–holes, or black show-boating a–holes, there is only the United States of Show-Boating A—holes, with Cam being the president and his teammate, Cornerback Josh Norman, being VP.

This Is About Cam’s Dancing, Ya’ll

Cam’s over-the-top style of play has even caught the eye of NBA types, with Charles Barkley telling ESPN between sandwiches, “As much I love Cam, if I played against him I would put a hit on him, no question. Because they [The Panthers] rub it in pretty good.”

If he wants to taunt a bunch of 300-pound killing machines, that’s his problem, not mine.

Charles isn’t racist for wanting to “put a hit” on Cam, and neither are any of the white players who want to join him. No opposing player or fan has ever liked a showboat in sports since the beginning of time. And when the showboat in question wins his way to the biggest stage, the hate is only going to intensify, regardless of color or creed.

I’m not denying that some people are rubbed the wrong way by the fact that he’s black, but let’s leave the Oscar’s voters out of this. The truth is, most people have no problem with the way Cam Newton plays. They find it refreshing because the NFL has gone to great lengths to legislate the fun out of the game.

You might be one of them. I am. Seriously. If he wants to taunt a bunch of 300-pound killing machines, that’s his problem, not mine. All I ask is that he doesn’t cry racism if he ends up wearing a white cast, because somebody is gonna pop him. If his on-field confrontations this season are any indication, it’s going to be a black player.

Newton is a phenomenal football talent, but he should leave the social justice crusades to someone else—because if he made any point with his comments, it’s that before we have the big conversation on how to end racism, we need to first have a discussion about what it is.

"Why Republicans Should Target Black Voters, Not Latinos","At some point in the near future, Republicans will need more of the minority vote to win the presidency. While in 2016 they may get by with white voters alone, every year that strategy becomes harder to execute. Winning a bigger share of a shrinking demographic is not the way forward, so the party has no choice but to racially diversify.

Although many conservatives have written on this topic, few have provided details: How should minority voters be reached? Which minorities: Africans-Americans, Asians, or Hispanics? What issues, if any, should Republicans compromise on to win their votes? How much compromise is necessary?

These decisions and tradeoffs cannot be made intelligently without a mental framework. Republicans need a way to analyze which efforts are worth pursuing, what metrics should be used to determine success, and how those efforts will help move the party to the desired state. The Republican Party needs a racial diversity strategy.

Criteria for Success: Realism and Effectiveness

Any Republican diversity strategy must meet at least two requirements. First, it must account for the existing contours of the party, and recognize that major deviations will provoke resistance. Because executing any diversity strategy will be difficult, it is important to minimize disruption to the present conservative coalition.

A strategy that calls for a path to citizenship will be more difficult to implement than one that does not. Similarly, a strategy that downplays social issues will raise more tensions than one that does not. In short, Republican diversity efforts must be realistic.

A Republican diversity strategy should also be effective: it must help Republicans win the presidency. There is no point in pursuing a new segment of voters if it does not. Increasing the Right’s share of the Hispanic vote may be the key to victory. But it is also possible that African-Americans or Asians matter more in the Electoral College. These types of decisions can in principle be resolved empirically. Because the presidency is so important, evidence must guide a Republican diversity strategy.

Why Immigration for Votes Doesn’t Work

Right now, Republican diversity efforts can be classified in two camps. One explicitly considers race and is driven by conservative elites. It reduces to a single idea: Hispanics avoid the Republican Party primarily because of its stance on immigration. Moderating on immigration by offering a path to citizenship would allow Republicans to capture enough Hispanic votes to win presidential elections.

In 2016 Republicans could win 49 percent of the Hispanic vote and still lose the election.

The line of reasoning has been ably refuted elsewhere. Two points should be stressed: First, only once in history has a Republican candidate received 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. Second, demographic changes and the geographic concentration of Hispanics mean that in 2016 Republicans could win 49 percent of their vote and still lose the election! As Sean Trende and David Byler noted, Hispanic voters have a “limited electoral impact.”

Amnesty also contradicts the desires of a large fraction of Republican voters, whose preferences cannot and should not be ignored. So even if the basic argument were correct, it would require a staggering share of the Hispanic vote and also be opposed by a core Republican constituency. These two facts make the elites’ strategy both unrealistic and ineffective.

A Middle-Class Agenda Isn’t the Answer, Either

The second camp, occupied by Reformocons, avoids wrestling with race specifically. The Reformocon message is: Republicans should first work on building a middle-class agenda. If they do that well, minorities will vote Republican. There would be no need to worry about race, and definitely not Hispanics. This argument is powerful. Reformocon policies will probably appeal to many Americans, including racial minorities.

Reformocon policies will not win over minorities if they can’t even win among Republican primary voters.

But there at two problems with this approach. First, the Reformocon agenda suffers from something Marco Rubio can relate to: it polls great in the general election but has problems in the primaries. Reformocon policies will not win over minorities if they can’t even win among Republican primary voters.

At some point, Republicans will probably embrace middle-class policies. But that shift may take decades to complete, if ever; and there’s a good chance that a watered-down Reformocon agenda will appeal less to minorities, and everyone else, than whatever the Democrats offer. For the near future, a full-throated Reformocon platform is no more realistic than one that is pro-amnesty. Both greatly disrupt the Republican coalition.

The second problem is that Reformocons explicitly ignore the racial dimensions of U.S. politics. Given how much racial strife runs through American history, it is unlikely that a few family-friendly tax credits will solve Republican deficiencies. On this, the Left is correct: race cannot be ignored in America. You have to confront it head-on. A Republican diversity strategy must do just that. The goal should be to permanently change the Republican coalition so it includes racial minorities.

With Blacks, Republicans Have Nowhere to Go But Up

As flawed as the elites’ prescription is, they have two things right. Republicans can’t avoid race, and it makes sense to go after a single racial group. They were just wrong about which race. Given the ideological makeup and geographic distribution of America’s minorities, Republicans would most benefit by focusing on African-American voters. Rather than attempting to replicate the Left’s rainbow coalition at once, a useful first step may be to create a durable black-and-white coalition.

It is precisely because African-Americans overwhelmingly vote Democratic that Republicans should pursue them.

Last November, Theodore Johnson rationalized the actions of the Mitt Romney canvassers who ignored him: “As a black guy, I couldn’t really fault the group’s practical decision. After all, why spend time and campaign resources on me when nine in ten blacks routinely vote for the Democratic presidential nominee and when the nation’s first black president was seeking reelection?” While the rest of Johnson’s essay should be commended, this analysis is wrong. It is precisely because African-Americans overwhelmingly vote Democratic that Republicans should pursue them.

It is generally easier to grow market share when starting from nothing. Republicans received 4 percent of the black vote in 2008 and 6 percent in 2012. If Republicans made it their primary goal, they should be able to nominally improve on that total to get 10 percent. We know that outcome is possible because Republicans did it seven times in the eleven elections since 1972. It is reasonable to think that Republicans can do in 2016 what they have done repeatedly in the past. It’s not clear who decided 40-plus percent of the Latino vote would be easier to achieve than 10-plus percent of the African-American vote. But the evidence does not support that assertion.

The sensitivity of the Democratic electoral model to African-American voters is another reason Republicans should focus on them. Small gains can have a very large impact: merely reverting their vote to pre-Obama levels “wipes away” the Democratic electoral college advantage. Since so little African-American support is needed for Republicans to be competitive, it is unconscionable to ignore them. Black voters are also concentrated in states that, unlike Hispanic voters, can deliver the Electoral College to Republicans. An African-Americans-first diversity strategy therefore actually helps Republicans win.

It’s not clear who decided 40-plus percent of the Latino vote would be easier to achieve than 10-plus percent of the African-American vote.

The vague problem of how to get “minorities” to vote Republican can now be transformed into something concrete and actionable: determining how Republicans should win at least 10 percent of the black vote in the swing states Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Virginia. That’s it.

None of this should suggest that winning 10-15 percent of the black vote will be easy. It will not. But Republicans need minority voters and will be engaging in outreach of some form anyway, so they should focus on what yields the highest payoff.

Launch Republicans’ Racial Diversity Startup Right

This diversity strategy is admittedly not as uplifting as the Reformocons’ suggestion of trying to improve among all minorities. But this desired outcome may be achievable only if Republicans start with a single demographic. Consider a business analogy. Many entrepreneurs succeed because they target a niche, beachhead market and consciously ignore others. This approach allows them to expand and grow. Only after winning the beachhead market do they have the ability to sell elsewhere.

Initially focusing on African-Americans is a plausible way Republicans can transition to a party that represents all races.

The Republican Party should follow a similar path because it is effectively a startup when it comes to racial diversity. It doesn’t have the resources, customer knowledge, or sales team to convince everyone, and will have a better chance of success if it concentrates on one minority group. As Republicans get used to addressing their concerns, it should be easier to do so for other minorities. Initially focusing on African-Americans is thus a plausible way Republicans can transition to a party that represents all races.

Malcolm X once observed that African-Americans are rarely asked to “contribute anything to other areas of thought and ideas [outside of race],” and no one seems to care “what they think about the problem of world health, or the space race to land men on the moon.”

Sadly, this observation still rings true. How often do working-class African-Americans get to comment on immigration reform? How many black Christians were asked their thoughts about gay marriage? Because many issues are often framed as white versus non-white, black opinions are neglected. Republican outreach can change this dynamic, and expose tensions in the Democratic coalition. Immigration and social issues are two areas where this tactic may be particularly effective.

Many Republican Themes Appeal to African-Americans

Elites may not like it, but immigration will remain a divisive issue for many years. While there may be ways to moderate on rhetoric, many Republicans are in fact opposed to both increased immigration and a path to citizenship. These stances are becoming a litmus test for conservatives.

African-Americans are also hurt by America’s morally and intellectually bankrupt immigration system.

Immigration is particularly important for working-class whites, a demographic Republicans must win to capture the White House. Any Republican candidate will therefore inevitably campaign on securing the border and helping American workers.

Since these themes will already be a part of Republican messaging, it makes sense to apply them to African-Americans. As Buzzfeed described in December, African-Americans are also hurt by America’s morally and intellectually bankrupt immigration system. Black Americans already have a latent distrust of cheap foreign labor. Republicans should at least try to take advantage of this common ground.

This outreach will hopefully reveal the divisions between pro-amnesty Democrats and many African-Americans, something that can only help Republicans. Unlike amnesty, this message will not anger a key conservative voting bloc. It may instead strengthen their commitment to vote Republican.

In addition to working-class whites, Republicans also need Christian social conservatives to win the White House. Republicans will definitely be cultivating their support and responding to their concerns. As they do so, Republicans should not forget that many black Americans fall in this category.

Theologically serious black Christians are perhaps the most overlooked group in the culture wars.

Because American evangelism is wrongly portrayed as purely white, the faith of millions of African-Americans ends up being obscured. Theologically serious black Christians are perhaps the most overlooked group in the culture wars. No one seems to wonder how faith guides black Christians. No one asked how they felt about the Hobby Lobby decision or when Vanderbilt University derecognized Christian student groups.

White secular liberals don’t seem to realize that the people they appear to hate the most—religious Christians—and the ones they need the most—black Americans—are the exact same people. White secular liberals who mock Christians are mocking the most important member of their own team.

Republicans can highlight this tension by forcing Democrats to solicit black opinions on faith and culture issues. When liberals compare Christian beliefs on marriage and sexuality to racism, Republicans should ask: what do black Americans think about that analogy? Black people are the most Christian Americans as well as victims of the worst racism in American history. Their voices cannot be ignored in these conversations.

How to Respect Black Americans

Republicans should stress that casually invoking racism trivializes the unique horrors of the black experience. Only black people endured 250 years of slavery, ninety years of Jim Crow, decades of racist housing policy, and 4,000 lynchings. Perhaps except for Native Americans, no group in our history has suffered like black Americans have. Racism analogies should be as taboo as ones about the Holocaust. That message will surely resonate with many African-Americans. Remember: it only needs to resonate with about 10 percent of them to start having a big electoral impact.

Republicans should stress that casually invoking racism trivializes the unique horrors of the black experience.

In the passage referenced above, Malcolm X explained how he knew which journalists “respected [his] mind”: “They would invite my opinion on subjects off the race issue…We would sit around and talk about all kinds of things, current events and other things” (emphasis added). Republicans should exude this type of respect towards black Americans by engaging with them on these other things. Like so many of us, black Americans are religious parents worried about an increasingly secular culture; workers fearful about the future; entrepreneurs affected by marginal tax rates.

As much as African-Americans may care about topics like police brutality and affirmative action, it is profoundly disrespectful to believe that’s all they care about. As Ta-Nehisi Coates once noted, few black people “wake up thinking about the HIV rate, or go to bed thinking about the incarceration rate.” There is much more to black America than suffering, a fact our political discourse, and especially Democratic discourse, does not acknowledge. Republicans should acknowledge it. They should meaningfully address the worries black Americans share with all Americans.

Respect Doesn’t Mean Pandering

In this outreach, Republicans don’t always have to agree with African-Americans. The Right does not have to embrace affirmative action or the current form of the welfare state. When necessary, Republicans should just explain why they think their policies are better for everyone, black America included. Many will disagree, and that’s okay. If done properly, many will end up agreeing. Many already do. Mindless agreement is not respectful, and Republicans should shun that approach.

Like members of any large group, black Americans have diverse views.

Republicans should instead recognize the immense diversity among African-Americans. If they comprised their own country, African-Americans would be one of the ten largest black countries on Earth. There are almost as many black Americans as black South Africans. Like members of any large group, black Americans have diverse views. Republicans should expect many African-Americans to agree with their policy agenda.

Black Americans may overwhelmingly vote Democratic, but they are not overwhelmingly liberal. Most are just moderate Democrats, and they often disagree with their party. The Democratic coalition requires that this ideological diversity be suppressed. Republicans can and should expose it.

Simply put, Republicans should treat black Americans like every political party in every democracy on Earth treats its citizens: try to identify potential supporters and pursue them relentlessly and unashamedly. Doing so would convey genuine, authentic respect.

Change, or Lose

For decades conservative intellectuals have promoted the idea that Republicans should reach out to African-Americans. But until now Republicans could win presidential elections without minorities of any kind. So they, somewhat understandably, have never really tried to. Since an increasingly brown country is rendering the previous electoral calculus obsolete, it is finally time to start taking action.

Since an increasingly brown country is rendering the previous electoral calculus obsolete, it is finally time to start taking action.

This essay presents one way for Republicans to begin the process. The specifics are less important than three key principles. First, conservatives need a racial diversity strategy rather than ad hoc tactics that depend on specific candidates or circumstances. Only a coherent strategy can help allocate scarce resources and identify how to move from the present state to the desired one.

Second, on both moral and practical grounds, the desires of the existing Republican coalition must be accounted for. Third, any suggested actions must empirically demonstrate how they would help Republicans win. Parties exist to win elections, and victory is the only metric that ultimately matters.

I believe these principles imply that Republicans should primarily focus on African-American voters. While this conclusion should be vigorously debated, it is worth highlighting a few closing facts.

Only one minority group is deeply, profoundly Christian. Only one has a large segment of people skeptical of both mass immigration and a path to citizenship. Only one will be receptive to outreach on these issues in a way that does not upset the current Republican base. Only one minority group has historically supported Republicans at levels they now need to win.

As the Republican Party looks to racially diversify, to me, at least, the choice is clear. It’s go black or go home.

Black Helicopter Parents Use The Police To Enforce Their Parenting Style,"You’ve no doubt experienced or read about the horrors of “helicopter parenting,” with overprotective mommies and daddies hovering over little Junior’s every move to save him from every conceivable peril. But prepare yourself for the newest evolution of this unfortunate trend.

I’m calling it “black helicopter parenting.” Take one part overprotective coddling cocoon-mom, one part suburban liberal worry-wart, one part nosy neighbor, and combine it with the unseen omnipresent eye of our do-it-yourself smartphone surveillance state, and presto: black helicopter parenting. Why just worry about your own kids’ every move when you can anonymously “look out” for others?

It sounds paranoid. But they really are watching you! Well, watching me, at least.

On to the Story

Here’s what happened. I was driving two of my darling moppets to school at Something Something School of the Suburbs. As so often is the case, eight-year-old “Pumpkin” was assailing seven-year-old “Princess.” (Names have been changed to protect the guilty.) Princess was shrieking, as usual. Despite daddy’s pleas for about ten minutes, neither would cool it.

So, given the break of a long red light, I shouted “STOP IT!” and reached back to deliver what should have been a sound smack to the hands of young assailing Pumpkin. It didn’t quite make it, as he’s a quick one. But they settled down and started yammering about something else.

Needless to say, I was shocked and more than a little appalled. Who does that?

I drove them on to the drop-off line, bid them adieu, and was on my way to work—only to have my wife call me two hours later, saying, “So, did you smack Pumpkin on the way into school today?” “Uhhhh… yeah?” I replied, wondering how on earth she knew (not that this had been the first time either of us had delivered a little backseat justice).

Then she tells me, “Evidently another parent saw you do it from the car behind you, and took a picture of your license plate with her smartphone. Then she followed you to the school and went in to complain about it, saying she’d seen you hitting your kid!” Needless to say, I was shocked and more than a little appalled. Who does that?

The wife went on to say, “So the teacher she told had to tell the school officials. Who then had to interview our son.” Of course, when they said, “Did your dad hit you in the car this morning?” he replied, “He didn’t hit me… I ducked!”

This school official is a reasonable person who knows us, and she says she totally understood what happened, but she let us know she was required by law to file a report with Child Protective Services (for a poorly delivered car-swat!).

Fortunately, she could report it was nothing to be concerned about and didn’t have to give them my name or anything. But still! And she told my wife to pass on to me this: “You might just need to be more careful with how you discipline the kids in public.” (In public! I was in my wimpy little car!)

This Could Easily Escalate

I don’t think anything else will come of this, although last night, there was a county police car driving by my house (which almost never happens), evidently looking for an address he couldn’t find. “Did this busybody report me to the police?” I had to wonder.

Every other parent I’ve told it to has been incensed, ready to deliver a backseat swatting of his own to this unknown complainer.

I know under state law it’s okay to deliver a little physical discipline to your kids. At least as of today. But who knows. Maybe she’d exaggerate, as she obviously imagined something much worse than the reality of the situation. Even though this case is completely ridiculous, we’ve all seen and heard more than enough cases of the police or Child Protective Services overstepping their bounds.

What if the people at our school hadn’t known us, and weren’t so commonsense about it? What if they too jumped to conclusions and started putting words in my kids’ mouths? It’s not so farfetched.

As I’ve shared the story, every other parent I’ve told it to has been incensed, ready to deliver a backseat swatting of his own to this unknown complainer. So perhaps it’s just as well we don’t actually know who it is.

She knows who I am, though. Or, at least, she knows my car. I’m sure she’s out there now, talking to her fellow helicopter parents, possibly encouraging them to try a little black helicoptering of their own. I imagine her congratulating herself for her bravery, pointing fingers and whispering to the other parents (“There’s the one who abuses his kids!”). So I’m left to wonder, “Which one of these is the culprit? Who’s been watching me?”

Parent Like Me Or I’ll Tell Big Brother

So, Black Helicopter Mom, if somehow you end up reading this, stop and think about the possible consequences of your behavior. You hover around, safe in your anonymity, but you could conceivably do real damage to a family, and you’ve already done real damage to the sense of community at our school.

Is this the future? Will we see more people spying on each other, using their smartphones for a little high-tech tattle-tale-ing? Calling the authorities to handle things they won’t bring up to people to their faces? Expanding their helicoptering and over-parenting past their coddled offspring out to everyone else’s? I think we can count on it.

So look out. You may not have anything to fear from the black helicopters of the United Nations or whoever else. But the black helicopter parents could be after you next!",https://thefederalist.com/2016/02/09/black-helicopter-parents-use-the-police-to-enforce-their-parenting-style/,2016-02-09
Bernie Sanders Reaches Out To Al Sharpton,"Following the New Hampshire primary where he smoked Hillary Clinton by 22 points, Bernie Sanders made a stop in Harlem to visit with Al Sharpton.

The two men hugged at the entrance of Sylvia’s then spent 20 minutes together talking about affirmative action and police misconduct. The meeting was arranged at Sanders’ request, according to The Washington Post.

While Sharpton tweeted about the friendly sit-down (here and here), Sanders’ Twitter feed remained silent on the subject, simply posting a tweet later in the day, saying, “As President, let me be very clear that no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will.”

Still, he made no mention of meeting with Sharpton, preferring to tweet about his interview with “The View.” After the meeting, Sanders left without addressing the crowd, leaving that task to Sharpton.

“It is very important that he sent a signal that on the morning after a historic victory — it’s the widest margin we’ve seen in the history of New Hampshire — he would come to Harlem and have breakfast with me,” Sharpton said.

Bernie Needs Black Voters

Sanders lags behind Clinton in support among the black community, and the meeting was clearly an effort to bridge that gap, though it’s not the first. He has reached out to the black community before, interviewing with Ebony magazine last fall and sending a black female campaign advisor to grace the pages of Essence magazine. But now that he’s heading to South Carolina, where he has trailed Clinton by 55 points among blacks, he needs to step up his game.

Sanders’ problem is that he’s from one of the whitest states. Blacks, Asians, Native Americans, and Latinos make up only 6.8 percent of Vermont’s population. While blacks would find most of Sanders’ policies acceptable, many of them just don’t know who he is. He also hasn’t interjected much into the debate around police misconduct. He has stuck to his message about economic inequality—something Black Lives Matter protestors haven’t appreciated. They also didn’t appreciate when he walked out on them at a campaign event.

But Al Sharpton Has a Tarnished Reputation

If Sanders wants to build bridges with blacks, Sharpton might not be the way to go, because the “civil rights leader” doesn’t have the best relationship with people in his own community. Despite being a spokesman for the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, many in the black community see Sharpton as an opportunist who is always angling for personal gain.

In 2014, when Sharpton tried to interject himself into the funeral of Akai Gurley, who was shot dead by a rookie police officer in a housing project in Brooklyn, the family told him to stay away.

Sharpton held a news conference at the time, promising to deliver a eulogy at the wake. But Gurley’s aunt told TMZ: “Al Sharpton came in, put his name on the situation, but has not even made one single call to the parents of Akai.” All Sharpton sees, she said, “is money and political gain and he is turning the tragedy into a circus.”

More recently, in Ferguson, young black protests chanted “F— Al Sharpton!” and said he was a limelight-loving leech on the Black Lives Matter movement. Sharpton responded by calling them stupid. One of the protesters, and founder of New Yorkers Against Bratton, accused Sharpton of wrestling for control of a movement that’s leaving him behind.

If Sanders wants to make connections with black voters, maybe he should stick to Ebony and Essence magazines and stay away from quickie meetings with Al Sharpton in Harlem restaurants.

David Bowie’s Last Bows To His Past,"Judging by the entertainment media frenzy accompanying the issue of David Bowie’s latest album “Blackstar” on the multimedia star’s 69th birthday (coincidentally also the birthday of Elvis Presley) the singer/songwriter/provocateur had released 2016’s equivalent of “Pet Sounds,” “Sgt. Pepper,” and “Exile on Main Street.” It’s good, but not that good.

In fact, it’s also not as good as Bowie’s landmark albums of the 1970s, but it’s a compelling album just the same, especially when listened to as the final chapter of Bowie’s recorded output.

That he died a mere two days after its release had writers scrambling to find Easter eggs in Bowie’s “Blackstar” lyrics. Yes, the album contains lyrical examinations of mortality alongside the flashes of creative wonderment that characterized the majority of his musical compositions. However, “Blackstar” is also at times bleak, a condition underscored by lyrical ambiguity and sometimes offensive imagery featured in the title track’s accompanying video.

I’ll return to all that after a brief prologue.

It’s All There on that Glorious Vinyl

It’s hard to imagine my experiences in the 1970s devoid of Ziggy Stardust and the Thin White Duke. I recall hearing “Changes,” “Space Oddity,” and “Rebel, Rebel” on the radio; borrowing “Aladdin Sane” and “Pinups” from my older brother’s girlfriend; grooving on “Diamond Dogs” in a high-school classmate’s car while she smoked Marlboro Reds and shared with me several sips from a bottle of Annie Green Springs Berry Frost; snapping my fingers to “Young Americans” when Bowie performed it on “Soul Train;” missing my 45 of “TVC15”/“GoldenYears” when a younger sibling filched it to take to school; and buying “Heroes” the week it was released.

Despite my youthful fascination with most things Bowie, his public persona seemed more a parody of hipster rock star rather than the real deal.

By the time Bowie hooked up with Soupy Sales’ kids in Tin Machine in the late 1980s, it had become apparent his once remarkable talent had gone fallow, perhaps never to return. Ever optimistic, I waited for its resurgence with much the same degree of anticipation as Vladimir and Estragon in some multi-decade, musical version of a Sam Beckett play.

Despite my youthful fascination with most things Bowie, his public persona seemed more a parody of hipster rock star rather than the real deal. His videos—for all the bizarreness, freaky costumes, and Luis Bunuel references—seemed mere Euro-trash, existentialist, avant-garde posturing, and not far from his coldly detached, ennui-laden performance in “The Hunger.” Seriously, has any other rock video star employed a prop cigarette with as much world-weary aplomb?

His music, for the most part, was only as good as his creative partnership with whatever guitarist he may have been working at the time, and the list extends from Mick Ronson and Carlos Alomar to Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Fripp, and Adrian Belew. Of course, one cannot ignore the creative sparks ignited by further collaborations with Mott the Hoople, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Brian Eno, and—lest we forget—Bing Crosby and Queen.

While all told it was a mixed-bag, my appreciation of Bowie could be summed up best by quoting Pete Townshend: “It’s all there on the vinyl.” Some of that vinyl was glorious indeed. Having hooked me in the 1970s, I checked in on Bowie from time to time to see what he was up to in subsequent decades.

Weird Prophetic Tone

What did Bowie do after nearly five decades and more than 20 studio albums into his career to recapture the attention of his core audience and win new fans to his oeuvre? Contrary to other reviews I’ve read thus far of “Blackstar,” he didn’t go full-throttle jazz, because if he did it wouldn’t reflect Bowie’s wide-ranging musical restlessness.

On ‘Blackstar’ Bowie went so far as to invent a new sub-genre, which I dub Apocalyptic Soundtrack Jazz.

Bowie has always incorporated elements of jazz into his music, which made albums like “Low” prime fodder for other composers such as Philip Glass to adapt for their own purposes. On “Blackstar” Bowie went so far as to invent a new sub-genre, which I dub Apocalyptic Soundtrack Jazz.

Not that such a designation renders the album as a whole devoid of merit. After several hearings, the album sonically concocts a weird prophetic tone perfect for an evening of celebrating a world in the grips of spiritual entropy. The two videos released from the album thus far, for example, depict Bowie as a blindfolded prophet with buttons sewed over the singer’s covered eyes.

But this is where I take exception to the creative vision of Bowie (and his video director, John Renck) alluded to above. The video for the title track features discovery of a bejeweled astronaut skull (the remains of Major Tom?), Cthulu, twitching individuals engaged in dark ceremonies and, most disturbingly, three dancers erotically writhing on crucifixes and Bowie panning Anton LaVey’s “Satanic Bible” across the screen.

Substituting Blasphemy for Creativity

LaVey, founder of the Church of Satanism, exhibited a flair for dramatic exhibitionism by referring to himself as “the most evil man in the world.” To quote an email from my friend, Karl Nilsson, an advertising copywriter and graphic designer in southeast Michigan: “Whenever a pop star (or modern artist or filmmaker) runs out of ideas, they substitute blasphemy for creativity.” Referencing the science-fiction- and psychedelic-drug-inspired British rock band, Nilsson added: “I saw most of this claptrap at a Hawkwind concert decades ago.”

Left to viewers’ interpretation is whether Bowie believes in any of the “time is a flat circle” twaddle or is delving deeper into sinister cultural archetypes in order to depict our troubled times. According to “Blackstar” guitarist Ben Monder, Bowie told him the song ostensibly deals with ISIS, but longtime Bowie producer and collaborator Tony Visconti, for one, disputes that reading.

One thing’s for certain, however, and that is “Space Oddity” was Bowie’s breakthrough hit. It’s also the song that introduced Major Tom, who subsequently reappeared in “Ashes to Ashes.” The Major Tom persona, then, is the recurring alternate stage presence of Bowie’s career. He never returned to Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke thematically or visually, but those jewels embedded on the astronaut’s skull in the “Blackstar” video certainly point toward an identification of Major Tom with Bowie’s initial and subsequent commercial success. In the latter video, a woman retrieves the skull and uses it as an object of cultish veneration.

Venerating what, exactly? Listeners are told again and again by the narrator of “Blackstar” that he isn’t a film star, a pop star, a porn star, a gang star, or a marvel star, yet the Blackstar says:

How many times does an angel fall?

How many people lie instead of talking tall?

He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd …

I’m a blackstar, way up, on money, I’ve got game

I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain

I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes….

You’re a flash in the pan (I’m not a marvel star)

I’m the Great I Am (I’m a blackstar).

Is Bowie singing in character as I Am, the Greek Eimi, or Jehovah, proclaiming he’s not a superhero? Or is he invoking a false prophet, an ISIS fighter—or could he deliberately be attempting to invert the Judeo-Christian God as the fallen angel Satan, hence the LaVey reference?

Something happened on the day he died

Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside

Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried

(I’m a blackstar, I’m a star’s star, I’m a blackstar)

The remainder of the album utilizes the band of saxophonist and bandleader Donny McCaslin, which includes drummer Mark Guiliana, keyboardist Jason Lindner, and bassist Tim Lefebvre, to great effect. “Lazarus,” written by Bowie for his Broadway stage production of the same name and sequel to the Nicholas Roeg 1976 cinematic mindbender “The Man Who Fell to Earth,” resembles the saxophone-drenched soundscape of “Sons of the Silent Age” from “Heroes.”

Ben Monder plays guitar on the album’s closing song, “I Can’t Give Everything Away,” and does a superb job of recreating Robert Fripp’s masterful work on Bowie’s classic late 1970s Berlin Trilogy albums, which included “Low,” “Heroes,” and “Lodger.” The harmonica heard in the background of the same song also hearkens back to “A New Career in a New Town” from “Low.” The song “Girl Loves Me” is a lyrical nod to Anthony Burgess’ “Clockwork Orange” married to mid-1970s London gay patois.

“Blackstar” is a step up from Bowie’s “comeback” album from 2013, “Next Day,” which was intriguing and kicked open the creative door for this swan song. “Blackstar” captures a terminal Bowie inching in a direction even more aesthetically satisfying and able to stand on its own musical and lyrical merits rather than trolling out occult props to provide edginess and relevance.

"Yes, Planned Parenthood Targets And Hurts Poor Black Women","Last year, my buddy (we’ll call him “Andy”) told me how his girlfriend (“Helen”) had a terrible weekend. Helen worked as an overnight nurse at a local hospital’s emergency room. In the early hours of Saturday morning, a young woman who had recently had an abortion came in, deathly sick, with septic shock.

It was determined that pieces of the fetus, not completely removed during the procedure, led to the sepsis. Later that day, another young woman came in who had just had an abortion, also with sepsis caused by fetal remains.

“Helen’s pretty shaken up,” Andy said. “She says both girls almost died.” I asked Andy about the two young women. Both were black, and about Helen’s age; both had their abortions at the local Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Paul, Minnesota. I then explained to Andy that Planned Parenthood generally doesn’t use ultrasound when performing abortions—it costs too much and takes too much time, cutting down on margins.

Not using ultrasound is like operating with a blindfold. The abortionist can “feel around” for fetal tissue, but doesn’t want to feel around too much, as this would risk perforating the lining of the uterus. “That’s so sad, so messed up,” said Andy, who until then had been largely agnostic about abortion.

Planned Parenthood and its fellow abortion providers are no friends to black women, yet they are heavily subsidized by Congress. Rep. Gwen Moore recently argued the opposite in the Washington Post, that “Abortion clinics don’t ‘target’ the black community.” That’s plain false. Look at the facts, partisanship aside.

Watch for the Statistical Dodge

Moore begins by citing a commonly used Guttmacher Institute statistic (Guttmacher is Planned Parenthood’s research arm): “fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majority-black neighborhoods.”

This statistic is spurious. Because black Americans comprise only 12 percent of the U.S. population, relatively few areas in America are majority black. By neighborhood, Guttmacher means ZIP code. Only 2 to 4 percent of U.S. ZIP codes have a majority black population. Only 3 percent of counties have a majority black population.

It makes business sense for Planned Parenthood to reside in urban areas with high concentrations of people, of which a high portion are poor.

Using Guttmacher’s own findings, however, almost 10 percent of America’s high-volume abortion clinics (performing more than 400 abortions per year) exist in those majority-black ZIP codes. Clinics in neighborhoods where non-whites are the majority, only around 15 percent of U.S. neighborhoods, make up 40 percent of all abortion clinics in the United States. This means that, even on Guttmacher’s own showing, abortion clinics are indeed disproportionately found where the local population is predominantly minorities.

Guttmacher’s misleading statistic on “black neighborhoods” was contrived to counter a statistic put out by a pro-life group. This group pointed out that 79 percent of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities are located within a two-mile radius, or walking distance of, a black or Hispanic neighborhood (what the Census Bureau calls a tract), defined as either having a “minority population at or above 50 percent,” “minority populations at least 1.5 times higher than the average percentage of the surrounding county,” or “a minority population equal to or greater than the average national minority population: 12.6 percent African American or 16.3 percent Hispanic/Latino.”

The numbers don’t lie. Abortion clinics do disproportionately reside in minority neighborhoods. Planned Parenthood, especially, resides in urban, poor, and minority areas. This is no conspiracy. Rather, it makes business sense for Planned Parenthood to reside in urban areas with high concentrations of people, of which a high portion are poor.

Poverty Doesn’t Explain This

Moore says “[conservatives’] goal is to intimidate and inflict trauma while limiting the health care choices for pregnant women in need.” She goes on to blame poverty and the lack of proper contraceptive access for the stunningly high black abortion rate—abortions of black children make up almost 40 percent of total U.S. abortions each year, despite black Americans comprising only 12 percent of the population.

Abortions of black children make up almost 40 percent of total U.S. abortions each year, despite black Americans comprising only 12 percent of the population.

Poverty alone does not explain the high black abortion rate. There are almost twice as many poor whites as there are poor blacks in America, yet black women who live below the federal poverty line contribute to 14 percent of the nation’s abortions, while poor white women contribute to only 11.7 percent of the nation’s abortions.

Poverty also fails to explain the lack of birth-control access among poor black American women. In the 1990s, even though Title X funding steadily increased and the poverty rate fell, the number of unintended pregnancies poor minority women had began to skyrocket. That trend persists until the present. According to the American Prospect, while the average abortion patient used to be “[a] middle-class, white high-school or college student with no children whose bright future could be derailed by motherhood,” today she is more likely to be “a twenty something single mother of color,” because an unexplained “[l]oss of [birth control] access for poorer [minority] women” occurred in the first half of that decade.

What then, can explain the high black abortion rate? Moore decries the lack of birth control access among poor black women even while Planned Parenthood gets millions every year from the public purse to provide contraception to low-income women. Are these women served well? Guttmacher reports that “minority women, women who are poor, and women with little education are more likely than women overall to report dissatisfaction with either their contraceptive method or provider.” Isn’t Planned Parenthood their main contraception provider?

Blame Planned Parenthood for Its Clients’ Poor Access

As I’ve extensively outlined in the past, Planned Parenthood is to blame for the high black abortion rate. Because black Americans are disproportionately poor, black women of childbearing age disproportionately rely on Medicaid, or are uninsured. Black Americans also disproportionately reside in urban areas.

Planned Parenthood is like the Veterans Administration, only Planned Parenthood is actually efficient at abortion.

Planned Parenthood is also largely urban-focused, mostly due to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and Title X. Title X essentially pays Planned Parenthood to locate next to poor populations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which allowed states to regulate abortion providers, brought higher fixed costs, increasing the appeal of urban areas to leverage economies of scale through higher abortion volumes. Planned Parenthood gained immense market share after Casey was decided in 1992, due to competitors’ retrenchment in the face of the regulatory onslaught, and this strengthened monopolistic power corresponds with the loss of birth-control access that occurred among poor women during this time.

Next, women in urban areas who are uninsured or receive Medicaid (who are also disproportionately black) find few choices outside the local Planned Parenthood affiliate. Medicaid grossly under-compensates providers who don’t also receive Title X funds (of which Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient), and Title X providers offer the only avenue for uninsured women to receive women’s health care.

Rather than empowering women, this system accomplishes the opposite, namely through lack of choice.

Rather than empowering women, this system accomplishes the opposite, namely through lack of choice. According to a Guttmacher study, 6 in 10 women who visited a “specialty contraceptive clinic” (a Title X grantee) considered the clinic their “usual source of medical care,” while 4 in 10 women surveyed considered the clinic their “only source of health care.” Because this study only looked at clinics in areas with multiple Title X grantees, many women frequenting Planned Parenthood experience an even greater lack of choice.

Due to this lack of competition, Planned Parenthood is free to undersupply its low-margin or loss-making product, contraception, to steer customers towards abortion, its high-margin product. A similar situation was seen in post-Soviet Romania, where doctors were heavily compensated for abortion relative to birth control. I estimated that between 30 and 50 percent of Planned Parenthood’s $91 million in profit during its last reported fiscal year comes from abortion. Planned Parenthood is like the Veterans Administration, only Planned Parenthood is actually efficient at abortions, a cash business with high profit margins.

Poor Black Women Suffer to Protect Democrats

To Moore and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, along with the rest of the Democrat Party: I understand you are for “choice,” but how long can you put your party’s interests above the interests of poor, black women? Many of these women directly support you, through volunteering, donating, and voting. Will they never find out what is being done? Will the light of day never shine through?

Let them compete for the funds with other OB-GYNs, and let the consumer decide who gets the money.

Congress could act now to end the high black abortion rate. Foster competition: Give every poor woman a “women’s health insurance” card they are free to use at any OB-GYN in the nation. Pay for this with the Title X funds currently allocated to Planned Parenthood. Lawmakers should agree that this insurance can’t be used for abortion—that’s already the status quo with Title X. Republicans would surely increase funding for women’s health care under such a program.

Don’t worry: if Planned Parenthood is so great, it will still be around. Let it compete with other OB-GYNs for the funds, and let the women who use these services decide who gets the money.

Black lives matter. And the lives of black babies matter, too. Let’s act to protect them now.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that black women comprise 12 percent of the U.S. population. Black men and women together comprise that 12 percent. We regret the error.

Watch A Black Lives Matter Activist Get In Hillary Clinton's Face,"During a campaign fundraiser in South Carolina Wednesday night, a Black Lives Matter activist interrupted Hillary Clinton to criticize her for comments she made in 1996.

While Clinton was speaking in an intimate gathering of what appears to be about a dozen or so people, a BLM activist stood behind the presidential candidate holding a handwritten sign that read: “We have to bring them to heel,” a reference to a comment Clinton made in the ’90s.

“Will you apologize to black people about mass incarceration?” the unidentified girl asked.

“I know that you called black people ‘superpredators’ in 1994,” she said. “You owe black people an apology.”

The girl was eventually escorted away, and shortly afterward Clinton is heard saying: “Okay now, back to the issues,” before continuing her speech.

The “superpredators” comment the BLM activist referred to is one Clinton made in 1996 about community policing and cracking down on gang violence.

“We also have to have an organized effort against gangs,” she said. “They are not just gangs of kids anymore, they are often the kinds of kids that are called ‘superpredators.’ [They have] no conscience, no empathy, and we can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.”

Recently, former NAACP president Ben Jealous, who recently endorsed Bernie Sanders, has been accusing Clinton of pushing the “superpredator” theory — a line of rhetoric prevalent in the ’90s that theorized many of the worst criminal offenders were already a lost cause at a very young age, thus juvenile offenders should be punished more harshly.

As Mediate pointed out, the “superpredators” narrative was often racially motivated and has since been debunked. However, Clinton’s comment is far less damning when put in proper context, though it is still a little uncomfortable to watch her talk about it.

This isn’t the first time Clinton has said something cringe-worthy about black people. Last July, she admitted that she thinks black men in hoodies are scary.

“I mean if we’re honest, for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear,” Clinton said.

In August, she had an uncomfortable conversation with Black Lives Matter activists, during which she told them she would only talk to white people about racial issues.

“Respectfully, if that is your position, then I will talk only to white people about how we are going to deal with the very real problems,” she said.

Currently, Clinton is beating Sanders in the polls in South Carolina by an average of 57-33. Among black voters, she has a 47 percent lead, according to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.

Hillary To Black Voter: Why Don't You Go Run For Something,"During a campaign stop at a coffee shop in Minnesota on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton told a young black woman to “go run for something” if she wouldn’t support the former secretary of State’s bid for the White House.

According to The Hill, the woman was confronting Clinton about the remarks she has made in the past, including comments she made about “super-predators” in 1996. Some people have taken those comments as digs at black men.

Clinton made reference to meeting a Somali-American city council member, presumably Abdi Warsame of the Minneapolis City Council, yet the woman persisted in arguing with Clinton.

“You know what, dear, you have a different opinion,” Clinton said. “He is a Somali-American elected to the city council. I’m really proud of that.”

After the woman disagreed with her again, Clinton fired back: “Why don’t you go run for something then?”

“I’m working for a Somali-American,” the woman said.

“Well, good!” Clinton exclaimed. “Good luck to you!”

Watch the whole confrontation here:

This isn’t the first time Clinton has been confronted about her record on racial issues. Last week, a Black Lives Matter protestor interrupted one of Clinton’s fundraisers to demand an apology on her past remarks about “super-predators” — a line of rhetoric that popularized the notion that some of the worst criminal offenders were doomed from a very young age.

This isn’t the first time Clinton has said something cringe-worthy about black people, either. Last July, she admitted she thinks black men in hoodies are scary.

“I mean if we’re honest, for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear,” Clinton said.

Bill Clinton Wants 'Black Lives Matter' Protesters To Shut Up,"At a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday, former president Bill Clinton was repeatedly interrupted by Black Lives Matter activists while delivering a stump speech for his wife’s campaign. What he said in response quickly shut them down.

One of the activists reportedly carried a sign that referenced Hillary Clinton’s use in 1996 of the term “super-predator” to describe young black people. That sign prompted Bill Clinton to launch into a lengthy defense of his administration’s crackdown on crime and welfare abuse in the 1990’s, policies which have come under repeated attack by black activists.

“I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African American children!” Clinton said.

“Maybe you thought they were good citizens, [but] she [Hillary Clinton] didn’t!” he said. “You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter. Tell the truth! You are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns.”

“They say the welfare reform bill increased poverty,” the former president said. “Then why did we have the largest drop in African-American poverty in history?”

Black Lives Matter activists have repeatedly foiled Clinton’s campaign events and have objected to comments she made in the past about “super-predators” — an idea popularized in the ’90s that theorized many of the worst criminals became a lost cause at a young age. Some, including former NAACP president Ben Jealous, have taken this to be a dig at black men.

Clinton’s comments about “super-predators” aren’t the only cringe-worthy remarks she has made about black people. As The Federalist reported last July, she admitted that black men wearing hoodies can be scary.

“I mean if we’re honest, for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear,” Clinton said.

“Respectfully, if that is your position, then I will talk only to white people about how we are going to deal with the very real problems,” Clinton said.

Stop Trying To Replace White Privilege With Black Privilege,"The Gap has come under fire from people screaming racism after releasing this ad featuring a group of young girls from an acrobatic troop. Some people complained it was offensive that the white girls seemed to be displaying all the power and the black girl was just there to prop up her white counterpart.

Full disclosure: I’m black. My kids are black. My husband is black. We’re black people! We also happen to live in a majority-white suburb that is still fairly diverse but severely lacking in black Americans specifically.

I say all this to explain that I do feel a certain sensitivity to raising black children in a part of the country where they don’t have too many other black friends to identify with. We often joke that we are the family from “Blackish,” always straddling that line between enjoying the suburban comforts we worked so hard to earn our way to and maintaining a connection to our communities—keeping them street smart, if you will.

So when I see stories like this my ears immediately perk up. Race isn’t an everyday obsession for our family, but it is something we think and talk about from time to time.

But, people, please. This has got to stop. This is not a picture of a white girl holding a noose around a black child’s neck. This is not a picture of a young black woman being swept away by firehoses. This is a picture of four striking young ladies. It’s a clothing ad.

Don’t Take Exception to Our Race

What if the people who shot that photo weren’t thinking of that little girl as “the black one”? What if when they were choosing order and poses they weren’t agonizing over how to treat “the black one”? Isn’t that what we want? Isn’t that what we’ve been asking for?

You’re asking my kids to be bitter instead of gracious; angry instead of grateful.

I don’t want people to ignore our race (I think it’s silly when people try to tell me they don’t see race). Neither do I want people taking exception to our race. If you’re one of those people who would complain about an ad, like this think about what you’re saying to me, as a parent—and to my children. You’re telling my kids that if they’re not favored or their feelings aren’t taken into account first and foremost when dealing with white people that they are the victims of racism.

My children are alive in the most free, prosperous nation in the history of the planet. They have many blessings that (quite literally) the majority of people on this planet would die for and maybe even kill for. Certainly many die trying to get here for those very blessings every day. You’re asking my kids to be bitter instead of gracious; angry instead of grateful. Then you wonder where the “angry black man/woman” stereotype comes from and why it’s so hard to shed.

Let’s Not Create ‘Black Privilege’

Do I have to explain to you how difficult it is to raise responsible, respectful, resourceful children when everyone is telling them they needn’t be any of those things because their skin color is more important than their attitudes? When my son walks in to his first job interview I don’t want those employers to wring their hands over how to handle this young black man (so no one thinks they’re being racists!) or even hire him just because he’s black. I want him to be seen as any other candidate.

If he is exceptional, I want it to be because he has worked very hard to become exceptional, not just because he’s black.

If he is exceptional, I want it to be because he has worked very hard to become exceptional, not just because he’s black. That’s insulting. It is the very opposite of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “dream” in which people are judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.

We want white people to stop looking at us as “others” while demanding they pay special attention to our race as a condition of every interaction with us. In effect, we’re asking them to replace “white privilege” with “black privilege.”

Well, count me out of all this ridiculous microaggressing and special snowflake weirdness. I am not raising my children to be privileged, even though as middle-class suburbanites they currently live one of the most privileged lives on the planet (as do you if you are reading this from ANYWHERE in America).

Get a Life, People

I’m raising my kids to be humble, to earn their way to the things they want, to be respectful of those in authority and those whom they choose to serve as Christians and generous Americans. I’m raising them see themselves as a part of whatever community in which they choose to put down roots. They are not “others.” They are Americans, and if they’re the only black kids in a community full of people who are different from them I expect them to adapt and succeed, not melt into a puddle of tears.

Asking them to suddenly demand other people think about their race before their personhood is asking them to regress.

There is not one thing they cannot do in this country if they are willing to put in the time and the effort. They have every available comfort and right. They can vote (when they are of age), work, earn, go to school, drive, marry who they want, eat where they want. Asking them to suddenly demand other people think about their race before their personhood is asking them to regress. You’re asking me to raise people who look to others to validate them instead of looking to their God, themselves, and the people who actually know and love them. This is unacceptable. Worse, it’s childish.

Are the people who made that Gap ad racists? I have no idea, since I’ve not met one person involved in its creation. Are they insensitive? Maybe. Does it matter? Nope.

Tomorrow my kids will wake up do their chores and their homework, and their parents will go to work and we’ll eat dinner in our home with our pets and our Internet and our comfy chairs and we’ll dream together about our futures. Just like we do every day.

Civil Rights And The Sexual Revolution Need A Divorce,"“Intersectionality”—or discussing feminism always within the context of fighting racism and class inequality—is a sacred goal championed by feminists like Eleanor Robertson of the Guardian. She describes it as “one of the most important ideas that feminist scholarship has ever come up with.”

Maybe intersectionality would be possible if only the gender part of this equation did not fall under the umbrella of the sexual revolution. Second-wave feminism, punctuated by the early 1960s publications of Helen Gurley Brown’s “Sex and the Single Girl” and Betty Friedan’s “Feminine Mystique,” became something of a traffic accident.

Timing is everything. The shift to a new conception of women’s rights came shortly after rebellious white men had declared war on chastity and marriage. The early 1950s saw the launch of Hugh Hefner’s Playboy and the debut of Arthur Miller’s “Crucible,” while the late 1950s saw the publication of Norman Mailer’s seminal essay, “The White Negro.” Pornography went pop. Naked bodies became something male consumers were entitled to see for a price. The more pastors and church ladies inveighed against dirty magazines, the more boys came to see consuming porn as an act of political liberation rather than as the ancient, embarrassing habit of onanism. Marilyn Monroe was a key link between this major cultural shift and “The Crucible,” since she posed for Playboy and soon married Arthur Miller.

How Sexual Promiscuity Became Cool

Miller’s “Crucible” used the Salem witch trials as an obvious allegory for the repressions of creative people by Wisconsin Rep. Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Miller’s play reinforced the association in Americans’ minds between sexually judgmental Puritans and their penchant for political persecution. Puritan Hester Prynne of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “Scarlet Letter” was a returning specter in the American conscience, a symbol of sexual heroism, the martyr whose defiance of oppression consisted of eroticism forbidden by snoopy matrons and emasculated hypocrites.

These strong messages converged in Norman Mailer’s chronicling of the hipster movement. While maintaining some ironic distance from the hipsters in “The White Negro,” Mailer furthers the period’s habit of framing radicalism sexually. Mailer implies that white male sexual transgression could be a revolutionary act against political repression, equivalent to black families facing fire hoses and bulldogs to enroll in white schools. Here is an excerpt from “The White Negro”:

Knowing in the cells of his existence that life was war, nothing but war, the Negro (all exceptions admitted) could rarely afford the sophisticated inhibitions of civilization, and so … he lived in the enormous present, he subsisted for his Saturday night kicks, relinquishing the pleasures of the mind for the more obligatory pleasures of the body, and in his music he gave voice to the character and quality of his existence, to his rage and the infinite variations of joy, lust, languor, growl, cramp, pinch, scream and despair of his orgasm. For jazz is orgasm, it is the music of orgasm, good orgasm and bad, and so it spoke across a nation…

Mailer celebrates the freeing effect of “orgasm” embodied in “jazz,” a black art form outside the “sophisticated inhibitions of civilization.” Yet the black civil rights movement of the 1950s was led by orderly Christian family men who wanted desegregated schools for their children, voting rights, and relief from police harassment. The fight against racism was not waged by promiscuous men ejaculating while listening to jazz.

Once, Women Deserved Honor

Civil rights as we have come to romanticize them are really more a creature of the conformist 1950s than a spawn of the chaotic 1960s. In 1954, the Supreme Court handed down Brown v. Board of Education; ten years later, Congress passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This mere decade saw the quantum leaps in anti-discrimination law commonly associated with civil-rights nostalgia, as well as the most heroic efforts to remedy centuries of ghastly racism.

Civil rights as we have come to romanticize them are really more a creature of the conformist 1950s than a spawn of the chaotic 1960s.

It all begin with Brown. The Supreme Court received expert testimony from researchers Kenneth and Mamie Clark, who had observed that black children were more likely to play with white dolls than with black ones, because they thought the white dolls were prettier.

“What does the doll experiment in Brown tell us about the long-dead culture of the 1950s?” I asked my students, as we were discussing Brown in relation to the film “Show Boat” (1951), starring Ava Gardner and Howard Keel. The 1950s were simultaneously very racist and yet a time when a more conservative Hollywood had forged a powerful national consensus about marriage and family values. “Show Boat” could successfully appeal to American audiences with its tragic plot of racism, because the mulatta character Julie LaVerne (Ava Gardner) sings, “Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, I gotta love one man ‘til I die.” The moviegoers of 1951 had a widely understood cultural code that read Julie’s song as an ode to chastity, something everybody could embrace.

The decision in Brown v. Board of Education makes sense when we acknowledge the era’s traditional values about family, women, and children. In the early 1950s audiences worshipped women as icons of beauty and honor. The thought that little girls, the pinnacle of beautiful innocence, would be denied the dignity of envisioning dolls like themselves as lovely, prompted a country to mobilize and desegregate. There has been no comparable breakthrough since the decade after Brown.

A Chastity Culture Leads to Widely Dispersed Wealth

Racial stalemate stems partially from distorted memories of what catalyzed revolutionary change. Refashioning the 1950s through the fantastical lens of the 1960s, many in the New Left hallucinated that white men seeking to satisfy sexual urges without guilt were like black people resisting the Ku Klux Klan and state-imposed repression in the Deep South. Promiscuity and sleaziness were seen as allies of black liberation rather than as social traps.

Racial stalemate stems partially from distorted memories of what catalyzed revolutionary change.

Kevin Phillips’ 2002 book “Wealth and Democracy” graphs what happened to wealth inequality starting in the 1970s. For several decades, under both Republican and Democrat administrations, poverty had been high but income inequality had been low. Between the 1970s and 1990s these trends reversed. Official poverty rates dropped but the statistical gap between the wealth of the uppermost American elites and the middle class ballooned to the frightening scale of the Gilded Age. Racial inequality reflected this trend. By the 1990s, median household wealth for whites was $18,100, contrasted against $200 for black families and $0 for Latino families.

Marxists contend that this slide could be traced to expansion of multinational corporations and globalized “late capitalism.” Equally valid but often ignored is the objection by social conservatives: The Eisenhower years saw a powerful chastity culture, which resulted in stable households. This enabled families to amass private equity in homes, savings, and automobiles.

Although the children of these 1950s parents ended up reveling in no-fault divorce and rampant promiscuity, the nest eggs trickled down as family inheritances. White families by and large enjoyed the lasting benefits of 1950s chastity culture, whereas most of today’s Latino families did not have ancestors in the country by the 1950s; their parents or grandparents immigrated to an America that was already sexually decadent and plagued by divorce.

Black families of the era were prevented from reaping the benefits of Christian chastity because of institutionalized racism. The civil rights movement shattered the apparatus of Jim Crow, but the sexual revolution shattered the stable culture that would have allowed them to build what white families built during the Eisenhower era.

Where Christians and Feminists Should Agree

Feminism also suffered from its incongruous ties to the male revolt against chastity. The sexual revolution predated second-wave feminism and framed women’s rights in terms of birth control, fornication, pornography, abortion, and no-fault divorce: all things that left them increasingly available, vulnerable, and disposable, to men.

So where does this leave us now?

Symptomatic of our current state is the stunningly sexist war of wards between Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz over their wives’ looks, sexual desirability, and propriety. Bryan Fischer, blogging at the website of the American Family Association, writes that Trump is “Beneath Contempt” because of his comments regarding women. His column begins: “This column is not about politics. It is about basic human decency, civility, and respect for women” (emphasis added).

Matt Walsh wrote this in The Blaze at virtually the same time:

For the record, Donald Trump’s current wife — a woman 25 years his junior who used to take her clothes off and pose for pictures for money — is his third, who he married after dumping his second, Marla, with whom he cheated on his first, Ivana, who, according to allegations in a sworn deposition, he once brutally assaulted.



By the way, he has never repented, apologized, or admitted that he did anything wrong … He boasts of his adultery, happily recommends that other husbands leave their wives just as he did, encourages men to look at women as ‘pieces of ass,’ and advises them to ‘treat women like sh*t.’

While Fischer and Walsh were writing these “J’Accuse!” statements regarding Trump’s putative misogyny, countless feminists were decrying Trump as a misogynist for his vulgar tone toward Rosie O’Donnell, Megyn Kelly, and a woman who wanted to pump breast milk during a deposition.

In Trump’s views toward women there seem many things to hate, yet none of the complaints against him seem to stick, because the two groups taking most strenuous objection—Christian conservative men and feminists—have been at each other’s throats ever since the sexual revolution started and will never articulate a compelling argument to the public explaining what is so wrong with Trump’s conduct.

Both right and left complaints about Trump are often marred by special pleading and overuse of outdated anecdotal evidence against him. The allegations about Ivana Trump date back to almost 30 years ago. Claims about Trump’s treatment of journalist Selina Scott go back 20 years. The other hyperlinks Walsh provides lead to statements Trump published in 1997 or made in interviews going back to 2003.

As I argued recently in American Thinker, Christians cannot impute permanent, irreversible guilt to someone going back that far without undermining the entire premise of Christianity itself: repentance and changing for a better purpose.

Trump Treats Women As Feminists Demand

Second-wave feminism created Trump. Feeding on the scraps of Hefner’s and Mailer’s sleazy sex liberation, second-wave feminism misconstrued women’s plight as the consequences of chastity and patriarchy, which were actually cultural ideals that limited male behavior and forced men to sublimate their libido into chivalry and other respectful gestures toward women.

The anti-rape “yes means yes” consent laws governing college campuses are clumsily trying to replace the consent-focused purpose of marriage—“Do you take this man…”—without admitting that marriage was actually good for women. In a Buzzfeed video featuring feminists challenging male chauvinism, some of the feminist challenges are:

Why do you think we’re obsessed with you when we hook up?



[When we hook up], I just want you to leave too, I’m busy, I got s*** to do.



Why can’t I sleep with as many people as I want to, without being judged?

This landscape of transient female lust is only possible if there are men left in the wake of all these callous one-time encounters. Fifty years of life after “Sex and the Single Girl” lead to … Donald J. Trump. Told by feminists that he is damned for wanting a traditional commitment, and told by Christian conservatives that he is damned for giving women what feminists said they wanted, Trump plays to the middle ground, where misogyny blossoms. He is not an isolated phenomenon.

There’s much to criticize about divorce. But one divorce is necessary: It is time for “civil rights” and the “sexual revolution” (including feminism) to part ways. There is no intersectionality here, just poisonous cross-purposes. In the meantime, both feminists and social conservatives need to brace themselves for the possible words “President Donald J. Trump.” Karma.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/04/19/civil-rights-and-the-sexual-revolution-need-a-divorce/,2016-04-19
Virginia Tech Tells Black Columnist To Take A Hike,"Virginia Tech is totally cool with free speech, just so long as it doesn’t come from a black conservative who might offend the delicate sensibilities of cloistered campus progressives.

Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley says he was disinvited from speaking at Virginia Tech due to “concerns” among faculty members about topics raised in his book, “Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed.”

And how did Virginia Tech respond to claims that it disinvited a black conservative from speaking on campus? University officials claim that Riley couldn’t be disinvited because he was never invited to speak in the first place. That’s right: Virginia Tech’s response to the charge of specifically blacklisting a prominent minority voice is that it’s impossible because the school wouldn’t dare ask a black conservative to address the school’s faculty or students.

Riley pushed back against the university’s statement, explaining that Douglas Patterson, a finance professor at the university, sent him a written invitation in April which included an offer to pay for Riley’s expenses and to provide an honorarium for his time.

.@virginia_tech disinvited me to speak and now says I was never invited. Paper trail shows that’s a blatant lie. https://t.co/csaNUcCUtC Jason Riley (@jasonrileywsj) May 4, 2016

“I don’t buy this line that I wasn’t invited,” Riley told The Roanoke Times. “Based on my understanding of the English language it sounded like an invitation to me.”

Last week, Patterson wrote an e-mail to Riley explaining that other faculty members were reluctant to allow Riley to speak. Why? Patterson told Riley that faculty nixed Riley’s appearance because they were “worried about more protests” from campus progressives.

“[They] are worried about more protests from the looney left if you [Riley] were to give the lecture,” Patterson reportedly wrote in an email to Riley.

“I explained that if we allow ourselves to be intimidated by these people they win, and we lose,” Patterson wrote, according to Riley. “It was no use arguing, their minds were made up. Fear of a possible protest is more important than free speech or the values that a university is supposed to stand for.”

In a column published by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Riley wrote while this was his first time being disinvited from speaking on a college campus, his experience isn’t unprecedented:

I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been approached by conservative students after a lecture to a mostly liberal audience and thanked, almost surreptitiously, for coming to speak. They often offer an explanation for their relative silence during question periods when liberal students and faculty are firing away. ‘Being too outspoken would just make it more difficult,’ a Wellesley student once told me. ‘You get to leave when you’re done. We have to live with these people until we graduate.’ In April, I spoke at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where the college Republicans who invited me took the precaution of clearing my name with liberal student groups ‘to make sure they wouldn’t be upset.’ We’ve reached a point where conservatives must have their campus speakers preapproved by left-wing pressure groups. If progressives aren’t already in absolute control of academia, they’re pretty close.

Virginia Tech’s move to ban Riley from speaking on campus occurs just weeks after the invitation of another conservative speaker prompted outrage among students and liberal groups within the community.

This isn’t the first time campus leftists demanded a heckler’s veto over who can and can’t speak on the taxpayer-funded campus. In March, progressives not only demanded that scholar Charles Murray not be allowed to speak, the university went out of his way to slur Murray in an open letter. Patterson, the professor who invited Riley to speak, said the Virginia Tech president’s gratuitous swipe at Murray was “a cheap smear of a prominent scholar.”

Despite the outcry, Murray, who is white, was eventually allowed by campus officials to speak on campus in March. According to Virginia Tech statistics, two out of every three students on campus are white. While roughly 20 percent of Virginia’s overall population is black, a mere 4 percent of Virginia Tech students are black, according to university enrollment data.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/04/virginia-tech-just-disinvited-a-black-conservative-from-speaking-on-campus/,2016-05-04
The Forgotten History Of ‘The Black Silent Majority’,"At a 1973 bill-signing session, the pistol-packing Reverend Oberia Dempsey of Upper Park Avenue Church in Harlem praised Republican Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for heeding the calls of his community to get rid of drugs. The “Rockefeller drug laws” mandated life imprisonment for drug dealers.

Acknowledging that addicts needed treatment, Dempsey asserted, “We are not going to stand any longer and see decent citizens brutalized or subjected to punishment because someone is out there sick.” He added sarcastically, “And I’m sorry for the bleeding hearts, I’m sorry for all of the people who are over-sympathetic with criminals and under-sympathetic with decent citizens.”

Only one African-American legislator, Sen. Vander Beatty, voted for the legislation, although it fell short of his aim: capital punishment for drug dealers. But Dempsey was joined by the “black silent majority,” working- and middle-class citizens who saw their once-vibrant cultural center terrorized by drug pushers. Two hundred Harlemites took up firearms with Dempsey and patrolled their streets, tracking and reporting drug pushers to the police in “Operation Confiscation” and “Operation Interruption.” They also escorted women to church and to the market.

Such extraordinary stories are told in City University of New York sociologist Michael Javen Fortner’s “Black Silent Majority: The Rockefeller Drug Laws and the Politics of Punishment” (Harvard University Press, 2015). Fortner uses newspaper archives, meeting minutes, polls, surveys, oral histories, interviews, legislative hearing records, and even fiction and drama to piece together a compelling narrative about a community fighting for its life. Except for the occasional lapse into academic jargon (“the ebb of Fordism,” for example), this is fascinating reading. It is changing the conversation about mandatory minimum drug laws.

A Surge of Interest in Controversial Black History

The book began receiving attention in advance of its release in September, with the Chronicle of Higher Education devoting a long feature article to it in August, which led to an interview later in the month on radio station WIND, in Chicago, then one on WNYC in September.

It pushes against the narrative about the ‘new Jim Crow,’ drug laws that have led to the disproportionate rate of African-American incarceration.

A first book, it garnered immediate attention from quarters that would make any author envious, including The New York Times, New Yorker, New York Magazine, Daily Beast, and Salon. A couple weeks after its release, Fortner wrote an op-ed for the The New York Times, addressing police shootings of black men that had spurred protests and sometimes riots. In January, he spoke at the Manhattan Institute. The New York Academy of History gave him the award for the best book of 2015.

The pace is continuing, with invited appearances coming up at places as varied as the Miller Center at the University of Virginia and the African American Studies Department at Columbia University. In a recent interview, Fortner told me happily, “My dance card is full.”

Reasons behind the attention include the fact that the book features subject matter that has been univocally promoted in the academy. It pushes against the narrative about the “new Jim Crow,” drug laws that have led to the disproportionate rate of African-American incarceration (six times that of whites). The theory holds that a white backlash against civil rights gains led to such discriminatory laws.

To the contrary, Fortner shows that the “black silent majority” pushed back against “the criminologies of the welfare state espoused by the white middle-class reformers who had monopolized the debate over drug addiction and crime during the 1950s and early 1960s.” The 1973 Rockefeller drug laws repudiated the liberal 1962 Metcalf-Volker Act.

African-Americans Oppose Their So-Called Advocates

The beleaguered residents of Harlem received little help from the new class of black politicians and activists, overwhelmingly Democrats. A. Philip Randolph’s Emergency Committee for Unity and Social and Economic Problems featured stars like Percy Sutton, Malcolm X, and Bayard Rustin; they considered drug users casualties of racism and decried police brutality and racial attitudes. The committee formed in 1961 but was short-lived, as members switched their attention to the national civil rights movement, specifically the 1963 March on Washington.

The silent majority took advantage of the expanded opportunities in entrepreneurship, public sector jobs, white-collar jobs, and political office that came about between 1940 and 1960.

Representatives like Sutton expressed ideas in “white-dominated public spaces” that contradicted pleas they heard from constituents, those who felt that the “‘wounds of centuries’ had been partially treated and partially healed by their industry and probity.” The black community suffered from the loss of labor-intensive work and continued residential segregation and unscrupulous landlords as the 1960s approached; but the silent majority took advantage of the expanded opportunities in entrepreneurship, public sector jobs, white-collar jobs, and political office that came about between 1940 and 1960.

Fortner tells their stories with empathy, if not approval, claiming they were “motivated by fear and advised by indigenous values.” He leaves the reader to agree or disagree with their blaming “the community’s downfall on individual behavior, the self-indulgent, irresponsible actions of the disadvantaged, rather than racial or economic inequality.” He offers no solutions but evidence to peel away layers of ideology. Dispelling the dominant belief that the majority of blacks approved of urban riots, militancy, and black nationalism, he cites poll after poll showing disapproval of such figures as Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, and approval of the NAACP’s moderate tactics.

Doubly Victimized, By Criminals and Their Champions

He also presents surveys that contradict assumptions about a racist white silent majority. One in 1970 showed that among the 63 percent of respondents who described themselves as the “silent majority” 22 percent thought “Negroes” were treated unfairly, as opposed to only 12 percent who thought it was “working men” or “the lower middle class.” Blacks were twice as likely as whites to be worried about drug use. White Catholics and police officers were more concerned about student protests than black crime. Police found it harder to take the “scions of the upper middle class in the best universities” hurling bricks and bags of feces and denunciations as “pigs” than ghetto inhabitants’ usual crimes.

White Catholics and police officers were more concerned about student protests than black crime.

All this happened before Fortner was born in 1980, but he suffered the consequences. When he was only two years old, one of Fortner’s older brothers was stabbed with an ice pick at a party. Their father, a machinist, cradled his dying son in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. The brother’s name, Dexter, was never spoken again, and when young Michael tried to surprise his mother by taking photographs of Dexter out of the closet and putting them on the walls, they were quietly taken down. (Another of his three brothers is imprisoned.)

Mark Parry visited Fortner’s old Brownsville neighborhood, where Fortner grew up with the “’constant and subtle terror’” of drug dealers loitering in front of his housing project, addicts knocking on the apartment door peddling stolen goods, and gunshots.

Fortner escaped. He received scholarship money to attend boarding school, then earned a PhD from Harvard University. As he explained to me, he set aside the typical project of revising his dissertation (a comparison of racial and class politics in New York and London) into his first book. He turned to the topic that was “calling” him.

Opposition to Alternative Explanations

He had read Michelle Alexander’s influential “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness” (The New Press, 2010) and was vexed by the discounting of “black agency.” Alexander blamed a white backlash, but Fortner wondered, “’Where are the black folks in this story?’”

Some feared what they believed to be his politics—as a ‘right-wing black conservative.’

Parry notes that Fortner’s early research published as articles had already “met resistance from critics who felt he was trying to justify mass incarceration, which he loathes.” Parry’s article, however, featured some of Fortner’s critics. Yale law professor James Forman Jr. praised the book for giving agency to the black community, but said Fortner overstated his claims. University of Michigan history professor Heather Ann Thompson didn’t dispute Fortner’s research, but insisted that he did not adequately capture the nuances.

Rutgers history professor Donna Murch maintained that blacks had little power; she curiously pointed out that the Voting Rights Act did not pass until 1965 (eight years before the passage of the Rockefeller laws). Murch expanded her criticisms of what she called Fortner’s “revisionist project” in the October 16 Boston Review. Fortner replied in an article of nearly equal length, offering his definitive response.

Fortner told me Chronicle and New York Times reporters sought out professors who “hold and protect racial arguments most fiercely” and are most devoted to a “radical vision of mass incarceration.” As a result, they are closed to “alternative interpretations and unintended consequences, unexpected things.” Some feared what they believed to be his politics—as a “right-wing black conservative.”

An Appreciation for Nuance

This made it difficult for them to see the nuances in the book, including points about what Fortner calls “white liberal privilege.” Such privilege allows liberals “to evade all the problems of street crime, of heroin addiction. . . .” He told me, “I don’t necessarily applaud what the people in the book do but I try to tell their story. For me their story is about dealing with one of the most difficult challenges one could face and not having options. It’s important to understand where the politics are coming from, to understand the anger and the pain.”

Let’s hope that this points to a turnaround in scholarship, an openness to the ‘unexpected consequences’ that evidence brings.

Fortner says the positive response has far outweighed the negative. Jason Riley, writing in City Journal, called the book “urgent and extraordinary.” Kudos also comes from liberal quarters. As Fortner notes, Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson praised it in print and in talks. Johns Hopkins political scientist Lester Spence listed Fortner’s book in his top five shortlist of 2015 books, alongside Ta-Nehisi Coates’ “Between the World and Me,” Marlon James’ “A Brief History of Seven Killings,” a collection of “science fiction stories from social justice movements” titled “Octavia’s Brood,” and Jabari Asim’s “Only the Strong.” Columbia University professor John McWhorter called it “the most important black book of 2015” on bloggingheads tv’s “Glenn Show.” It made the editor’s choice in the New York Times Book Review.

Such bipartisan appreciation is a positive sign. Let’s hope that this points to a turnaround in scholarship, an openness to the “unexpected consequences” that evidence brings. I am looking forward to reading Fortner’s next book, about the crack epidemic of the 1980s.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/05/the-forgotten-history-of-the-black-silent-majority/,2016-05-05
Why Black Voters Should Support Donald Trump,"As an American who is black, I’m supposed to hate Donald Trump. They say he’s a racist demagogue. They say he hates Mexicans. They say he hates women. They say he’s mean. Yes, I’ve heard it all. But I believe that above all the sensationalist name-calling, there is a strong case for black support for Trump.

They say when white people catch a cold, black people get pneumonia. Nothing illustrates this better than the trends of automation, globalization, and immigration, which have left many black people in the dust even while lifting many immigrant groups and other races into the middle class.

Indeed, until about midway through the twentieth century, a black man with only a high school education could earn a good enough living to buy a home and support a family on a single income. Today, that is much more difficult. Research from the nonpartisan, nonprofit policy analysis group Young Invincibles shows that “holding all else equal, an African American male needs some college credit to have a similar probability of employment as a white male high school dropout.” The unemployment rate for black men with only a high school education is 9.6 percent, more than twice as high as the white male rate for that education level.

While the forces of globalization and automation that have contributed to this situation cannot be stopped, some policy solutions warrant consideration.

Bad Economic Policies Especially Hurt Black People

Take illegal immigration. Untold millions entering the United States illegally over the past decades have dramatically increased the size of the labor pool at the low end of the market, harming prospects for wage increases by poor blacks. Indeed, The United States Commission on Civil Rights, in its 2010 report “The Impact of Illegal Immigration on the Wages and Employment Opportunities of Black Workers,” found not only wage suppression effects on black workers due to illegal immigration, but also reduced employment rates, and evidence of racial discrimination against black workers, due to employers perceiving they can pay illegal immigrants less than black workers, among other factors.

One of the report’s contributors, Gordon Hanson, found “a 10 percent immigrant-induced increase in the labor supply is associated with a 4 percent decrease in black wages, a 3.5 percent decrease in the black employment rate, and a 0.8 percent increase in the black incarceration rate.” That’s right, Hanson’s data suggests that even black crime is negatively impacted by illegal immigration, as some black men turn to crime in the absence of jobs.

This implies that a serious attempt to end illegal immigration would benefit not only wages and employment rates for black men, but even crime rates. And there is just one candidate with a policy platform of ending illegal immigration: Donald Trump.

Then there’s globalization. The first types of jobs to be sent overseas are the jobs likely to be done by black workers: factory jobs and other types of unskilled labor. Certainly, job skills, training, and education are a part of the solution and policymakers should pursue them. But if Trump can reduce the regulatory and tax cost of doing business in the United States to make it more attractive for our companies to come back home, it should have a positive effect on black workers by making more jobs available over the long term.

Foreign Competitors Don’t Play Fair

Trump delivers a message focused like a laser on those left behind by globalization. He’s starting the conversation on getting our companies to stop closing down factories and outsourcing. He’s talking about equitable trade policies with our partners such as Japan: even though her cars represent half of the U.S. automobile market, she only allows foreign automakers a 5 percent share of her market.

Then there’s China. It’s well-known that the Chinese government has locked Google out of the country due to censorship and a desire to protect her Internet brands from foreign competition. But a survey the American Chamber of Commerce did in China additionally found rising concerns about protectionism from many other foreign companies operating there. Respondents listed protectionism as a top five concern, negatively affecting their ability to do business in China.

What’s more, the percentage of firms concerned about protectionism and unfair targeting of foreign firms is increasing. Thus, amidst a protectionist Japan and a China systematically increasing barriers to U.S. businesses, only one candidate has a serious message on correcting these imbalances. If accomplished, more equitable trade policies could help U.S. manufacturing, which would in turn help poor white, Hispanic, and black Americans.

Then there’s politics. Despite black Americans giving the Democratic Party 90 percent of their votes every election cycle, many think black interests are being brushed aside while the party bends over backwards to accommodate an ever-increasing list of special interests, leaving its most loyal constituency, black Americans, with nothing but scraps from the table. Can anyone point to a substantive Democratic Party policy paper on black jobs that they’re serious about implementing? (When you find it, I’ll find you a unicorn and a leprechaun.)

Yet Trump’s focus on American workers may be just that. Although not specifically directed towards black workers, it is in fact a black jobs policy. Just as many working-class whites are backing Trump because he is the one fighting for working-class interests, maybe black people should realize that our interests are not that different than those of working-class whites and do the same. For perhaps Trump is speaking for us as well.

Dyson Is Wrong: Violence In Cleveland Will Solve Nothing,"In The New Republic, professor and civil rights activist Michael Eric Dyson calls for aggressive and potentially violent protests during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. This call to action by an important figure is likely to resonate. If recent riots at Trump events across the country are any indication, Cleveland could turn very ugly, very fast. But both Dyson’s approach to protest and justification for it are wanting. The violence he expects will not galvanize the nation—it will further divide it.

There are reasons to protest Trump, and effective ways of doing so, as I have expressed in these pages. Indeed, Trump himself has fanned these flames, predicting riots and offering to pay the legal fees of fans who become violent. But Dyson’s invitation, even encouragement, for violence plays directly into Trump’s divisive hands. Dyson fails to understand this because he misdiagnoses the country’s current racial strife in important ways.

It’s Not Obamaphobia

Dyson’s central premise is that white fear of a black president is a main cause of the increased racial tension we have seen over the past several years. As he puts it: “They are driven by rage that a black man today still represents a nation that once held black folk in chains, and which still depends on the law to check their social and political aspirations. Barack Obama so spooked the bigoted whites of this country that we are now faced with a racist explicitness that hasn’t emerged since the height of the civil rights movement.”

I recently wrote about the various causes of the rise in explicit racism, including the rise of anti-white rhetoric. White people have gotten the message that they are the root of all evil, and are rejecting that message. Putting that to one side, however: What evidence is there of this racist anti-Obama backlash? It has been a staple belief among progressives since the day Obama took office. But is it real?

A strong piece of evidence against the “racial backlash against Obama” theory is that the 2012 election did not feature anywhere near the heightened racial tension of this year’s contest. Surely four years would have been enough to bring the old-fashioned racists out. It is unlikely that those who did not act out of racial animus towards the president in 2012 suddenly would in 2016.

The fact of a black president is just that: a fact. The president has not become more black; nothing about his status has changed. But clearly something has been changing. Tribalism on all sides has grown, and we no longer believe our neighbors share our values.

The Obama Uncle Tom Myth

The second foundation of Dyson’s call to action has to do with what he perceives as Obama’s unwillingness to put the concerns of black Americans front and center in his administration. It is a strange attack that Dyson and Cornel West have been leveling at Obama for his entire presidency. While some have seen Obama’s beer summit and his statement that his son would look like Trayvon Martin as playing racial favorites, Dyson says Obama has not gone far enough.

It has always been unclear to me what black thinkers like Dyson and West want the president to do. Surely if Obama were to give a full-throated defense of reparations from the Oval Office, for example, it would exacerbate the racial animosity from whites that Dyson points to. But it seems like this is exactly what Dyson wants. Dyson wants white America to admit something, but it may not be something most of white America actually feels or believes.

This is the strange parallax through which Dyson views America. On the one hand, the mere fact of a black president has led to white hysteria, and on the other, the black president has supposedly gone out of his way to appear neutral on race. The center cannot hold these two arguments together.

What Does Dyson Want?

One must assume that Dyson is asking his fellow citizens to join him on the front lines in Cleveland. He expects a police reaction that will compel a violent response from him and his followers. He expects and perhaps looks forward to people throwing rocks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails. He is ready for the violence that will usher in the age of…the age of what? Where does the great mind of the modern civil rights movement think this violence will end?

This is precisely the point at which Dyson’s language comes to mirror Trump’s. Neither makes an explicit appeal to violence, but neither rejects the idea that violence might be needed. Dyson feels that white hegemony justifies his illiberal nod towards mob violence; Trump feels persistent political correctness justifies his nod towards violence. Both Dyson and Trump have long since abandoned the idea that actual dialogue can bridge these gaps. Only militant action can work now.

Let’s imagine that Dyson’s vision of Cleveland comes true. There are violent clashes between police and black protesters; cable news makes millions covering it. One or two new superstars of the movement emerge. Dyson himself mans the barricade, chanting, sweating, and holding his semi-automatic machine gun aloft in the service of justice! If people die, they die. This is bigger than that, this is the future of America, this is… Well? What is it, Dyson? What are you really asking kids to potentially die for?

Let’s Get A Grip

Trump has introduced a toxic level of racial vitriol into American politics. Only his most blind and sycophantic supporters would even pretend otherwise. So it is right and just to protest his troglodytic pronouncements. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Expecting and advocating for violence is exactly the wrong way. It plays into his hands, and alienates white Americans who might otherwise be sympathetic to the concerns of Americans of color.

This is ultimately what Dyson misses about white Americans. We are not predisposed to hate a black president. We are not conditioned to fear and hate the black male body. Our relationship to it is far more complicated than that. It includes Trayvon Martin, LeBron James, Jackie Robinson, Mohammad Ali, Barack Obama and even Michael Eric Dyson. Blackness is not one thing to white people, just as I imagine it isn’t to black people.

If we are talking about a dignified and non-violent protest against Trump in Cleveland, then if I can swing the airfare from Brooklyn, I’ll stand with Dyson. I too believe that Trump has coarsened our rhetoric and poisoned our discourse in ways that might harm racial progress for a generation.

But I won’t surrender to Trump as Dyson has in his breathless column. I won’t accept the race war he offers. I read Dyson’s call to arms in good faith, and I find great fault in it. I hope Dyson will consider my words and amend his justification of violence.

1968: William F. Buckley Interviews Muhammad Ali,"Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr., Program 130, “Muhammad Ali and the Negro Movement,” Firing Line broadcast records, Hoover Institution Archives.

BUCKLEY: In 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, Mr. and Mrs. Cassius Marcellus Clay christened their newborn son Cassius Clay, Jr. 22 years later, Cassius Clay renounced his name and its associations and elected to call himself Mohammed Ali, which is, of course, how we shall refer to him tonight, even as tomorrow if he were to change his name back, we would refer to him as Cassius Clay. In changing his name, Mohammed Ali intended to disavow his culture, and to adopt membership in the Black Muslim movement of which he is an apostle. When, a little bit later he was called by the Selective service Board to serve in the Armed Forces, Mohammed Ali explained that he was proof against such laws as a miner of the Islamic faith as taught by Elijah Mohammed. The courts were not impressed, the Boxing Commission has stripped him of his boxing crown and very soon, assuming the Supreme Court of the United states goes along, Mohammed Ali will go to jail or renounce his citizenship and forfeit his bail. Mohammed Ali defended his world heavyweight crown six times in 11 months and won them all. His career as a boxer until he dropped Sonny Liston dead in his tracks was ridiculed as primarily an act of self-promotion, an art at which young Cassius Clay was greatly proficient. I’m the greatest, he told everyone, they all must fall in the round I call, he versified, and just about the time that he had established his supremacy beyond reasonable doubt~ he felt the afflatus of Elijah Mohammed and here we are. He had been something very special. “I was the onliest boxer in history people asked questions like a senator,” he had said, but even so, he wouldn’t have it otherwise. I should like to begin by asking Mr. Ali what makes him believe that the same country that glorified Joe Louis would want to persecute you?

ALI: Well, first of all, I would like to thank you for the brief introduction. You covered a lot of space in such a short time. You did make a few points that I would like to straighten up, and I’m sure you did this without knowledge of what you were saying. I did not take the name, I just named myself Cassius Clay, this is a honorable, Mohammed Ali, given to me by my religious leader and teacher, the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, and I would like to say that Mohammed means in Arabic “one who is worthy of praise” and one praiseworthy, and Ali means the most High, but the slave name Clay meant dirt with no ingredients.

BU: The slave word, which?

AL: Clay, meant dirt with no ingredients. Names have meanings in different countries. And I also would like to say that I am not an apostle of the Muslim religion. We believe that the Honorable Elijah Mohammed is the apostle of Allah, God, but I’m only a helper and a minister of his, and I also would like to say that you mentioned that I’d, when I’d accepted Cassius Clay I disowned, or disannounced my culture. Well, I did not disregard my culture, if I did, it was the white American culture, and I accepted my true culture, when I accepted Mohammed Ali, because this is a black name, Islam is the black man’s religion, and so I would like to say, that I would like to clarify that point that I reclaimed my real culture, and that’s being a black man and wearing a black name with a black body, and not a white name, so I would never say that I didn’t disown my culture. But I would say that I put down a lot of the white American culture, and ways, and beliefs, and answering your last question about Joe Louis and me, why was he so praised, and he not? Well, I would like to speak from my knowledge, and the reason I can see is Joe Louis is what you would call, or what a white would call a good, red-blooded American boy who went to the Army and told the world, we must fight for our country, and he, in his times, he didn’t have the protestin’ and the things they are havin’ today, but I would say that I receive respect by not only blacks around the world, now that I’m a Muslim, but also all throughout white America, more so than any boxer including Joe Louis. And mainly by the college youth of today. So, I’m just a lot different from, I would say, Joe Louis, I guess that’s why I’m looked at different.

BU: Well, I understand the point that you make, and I think you make it very well, but you have in fact said, publicly, on a number of occasions, that America was looking for a way to get back at you because we are a white culture, and I’m asking you if we were looking for a way to get at you, why was it that Joe Louis was so popular with the same white America? Why do we have it in for you?

AL: Well, I can’t recall saying white, as a whole, was out to get me, because many know nothing about me, or care nothin’ about me, or what I believe, and what I believe or what I do will never harm ‘em, nor will they have to come in my path. But I did make a statement that the men of the Boxing Authority and the people who own it to get me out of the way couldn’t do it physically, and many people I was sure in government, so the legal way they could say take the title, and then make it look justifiable to the public was to say that he wouldn’t serve his country. Twice, if you recall, I was denounced by the draft. In Florida I was illiterate, they didn’t want me, then they had a special psychiatrist to come to Kentucky, they checked and they didn’t want me. But as soon as my name was Mohammed Ali, as soon as I announced I was a Muslim, then all of a sudden I became smart.

BU: Well, then, you do believe that. You believe that you were drafted only because you changed your name to Mohammed Ali and joined the Muslim religion, is that correct?

AL: Yes, sir. They knew that I wouldn’t go. And they know the government, they know the Honorable Elijah Mohammed and his followers, the jails are packed with Muslims, but this would justify uh my title being taken, and this

BU: Yeah. Well, now, if you hadn’t changed your name and your religion, in your judgment, you would have continued to have been listed as undraftable?

AL: I believe so, yes. But it’s debatable, you know, you have a right to say what you believe, and I have a right

BU: Oh, sure. Let’s not fight over it (LAUGHTER). The reason I ask this is because I’m anxious to know in the course of appealing to the courts, your lawyer must have made that point. But apparently made that point unsuccessfully. So, did they in fact ask the draft board to explain how come all of a sudden they reclassified you? Did the draft board give a

AL: Well, they asked the draft board

BU: give a plausible reason for doing so?

AL: They asked the draft board to explain a lot. As a matter of fact, I have about 675 documents I have, of handwritten letters by Baptist preachers, some white, and Muslim ministers and Honorable Elijah Mohammed and the question was is he really sincere? And like right now I consider myself in court now. I done faced one white judge and now I’m lookin’ at you, and I already had one white jury and audience such as I have here now, and it really makes, I have to be real cool and not savage and radical, because it makes me angry when I think about it when I see the white boys, who are really the number one citizens, the future rulers, when I see them by the hundreds leaving the country uh see the white preachers breaking into draft board houses in Wisconsin and Baltimore, tearing the files outta of the walls and makin’ a bonfire out of 45,000 draft cards, pouring blood on them, and I see them go to court and the juries say two years, and I get five years for legally doin’ what’s legal, I say if I

BU: Now, wait a minute. When you say legally

AL: I mean, you can denounce the draft on any grounds you have to go to court, if you lose, you pay, you have to be a man, and pay your sentence, which I said I’m gonna do, I’m not leavin’ the country, but this is legal, what I’m doin’ is legal. If you’re guilty you gotta pay. What I’m doin’ is legal. So, the people, I’m not usin’ these people as an excuse, to do

BU: Now, wait a minute. The five years that you’re talking about is for doing something illegal in the eyes of the court system of the United States, right?

AL: No, sir. It’s not illegal in the court system to not take the step, if your grounds are justifiable and you can prove it. And then you can lose

BU: All right but you couldn’t prove it.

AL: Yes, we had the prove. Here’s what I was gittin’ ready to say then, that makes a black man hot, if you understand, my first wife I had to divorce, this was before the draft come up, because she wouldn’t wear her dresses long, I think you remember this, this was headline news. It cost me 250,000 dollars, I’m payin’ $1200 a month now in alimony, I paid $96,000 in lawyers’ fees now, if this is not sincerity, I don’t know what (LAUGHTER), I’m not tryin’ to be funny

BU: No, no, no, I don’t oubt your sincerity. I’m talking about, no legality and sincerity are two different things. You can be perfectly sincere, for instance, and in desiring to break a law, but it’s still a broken law.

AL: Well, this sincerity, all I’m sayin’ is that this sincerity was not recognized, I mean, the files, the papers everything we had, you asked me a question

BU: Yeah.

AL: But did you say to the draft board, that when you accepted Mohammed Ali they seemed to change and if you had used Cassius Clay, they wouldn’t have. Well, all these things were brought up and they completely overlooked it.

BU: Well, let’s grant the sincerity of a couple of judges and quote them. I think it’s only fair to do so under the circumstances. One of them, the first one you approached said that Cassius Clay quotes “claims to be a minister of the lost-found nation of Islam and maintains he was due a ministerial exemption from the draft. His vocation is clearly that of a professional boxer.” His point was that in fact you were a professional boxer not a minister.

AL: Yes, well, what did we tell the judge there, he said, if you are a minister why are you a boxer? At the time I heard the Islamic teachings as taught by the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, I was in about $138,000 worth of debt. And this debt had to be paid, and boxin’ was my way of payin’ my debt, but I would say one thing, I was asked in a way when he said take the step, choose between the wealth of America and the millions of dollars and the title, the ministry. So, I chose the ministry. If I was not sincere, then I would have easily went to Vietnam, boxin’ exhibitions, and made a couple of cool million

BU: I don’t think anybody in his right mind would doubt your sincerity,

AL: Well, this is what the whole thing’s about.

BU: No, I don’t think so. The question is whether or not you fit into certain specifications as defined by the law.

AL: Right.

BU: Now, for instance, the judge in the next higher court, ruling against you, said that you “claimed objections to participating in war, insofar as they are based upon the teachings of the nation of Islam, resting on grounds which primarily are political and racial. These constitute only objections to certain types of war in certain circumstances rather than a general scruple against participation in war of any form. However, under the law, only a general scruple against participation in war in any form can support an exemption as a conscientious objector. Now, that makes sense, doesn’t it, that’s not anti-you, is it?

AL: Right. One thing I would like to say is that I’d have to admit, and tell you this, my first lawyer who was a black man, he was pretty well versed, but not versed enough, and I was a minister at the time that they called me. I was doing the ministerial work throughout the country, for the teachings of Islam, as taught by Honorable Elijah Mohammed, and he, hardship was my first case, he said this is what we’ll do. Then they were gonna grant us the paying on hardship, but still I would have to work in a hospital or something, and not carry weapons, well I couldn’t do this.

BU: Why?

AL: Well, we uh the Holy Koran, our religious book, teaches us, that we who declare ourselves to be righteous Muslims, do not participate in no wars, in no way, fashion or form, that take the lives of other humans. And so what I’m sayin’ is that I should have told him, it’s my fault in a way, too, I should have told the lawyer that I’m not participatin’ in no kind of way, so but the two, and after he failed that, he went on another ground, I had to support my mother, which was not enough to keep me from going in some kind of way. So, then Hayden Coventry (?), a wiser lawyer from Washington, who we hired. He said you’re a minister. I said that’s right. He said well this is how you should have went in first (?), because a minister don’t have to take part in nothin’, a hospital, nothin’. He said the onliest way you’re gonna get out is to go in as a minister, and I didn’t know it, and my first lawyer, he come up talkin’ about this is not so, the other lawyer proved to me that it was so, then we filed ____ I have to admit that it did look phony to the public, well at first he tried to get by because he’s a conscientious objector, secondly, he had to support his mother, now he’s a minister, but if we had went in first with the ministry, I’m sure it would have been much easier. So, this is why the judges say this and say that, because it did look funny, because we made the wrong move at first.

BU: Well, but then, if that’s the case, it’s incorrect to blame them, isn’t it?

AL: the lawyers?

BU: No, no, no, the judges.

AL: No.

BU: In other words, the judges take whatever argument you present.

AL: Well, I’m not blaming the judges, and I’m not cryin’, I told them my bags are packed, and clean out my sail, because I’m ready to go to jail. I’m not cryin’, I’m not hijackin’ no planes, I have my draft card, it’s not burnt. So, what I would say is that the lawyers should have went at it another way. And I would say that they should know better, but I’m not cryin’ about it. I’m a man. And I would like to say that the judges can look at this as a fraud in the beginning, if they want, and then they can still look at the third case, is he sincere as a minister, or is he real? But, I’m not, I’m just talkin’ about this because you brought it up, but you don’t hear me protestin’ over things that are happenin’ to me, I’m just playin’ it by ear, I’m relyin’ on Almighty God, Allah, and whatever happens happens. I’m not tryin’ to convince the jury or the judge that I’m sincere. We took the papers in, we did the best, we go under the law, and what happens, happens. But we’re sure that they know that I am.

BREAK

BU: Mr. Ali, you say that your religion prohibits participation in any war at all. My own understanding from reading the works of Mohammed Elijah is that the prohibition is against “white Christian wars.” Now, do you mean that your own religion is different from his in this particular respect that you consider yourself a pacificist?

AL: My religion is different from whose?

BU: From Mohammed Elijah, Elijah Mohammed.

AL: No, I follow him, I can’t be different from him. I follow him.

BU: You follow him. So, you would take his word for it if he says that the only wars that are forbidden are participation in white Christian wars. This leaves some wars in which you would be willing to participate?

AL: The Koran say that we take part in no wars, in no way, fashion or form, that take the lives of other humans, and it also says that unless there’s a Holy War declared by Allah or one of his prophets, or messengers (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

BU: Well, but in fact the Black Muslims in America, as you know, have made considerable modifications on the Koran

AL: I’d like to say one thing, sir. We cannot change the Koran or make no modifications, this cannot be done, or it would no longer be holy, if we did, but I would say, I’d like to say another thing while we’re here, the people here, college students look intelligent, and I understand you well intellect, intelligent man, we are not Black Muslims we are Muslims. You see, you have Catholics. You have Chinese Catholics, you have Indian Catholics, you have black Catholics and white Catholics. But I’m sure you don’t ask a man are you a white Catholic? Are you a Chinese are you a yellow Catholic, a red Catholic, or a white Catholic? He’s just a Catholic. We have black Muslims, we have brown Muslims, we have red Muslims, we have yellow Muslims, we have even white complected Muslims, so I’d like to clear that point, this is a press word, Black Muslims. Islam religion has no color distinction, we are just Muslims, and I’d like to (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

BU: I know that you’re aware, though, Mr. Ali, that rigorous members of the Islamic faith have denounced the American Muslim movement

AL: Well, I would like

BU: The one that we’re referring to on the grounds of its heterodoxy. They say simply that a lot of rules are sort of made in Chicago, which have really no bearing. For instance, the whole notion of sainted race, and all that kind of business.

AL: I’d like to say one thing. Many people are quick to say that we are not recognized by Muslims in the East (?). And I start with the Honorable Elijah Mohammed. In 1959, he went throughout the Holy City of Mecca to dine and wine with Nasser of Egypt and all of the black, mainly the rulers of the Islamic countries. I left his house a few days ago, and about 7 or 8 scholars of Islam constantly come to his house from Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, when I was sentenced to jail, Mohammed awaited the Supreme Council of all Islamic affairs, it was in the paper, it was on the back page, real small writin’, they didn’t want too many people to see it, it said in the name of 600-million Muslims, Mohammed Ali is a Muslim, he is recognized by us, also, and do not jail him. The President of Turkey, it was in the papers here in America wrote over bearing witness that I was a Muslim and recognized. The President of Syria and Lebanon have ate dinner with Nasser three times in his palace, I was invited by King Faisal to open the pilgrimage to Mecca with him, hand in hand, where 600-million Muslims from all over the world come, and Elijah Mohammed’s son, Hurbin (?) Mohammed has just left for Kuwait, invited by the government, so daily Muslims come to our mosque in Cleveland, Washington, wherever we have colleges they all come to our cellars (?), we all are recognized, this is false propaganda, I just want to say.

BU: Yeah. Well, if it’s false propaganda why, for instance, should it have been propagated by Malcolm X?

AL: What, I’d like to say I’m not trying to be funny, and I hope the people don’t laugh.

BU: Sure.

AL: But I barely got out of high school, and the word propagated by Malcolm X, what do you mean?

BU: Well, Malcolm X came back, as you know, from the Mid-East, and renounced the movement of Elijah Mohammed precisely on the grounds that it was not the same kind of Islam faith which he found very attractive.

AL: Well, I would like to say, I would like to say one thing about, I don’t know too much about what he saw, but he was there in 1959, I think, before, and he saw there were white Muslims, but Malcolm X got famous mainly by being hard on people like you, white people, white devils, you blue-eyed blond-headed dog. Oh, he got famous like this. And he had so many white enemies, white card nothin’ about Malcolm nor so-called Negroes when he was really down ___ Elijah Mohammed, but they seemed to love and follow uh dead leaders, but I’d like to say this.

BU: White people didn’t kill him.

AL: No. I would like to say this, he was a man everything he had came from Elijah Mohammed and when he denounced or was put out for various reasons in the faith, then he had to from what I understood, this is me talkin’, I’ll be to blame if I say anything wrong, he had to get back with you all, so, in other words, he had to be apologizing, for things that he had said, because the protection of Allah, and the Muslims, were not with him. But I would like to say,

BU: You mean you think that he tried to make himself pleasing to the white community, because he had antagonized Elijah Mohammed.

AL: This is what I’m sayin’, this is me talkin’. Not antagonized him, but antagonized you.

BU: No, but you say

AL: I would like to say that whites jumped right behind him. They’re makin’ a book about him, it’s required readin’ in all colleges now, and they’re makin’ a movie about him, and projectin’ him as the leader and if you read his book and see the movie that’s comin’ out, it’ll make you hate Elijah Mohammed and the Muslims. Mainly, this is done to turn the black people against the real leader and I’d like to say that this is the way white people rule. This is your history, divide and conquer, you see, the first whites, your fathers, when they came over, they told Cochise that Runnin’ Bull stole his horses then after they got through fightin’ they came in and took over. And whites have always put one against another and now they have a dead man who was nothin’ but a, he admitted it himself, Malcolm, was a tramp or had white women sellin’ their body for him, he was nothin’ until the Honorable Elijah Mohammed made him great, made him great, taught him, even his name X come from Elijah. He gave him his name, the Honorable Elijah Mohammed was the established leader before he was born, now you seem to try to make it look liike he was a leader, and he was powerful, everything he, everything I have, let me say one thing, I barely got out of school, I got out of school, mainly, because I was a champ, and I actually didn’t pass. I won’t name the teachers that put me through, but I want, you’re a wise man, you’re an intelligent man, and if I was not a Muslim, or a follower of the Honorable Elijah Mohammed I couldn’t talk to you for two minutes. And I believe I can hold my own as an intelligent conversation with you, but it all come from the Honorable Elijah Mohammed. But people praise me, oh, you should be the leader, well, you don’t have to follow Elijah. Man, are you a fool? Everything I got comes from him. He taught me who I was, he made me proud, he made me fearless, he made me love my own, I’ve turned down millions to keep from selling out my people, the beautiful name Mohammed Ali, I now have 56 (UNINTELLIGIBLE) invitations by governments, all they ask me about when I go to those countries, how is Elijah Mohammed? White people twice a day, 65 and 70 their bus stop in front of Elijah Mohammed’s house hoping to get a glimpse of him. And you cannot destroy me like you have other big ministers of his in the past by telling us oh, you speak good, you should be the leader. See? This is to get me thinkin’ that I’m smart, and as soon as I leave Elijah you can get me. But as long as I stay with the Honorable Elijah Mohammed I’m safe. And if Malcolm X had stayed with the man that made him great, taught him everything he knew, today, he’d have been, big, big, big. But as soon as, in other words, how can I come to your son, and say you are wrong for spankin’ when you fed him, you clothed him, you gave him his name, you brought him into the world, who am I to come in and be the judge and say, why did you spank that boy? You taught him, you have a right to spank him, and Malcolm X did some things, he said sumpin’ about Kennedy that he shouldn’t have said, 130 whites died tragically on a jet, he praised it, and the Honorable Elijah Mohammed is not the kind of man to ordain it, so he had to spank him, and after you white people had told him how good he talked, he should be the leader, he couldn’t take the spankin’. He had to run out and start him a movement, and that’s when he destroyed him, you understand? So, I would say whites destroyed Malcolm X, not Elijah Mohammed, not the Muslims.

BU: No, I understand what you say and I don’t doubt either the sincerity or the eloquence of your tribute to Elijah Mohammed, but I do say that assuming that we are prepared to question the divinity of Elijah Mohammed, then one has to assume that somebody like Malcolm X, when he turned against him, might have been doing so for honest, sincere reasons. That is to say, he might have thought, well, I’ve been following this man for a number of years, but all of a sudden I have reached a level of understanding which permits me to see that he is pretty human after all, and beyond a certain point, he doesn’t have anything to teach me.

AL: He should have always known that he was human, and not having nothin’ to teach him, this is silly.

BU: Yeah, but some people treat him as though he were divine, you know, the way they did Father Divine, which would be another example.

AL: Well, he’s dead now, and we don’t talk about dead people, they’re dead and they’re gone.

BU: Who’s dead?

AL: Malcolm X is dead.

BU: Oh, yes.

AL: And we followed the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, who is the boss. And we don’t, rather not to stay here on the show and waste a lot of time arguin’ about a dead black man, when the whites are our common enemies.

BU: Well, no doubt of course he teaches you that, and no doubt you understand

AL: Well, we don’t have, you don’t have to teach a black man that the whites are his enemy.

BU: Well, you see, from my point of view, what Elijah Mohammed is doing to you, is diseasing your mind. You sit and tell me that we white people would like to divide and conquer.

AL: Well, you do.

BU: I grew up as a white child. I heard much more talk against Democrats than I did against black people. (LAUGHTER) And I grant that there is a lot of division in the sense that the Republicans are divided

AL: The Democrats and Republicans don’t lynch each other and castrate each other

BU: Oh, yes they do

AL: burn each other, tar and feather each other, and rape

BU: Yes, they do, yes they do

AL: And slay people

BU: Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, this is one of the difficulties.

AL: I would like to ask you a question, I’d like to ask you a question.

BU: Yes.

AL: Who, 22-million black people in America, who would you say our every day common enemy is? What other country? Or what nationality? I mean, you know, you have the nerve to be on a TV show like this

BU: I think the

AL: And look at me like I’m wrong for sayin’ Elijah Mohammed is poisoning me by telling you that we’re your enemies, and I feel it and see it every day, and every black man watching this show know you are our enemies, and you have the nerve to stand up here and say Elijah Mohammed is poisonin’ my mind. He can teach us that you are our enemies, you taught us. And your people delude (?), Martin Luther King was bumped off unjustly, Adam Clayton Powell was bumped off unjustly, they took my title unjustly, they killed Megers Ever unjustly, all the integrators who love white folks, was unjustly kicked out of Washington, they’ve been deprived of education and poverty throughout the country; they just came back from Vietnam, 12 boys in Chicago, and they said on the television and they told how white soldiers are teaching Viet Congs to hate ‘em, they fly rebel Communist flags, and they’re doin’ everything that they can to ‘em, right there in Vietnam, and you’re gonna tell me that Elijah Mohammed and trying to make the public think that he’s poisonin’ me by teachin’ us the truth. Here’s his latest newspaper

BU: Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

AL: Here’s his latest newspaper, hold it, man, here’s his latest newspaper “Mohammed Speaks,” and it’s full of truth, and you can get the paper in every city, you can buy Mohammed Speak, and if this, I mean, you’re a wise man, but I don’t think you’re too much wiser than the ones who run the country in the White House

BU: Much wiser. (LAUGHTER – APPLAUSE) Let me try to make this point.

AL: No, no one challenges nothin’ he teach, I mean, you’re intelligent, and I’m intelligent, and we all know he’s here, so, I’m not here to tell you sumpin’ you don’t know about.

BU: No, no, I’m simply telling you that you believe something which I happen to know isn’t true. See?

AL: Now, hold it. Now, what is that I believe that’s not

BU: You believe that the entire white community is your enemy. I happen to know it’s not your enemy. I doubt if there’s anybody in this room who is your enemy. But I do believe that just as a Hitler persuaded all the Germans that all the Jews were their enemy that people are engaged in spreading this kind of virulence, and that some very, very sincere people get caught up in it. You’re an example of it. And under the circumstances you end up doing a disservice to the cause that you really want to serve.

AL: Would you say Martin Luther King was doin’ a disservice?

BU: Well, now, what is the relevance of that remark? Now, whether you went to school or not, explain to me the relevancy of that remark.

AL: No, I’m askin’ you the question. I said, you said I’m doing a disservice, who’s doin’ the disservice

BU: You mean because he was killed by a white man? So, Malcolm X was killed by a black man. So what? So, what else is new.

AL: No, I’m not talkin’ about, no, you’re gittin’ upset. I’m not talkin’ about that. All I ask you was Elijah Mohammed is doin’ a disservice, or whatever it is that he’s doin’, well,

BU: Yeah. At one level, he’s doing this.

AL: Well, what’s the level?

BU: At the level of trying to persuade people that all white people are the same, and despise Negro people, at the level in which he urges you to (BOTH TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY)

AL: All right, let’s look at some of the things he’s doin’

BU: Okay. Excuse me just one second. Be right with you.

BREAK

BU: Go ahead, Mr. Ali, excuse me.

AL: You say one thing that he’s doing that’s not so good is tryin’ to persuade black people that all white people are no good

BU: That’s correct.

AL: Uh, you have about 180-million whites in America, and Madison Square Garden holds about how many people?

BU: You’d know better than I would.

AL: About 20,000.

BU: Something like that, yeah.

AL: If you could, which is impossible, fill up Madison Square Garden with white liberals who will die for blacks, or color means nothin’, and will give up their whole system, and their own people, and their richness, I mean, just all out, color means nothin’, if you could get 20,000, which is impossible, excuse me, which is impossible to fill, but

BU: I don’t say color doesn’t mean nothing

AL: Excuse me, if you had an arena with 10-million people in it, of whites, all who you say are really good, and mean right, if you had 10-million, you’d have 170-million to rule them out, so what I’m tryin’ to say, I see a white man die in a riot, he didn’t wanta die, or in a demonstration for blacks, America’s in Vietnam, droppin’ bombs now,

BU: Now, wait a minute, let’s get back to Madison Square Garden, because it’s one thing to say that white people aren’t the enemies of black people, and another thing to say that color doesn’t make any difference. It does. So does race, so does religion. For instance, the Italians and the Irish, and we all get along pretty well. But this doesn’t mean that the fact that somebody’s an Italian makes no difference at all, or that he’s an Irishman makes no difference at all. The question is are they enemies?

BU: What I was referrin’ to, what I was referrin’ to, say that you had some whites that didn’t pay any attention to color, you know, what I mean, we’re all equal, that’s what I meant to say, it would help the problem. I mean, they’re so few. For every one white, you can find me that you may say is liberal, and means right, I’m sure that you could find 5,000 to every one who would kill him for tryin’ to help. So, they’re so few until, here’s what I’m

BU: Why aren’t there more dead, white liberals? How many can you count? As a matter of fact, I did count as recently as two months ago, because I did a story on it, and I counted 12.

AL: Well, the NAACP, the Core, the Urban League, and all these organizations, and many, many, many of ‘em, they’ve completely dropped out, it was not too long ago, in the news, where that all the whites have dropped out of all these organizations things are gettin’ so critical, until the liberal you don’t see him no more, he just had to flee back into

BU: Oh, come on, they’re coming out of the ceiling. They’re all over the place, they’re right here, you’ll meet them in just a moment, very articulate liberals. Look, try to understand me, do you accept as a matter of faith that Elijah Mohammed can’t deceive you?

AL: Do what?

BU: Do you take it as a matter of faith that he can’t deceive you?

AL: I imagine he can deceive anybody if he wants to.

BU: Uh, huh. Well, now is it conceivable that he would want to deceive you

AL: For what reason?

BU: by suggesting that people feel about you the way in fact they don’t? Or for the reason because

AL: Well, he’s not deceivin’ us about white people.

BU: Well, some people of course insist that he is, including Malcolm X.

AL: No sir. No, sir. Not about white people. I know he’s right. Everything he say about white people right. Even when he say you’re the devil.

BU: Um. And that’s correct, too?

AL: Yes, sir. All the way. (LAUGHTER).

BU: How did the devil make out so wel?

AL: Make out so well, how?

BU: Dominates the United States.

AL: Oh, the Bible predicted that the devil would rule the earth for 6,000 years.

BU: Well, now far into those 6,000 years are we?

AL: Now exactly I don’t know. If you want to know,

BU: About half-way?

AL: If you really wanted to know, (LAUGHTER) if you really, really really wanted to know about Islam and, I’m just a student of the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, is the man who could really go deep into this, you know. But

BU: How do you account for the fact that he has been rejected by, according to his own figures, 97% of the black people of America?

AL: Well,

BU: How do you account for the fact that none of the prominent, with the exception of you, none of the prominent black leaders of America are subscribers to Elijah Mohammed?

AL: Subscribers to what, now?

BU: To his religion, to his movement.

AL: They all read his newspaper.

BU: Not even James Baldwin.

AL: I would say this to you, everything the black people are doing today comes from the Honorable Elijah Mohammed. They’re havin’ school problems. We want black schools, we want black teachers. This is his program. Being natural. They are black now, they don’t want to be called Negroes. This come from the Honorable Elijah Mohammed.

BU: Is that going to make any difference?

AL: Hold it. At the latest Black Power Conference, all the black leaders got together and said we want separate states from whites. This is stolen from the Honorable Elijah Mohammed.

T: They want their own schools, they want their own businesses, super-markets, they’re not talkin’ about

BU: Now, wait a minute. If you say they stole it from him, suppose I say he stole it from the Communists. They were preaching this in the early ‘30s.

AL: Now, hold it, hold it. What I’m trying to say, is that everything that our people are doing today, every leader that you can bring up from Ron Corina (?), the Black Panthers’ Elgis Cleaver, Malcolm X, uh Stokely Carmichael, Rap Brown, people such as myself, in the struggle, everybody you can name, talkin’ black or preachin’ anything black, they are ex-Muslims, they heard it from the Honorable, when you say why they don’t follow him, they are followin’ him and they don’t know it, but they haven’t yet accepted him religiously.

BU: If you say, if you say that there is a correspondence between what he preaches and what other black leaders preach, the answer is yes, that’s true. The question is what is the significance of that correspondence? Is there correspondence between what the Democratic Party wants and the Communist Party wants? It doesn’t mean that one dominates the other.

AL: Your major, I understand, your major question was, how come 97% rejects him, then 97%, 97% of the people really don’t know enough about him to really reject him or hate him, but they’re enticin’ by the wealth of America. For example, I have a black friend, I could be a Muslim, I go for what you go for. I believe the white man’s a devil, but not the woman. I gotta pretty white girl. So, he can’t join, because he’s gotta white girl friend.

BU: He’s not sincere.

AL: You understand. So, this is why he haven’t joined. Another fellow. I go for the Muslims, I go for everything you preach, but I gotta have my poke chops and ham hocks, I can’t quit eatin’ my pork. Another fellow. What’s wrong with a little reefer, you understand? To be a follower of The Honorable Elijah Mohammed, you have to completely extain from alcohol, or fornication, adultered, killin’, stealin’, lyin’

BU: It gets tougher, and tougher. (LAUGHTER).

AL: Well, yes. Even in the days of Jesus, in the days of Moses, and everything that the Honorable Elijah Mohammed preaches in the way of livin’ clean, Christianity preaches, but they just don’t, you can be a Christian and commit adultery, you can drink, you can smoke, you can drink wine, because Jesus drinked it, and you can nightclub and party, but you can’t wear mini, mini skirts, and be followers of Jesus, but not bein’ a Muslim, so, I would say that the people are not rejectin’ the Honorable Elijah Mohammed because they don’t believe what he teach

BU: But, it’s too tough, it’s to otough.

AL: Right. Well, it’s not that it’s too tough, but they just haven’t looked in it enough to really check it out.

BU: They’re not committed. Well, I think that’s a very good point. I think that there might be other reasons for rejecting him, too, because somebody said his religion is a curious mixture of Calvary and the O.K. Corral.

AL: One more thing I’d like to say. Uh, fear of white people stops a lot now. I’m not namin’ the names, but many of them black people who come on your TV shows every week, slip to our meetins, donates to ‘em financially, Mohammed Speaks is always in his house, under his bed, but when he sees you, yassah, boss, he just

BU: I haven’t run into any of those. (LAUGHER)

AL: Well, they’re around.

BU: Give me their names and phone numbers.

AL: Many, many, many, many, many big black, many of the black leaders slip in his back door, civil rights leaders, but they don’t want the press to know it. And fear keeps a lot of our from comin’ to what the Honorable Elijah Mohammed is preachin’.

BU: Now, that fear, as related to your own experience, gets us back to the first point, which is you believe that you were reclassified because you became a follower of Elijah Mohammed, right? Otherwise, you

AL: I wouldn’t say that’s totally all of it, that’s got mainly a lot to do with it.

BU: Because I see from the Liberator Magazine, the Socialist magazine, published by the Afro-American Organization, they say whatever the government’s reasons, most black people are convinced that Mohammed Ali was victimized because he is black, because he is a member of the country’s most vulnerable minority. Now, this magazine, which is sympathetic to you, didn’t say because you were Muslim, (BOTH TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY) or a follower of Elijah Mohammed, but because you were black.

AL: Well, I would say that whoever wrote that actually believed that this is the reason, but this is not, no, no not because I’m black. As much money as the white people could make on me

BU: Well, why wouldn’t the devils go after you? Just because of that.

AL: As much money as the devils could make on me, commercials, advertisements, movies, heavyweight title fights, man, whew, millions of dollars was made when I fought. Let me tell you sumpin’

BU: Well, why didn’t they stick with you then?

AL: The government is so out to get me because of who I am, so that I can’t donate to the works of the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, a man who can take a dollar and make 10-thousand dollars come from it.

BU: Well, you have written that Elijah Mohammed refused to take your money.

AL: Right. Let me say one thing to you, let me say one thing. I owe him money, as a matter of fact. A hundred dollars. Let me say one thing to you, (PAUSE) I forgot what I was gonna say (LAUGHTER) What were we talkin’ about

BU: Well, you were saying about why they went after you because

AL: Oh, right. Thank you. I’m thinkin’ ahead of myself. You see, you’re a wise man, and you make a man think. (LAUGHTER)

BU: Is that ___ in the ring?

AL: No, boxers don’t think as fast as you. They’re slow. But what I would like to say is that Washington, the government, now, the reason I say the government’s behind all this, is because I tried to box a exhibition for the poor people in Mississippi, I could have donated at least 70 or 50-thousand dollars, they came together — the Boxing Commission — and they said well, he probably could, donate a couple a hundred thousand to ‘em, but that’s just a drop in the bucket, as

BU: Who said that?

AL: if to say, the Commission of California, Boxing Commissioners if to say Negroes are not worth than a drop in the bucket, and they wouldn’t do that for ‘em, and the government had to call ‘em, because the commissioners were frightened, as if somebody from Washington had called ‘em, and then we had another boxing match okayed in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m just showin’ you why I know where it’s comin’ from, everybody had okayed, the Mayor’s assistant, the Governor’s assistant, and the Commission gave me a license; somebody forgot to ask the Mayor about it, and he came back hollowin’, I don’t want no draft dodger here, git him out, and like he had a speech written out, somebody told him. And then we said, we’re not fightin’ in America until we go to jail and do some time, or win the case, so, we went to the Indian (?), friend of mine, said I can get you out, I’m not pushin’ the fights, I have various people, Negroes who know you all good, figure that somebody can make a way for me to make a livin’ in America. I say it’s impossible, it ain’t gonna work, I’m a Muslim. I’m followin’ the most hated man in the country, the most powerfulest, the onliest one that tells the truth, and they don’t want his works to spread, and keepin’ me down, hopin’ they can stop his progress. So, they said, oh, man, they ain’t that ___, Elijah Mohammed ain’t nothin’ that powerful, the government ain’t worried about it. I said Washington is not the White House, and not gonna let me fight. They went to the Indian Reservation, 15 Indian Chiefs all got together, okayed the fight,

BU: On the reservation?

AL: Yeah. It was all __, contracts had been signed. It got to Washington. And their food supply or something was threatened. Government surplies was threatened if you let him fight. And the next day no comment, but the fight’s off.

BU: Why can’t you fight outside the country?

AL: Oh, they took my passport. They got that early. Well, I had about, I’ll tell you why, I have about 3-million dollars in Asian, African and European exhibitions. Not fights, just in the Muslim country, they’re dyin’ to see me, so, now, 3-million dollars, the prosecutin’ attorney from Washington came to Houston and told the judge I was goin’ to Japan for the first exhibition, had about 500,000 dollars to pick up, the end of it me makin’ money. I didn’t even need America, I was so popular outside the country, until the prosecutin’ attorney came from Washington, and said, judge, we cannot let this man go to Japan and fight, because they are anti-American, they’re gonna praise him and hail him, and meet him, we understand, at the airport, make a hero out of him, they might make him a millionaire fugitive, his penalty is so serious, five years in prison, ten-thousand dollar fine, he might not return to the country. Now, if I want to leave the country, I know how to leave. Tomorrow. Quick. Easy. If I really want to leave. That’s not the intention. The intention is to stop me from makin’ a livin’. To punish me, you understand.

BU: Be right with you.

BREAK.

BU: Mr. Ali, if you believe that, why don’t you leave the country?

AL: Well, I’d like to say one thing. He was right, I could be a millionaire fugitive, if I was greedy and worried about myself

BU: Well, you could give it away.

AL: No, one thing I’d like to say.

BU: I mean, you could become a Canadian and fight and send the money to Elijah.

AL: Well, no, no. No, this is not my purpose and he don’t need my pennies.

BU: Well, but some people do.

AL: So, I would like to say this, that the flesh and the blood of my people, and their freedom is more important. And one thing I’d like to say real quick, because you say you have some questions, when the whites first came to America from England, they didn’t have the air-conditions, the Buckley Show, and the jet planes. They had to ride stagecoaches, watch Indians stab and kill their wives, no medicine, no penicillin, but nevertheless the first whites kept comin’. They cut down the trees, underbrush, until they made a way for you, then they went and got ‘em some slaves, and worked them them ___ to build a country, but they died, but they never saw this, but they made a way for you, and the World War II, the Japanese, his life didn’t mean nothin’ some of ‘em, they had planes called suicide missions, he knew he would die, he ran the plane directly into the ship for his people in the future, the children. Now, but black people we’ve been taught that we will never be free, until some will have to die, some will have to give up wealth, their loved ones, and their health, So, what I’m doin’ is for myself and for justice for black people, runnin’ will kill it all, it’ll make me a coward, you understand.

BU: I see what you mean, yeah.

AL: So, I would rather go to jail.

BU: Sure.

AL: Mr. Greenfield.

GR: I’ve heard you speak before about what you’re doin’ now, and how you enjoy it, but I just wonder, being quite honest with us, are there times when you miss being heavyweight champ of the world?

AL: No, they miss me. (LAUGHTER)

GR: I know that.

AL: No, I don’t miss it. I’ve not been missin’ it. You see, I would like to say one thing, whites have been, you may say why is he always talkin’ about whites and blacks, because everything that happens to me is racial, is all based on race and religion, you understand. Many boys I know, name of George Hamilton, get out of the army, and do everything, so I’m the scapegoat, so I got to think like this, because I’m a victim of all this.

GR: You know there are white kids in jail for five years, in fact, those Baltimore guys didn’t get two years, they got six, which is more than you.

AL: Well, they got two and a half.

GR: No, no, Berigan got six.

AL: That must have been in Wisconsin, but what I would like to say is this, your question was

GR: Do you miss it sometimes? Do you miss being the best fighter in the world?

AL: I am the best. I don’t miss being the best.

GR: But, you’ll never be able to prove that again.

AL: I don’t have to prove it. Can you name somebody that could as much as hit me?

GR: Not right now.

AL: No. So, I’m not, you’ve been brainwashed to think that I’m not the champ.

GR: Nope, nope. I just wonder if you miss what you were doin’.

AL: No, I miss the money, not boxing. (LAUGHTER) I’m bein’ truthful. I can box tomorrow, I can go to the gymnasium, call up my sparring partners, and we can box all day, but I won’t get no money for it. You understand?

BU: Miss Williams.

WI: Mr. Ali, you’ve said that you’re against war. I wonder how you feel about the Black Panthers domestic war here.

AL: Well, we black people, as a whole, are at war we’ll say with the white power structure. Not physically, but we have definite protests to win the battle. Like, for example, when America is in Vietnam, one American is fightin’ from the air, the other American is fightin’ on the land, another one is on the shore, shootin’ with the ships, another is a secret spy and another is in a submarine, they’re all fightin’ the same common enemy. They say the Viet Cong but they have different approaches. You see, black people ALL are fightin’ you all for freedom, justice and equality. One believes that intermarriage is gonna solve it, and 200 years from now we all will be a beautiful cream color. He really believes it. One believe that gittin’ some rifles and shootin’ up the country is gonna solve it, another believes that education. One day we’ll be the president. One believe that we gotta git into the white man’s pockets and get all the money. You’ve got hundreds of billions of dollars that he’ll never see or git to, but he believes that one day he’s gonna git most of the money. But we believe that the problem, the answer, is separation and marryin’ our own kind, cleanin’ up for self, and gittin’ some land, and buildin’ our own nation. So, the Black Panthers are a group who figure that they are right, and doin’ the thing the way they see it, but we don’t all agree with each other, but we’re not here to talk about it, but I will say, on violence Elijah Mohammed teaches us it’s impossible to be violent against the most powerful military country on the planet. It’s impossible.

BU: Mr. Gaynor.

GA: Mr. Ali, if you feel that the white man is your common enemy, do you foresee eventual physical conflicts between your movement and the white community?

AL: No, sir. I would like to say that, when you say my movement, it’s not my movement.

GA: Well, the movement of Elijah Mohammed.

AL: Right. You gotta watch all this, because you’ll have me thinkin’ it’s my movement. That’s the way they did Malcolm X and he wouldn’t straighten it out. He talked like it’s his movement. It’s not our movement. It’s the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, God’s, it’s God’s movement. And the Honorable Elijah Mohammed is teachin’ it to us.

GA: Well, do you think there will be eventual conflict?

AL: Not with Muslims, unless you attack us. You see, after each meetin’ we say that we don’t believe in bein’ the aggressor, but fight like hell against those who fight against you. But not be the aggressor. Which is not, there’s nothin’ wrong with that. But I’d like to say that Muslims are never in violence with white people. It’s the black man who love you. See, you don’t let him in your toilet, you don’t let him in your restroom, you don’t let him marry your daughter, you gotta fight. So, we’re not gonna be botherin’ you, you understand. Muslims don’t come in, we don’t have no trouble with you. It’s just the integrator.

GA: Do you allow white men in your meetings?

AL: No, sir, not in religious meetings. No, sir. It’s a family problem, a discussion, and you would feel out of place. You know. I’m sure you all have many meetings we can’t go to.

GA: A few. (LAUGHTER)

AL: A few. A whole lot of them.

BU: I can’t think of any. As a matter of fact, I can’t think of any.

AL: Who?

BU: No, I really can’t.

AL: You can’t think of any meetings that white folks have

BU: No.

AL: That black folks can’t go to?

BU: No, no, no I can’t.

AL: You should be ashamed of yourself.

FROM AUDIENCE: Klan

AL: Klan.

BU: Oh, the Klan. How could they tell?

AL: I’m sure there’s a whole lot of ‘em.

BU: Mr. __?__ (ALL TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY)

?: Mr. Ali, from your conversation with Mr. Buckley I have assumed, that, if given chance, and your appeal is won in the Supreme Court, you would return to the ring. Now, wouldn’t this conflict with your being an ordained minister of Islam and therefore pacifistic?

AL: You can look at it that way, that’s all right, I understand you, I’ve been asked this question a million times in colleges. Uh, I have, I’m in about 485-thousand dollars worth of debt, now, which the courts say I don’t have to pay until I can earn it, and I will have paid my debt, and git right out of the ring, but I would like to say boxing cannot compared with war. We have gloves on, we have cushions, we have referees, we have judges, we have ambulances there, the intention not to kill, we don’t have steel there, we don’t have bullets, we don’t kill momma, kill daddy, kill baby, our intention is a sport, and we’re not there to kill, so boxing cannot be compared in no way with machineguns and bombs and everything that they use

BU: Yeah, I think that’s fair enough

AL: Thank you.

BU: And uh well, just, in closing, Mr. Ali, do you feel that you will be able to repay this money that you owe by professional, you only have five seconds,

AL: If I’m allowed to pursue my profession again, yes.

BU: Thank you very much. I enjoyed talking to you very much.

AL: I enjoyed talking to you.

BU: And thank you all.

Black Lives Matter Ineptly Torches Justin Timberlake,"I would like to extend a hearty “Congratulations!” to Black Lives Matter on slowly but surely alienating every single one of their allies. A few days ago, Justin Timberlake was “forced” to apologize after a completely innocent tweet in support of actor Jesse Williams’ rant about racial and social justice at the BET Awards.

After this tweet the #BLM (Black Lives Matter, for the hashtag-illiterate) types immediately descended, demanding he stop appropriating black culture and music. When JT suggested “we are all ONE” it further exacerbated the issue. It’s not just JT. Many white Americans have been shouted down after expressing support for #BLM, and even just for sitting there minding their own business, not saying anything.

If we can’t even let a white celebrity tweet out support for the message of a half-white celebrity then we might be doing it wrong.

Heck, even Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been muzzled by the angry #BLM folks. Think about how counterproductive that is: both support #BLM and one of them just may be the president one day! But yes, let’s shame people into public silence. Great plan! That will make it extra exciting when folks start complaining once again about how quiet white people are about the loss of black life.

Great Idea: Shouting at Powerful People

#BLM types don’t seem to understand that black Americans are only 12 to 13 percent of the population of this country, and that white people are still more than 60 percent. Math is hard, but let’s run the numbers on that one. White people are still the majority—a very large majority—and they still dominate the apparatus of justice in this nation. So if you belong to a group that wants to influence that apparatus, you’d better start getting more white people to join you in your cause.

I’m no psychiatrist, but I feel pretty confident that the way to recruit people into a cause or movement isn’t to shame and berate them. That seems counterproductive. (I also find it a delicious irony that we’re complaining about Timberlake’s cultural appropriation over a tweet inspired by a BET Awards speech when Timberlake has been nominated for a BET Award eight times.)

Justin Timberlake did nothing—NOTHING—except support a very passionate message that every last one of the #BLM crowd endorses. For that he was belittled. This man has 55 million Twitter followers, 31 million on Instagram. He has multiple Grammys. He’s an actor, producer, and musician. He has influence.

Should they kiss his ass? No, but how about just say nothing. They don’t have to fall down and thank the heavens that this white man cares about black lives, but they don’t need to make him the devil, either. Just say nothing!

If anyone in the official #BLM had any common sense they’d jump on this opportunity and draft him into the movement so they could piggyback on his considerable social media platform. As a blogger, I am forced to know quite a bit about marketing and packaging a message for maximum results, and that seems like a marketing dream come true. Let the guy use his white privilege for the movement instead of forcing him to skulk away, taking all his money and his platform with him.

We’ve Come All This Way for You to Act Like Idiots?

While it seems likely Timberlake won’t change his personal views on racial unity and social justice, it’s even more likely he’ll simply not say anything from here on out. How long will it be before those same people who berated him start complaining that Timberlake and other white people like him aren’t speaking out enough?

Martin Luther King Jr. and our ancestors did not defeat Jim Crow by isolating themselves and belittling white people who dared to express their unity with the cause. King knew white America had to want our freedom as badly as we did in order to make an impact, and he marched proudly with many white activists. He welcomed white people who took the message of civil rights to their more ignorant brethren across the country.

If you’re part of the official #BLM movement, you may be saying to yourself right now (if you’ve even made it past the headline), “We don’t need a white savior! We don’t need white people to march with us. We need them to sit down and shut up and let us talk!”

If that’s your “strategy,” then good luck with that. You’ve officially forfeited the right to complain about white people not caring enough. The ones that do are shouted down and humiliated. Let them support you or make peace with the fact that you’re officially endorsing segregation.

Congressional Black Caucus Blames GOP For Dallas Shooting,"Democrat Rep. G.K. Butterfield blamed Republicans for the five officers who were massacred by a racially motivated gunman in Dallas Thursday night.

“The Republicans in Congress are refusing to address gun violence in America that targets black men and black women and Hispanic men and Hispanic women and, yes, even police officers,” Butterfield said while flanked by other members of the Congressional Black Caucus — just hours after five officers were shot and killed while trying to protect protestors who were rallying against police brutality.

One gunman, who is now dead, has been identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, a 25-year-old Army veteran with no apparent ties to terrorist groups nor criminal record. Johnson told authorities during the standoff he was specifically targeting white police officers, Dallas Police Chief David Brown said in a press conference Friday morning.

“The suspect said he wanted to kill white people,” Brown said. “Especially white officers.”

Despite the suspected gunman’s racial motivations, which he made clear in his own words to authorities during the standoff, Butterfield insisted Republican members of Congress were responsible for the tragedy.

Butterfield also suggested more tragedies will occur in the immediate future if Republicans don’t pass more gun control legislation.

“If we fail to act, this will be a long, hot summer,” he said.

At the time of publication, little is known about the suspect. The weapon used has yet to be revealed, as is whether the gunman obtained it legally or illegally.

Butterfield said:

‘We need legislative action now. We don’t need to leave the Hill this week or any week without assuring the American people that we understand the problem of police misconduct in America. We understand the murders of innocent black Americans. We get it. We understand the problems faced by our law enforcement officers and I don’t want to diminish that in this conversation today. We understand the problems faced by law enforcement officers, most of whom put on the uniform every day and serve and protect our communities.



‘Republicans, what on Earth — why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence? Why not give it a hearing? Give us a debate. Give us an up or down vote on legislation on gun violence. Why? Last night while on the floor, we were advised that several hundred protesters were en route to the Capitol, demonstrating and protesting and exercising the First Amendment rights, their First Amendment rights by demanding that we as elected officials protect their sons and daughters and their grandsons and granddaughters, their brothers and their sisters.



‘At 10:00 PM, the Congressional Black Caucus, along with other members from other caucuses, went outside of the Capitol and we met the demonstrators. We spoke to them. We embraced them. And we helped lead their march to the White House. They told us with unambiguous clarity that Black Lives Matter, that the movement is serious, it is organized and they demand legislative action now. And that we don’t leave this place until it’s done.



‘I applaud —we applaud the demonstrators last night for telling us the deaths of Baton Rouge and Falcon Heights gives them the energy and determination they need to pull off the band aid of the stain of irresponsible police killings in America. The two acts of murder this week that we all so sadly know must be addressed by law enforcement. It must be addressed by the Congress of the United States.



‘If we fail to act, this will be a long hot summer. In the rally audience last evening, a young lady held up a sign that read, ‘I wept more last night than I slept.’ Colleagues, America is weeping. They are angry. They are frustrated. And Congress, when I say Congress, I mean the Republicans in Congress, are refusing to address gun violence in America that targets black men and black women and Hispanic men and Hispanic women and, yes, even police officers.



The Congressional Black Caucus is frustrated. You want to say we’re mad, we’re mad. We are determined to take our advocacy now to a higher level.’

Don’t See Tragedy In Black Neighborhoods? You’re Not Looking,"I will never forget the day I got it. A bright day in my majority-black neighborhood in Southeast DC, police swarming the street as they finally busted the woman who had sold drugs out of the bus stop for months. My neighbor and I standing on our porches watching the aftermath. The police were milling about, mopping up, done with the action and starting the paperwork.

My neighbor, a black man, was better educated than I and worked a professional job probably making more money than me. He and his wife filled their home with music and art, kept their yard meticulously orderly, traveled the world.

As an aside, this may sound like a “very articulate” statement, an expression of surprise that such a black man existed, or singling him out as unusual, but he wasn’t. Perhaps he was a little on what I believe is called the booshy side, but there was nothing unusual about him. Most people in our neighborhood were like most people across America: Hardworking citizens living their lives, raising their families, tending their business in peace.

I describe my neighbor as a real person I knew. I cannot imagine he ever had trouble with the law, at least not of his making, and I am certain he had no warrants or probation to worry about. Yet as I stood to watch the police in action, he said, “I’m not going anywhere near that mess,” and fled into his house.

It was the look in his eyes. It was primal and afraid. He knew deep in his bones that he needed to keep away from police. It was instinct, something deeper than rationality.

It puzzled me because I, a white woman, knew deep in my bones that the police were there to help me. If I ever got lost, hurt, or afraid, I merely needed to call them and they would rescue me. I remembered once, as a girl, coming home to my suburban neighborhood only to find birds had broken into the house and were roosting on my grandmother’s silver. Naturally, after I failed to shoo them out, I called the police. Naturally, they came and flushed the birds out the window. It seems so silly now.

It Was Hard to Feel the Police Cared

But things were different in my majority-black neighborhood. I had never called 911 in my life, but I had cause to in that neighborhood. Me, on the phone in the wee hours of the night, more scared than I have ever been, pleading with them to hurry as screams came from my front yard. A man siccing three pit bulls on another man, standing, watching, approving as they bit and clawed. Yes, they were both black, victim and perpetrator.

Me, hiding irrationally behind the bed even though the men couldn’t see me, terrified the dog would tear the man’s throat out before the police came. No sirens in the distance. Just an eventual roll-by, arriving after the attacker had taken his dogs home, a single officer who did not get out of his car. He handed the bleeding victim a paper towel and called an ambulance. No charges were ever filed.

It was hard to feel the police cared. But then again, why would they? The victim would never testify against the thug who harmed him, probably did not even tell the officers who it was. A code of silence protected such people. I saw other things, too: Juries refusing to convict men who had been caught dead to rights selling drugs, juries putting thugs back on the street to victimize the community. The complicated and byzantine relationship between the community and the law, and the police are on the front lines. Hostility and need, disappointment and great heroism.

I saw women who had perhaps once had lovers or husbands but who were now alone, raising children, pouring themselves into the neighborhood with incredible dignity and strength. Men who preach, serve, and fight to bring peace to their neighborhoods. The incredible everyday heroism of this most American of stories, I began to see.

That heroin addict was not a heroin addict. He was Kevin, who had wrestled in high school, had had talent and gotten an athletic scholarship, who had hoped to compete in the Olympics, his eventual death of overdose a blow to the family who loved him. The beggar by the metro was not just a beggar but Mr. Jackson, a would-be musician consumed by alcohol. Shattered dreams do not hurt any less if you have a hand in shattering them.

I Don’t Blame You, But There Has to Be a Better Way

One Halloween, I was surprised to meet a teenager living across the street. I did not know he lived there—his single mother working two jobs made him stay inside for fear of what would happen to him on the streets. He might be attacked by thugs, seduced by thuggery, attacked by police, killed by a senseless act of violence, so he stayed inside always. He was a burly young man with a genial face, the type of young man a violent teen would attack just to prove himself. I remember thinking simultaneously that I didn’t blame her and that there had to be a better way.

I saw that the young men, and a few young women, who died each week were not just thugs gone wrong but Carla’s grandson or Sammy’s cousin or the kid of someone Yvonne went to high school with. I saw the young men, about one a year, who were killed because they dared to do well in school, dream to be better, and, even more insulting, lumped in with the violent by people who didn’t bother to distinguish one black victim from another.

So I began to understand, just a little, that the black community lives in a constantly unfolding nightmare. They can see it coming from far off in so many lives like a wave, and are powerless to stop it. They see a little boy, a precious child of theirs, grow into something lost. Someone’s baby, someone’s grandbaby. And they think “not another one.” They see a little girl with hope in her eyes fall to violence, and they say “not another one.” They see a man, a good man, gunned down by police, and think “not another one.” This chorus goes through their minds: “not another one.”

White America lives in another world where they never think that, never feel that in their bones. Yet it is something to be felt deep in the bones, something to breathe in and out. If we see a two-line obituary about a teenager killed by gang violence and do not see the tragedy of it, that is on us. If we see prisons bursting with broken dreams and do not see the tragedy, that is on us. If we see a man who dies for no good reason—even if the police are justified in wrongly thinking he was a threat—and do not see it for the tragedy it is, that is on us.

This is a problem for all Americans. I do not think white Americans are guilty, as more militant people believe, of wanting black people dead or repressed. I also believe the answer lies in conservative principles and rule of law as opposed to socialism. But I do think white Americans are guilty of willful blindness, of thinking a problem has been solved when it hasn’t, of living in a bubble and not seeing the struggle of their fellow Americans.

We lack compassion, we lack empathy, we do not see our brothers and sisters in their distress. The police are not the problem. We all are. And the solution will only come the American way: citizens working together toward a common goal of peace and prosperity.

"If You Don’t Want Cops To Shoot You, Don’t Resist Arrest","It saddens me that what little is left of the black civil rights movement is spent defending thugs, hustlers, drug dealers, and troublemakers such as Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile. Can you believe we’ve gone from honorable causes like fighting for the right of black people to attend college to defending black criminals who foolishly mouth off against, run away from, and fight with the police; police who are putting their lives on the line to protect us from criminals?

Can’t the protestors at least defend young black men of honor, quiet heroes going against the grain by wearing their pants around their waist; refusing thuggery, weed-smoking, and hustling; those who marry one woman, have all their kids with that one woman, proactively raise those kids to be successful, productive citizens, and love only their wife and no other woman; those who work an honest job with integrity, intensity, and discipline, no matter how menial the work? (Note: selling illegal cigarettes on the street or bootleg CDs on the corner doesn’t count as honest work!)

If a protest were held against the oppression of such young black men, I’d be the first to join in. Yet every time I hear of a black man being killed by the cops, he’s not the man I just described. He’s almost always a criminal thug I have no desire to defend. Hardly our best, and hardly what Dr. King died for.

It’s Easier to Blame Everyone But Yourself

You see, unlike those men recently shot, I do not fear for my life from the police. Quite the contrary, my life is made safer by the police who stand between me and people like Sterling, who is much more likely to break into my car or stick me up at night compared to any harm that might come to me from a police officer. The fact is, the police are not shooting black men like me. Why? Because I am not a criminal, and when the police stop me, I politely do what they say, and they leave me alone. I do not run away, fight back, or mouth off. It’s really pretty simple.

Why is no one asking how these men’s families and communities failed them so badly that they became criminals or thugs? If you look up “tough” in the dictionary, my grandmother’s picture will come up. If you were raised under her and acted up, after she got done with you you’d wish the police had gotten to you first. I’m glad my father was raised in such an environment. Discipline happens in the home, and it starts early. When it doesn’t, the police are left to clean up the mess of deeply broken human beings who were already doomed before their first interaction with the law. It’s totally unfair to ask the police to treat hardened criminals with kid gloves.

How did we get here? The Welfare Industrial Complex has produced generational government dependence that has devastated black families and communities and created the criminal underclass of black thugs the police are killing today. I wonder what Black Lives Matter has to say about that? Will they unequivocally call for an end to the welfare, food stamps, and government subsidized housing that have replaced the black father, and thus return the role of family provider to the black man where it belongs, not the government?

Will they call for a complete end to illegal immigration and to burdensome regulations and taxes that make hiring Americans too expensive? After all, these things reduce wages, increase unemployment, and harm the ability of young black men to get jobs that provide for a family. My guess: don’t hold your breath. It’s just so much easier to blame the police, white privilege, and institutionalized racism.

Yet amid all the hype, let us not lose sight of reality: No matter how much the media attempts to stir up racial strife, the fact is about 70 black people are killed by other black folks for every one killed by a white police officer. White police killings of black people are simply a non-issue compared to what black people do to each other, unfortunately.

So no, despite the prevailing atmosphere of hysteria, I’m not afraid of being killed by the police. Quite the contrary: sadly, the data shows I’m much more likely to be victimized by a fellow black man than by a white police officer. So may the police remain sharp, aggressive, and strike fear into criminals so the good people don’t become victims.

This Week We Are All Black Lives Matter,"In the early 1960s the nascent platform of television news brought images of the civil rights movement into the living rooms of American white people. Most understood the reality of racial discrimination, but had never seen firehoses and dogs set on human beings. The images shocked and galvanized them. It led to change—often not enough change, sometimes the wrong change, but the truth could no longer be ignored.

This week, the videos of the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile have shocked a white America that has known for too long there is a problem. Every white American paying attention already knew police kill black men at alarming rates. But knowing isn’t seeing. This week we saw and felt the shock and pain of a woman losing the man she loves. This week the technologies of smartphones and social media brought all this into our living rooms.

As if these horrible events were not enough, in their wake five police officers are dead in Dallas, victims of a madman who set out to kill white cops. It’s a reminder that our rhetoric has consequences, but so does our silence.

After watching these videos I understood the term “Black Lives Matter” in a new way. In fairness, the movement (which I remain critical of in significant ways), has been trying to explain it to me for some time. What the term really means is that black lives don’t matter. Not enough, anyway. This is an ugly concept for white Americans to accept. But it is a daily reality for America’s blacks.

Hear Our Cries, Someone

So far, this carnage has failed to convince much of white America that there is a crisis going on. Individual events can be painted as isolated incidents. Statistics can be used to show that black men have a higher rate of police interactions. We can tell ourselves, truthfully, that police departments and the government are initiating training and best practices. After all, what can we really do other than sit in our living rooms and watch?

Ever since the riots in 1968 black protesters have been mocked for burning down their own neighborhoods. But there is a logic behind this that is important to understand. We watch. If the protesters in the Newark riots had gone to raise hell on the Upper East Side, white America’s response would have been a lot more than watching. It would have led to a confrontation the protesters knew they were bound to lose.

But white America watched the Watts riots, just as we watched Ferguson. In both cases black Americans were yelling “Look at me!” They were demanding that we see and feel the crisis of police violence towards blacks. Not as an esoteric problem, but as a time bomb, ready to go off at any minute with the news of another deadly police shooting.

When the next black man or child is killed, we will once again wince, shake our heads, and hope officials get their act together. Then we will return to our lives, the things that really matter. This is the problem Black Lives Matter is attempting to address. Do I agree with them shutting down others’ speech to put their message first? In most cases I do not. Do I understand why they are doing it? Absolutely.

If instead of black people being murdered by police we were facing the outbreak of a disease, or a drumbeat of killings by foreign actors, it would be the only story until the problem was solved. It would not ebb and flow into our consciousness with each breaking newsflash. As wrongheaded as some of the movement’s actions have been, on this point they are quite correct. We aren’t acting like this matters to us.

Silence Is Not the Answer

It is difficult for white Americans to know what they can, or even what they are supposed to, do. On the one hand we are told to be allies, standing in the background, silently listening to voices of the voiceless. But at the same time we are told this is our problem and only we can fix it, which is doubtless true. But these two admonitions are at cross-purposes. White people cannot face this problem with an attitude of respectful silence.

We must be loud about this crisis. It must stay above the fold, and in our feeds. We must be animated and angry. More than anything, we must let our black countrymen know we see this for what it is and we will not stand for it. Do not be swayed by the white race-baiters posting pictures of victims to make them look like criminals. There will be cases where the victim is a sinner; there will be cases where the victim is a saint. But what these cases must represent to us is one single broad problem: police killing black people.

The 1960s were a time of tremendous and important legislative and judicial change. But ultimately, it wasn’t the laws or the state that underwent the most important change. It was us. We were shocked into self-reflection. We were stunned into caring. Attitudes changed. Ultimately, we must trust and promote that hope of changing attitudes.

Law and policy can attempt to address systemic racism, but every system is eventually implemented by people. The hand that holds the gun is the only system. In those long, deadly moments choices are made, threats assessed, and actions taken. We must never accept the color of a person’s skin influencing the police officer facing these situations.

I’m not convinced white Americans have accepted this. In fact, I know many have not. As black Americans shout, yell, and cry that their lives matter, the eerie silence of white Americans carefully balancing causes and solutions whispers back, “No, they don’t.”

Now is the moment we must not avert our eyes. We must stare at this scourge of killings and demand that stopping them take the highest priority. If we believe, as most of us hope we do, that all lives matter, now is the time to prove it.

Black Lives Matter’s Violence Undermines Its Credibility,"In the aftermath of police killings of two black men—Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota—Black Lives Matter (BLM)-led protests have sprung up in cities all over the country. While their grievances are clear and compelling, their methods of achieving redress are questionable and may hurt the movement’s long-term goals.

BLM may intend to do the right thing: enlighten the public about injustices within the black community, especially at the hands of law enforcement.

#BlackLivesMatter advocates dignity, justice and freedom. Not murder.



— Black Lives Matter (@Blklivesmatter) July 8, 2016



After the news of Castile and Sterling’s deaths hit the nation, BLM held a protest in Dallas, Texas. Although that protest started out peacefully, it ended in bloodshed when a gunman who had a vendetta against white cops murdered five and injured several other on-duty officers.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick blamed BLM: “I do blame people on social media, with their hatred toward police. I do blame former Black Lives Matter protests ― last night was peaceful, but others have not been… this has to stop.”

The events in Dallas have set off a firestorm of protests, demonstrating just how livid and unruly the movement has become. Instead of protesting peacefully nationwide and despite condemning the Dallas shooting, BLM is doubling down in its protests, often violently. They shut down an interstate and major thoroughfare in Miami. In Oakland, protestors vandalized a police station with red paint and spray-painted streets, also stopping traffic on an interstate, during which protesters climbed atop a stalled semitrailer. Others lit a bonfire on the freeway.

Even widely viewed photos such as this one hide this aspect of violence, as the woman looks peaceful yet is being removed from a roadway she refused to exit of her own volition in an attempt to keep disrupting traffic.

Violence in Saint Paul

Police pulled Castile and his girlfriend over because he matched the description of an armed robbery suspect (at first media reported it was only for a minor traffic violation). It’s also reported he had a license to carry a firearm. It now appears as though those two pieces of information combined to aggravate an under-trained or trigger-happy officer, as the cop shot Castile four times and he died following the incident. Castile’s girlfriend shot this video live to Facebook, which went viral, fueling BLM to organize an impromptu protest on the streets of the Twin Cities Saturday night.

BLM shut down part of Interstate 94, a major highway in St. Paul, and although it appears to have begun peacefully, some people started throwing water bottles, pieces of concrete, rebar, brick, Molotov cocktails, and rocks at police. At 3:27 in this video you can see a person throwing a small firecracker towards the police. To break up the crowd and push them off the highway, police responded with flash/bang grenades. About 100 protesters were arrested and more than 20 cops were hurt, one with a spinal fracture.

Keep callin y'all. @mayorcoleman release all protesters now. https://t.co/t4UC3Jk2wd

Few people are likely to be sympathetic to Black Lives Matter when they protest police by throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks at them, spurring multiple arrests, then demand to be released.

Snarling At Police Has Got to Be Effective, Right?

Following Sterling’s death on Saturday, caught on video here, BLM protested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he lived. BLM activist DeRay McKesson tweeted, just before he was arrested, that police were provoking them “for no reason.” But when you watch the clip, the police are walking alongside or escorting the protestors, and the protestors are the ones making snarky insults.

And now the police are pacing the protestors, provoking us for no reason. #BatonRouge https://t.co/bCGmh46x7T

When “a few hundred people” attempted to close off a Louisiana interstate, police headed them off and arrested between 30 and 40.

Good Cause, Bad Approach

BLM may wish to be peaceful, well-meaning, strategic, and persuasive, and these violent and disruptive behaviors are the actions of a relative few. Yet when the “few” are attacking police officers, it’s hard to overlook. As Barbara Reynolds, a minister and 1960s activist, wrote last year of the current movement:

Many in my crowd admire the cause and courage of these young activists but fundamentally disagree with their approach. Trained in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr., we were nonviolent activists who won hearts by conveying respectability and changed laws by delivering a message of love and unity. BLM seems intent on rejecting our proven methods…[A]t protests today, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot. The demonstrations are peppered with hate speech, profanity, and guys with sagging pants that show their underwear. Even if the BLM activists aren’t the ones participating in the boorish language and dress, neither are they condemning it.

The BLM movement, unlike King’s, only seem to come out in droves following very specific murders: when white cops kill black people. Yet this is not the major scourge of the black community. Recounting his days as mayor of New York City, when crime was reduced by over 50 percent, Rudy Giuliani noted on Fox News,

Black Lives Matter hasn’t saved nearly as many black lives, if they’ve saved any at all, as I have. Where are they? Where are ‘Black Lives Matter’ when six kids get shot in Chicago by other black kids? The reality is we’re going to end this issue when we get control of the significant amount of violence in urban America within the black community. And it’s the police who are doing that. Black Lives Matter divides us.

Given the videos of the killings of Castile and Sterling last week, it seems clear BLM has legitimate grievances. But if they want to be heard and remembered as a movement that changed racial unrest in America, in line with the success of the 1960s civil rights movement, they must do so without provoking police or inciting violence. Until they can figure out how to do this, their actions will continue to besmirch their reputation and cause.

"For Micah Johnson, Any Ideology Is An Excuse To Kill","Let’s take the Dallas shooter at his word: he hated white people. But is that all there is? Lots of blacks, whites, Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans hate each other. They don’t all open fire on each other with powerful weapons. Maybe there’s something else at work here.

The current narrative is that Micah Johnson, as a young African-American man, was enraged by police brutality against African-Americans. An Army veteran and a “quiet” young person—these shooters are never described as “loud”—he was finally pushed over the edge either by the police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana (if you’re sympathetic to the most militant black nationalist line) or the irresponsible rhetoric of groups like Black Lives Matter (if you’re an adherent of the view that BLM is essentially a terrorist organization).

There’s another possibility, one largely ignored because it doesn’t fit either narrative: maybe Johnson, like Charleston murderer Dylann Roof and Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen, was a screwed-up weirdo with a ton of anger who went looking for a cause to support his desire to kill.

Always Something of a Misfit

Superficially, it looks like Johnson turned to violence after returning from Afghanistan, a fact that seamlessly plays into a perfect narrative of racial injustice: black veteran returns to Texas from a war zone—“he managed to bring his war back home,” as the New York Times put it—where he finds black men are in more danger in America than in Afghanistan, so picks up a rifle in defense of his community.

Except that’s not quite what happened. Johnson never saw combat, and he didn’t “return” so much as he was “sent home.” For stealing panties.

As the Daily Beast reported, Johnson was shipped back to his reserve unit just ahead of a restraining order and a less-than-honorable discharge from the Army.

As reported by one of his bunkmates in Afghanistan, Johnson suffered a particular shame.



‘We all knew he was a pervert cuz he got caught stealing girls’ panties,’ the bunkmate later said in a Facebook post.



Johnson’s military lawyer, Bradford Glendening, says that a female corporal mentioned Victoria’s Secret underthings when she filed a sexual harassment complaint against his client.



The lawyer further reports that the corporal was worried enough to seek an order of protection against Johnson and to recommend that he receive mental health treatment.

Somehow, Johnson escaped punishment: he got an honorable discharge, which surprised even his lawyer. “Someone really screwed up,” Glendening said. “But to my client’s benefit.”

Johnson, as it turns out, was always something of a misfit, much like his would-be White Power and ISIS counterparts Roof and Mateen. Like other “loners”—a word that popped up within a day of the shootings—he was fascinated by military hardware and macho endeavors, including enrolling at the “Academy of Combat Warrior Arts” near Dallas.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that. It’s perfectly normal for a young man with “anger issues” to enroll in an academy that trains young men in combat tactics, rather than wasting his time with boring things like jobs or girlfriends. (When he wasn’t honing his urban guerilla skills, he shot hoops literally for eight hours a day.)

A Victim Avenger

None of this is to deny that when Johnson finally opened fire on Dallas law enforcement officers, his head was full of racist poison. The outsider who was obsessed by military weapons as early as high school, whose stepmother was white, whose time in the Army came to an end with a handful of stolen panties, found an ideology that made him the victim of a race war and placed him in the role of a powerful avenger.

This is what Roof and Mateen did as well, like so many other “lost boy” killers. Roof, for his part, said he was sick of black men raping white women. Like Johnson, his friends said he made the occasional racist remark, but no one thought he was serious about violence. Mateen, likely a closeted gay man, lashed out at the gay community after a history as a difficult boy stretching back to third grade and more recent events in which his temper scared those who knew him.

In every case, we must study the professed motives of the shooters and hold those responsible who made the propaganda who inspired them: white nationalists, black nationalists, Islamic extremists. At the same time, we should not assume these young men are avatars of the ideologies they espouse. Rather, they are part of a new strain of violent losers, men driven by a combination of narcissism and insecurity and who latch on to heroic narratives in which they are the central figures in a morality play of justice and retribution.

Defending the white race, defending the black race, avenging Islam: all of them are the same story played out by the same type of man. In other cases (John Salvi attacking abortion clinics, Timothy McVeigh blowing up a federal building) the targets or the ideas may be different, but the actors and narrative are the same. The hero, spurned in his own community, takes matters into his own hands, and kills—usually in the most cowardly way possible.

Crazy Loners Shouldn’t Control Us

In every case, we zero in on the message, because normal human beings link actions with words. We also do this because the alternative is even more frightening than terrorism: we cannot seriously believe that an aimless life of too much weed, or a burning shame and anger about getting caught as a panty thief, can eventually produce the slaughter in Charleston and Dallas. It’s too random, too uncontrollable, and too close to home. Terrorism, in a way, is actually the more comforting explanation.

It’s true, of course, that hateful propaganda always targets the weakest and most insecure among us. It’s not meant to turn men and women of virtue into killing machines; it’s meant to sift through the lost and disturbed, and to instruct them in how to focus their vaporous fears and formless rage into a weapon.

They wanted a reason to commit murder. They found one. The next killer will just as surely find his own.

It’s also true that groups of people with the same ideology create cells of terror and violence. These groups make plans and sustain networks, and must be pursued and broken up wherever they’re found. But to conflate radicalized losers with actual terrorist organizations is to risk spreading law enforcement and intelligence too thin: the battle against terrorism and the firefight with a disturbed loser who was part of nothing and who spoke to no one are not part of the same war.

Johnson’s ramblings are no more and no less important than Roof’s racial theories or Mateen’s pledge of allegiance to ISIS. These men, in retrospect, seemed likely to kill at some point. White supremacy, black nationalism, and Islamic extremism lit the fuse, but in the twenty-first century, there is no way to empty the trough of toxic Internet sludge on which these damaged boy-men feed. They wanted a reason to commit murder. They found one. The next killer will just as surely find his own.

The more pressing question is whether we will allow ourselves to be dragged into social warfare by these pathetic failures. Racism and terrorism are real problems, but are we going to let panty thieves and chronic stoners set the terms of the debate?

Rather, if we’re going to have another dreaded “much-needed national conversation,” it should not be about guns or racism, but about the human time bombs our culture is creating and nurturing among us. Unfortunately, that’s not only a discussion for another day, but one so uncomfortable to think about that we’re likely never to have it at all.

How Obama Left Us More Racially Divided Than Ever,"My mother is a huge fan of Barack Obama. The house is decked out with portraits of the president and Michelle, including some from his inauguration, which she attended. I’ve never seen her this excited for any president, including Bill Clinton.

This type of sentiment is typical of many black Americans, who have a brimming sense of pride over the first black president. This is not so much because they agree with his policies—in fact, many black Americans, while Democrats, identify as conservative—but rather due to a sense of victory that after so many years of slavery and segregation, we’ve finally arrived at the point where the American people are willing to accept a black president.

Yet all is not well. Under President Obama, many black folks think racial division has increased, not decreased. A family friend, who is a Democrat and an Obama supporter, recently curiously remarked, “I’ll be glad when Obama is out of office.” He said this not as an affront to President Obama, but as an acknowledgement that the state of racial affairs seems to have gotten worse under him.

Many whites feel the same way, which is one reason Donald Trump is popular. His outright rejection of political correctness that many Americans are sick of seems like a step in the right direction to his supporters, who hope removing PC will allow for honest dialogue without fear of being called racist amidst an environment that has become increasingly charged and accusatory.

Why is this the case? How did we get to a spot where black and white perceptions on race are so divergent, and we are more divided than ever? It starts with how you view our country.

Either You’re an Optimist or Pessimist

My view of America is that we are a place of great promise and opportunity, where someone like me, who is the grandchild of illiterate black Southern sharecroppers, can achieve success and reach the American dream. We are a place occupied by fair-minded, hard-working people whose culture and values have built a nation that is the envy of the world. I am proud to be a part of that culture.

Our Founders, while imperfect and a product of their times, were visionary heroes who made hard choices and compromises to give us the successful system we have today. Because Americans are good, we’ve worked hard over time to right the wrongs in our society that our Founding Fathers could not eliminate in their time. In summary, we are a fundamentally decent people blessed to live in a phenomenal land with a rich heritage.

But not so for President Obama. His view of our nation seems to be very different than mine and that of many other Americans. I believe that when President Obama thinks of America, more so than a place of hope or opportunity, he thinks of a place where racist white Christian fundamentalists came here from Europe, committed genocide against Native Americans, enslaved and segregated black people, denied women, gays, and other minorities their rights, and used capitalism and a rigged legal system to oppress poor people for centuries. He also believes this is still continuing today.

Given this view of America as an evil place in need of forceful justice for her sins, the president’s overarching goal has been to eliminate what he sees as the structural, institutionalized discrimination that defines America. He has done this by taking every opportunity to see disparities between groups as evidence of discrimination, then using all available resources to fight this perceived discrimination by going to war against the Americans he believes are responsible for it, who are almost always whites, men, police, and Christians.

A small sampling of the ways he has done this are: accusing whites of “white privilege,” which means having an unfair advantage due to being white, an advantage built upon oppressing minorities; accusing the police and justice system at large of racism; blaming pay differences between men and women on discrimination; and casting Islamic radicalism as a legitimate response to discrimination (ostensibly by white Christians).

This strategy has had two effects: 1) It’s caused the alleged victims of the perceived discrimination to become more militant, hostile, and only willing to make demands and not willing to engage in dialogue due to increasing their sense of victimhood, and 2) It’s caused the alleged perpetrators of the perceived discrimination to feel unfairly blamed for problems that are not their fault, thus less willing to engage in dialogue with people who will do nothing but accuse them of wrongdoing.

In other words, both sides are moving away from each other. This means that, contrary to unifying the nation, the president’s leadership has caused division and discord.

Discrimination Is Not the Biggest Problem for Minorities

In addition to failing to unify the nation, the president’s leadership philosophy has also failed to solve the underlying problems supposedly caused by discrimination. This is due to his failure to understand two critical truths: 1) Unequal outcomes do not constitute proof of discrimination. Thus policies attempting to produce equal results between groups through eliminating discrimination will accomplish nothing when the unequal outcomes are not caused by discrimination in the first place, and 2) While actual discrimination exists, most of the ills minorities face in today’s America are not caused by discrimination, but rather by factors such as complete family breakdown engendered by the welfare state and reduced employment prospects due to globalization, illegal immigration, and automation. So again, policies to remedy discrimination will do nothing to solve problems that are not caused by discrimination in the first place.

Sure enough, this is exactly what the data shows. With the exception of the unemployment rate, black Americans are worse off in many categories under President Obama, including: labor force participation, the percentage of people below the poverty line, real median income, the number of black people on food stamps, the percentage of black people who own homes, and the black-white test score gap in education.

Thus, far from unifying the nation, and far from ending the social ills he believes are caused by discrimination, President Obama has—perhaps unwittingly—caused America to become more polarized and divided, and brought us no closer to solving the key problems stunting black achievement.

Is Anti-Race-Baiting A Form Of Race-Baiting?,"Heather Mac Donald has spent a good portion of her career assuring people white cops aren’t racist. In 2010 she wrote a book entitled “Are Cops Racist?” Here’s the quick summary: No.

Mac Donald’s most recent book explores similar themes, and she’s written multiple articles in the same vein, including this one, penned last February but reprinted this past weekend by the Wall Street Journal. A fresh missive reiterating the same themes appeared in the Journal on Tuesday.

I agree with Mac Donald: Very few cops (of any race) are bigots. Here’s my concern, though. I’m not sure this is an answer to the questions many Americans are asking right now.

Mac Donald clearly wants this to be the question. Her article in the Journal begins with four quotes from the major Democratic presidential contenders, all related to criminal justice. Hillary Clinton is quoted as saying “too many encounters with law enforcement end tragically,” and “we have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.” Bernie Sanders is on record promising “no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will,” and “It is not acceptable to see unarmed people being shot by police officers.”

Now we get Mac Donald’s summary: “Apparently the Black Lives Matter movement has convinced Democrats and progressives that there is an epidemic of racist white police officers killing young black men.” Wait. Which of those quotes mentioned racist white police officers?

Bad Outcomes Don’t Necessarily Imply Evil Intent

Go back and read them again. Both candidates lament racism, and both decry a “broken system.” Neither one says anything about bigoted cops.

Perhaps you think this is hairsplitting, and that it’s perfectly obvious what Sanders and Clinton both meant. You should reconsider. The Democratic candidates are saying two distinct things. First, our criminal justice system has some problems that particularly (“systemically”) disadvantage blacks. Second, we’re seeing far too many tragic incidents in which police shoot or kill citizens.

It’s entirely possible for these assessments to be accurate for reasons that have little or nothing to do with police bigotry. Actually, there are many reasons these things could be true, which would in no way reflect personal prejudice among law enforcement.

Police officers enforce laws other people make. They deliver offenders to courts they don’t control to receive punishments others decide. They’re regularly subject to bureaucratic pressures to make this or that an enforcement priority, and their resources are perpetually limited. In short, there are innumerable reasons the system could be “broken” that would have nothing to do with racist cops.

Undoubtedly, some radical members or associates of Black Lives Matter do levy egregiously unfair charges against (especially) white cops. Last week that resentment spilled over into horrific bloodshed, which is why the WSJ decided it was an appropriate time to reprint Mac Donald’s piece.

Was that a healthy response, though? It might be if there were a chance cop-hating black radicals would read Mac Donald’s piece and be convinced. Realistically though, I don’t think the Wall Street Journal has much influence in that crowd. Its readers are conservatives, who should at this moment be looking for common ground and viable solutions, not radioactive buttons to push. Unless and until particular Democrats personally decry an “epidemic” of racist white cops, we shouldn’t saddle them with such inflammatory views. We also shouldn’t interpret their words in ways that are maximally injurious to the honor of white cops.

Are Cops Trigger-Happy, Or Are Black People Violent?

Lethal police shootings are controversial for a reason. It’s hard to blame “the system” when an officer shoots a suspect; presumably the blame lies with the officer, or the suspect (or possibly some combination of the two). But if we are indeed witnessing “an epidemic” of lethal police shootings, that surely says something about the police as a group, or about the people being policed.

Obviously, Mac Donald’s money is on the latter. Her argument, though, is decidedly odd. Drawing on the Washington Post’s meticulously kept data on police shootings in 2015 (The Guardian has engaged in a similar project), she points out that “fatal police shootings make up a much larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths than black homicide deaths.”

Come again? It’s strange how Mac Donald skips right past the obvious questions and focuses on a very specific detail of the Post’s broad-ranging project. Shouldn’t we maybe start by considering whether we have a worrisomely high number of lethal police shootings in general, and whether (and by what ratios) young black males are disproportionately victims?

There is also some recent evidence blacks are disproportionately likely to be stopped and harassed by police but not disproportionately likely to be shot in a police encounter. (Interestingly, Mac Donald does reference this study in Tuesday’s article, but only the portion relating to shootings. She doesn’t mention the disproportionate use of non-deadly force.)

Given all these interesting details, it’s odd how quickly she races to a rather specific question: If a particular person is the victim of a homicide, how likely is it that a police officer pulled the trigger? We can anticipate the answer. Given the fact of having been killed by another person, whites and Hispanics are more likely to have been shot by the police.

The stress Mac Donald places on this one weird statistic should itself make us wary. It’s clear she doesn’t want to discuss the alarmingly high number of police shootings. She wants to talk about the violence of dysfunctional black subcultures. After discussing her ratio-of-homicide-victims stat for two whole paragraphs, she bolsters her point by observing blacks also represent a disproportionate number of police assailants, and are disproportionately charged with robbery, murder, and assault. At last, she puts a bow on her “blacks are violent” argument by citing evidence black officers are more trigger-happy than their white counterparts.

We get the point. Don’t blame the white guys. They’re just trying to do their jobs.

Asking the Right Questions

This would be a solid argument if our main interest were in holding a moral magnifying glass to the hearts of white police officers. Mac Donald can build a strong case that police departments are not a breeding ground for white bigots. In fairness, that point holds some legitimate interest in light of the wild allegations flying through the virtual world and threatening the peace of several American cities.

Do black citizens have non-fanciful reasons to mistrust or resent law enforcement?

Having said that, it might still be worthwhile to broaden our range of questions. I humbly suggest most people are less interested in the racial attitudes of cops than in questions like the following:

Are our laws, and the means by which we enforce them, burdensome to honest and (at least mostly) law-abiding black citizens, especially those who live in poorer neighborhoods?

Are law-abiding black citizens more likely to be harassed, detained, or shot by police than law-abiding non-black citizens? Are petty (black) lawbreakers more likely to provoke a disproportionately forceful response from law enforcement?

More generally, do black citizens have non-fanciful reasons to mistrust or resent law enforcement?

Mac Donald’s statistics give us reason to think white cops probably aren’t, in general, racist. But that could easily be compatible with a world in which law-abiding black citizens (especially in high-crime neighborhoods) very reasonably view the police as a threat.

Some Helpful Hypotheticals

There is actually an upside to civic unrest over police shootings: it’s precipitated a push for better data and increased study of policing patterns. Hopefully, this will enable us to generate new strategies for training and deploying police effectively. In the meanwhile, some hypotheticals might help to illustrate why Mac Donald’s data, although not wholly irrelevant, really doesn’t answer the crucial questions.

You’re far more likely to be the victim of such an error if you live in a high-crime, low-trust neighborhood with a lax attitude towards due process.

Let’s suppose that certain predominantly black neighborhoods, for a range of historical reasons, have high crime rates and a pervasive mistrust of law enforcement. Solving major crimes in such neighborhoods is challenging. There are lots of murders, but a dearth of willing witnesses or informants. Still, the residents aren’t the type whose personal problems get reported on CNN, so standards for due process start to slip. That in turn poses dangers to the law-abiding, undermining further the relationship between local residents and police.

In such a scenario, proportionate numbers (of police shootings to crime stats) wouldn’t necessarily tell the whole story. Even honest, non-bigoted police are going to get the wrong man occasionally. You’re far more likely to be the victim of such an error if you live in a high-crime, low-trust neighborhood with a lax attitude towards due process. Roland Fryer’s much-celebrated recent study, although admirable in the scope of its data, wouldn’t necessarily reflect those sorts of problems.

We could add another wrinkle by supposing some cities might (historically or in the present day) have viewed the safety of impoverished, predominantly black neighborhoods as a relatively low priority. A rash of break-ins in the mansion district provokes panic, a press conference, and the threat of new management if the police don’t address the problem. By contrast, stacks of unclosed homicides from poor black neighborhoods just don’t make the mayor’s agenda.

In such a world, we might see homicides raging largely unchecked in certain neighborhoods, driving up black homicide rates. The associations might then lead blacks in gentrified neighborhoods to be viewed (somewhat reasonably) with greater suspicion. Meanwhile, the overall black homicide rate could still seem to justify the disparities, while in reality, honest black citizens might be right to suppose they’re at greater risk. More importantly, black citizens in such a world would have some reason to think society at large was lamentably indifferent to their well-being.

We should note that hypotheticals like the above could all be broadly true even if America had not a single racist cop.

Pointing Fingers Versus Seeking Solutions

The most discouraging thing about Mac Donald’s coverage of this topic is the dearth of suggested solutions. Both Journal articles imply public outrage should be directed towards black crime and not police misconduct. This is also a curious argument. Of course black homicide is a terrible thing. Still, social movements normally aim their messages at those who are interested in public opinion. That doesn’t include murderers. If widespread social disapproval were sufficient to deter violent crime, it’s fair to say our homicide rate would be close to zero.

We shouldn’t try to bury the realities of social breakdown, but we also shouldn’t use them as a de facto excuse to do nothing.

We shouldn’t try to bury the realities of social breakdown, but we also shouldn’t use them as a de facto excuse to do nothing. It’s important to support good cops, but one way to do that is by seeking real solutions. Both cops and residents suffer when relations between neighborhood residents and law enforcement break down.

What sorts of measures might help to alleviate the problem? Better transparency? Improved training procedures and attention to mental health? Changes in the way we allocate our resources? As a longtime expert in policing, Mac Donald could be addressing these questions instead of focusing relentlessly on answering a question that relatively few are asking.

Most cops aren’t racist. It doesn’t follow, however, that black citizens have no real grievances.

How Black Lives Matter Could Really Help Black People,"Snoop Dog’s crude Instagram comments about the History Channel’s remake of “Roots” and other recent productions that explore American slavery set off a wave of aggrieved reactions. In his rant, the Doggfather basically repudiates movies that show black people being brutalized by whites. He also admonishes filmmakers to produce movies that show more flattering images of black success, and calls on “real niggas” like him to avoid watching slavery-focused epics.

All told, Snoop Dogg’s remarks broached an interesting and timely debate. For example, The Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts penned an open letter to the West Coast rapper, criticizing him for condemning “Roots” just as many had condemned gangsta rap in the late ’80s and ’90s for its profane commentary on urban street culture. The irony is that, at the time, Snoop and other artists defended their music as important social documents.

NewsOne anchor Roland Martin also lambasted the rapper/actor (who holds the unfavorably reviewed “Soul Plane” as a film credit) for not signing on to produce black indie films, which hope to offer a broader reflection of the black experience. What we have here is really a culture wars debate. As is sometimes the case, when you get beyond the rhetorical skirmish, all parties seem to be genuinely concerned with the kinds of cultural content presented to this generation.

Our Conflict Addiction

In our age of social media and instant downloads, people are right to sound off about the subject matters and images to which this generation is exposed. According to the Pew Research Center, with the aid of smartphones, 92 percent of American teens go online daily. Over the last few years, young and old alike have been fed a steady diet of mass shootings, terrorism, police shootings of unarmed black men, and violent political protests. Social media and our 24-hour news cycle have left us both informed and unnerved.

Add to that the FBI’s Semiannual Crime Statistics, which saw an increase in every offense in the violent crime category in 2015. That’s the external reality. But how we respond to it is even more important. The real problem is that we’ve become a society fixated on conflict.

Sure, everyone needs to stay informed, but being overly preoccupied with societal conflict is problematic. In the ’90s, then University of Chicago professor Gerald Graff wrote a book called “Beyond the Culture Wars.” He argued that American higher education could face the culture wars by teaching “the conflicts” (hotly debated issues) instead of trying to claim apolitical distance. Graff wanted to deal with the conflicting views students and professors across humanities disciplines hold by not ignoring the tensions over race, gender, multiculturalism, etc.

While this may not be a bad idea if you’re an English professor teaching Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” and Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” in a sophomore literature class, as of late, dwelling on the conflicts has been damaging America.

Talk Is Cheap

Americans are becoming increasingly polarized on social issues. Our divided allegiances even have a jingoism to them that often thwarts communication. That’s really the nature of identity and cultural politics. Sympathy aside, I don’t know anyone who thinks that in 2016, this or that group has come close to understanding the particular struggles of another.

That’s not, as some have suggested, because society is unwilling to talk about things like race in public or because people lack empathy. It’s just that talking about controversial issues and airing grievances, while sometimes informative and useful in the proper context, does very little to remedy social or economic reality, particularly in black communities. This is one point buried in the whole “Roots” dust-up, which I’m sure Snoop and his counterparts would agree with.

As Americans, how do we cope with the visceral conflicts that are ubiquitous across media? Some of us might switch off cable news and instead surrender an hour and a half to a screwball comedy that requires little to no emotional output. Or we might enjoy a superhero flick where some meta-human swoops in and vanquishes evil.

In other words, it’s logical to opt for a mental health break every now and then, to look for a more comforting reflection of humanity, even if it’s comic-book inspired, rather than watching real-life domestic terrorists harm innocent people. In a world where we’re saturated in conflict, many people besides Snoop are going to shun historical features in favor of lighter content in their media choices. This may provide temporary relief. But the only way to get out of the miasma of conflict is for this generation to find a way to bring opportunity back into the picture.

This a deceptively simple notion requires reframing our view of America. We have to acknowledge that, with all its challenges, America is still the land of opportunity. Conor Friedersdorf posted an email interview with a journalist named Martha Tesema. Friedersdorf pointed out that Martha was an unaffiliated supporter of Black Lives Matter. The purpose of the interview was to come to terms with why the two disagreed about the interruption tactics of the Black Lives Matter activists who interrupted a Bernie Sanders speech in Seattle in 2015. Friedersdorf’s point was that, in disrupting speeches, activists might be alienating someone whose views are sympathetic to their own.

Favoring the strategy, Tesema argued it “disrupted the status-quo and kick-started needed conversations that I was desperate to have with strangers, friends, and co-workers.” What was missing from the interview was any mention of opportunity-based solutions to the injustices Tesema wanted to rectify. Instead, she was content to see activists harp on “the conflicts.” Tesema wrongly assumes that awareness of a problem is the most important factor when it comes to solving that problem’s underlying issues. Another unfortunate miscalculation is that those outside her community (culturally and geographically) are somehow best positioned to address her concerns.

Shift the Focus to Opportunities

For any real change to happen, people have to access channels of opportunity. It does not follow that spontaneous protests will lead to anything more than dubious public policy reform. But education channels can start careers. Economic channels can reduce poverty. Neighborhood renewal channels can restore communities.

Look at it this way: Today, there’s less policing in cities like Baltimore and Chicago, but poverty persists. Mistrust of local politics and the criminal justice system has only deepened. I’m not suggesting political channels are impotent, but the energies of activists and any Americans who want to see substantive progress should be directed toward promoting individual opportunity, which is this nation’s greatest strength.

According to the Opportunity Index, which measures factors and trends that contribute to economic mobility, overall opportunity in America has increased every year since 2011. Some of the highest-paying sectors need workers. Things aren’t perfect, of course, but the search for cosmic justice is a fool’s errand. Opportunity is a much more reliable path beyond more division and disaffection.

Some of the positive responses to the reimagining of “Roots” suggest many are not shying away from one of the country’s oldest conflicts—the enslavement of African Americans. Some believe that the new miniseries, following the influential 1970s epic, will impart this generation with a sense of profound meaning about the nature of American identity. In a self-protective gesture, others refuse to see “Roots” as broadcasting the shame of black Americans.

Then there are those who believe history is important, period—be it slavery, the Holocaust, or the Trail of Tears. Whatever the historical event, it should be viewed and reflected upon as an intellectual exercise perhaps, but it’s a mistake to attach any sort of larger social purpose to “Roots” or any form of entertainment.

Only Opportunity Can Improve Lives

This doesn’t mean that the way people process movies and music doesn’t have real social consequences. When paired with insight, guidance, and the right questions, the effect of historical portraits can be remarkable. When constrained by conditions of poverty and mediocre education, the impact can be dire. To put it plainly, there’s no guarantee that watching “Roots” will empower the average black American with enough understanding of society—or race, for that matter—to significantly improve his or her life chances. Only opportunity can do that, which is why the main thing we should glean from the “Roots” debate is that this generation of millennials needs to get beyond the conflicts to more productive efforts.

After wading through this whole ordeal, I’m left with one question. Who are the “real niggas” to whom Snoop refers in his rant—those he asks to shun “Roots”? Does he mean socially conscious black people or people who embrace American meritocracy in general? I guess it doesn’t really matter, because “Roots” won’t do the work of seizing opportunity for this generation any more than it did for the previous ones.

Still, Snoop is right to call out to people who aren’t looking to “Roots” to tell them who they are. He is wrong, though, to presume the production will leave others dejected. Ultimately, this generation will need to harness a new set of assumptions about life and liberty. But first they’ll have to see conditions clearly enough to avoid being paralyzed by conflict and grievance.

Subjects like race will likely always be a mainstay of conflict in our public discourse. So the only way to route us into more meaningful dialogue, to circumvent the demagogues and others who are obsessed with this social construct, is to tie the rhetoric of race to the reality of opportunity.

I Don’t Hate Black Lives If I Don't Rush Judgment On Violence,"Temporarily suspending judgment on the recent police shootings of black men Philando Castile and Alton Sterling does not mean I don’t think black lives matter.

David Marcus wrote recently here at The Federalist that white people don’t really think black lives matter—at least, not as much as they should. The article is called “This Week, We Are All Black Lives Matter,” but he really means that only black people are Black Lives Matter (BLM). This is false and needlessly divisive.

Marcus sees the gunning down of black people by police as an epidemic white people acknowledge, but they’ve been so far unconvinced “there is a crisis going on.” He writes, “What the term [Black Lives Matter] really means is that black lives don’t matter. Not enough, anyway. This is an ugly concept for white Americans to accept. But it is a daily reality for America’s blacks.”

Marcus brushes off crime statistics baked into the arguments of BLM skeptics. These includee statistics such as: blacks are charged with the majority of robberies, murders, and assaults in the 75 largest counties, meaning cops may encounter a higher proportion of blacks than whites in potentially lethal situations. As a percentage of total homicides, 12 percent of white and Hispanic deaths are due to police, while only 4 percent of black homicides are due to police. Ignoring those who point things like this out, Marcus instead issues an indictment of white America: “As black Americans shout, yell, and cry that their lives matter, the eerie silence of white Americans carefully balancing causes and solutions whispers back, ‘No, they don’t.’”

It’s Simply Wise to Wait Until the Facts Are In

According to Marcus, white America has been silent, and “respectful silence” is apparently unacceptable, even as a hyperactive media spins out of control with toxic levels of conjecture and too few concrete facts. Many of us were silent for a time after Michael Brown was shot and killed, even as the pits of our stomach filled with horror reading the initial tweets covering the tragedy. We were ultimately glad we had restrained ourselves and did not let visceral rage crowd out any room to accept new information or lines of reasoning.

It was painful to see a mother lose her son, and to see young life cut down in violence. But what did we learn? We learned that “hands up, don’t shoot” was a lie. We learned Brown wasn’t shot in the back while running away. We learned that Officer Darren Wilson had good reason to fear for his life and was, according to a grand jury, justified in shooting Brown.

The videos of Sterling and Castile’s recent deaths are jarring and horrifying, but even cameras don’t tell the whole story. Consider this video, for instance, documenting a traffic stop from the moment the officers approach the vehicle to the final violent conclusion. It took three body camera angles watched multiple times and played in slow motion for me to even glimpse the driver’s gun, and even then I was shocked. Who would have thought this seemingly calm individual who obeyed every order from the officer would turn violent?

Facts Steer Us Towards Addressing the Real Problems

Empathy for the suffering is critical, and feelings matter. Humans are meant to relate to one another emotionally, and to deny the fear, heartache, and horror many black people are experiencing based on these events is wrong. To deny cops’s fears they may be gunned down for their profession or viciously smeared for a lethal confrontation between races is wrong also. Feelings matter, but so do facts. Always.

Without facts, we cannot move toward real solutions. Without facts, we let our passions launch us ever deeper into our own personal realities, into deep, narrow pockets of spite, prejudice, and ignorance from which we cannot view any inconvenient truths, nor even the different experienced realities of others. Having isolated ourselves into our respective “sides,” we cease to empathize, listen, and cooperate toward common goals.

Facts alone cannot change the course of events. Marcus is right that passion is a critical component for any social reform. But facts, valid information, are the basis for meaningful dialogue that leads to effective and positive change. Without them, partisanship and prejudice spin us further into chaos.

Some of us are waiting for more information, and for any initial misinformation to dissipate. Hopefully we are not waiting for the “right” information—that is, information that fits conveniently into our worldview, at which point we launch into our pre-meditated opinions. But we are not in error to wait for the fog to clear before launching into a full-throated argument for this side or that. While many white Americans may be reticent to opine on very recent police shootings, or may not be as “angry and animated” as Marcus would want, our silence by no means indicates a complacency that rises to the level of “black lives don’t matter.”

Police Brutality Is Not the Black Community’s Only Problem

In fact, many whites have been begging America to address the disproportionately high number of black-on-black homicides, gang violence, high school dropout rates, levels of poverty, and family breakdown for a long time. Black lives do matter, independent of the color of uniform or skin of the people who end them. Rebecca Cusey’s recent article discussing her experience living in a majority-black neighborhood casts a bright light on the tragedies afflicting the black community, tragedies we absolutely must be concerned about.

Maybe BLM is right to assert police brutality doesn’t rank high enough on our list of priorities for aiding the black community, but the point is that our care for black lives expands beyond BLM’s narrow scope to cover these other struggles, many of which contribute to the black community’s high homicide rate.

May God rightly judge us for any complacency in unjustified violent deaths, but surely we should not be judged by others for temporarily reserving our judgement on new, highly controversial incidents, either.

Black Lives Matter Doesn’t Believe Its Own Slogan,"Like so many, I’ve watched with a heavy heart the malicious violence that is sprouting like poison ivy across the country, germinated by liberal applications of incendiary rhetoric and misplaced indulgence. In the city in which I was raised, Baton Rouge, three police officers were assassinated and three officers were hospitalized with gunshot wounds. One of the dead, a black officer with 10 years on the force, had recently posted on Facebook about the angst and mounting pressure he felt from the very community he ultimately gave his life defending. Does his black life matter? Where are the protestors on his behalf?

Yet the list of horribles continues. On the same day officers were killed in Baton Rouge, officers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were dispatched on a domestic disturbance call where a 20 year-old with two felonies on his record opened fire on the police car, wounding an officer inside the vehicle. Eight officers have been killed nationwide in 11 days. Here in Memphis a week ago, protestors took to the streets with their signs and chants and didn’t stop until they had shut down Interstate 40 in downtown Memphis.

For more than five hours, truckers, travelers, parents, and children sat, helplessly stranded on the I-40 bridge over the Mississippi River. (And you think the kiddos can be a challenge when the car is moving!) In one case, paramedics struggled to extract a sick child from the stranded traffic and transport the child to the hospital. How many others who needed medical attention remained stranded is unknown to us and to the resolutely impervious crowd that held commuters hostage.

Naturally, I was interested to see what my colleagues at The Federalist would have to say about events, and went right away to David Marcus’ very moving essay, “This Week We Are All Black Lives Matter.” While the overall appeal to greater understanding and empathy was laudable, somewhere along the way David was carried aloft on the headwind of his good intentions, and deposited somewhere between sentimentality and mawkishness.

The Disproportionality Runs the Other Way

Highlighting the fatal confrontations of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile with the authorities, David writes, “Every white American paying attention already knew that police kill black men at alarming rates.” That’s a pretty sweeping statement on behalf of a lot of people David has never met, and it needs some further scrutiny.

In 2015, according to information collected by the Washington Post, 26 percent of the people killed by police officers were black. Now, if that is alarming, what then are we to make of the fact that a full 50 percent of people who died at the hands of police officers were white? Should the fact that whites were killed by the police at nearly double the rate of blacks take us from alarm to outright panic? Should we shout that white lives matter and wreak havoc, or should we take a deep breath and dig a little deeper into the facts?

Heather Mac Donald, author of “The War On Cops,” has done a stunning and thorough amount of research which has yielded, among other things, the fact that blacks make up just 15 percent of the population in the nation’s 75 largest counties (2009), yet comprise 45 percent of all assault defendants, 62 percent of all robbery defendants, and 57 percent of all murder defendants. In New York City alone, where blacks comprise 23 percent of the population, they account for 75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime.

The wonder therefore, isn’t that a group so highly represented in violent crime comprises 26 percent of deaths that occur in altercations with authority, but rather that the rate isn’t higher still. Whites, who account for 33 percent of New York City’s population, commit less than 2 percent of all shootings, 4 percent of robberies and 5 percent of all violent crime while having the highest fatality rate in confrontations with police. Happily, they haven’t resorted to blocking interstate highways and targeting the police and show no interest in doing so.

It’s Not Necessarily Racism to Pursue Black Suspects

“As black Americans shout, yell, and cry that their lives matter, the eerie silence of white Americans carefully balancing causes and solutions whispers back, ‘No, they don’t,’” David Marcus writes. To divide a group of people by race and assume that they think monolithically is not only erroneous on its face, it’s the sort of presumptuous tribal division we usually associate with the hard left. To further presume to reach into the minds of these people en masse and hear them whisper that black lives don’t matter is insulting.

“The hand that holds the gun is the only system,” David continues. “In those long, deadly moments choices are made, threats assessed, and actions taken. We must never accept the color of a person’s skin influencing the police officer facing these situations.” Well, given the facts presented above, which I assume he must have been unaware of, the burden of proving that skin color is influencing the police falls to David. But he will need to come to terms with the following as well, which Mac Donald presented recently at Hillsdale College:

These disparities mean that every time the police in New York are called out on a gun run — meaning that someone has just been shot — they are being summoned to minority neighborhoods looking for minority suspects. Officers hope against hope that they will receive descriptions of white shooting suspects, but it almost never happens. This incidence of crime means that innocent black men have a much higher chance of being stopped by the police because they match the description of the suspect [emphasis mine]. This is not something the police choose. It is a reality forced on them by the facts of crime.

Add to this the fact that the number of cops who’ve been killed in shootings has more than doubled in only the first three months of 2016, and the fact that a police officer’s chances of being killed by a black person is 18.5 times higher than the odds an unarmed black will be killed by a police officer, and the risks associated with an officer responding to violent crimes in the places where they usually occur come into sharper focus. To lump these and other relevant factors under the blunt title of someone’s skin color “influencing the police officer” betrays a rather incurious simplicity regarding a complex topic.

A protestor who admitted he was taunting Dallas police later told how some officers rushed him and pushed him away from the gunfire when the shooting started. He told of seeing one of those officers fall to the ground, shot while saving the protestor’s life. Decisions that save lives, like those that take them, are not made in “long, deadly moments,” as David dramatically contends, but rather in the heat of the moment and in a fraction of a second.

Police Aren’t the Major Problem for Black People

To the extent that the deaths of blacks has become an issue of race, it has been made so by race hustlers from Barack Obama on down to the usual suspects who rather conveniently fail to address the fact that blacks nationwide commit homicide at eight times the combined rate of whites and Hispanics, and that black males aged 14-17 commit homicide at ten times the combined rate of white and Hispanic male teens.

The question then becomes: Black lives matter to whom, exactly? Because the numbers show it isn’t police officers who are hunting down innocent African Americans. Rather, the awful fact is that the last face a black homicide victim is likely to see is the black face of his killer. Closing the nation’s highways, looting business in the black community, and disrupting the lives of law-abiding citizens will not change that reality even a little bit.

When Memphis’ interim police director met with Black Lives Matter protestors on the I-40 bridge Sunday evening, they all agreed to a cease-fire in the city’s ongoing homicides, which have reached more than 120 people in 2016. No more killings, they said, for the next 30 days. Less than 24 hours later, predictably, another homicide took place.

So we are entitled to ask: Do black lives matter to the thugs who prey on the innocent in their community, who steal from them and assault them? Do black lives matter to a culture that demeans and dehumanizes women in its music and its actions? Exactly how precious are black lives in Memphis, where I live, where young black males regularly swerve on their motorcycles and in their cars across busy interstate highways at speeds in excess of 100 mph, wantonly endangering and sometimes taking the lives of motorists of all races?

Stop Blaming Poverty

In his 1984 book, “Civil Rights, Rhetoric or Reality?” Dr. Thomas Sowell, himself a product of Harlem, wrote:

Few people today are aware that the ghettos in many cities were far safer places two generations ago than they are today. Incredulity often greets stories by older blacks as to their habit of sleeping out on fire escapes or on rooftops or in public parks on hot summer nights. …In the 1930s whites went regularly to Harlem at night, stayed until the wee hours of the morning, and then stood on the streets to hail cabs to take them home. Today, not only would very few whites dare to do this, very few cabs would dare to be cruising ghetto streets in the wee hours of the morning.

So what happened? Dr. Sowell continued:

…If crime is a product of poverty and discrimination as they say endlessly, why was there so much less of it when poverty and discrimination were much worse than today? If massive programs are the only hope to reduce violence in the ghetto, why was there so much less violence long before anyone ever thought of these programs? Perhaps more to the point, have the philosophies and policies so much supported by black leaders contributed to the decline of the community and personal standards, and in family responsibility, so painfully visible today? For many, it may be easier to ignore past achievements than to face their implications for current issues.

Hillary Clinton says she wants to have a conversation about race. Fine. Let’s start with Sowell’s observations and explore whether such programs as Mrs. Clinton and President Obama have long advanced have helped or hurt the black community. Let’s explore whether a system that has encouraged generational dependence on government have yielded the results that were promised when its central programs were enacted more than 50 years ago.

By all means, let’s explore the liberal commitment to the lives of black children, for whom the most dangerous place in the world is in their mother’s womb. As Alveda King, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s niece, noted in 2014:

Right now in America almost half of our babies are being killed in the womb, and in certain parts of America more of our babies are being aborted than being born. While we were marching in the sixties, a place was being prepared for us at Planned Parenthood. We were trying to get off the back of the bus, and they were going to have a space for us in the front of the abortion mill.

Where are the protestors lamenting the hundreds of thousands of black lives claimed by the abortionist each year? Where are those who would confront Mrs. Clinton about her admiration for eugenicist Margaret Sanger, who referred to blacks as “human weeds?”

Yes, there is much to talk about, but we do not advance the conversation by ceding ground to the progressive mythology of racist cops or the progressive habit of dividing people by race for the purposes of assigning collective guilt or deification. Rebuking an entire race for imputed racism is a horribly misguided and repugnant exercise, whether it comes from the Left or the well-intentioned among us.

We are Americans, and we are individuals first and foremost, and we do not advance our country, our communities, or our neighborhoods by suspending the standards of civil society and civilized conduct, or by excusing lawlessness and anarchy—period.

Black Lives Matter Leader: ‘Defund Police’,"A year ago, two police officers in New York were executed while they sat in their patrol car. A week ago, five cops were killed in Dallas. Now three more officers have been murdered in Baton Rouge by a man inspired to kill because he believed the news about police unfairly targeting black men.

If you are to believe to President Obama, who issued a statement right after the shooting, these events should not be linked to anyone or any movement: “These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no one. They right no wrongs. They advance no causes.”

One needs wonder if President Obama’s eagerness to explicitly reject the connection between any movement (including Black Lives Matter) and the string of murdered police officers is a result of the sort of criticism recently lodged against him by writers like Myron Magnet at City Journal. Magnet, a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, recently penned an opinion piece entitled “America’s Worst President? I nominate Obama, the Anti-Lincoln.”

Magnet’s main point is that Obama has stoked the flames of resentment against police officers throughout his presidency by repeatedly—either explicitly or implicitly—suggesting white police officers’ shootings of non-white people are acts of racism. Meanwhile, Obama largely ignored the scourge of black-on-black crime, delivering only a single speech on the topic.

What’s Wrong With Leaving Police High and Dry

Maybe Obama should have listened to his former chief of staff turned Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel, who late last year blamed the uptick in violent crime in Chicago on police officers “going fetal” and second-guessing their actions because of the national scrutiny on the way they do their job.

Ironically, it appears Obama’s silence on black-on-black crime coupled with intense scrutiny on police officers—either using the bully pulpit of his office or using the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division—has made our country decidedly less safe for the very people of color he professes to want to help. Like so many campaigns of the progressive left (such as welfare, overtime mandates, and minimum wage increases) the Black Lives Matter movement makes life worse for the people it is designed to benefit.

Still, despite the empirical evidence that BLM is adversely affecting the very communities it is designed to help, many people still think there is merit to the protest movement. After all, there are pretty obvious cases of overzealous white police officers shooting and killing black people in an unjustified manner. In some of these cases, it also appears there is racism involved. Shouldn’t there be a protest movement for these cases? Take the case of the white police officer in South Carolina who was filmed shooting a black suspect in the back as he fled.

As the son of a retired police officer who was shot in the line of duty—while trying to apprehend a suspect who had already killed another police officer—let me be the first to say I agree with those who think civic engagement in communities should hold police officers accountable for their work. We should do this in the same way we might hold any of our public officials accountable for what they do for us.

Defunding a Crucial Part of Government Isn’t Accountability

This, though, brings us to the crux of why BLM is rotten at its core: It is not like any other movement to keep our public servants accountable. The goal of the BLM movement is to systematically undermine our nation’s law enforcement officers and make their job both less safe and less effective. Just listen to a recent interview of three founders of the movement on NPR.

In typical NPR fashion, Ari Shapiro fawns over the BLM founders, asking them, “Given all of the momentum that your movement has right now, given all the attention being paid to Black Lives Matter, on this the third anniversary, what is one tangible thing that you would like to see this inertia lead to?”

The immediate answer from BLM founder Patrisse Cullors: “Defunding police departments.” How can BLM say the movement is pro-police if its stated goal is to eliminate the very funding that makes it possible for police to safely fight crime in our streets?

It is a common refrain of the Left that government programs are ineffective because stingy fiscal conservatives don’t put enough resources into them: just ask any Democrat why education, social service programs, and government health care don’t achieve the promised results. The answer is always that we just haven’t funded them adequately. Why should police departments be any different?

After the sort of police shooting we just witnessed in Baton Rouge, activists will no doubt flood social media and cable news with a defense of BLM like the one recently made by “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah: “If you’re pro-Black Lives Matter, you’re assumed to be anti-police,” he says in the sort of haughty didactic tone that has made “The Daily Show” so popular amongst leftists. “And if you’re pro-police, then you surely hate black people. It seems that it’s either pro-cop and anti-black or pro-black and anti-cop, when in reality you can be pro-cop and pro-black.”

No, Mr. Noah, you can’t be both pro-cop and pro-black if you’re part of the BLM movement. BLM is explicitly anti-cop and, if you think anything else, you’re just not listening to them.

5 Things President Obama Needs To Say About Black Crime,"President Obama held a nationally televised town hall last week to address heightened tensions and divisions in our society due to recent shootings of black criminals by police, and the recent shootings of police officers in Dallas. Just days after the event, three police officers in Baton Rouge were assassinated, further highlighting the high stakes for how the president handles this issue.

I was invited to attend last week’s town hall and ask the president a question, but ultimately could not make it. But I did watch it at home, and would like to highlight some key points President Obama did not to make, which could have begun the process of healing and reconciliation.

Indeed, Sunday’s execution of three police officers in Baton Rouge shows what can happen when the president creates an atmosphere of racial victimization and blames police. So it is critical that Obama develops a new message that takes us in the right direction before things get worse and there’s another incident.

With that in mind, here are the statements President Obama should have included in his remarks last week.

1. ‘We Must, Must, Must Reduce the Black Crime Rate’

The black crime rate is significantly higher than that of other races. Yes, some would claim this is due to institutionalized racism or a lack of job opportunities. However, black crime was much lower in past eras when discrimination against black people was much higher, and the economic position of black people was much worse, than today. So that can be no excuse.

President Obama should have talked about how the overall crime rate for black people is three times higher than the national average. He should have noted how blacks commit homicide at a rate eight times higher than whites do, according to Department of Justice data. Even though blacks and Hispanics combined make up only 30 percent of the population, they make up more than 80 percent of all gang members in the United States. He should also have talked how even though black folks are only 13 percent of the population, we commit about 62 percent of all robberies and 56 percent of all carjackings. Obama should have then asked: “Is this really what Dr. King died for?”

2. ‘We Must Put the Black Family Back Together’

Even though the studies clearly show that children born into single-parent homes have worse outcomes in nearly every area, sadly, today about 72 percent of black kids are born to unwed mothers. This has created a whole new generation of troubled young men who have an increased likelihood of entering a life of crime and getting themselves into altercations with the police that create these divisive incidents we see on the news.

So putting the family back together so black children are born into stable, two-parent homes will go a long way to fixing many of the problems black people face today, including problems with the police. President Obama should have forcefully illuminated the broken state of black families, then outlined his ideas to put it back together. There are many ways to approach this, but one good place to start is to scale back well-intentioned but ineffective entitlement programs that encourage and enable single-motherhood, many of which the president himself unfortunately supports.

If he couldn’t have stomached this tough but true response, Obama could have at least given the example of how he leads his own family, which is indeed a stable two-parent black family.

3. ‘We Must Fix the Brokenness in Black Culture’

Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Data shows that the popularity of black kids decreases as their GPA increases, a trend not seen for white public school children. This means black kids pay a high social price for pursuing academic excellence. Research from psychologist Angela Neal-Barnett shows that things like taking an Advanced Placement class, taking an honors class, or—gasp—speaking standard English were behaviors many black students saw as “acting white” and thus carried a social cost.

Researchers are still working out the reasons for this unfortunate phenomenon, but I suspect it exists simply because many young black people are rarely challenged by teachers, parents, communities, and the media. That’s because: 1) It’s much easier to just blame racism, and 2) Challenging black veneration of underachievement might be seen as racist.

However, President Obama should have avoided the easy, cowardly approach of blaming racism and instead forcefully illustrated the problem, proclaiming that achieving excellence does not have a race attached to it, and we will have zero tolerance for blacks who ridicule other black folks for pursuing distinction.

There is also a destructive thug culture among some strains of the black community. Black journalist Cynthia Tucker Haynes beautifully states: “Somewhere along the way, a cadre of young black men and women began glorifying violence, misogyny and thuggery, accepting incarceration as inevitable, resigning themselves to lives on the margins of mainstream society. They created a thug culture that has been commodified — celebrated in music and movies, sold to poor adolescents in wretched neighborhoods as well as affluent teenagers in upscale communities.”

What more can be said? President Obama should have uttered these powerful words last night, then ended them with, “Therefore, we must demolish this thug culture that is destroying young black Americans. We will treat it the same as terrorism: pursue it, confront it, and destroy it.” That’s right, I just compared thug culture to terrorism. September 11, 2011 killed about 3,000 Americans, yet about 5,500 black men kill other black men annually. That’s almost two black 9/11s per year! So where’s the War Against Thugs™?

4. ‘The Police Are Not the Main Problem’

Over the past 35 years, a mind-bending 323,820 black people have been killed by other black people in America, far exceeding the number of police officers killed during that same timeframe. The data showsabout 71 blacks are killed by other blacks for every one black person killed by a white police officer. It is clear then, the real problem is black people killing each other.

Yes, cases of police misconduct should be confronted and handled promptly when they occur. Absolutely. But black deaths due to the police account for less than 2 percent of all black murders, so attacking the police must never be the main issue. President Obama should thus have stated forcefully, “Let us stop blaming the police, for they are not the ones killing black folks. Sadly, it is black folks who are killing each other. Therefore, we must solve the national problem of black murder.”

5. ‘Blaming Police Gets More Police Killed’

Rhetoric that frames police for the deep, systematic problems in the black community puts police lives in danger by riling up hatred and resentment towards them, and encourages the kind of cop killers we’ve seen in Dallas and Baton Rouge. This kind of rhetoric can’t be tolerated.

First, it’s not true. The police are the first line of defense in protecting black Americans from black criminals, who overwhelmingly target black victims. Second, it takes focus away from the real issues at the source of the problem: broken families, thug culture, entitlement programs that disincentivize family formation, and a culture of low achievement.

President Obama should have thus forcefully declared “We will never allow police lives to be put in jeopardy by dangerous rhetoric that blames them for brokenness in minority communities, a brokenness they did not cause and cannot fix.”

Thankfully for the president, I do not charge for this free post-mortem analysis. But for further consultations, we’ll have to talk.

Sheriff Clarke Is Right: There’s A War On Cops,"Nearly eight years after the historic election of Barack Obama as America’s first black president, we can see the disappointing result: a small-scale race war in America’s cities. That it’s a war was heralded by Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who denounced the recent attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge as “anarchy” in his speech at the Republican convention.

In an op-ed in The Hill, he went further, describing the attacks as “guerrilla urban warfare against the police.”

These attacks may not yet amount to a war—it’s only two shooters—but it is forming an ominous pattern, a series of spontaneous one-man insurgencies. It is no coincidence that both killers had military training and served during the War on Terror; they’re taking their cue from the enemy they were sent to fight.

Obviously, these were disturbed young men, and we will find many reasons why they went wrong. But they were both given a direction and justification by black nationalism and particularly by the idea, which has come to be accepted as an unquestioned truth by many, that racist police forces are out of control and randomly murdering young black men in large numbers. This is the narrative that fuels the Black Lives Matter protests, and it gave the Dallas and Baton Rouge shooters the sense that they were simply fighting back against a war on young black men.

It will be no surprise to you, I hope, that this narrative is completely wrong. Actual numbers about police shootings show nothing of the sort.

Numbers Tell the True Story

A while back, some of my friends coined what we call the Doctrine of Numerical Superiority—the idea that numbers and measurements always take precedence over narrative and story-telling. They’re all scientists and engineers, and this is their way of trying to push back on behalf of their method of thinking against the sloppy methods of narrative-driven journalism.

One of those friends, Jack Wakeland, helped me put together some of the numbers about mass shootings, and those numbers produce a very different story than the one we’ve been given. Jack runs down a few of the figures.

“While gunshot homicides are not incredibly rare events—there are about 13,000 a year—wrongful shooting deaths by police are rare.

“The US did not keep good statistics on police shootings until last year, probably because the police who keep most of the statistics really didn’t want to. In 2015, the number of fatal police shootings came to 986.

“Approximately 30% of people fatally shot by police are black and about 50% are non-Hispanic whites. To say that 40 to 50% of all violent crime is committed by blacks (even though they make up only 12% of the male population) puts these numbers into perspective.”

In other words, the number of black men killed by police is more or less in line with the percentage of violent criminals who are black. Other studies back this up.

“It is only through detailed statistical analyses of police use of force reports that one can actually find if there are racial disparities. In one such analysis no racial bias against black suspects was found in the use of deadly force. A small bias against black suspects was found in the frequency with which non-lethal force was used; but this was balanced by an equally small and opposite bias found in favor of black suspects in the use of deadly force.

“How many of these police shootings are bad? How many are tragic accidents? How many are acts of reckless negligence? How many are straight-up murder? There is no number on that. And with the universal history of men-at-arms sticking up for each other and covering for each other (in all nations and all cultures), it is impossible to be certain of the truth.

“All those truths about the ‘blue wall of silence’ being said, one has to think that the number of mistaken or criminal homicides committed by the police must be 10% or less of the total number shot dead. That comes to less than 90 a year.”

There Is No Wave of Police Shootings

Actually, an earlier Washington Post analysis concluded that “the kind of incidents that have ignited protests in many U.S. communities—most often, white police officers killing unarmed black men—represent less than 4 percent of fatal police shootings,” which would put the number closer to 40. And we know from the high-profile cases that have been thoroughly examined in the press—cases like Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri—that as the real facts come to light, they often either support the conclusion that the shooting was justified or create enough legitimate uncertainty to make prosecuting the officer impossible.

As I have pointed out before, any encounter between police and citizens is potentially dangerous. There is plenty of scope for misunderstandings, accidents, poor training, poor judgment (on both sides), and just plain bad luck to result in a police officer shooting a citizen to death over a misdemeanor offense like a traffic stop or selling loose cigarettes. There’s even more scope for shootings in which the facts are so murky and confused that it is hard to tell a justified shooting from an unjustified one.

So it’s actually remarkable that it doesn’t happen more often.

‘In a nation of 320 million people, these events are less common than being killed by a tornado.’

But even if the number of illegitimate shootings is fewer than 90 per year, Jack points out, “as criminal and law-enforcement activity peaks in the summer months, they can occur several times in one week.” Two weeks before Philando Castile, for example, there was a similar case in Fresno involving a young white man. Yet, as Jack points out, “In a nation of 320 million people, these events are less common than being killed by a tornado.”

“In an innumerate nation, tens of millions of people are being led to believe that wrongful police killings are common and that they’re oppressing an entire race of men. They’re teasing this very big conclusion about disparate racial impacts from two or three cases out of an unidentified (and virtually unidentifiable) set of less than 90 cases of wrongful killing per year. To say such a conclusion is statistically and logically invalid does not capture its absurdity.”

That leads us to Sheriff Clarke’s other big claim, that the narrative of a police war on young black men is being pushed by “the false tales of the revolutionary Marxist forces, who most recently have rebranded themselves from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter.” In effect, he is accusing them of acting as a political front for the shooters, providing them their narrative and their sense of serving a cause; Sinn Fein to the shooters’ IRA.

It is going too far to describe all BLM supporters as “revolutionary Marxists,” but the wider pattern fits. Charges of racism and especially of systematic racist murders by the police have long been a staple of the far left, no matter what the statistics, because they serve a purpose. The far left has never been interested in racism per se. They have been interested in using accusations of racism to undermine the moral legitimacy of America’s social, political, and economic system. If the system is fundamentally racist and corrupt, then it all needs to be torn down, justifying “fundamental change” along the lines the left proposes.

Obama, The Divider

That brings us to President Obama’s role, which Clarke also briefly alludes to.

It has become a bit of a cliché to complain that Obama promised us racial healing but delivered the opposite, to which he will reply that promises of magical transformation to a new age of racial harmony were always unrealistic. You don’t say. But that misses the real issue. People didn’t expect racial politics would magically improve. They expected racial politics to improve because Obama would do something concrete and significant to help them improve. They probably expected that, as the first black president, he would have the standing and moral legitimacy to speak to both sides, to recognize legitimate grievances while tamping down the flames of conflict.

We hoped Obama could articulate the humiliation of those who feel they are being unfairly targeted by police, but place those fears within a rational perspective.

They were expecting him to follow the example set by George Washington in putting down the Whiskey Rebellion. Insurgencies and guerrilla warfare against the federal government are not exactly new. In 1794, President Washington led 13,000 militia troops to put down a violent protest against a tax on whiskey, which was an important source of income for Western settlers in the Appalachians. He did so on the grounds that, while the grievance was legitimate, “if the laws are to be so trampled upon with impunity, and a minority…is to dictate to the majority, there is an end put at one stroke to republican government…, for some other man or society may dislike another law and oppose it with equal propriety until all laws are prostrate, and everyone will carve for himself.”

But the reason Washington could put down this insurrection so easily is because he had the moral authority to do so. As a man who had staked everything on the American Revolution, who had voluntarily relinquished power several times before, he had a reputation for unwavering dedication to the cause of liberty. He had a unique moral authority to speak to the rebels and to their supporters, and to demand that they disperse.

We might have hoped that President Obama would exercise some small echo of this authority when dealing with America’s racial tensions. We hoped he could articulate the humiliation of those who feel they are being unfairly targeted by police, but place those fears within a rational perspective, defend the role of the police in maintaining the rule of law, and tell the Black Lives Matter agitators to stand down.

But I never had such expectations, because I knew how deeply wedded he is to the far left narrative and its need to delegitimize American institutions so that politicians like him can “fundamentally transform” them. That’s why, eight years later, Sheriff Clarke and other leaders of law enforcement find themselves forced onto a war footing, an understandable siege mentality that will probably only make things worse.

That’s what happens when we don’t have leaders who are able to put facts above narrative and the good of the country above their predetermined political agenda.

5 Reasons Donald Trump Should Focus On The White Vote,"Prepare to be mindblown. A black dude is going to tell you why the GOP’s winning strategy is to focus like a laser on the white vote.

One key result of the increased polarization happening in America under President Obama is that Republicans have a chance to decisively capture the white vote in a historic fashion. In fact, the key to a Trump victory will be the white vote, not the Hispanic vote, the black vote, or any other vote.

Why? For one, the Democratic Party has already lost the white vote, and lost it big. Mitt Romney won the demographic by a whopping 59-39 landslide margin in 2012. Trump is leading it by similar margins. This is because the Democratic Party has decided that, due to the rising Hispanic and immigrant population—who vote about 80 percent Democratic—they no longer need the white vote to win, but rather can rely on favorable changing demographics to deliver elections.

This means Democrats are leaving white voters the wayside the same way they have ignored blacks for decades. The difference is that whites take notice and vote Republican in response. Black folks just keep voting Democratic.

Yet despite increasing white support for Republicans, Romney ultimately lost the 2012 race because minorities tend to vote Democratic as a bloc, and the white voter turnout he generated was not enough to overcome the minority vote that overwhelmingly and predictably came out against him.

So, to avoid a repeat of 2012, how much would Trump need in order to win? In short, Trump needs about 62 percent of the white vote to win the popular vote (in comparison to Romney’s 59 percent). More importantly, he would need to do between three and six points better on average than Romney did among white voters in the swing states, in order to win those states and thus win the election. That’s a tall order. But I argue it’s possible for several reasons.

1. People Are Excited to Vote for Donald Trump

Trump is a momentum generator. He far surpasses the excitement level of Romney in 2012. Indeed, voter turnout in the 2016 Virginia GOP primary broke 2012 turnout by more than a whopping 700,000 votes, and smashed the previous record set in the year 2000 by 50 percent. Trump shattered Romney’s 2012 numbers by similar margins in Ohio, and by large margins in other states.

In fact, Trump received more primary votes than any GOP candidate ever in history, despite being in a crowded field of 17 candidates, the largest pool ever. All this even though he spent very little on advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, or staffing. He’s also beating Romney among evangelicals. Much of this increased support has been among white blue-collar voters, who vote overwhelmingly Republican.

Granted, with few precedents to go on, the number crunchers are not totally sure of the link between primary turnouts and general election turnout. However, given that this election has thus far wildly defied the predictions of all the pundits, if there’s any link between primary momentum and general election momentum I expect at least some to transfer into the general election and help Trump get much better numbers with white voters than Romney did in 2012.

2. Everybody Hates Hillary

Although Trump has much more momentum and excitement than Romney did in 2012, Hillary has much less momentum and excitement than Obama did in 2008 or 2012. Indeed, if primary voter turnout has even a light correlation to general election turnout in this unprecedented crazy cycle, things don’t bode well for the Clinton camp: only 27.4 million people cast Democratic primary ballots in 2016, far fewer than the 35 million cast in 2008, the last competitive Democratic primary. That’s despite the presence of popular outsider Bernie Sanders this year.

Further, Hillary Clinton has historically low favorability ratings, and sits 10 to 15 points lower in favorability than Obama did at this time four years ago. Let’s also not forget Mrs. Clinton almost got indicted. That certainly won’t help her image with the white swing voters undecided between staying home or going out to vote for Hillary. Although they may like her better than Trump, many are not ready to cast their ballot for someone they don’t trust.

Minorities, unlike white swing voters, tend to stick with the Democratic candidate regardless of policy positions or personal character. Thus, the deciding factor with Hillary will be white voters. Given her low favorability, low momentum, and character damaged by an FBI investigation, she is almost certainly in worse shape with that group than Obama was in either election. This bodes well for the Republican challenger’s chances with white voters.

3. Latinos Aren’t Dropping Trump

Despite popular prognostications, Trump’s allegedly anti-Mexican comments have not caused a decrease in support among the Latino vote. Indeed, data shows the Latino vote is about the same percentage Republican as it has been in the previous two cycles. While Trump’s strong support for the police, his willingness to talk frankly about the problem of black crime, and his rejection of political correctness may cause some loss of support among black voters—many of whom see the police as an adversary and see talk about black crime as racist—it may cause an even larger bump in support among white voters. They are more likely to believe he is simply speaking honestly about the issues, no matter how uncomfortable it may make some feel.

Thus, some loss of the black vote may be a smart price to pay for an even bigger increase in the white vote—a vote that is actually persuadable. (First rule of elections: only target persuadable voters!)

4. President Obama’s Tarnished Legacy

The president’s positions on Black Lives Matter, recent police incidents, increasingly common charge that whites are guilty of white privilege, and his support for unprecedented levels of immigration eroding the white population have left many white Americans feeling attacked and marginalized to a much greater degree than in 2012.

This may energize many white Americans to make a change in direction from where another four to eight years of similar leadership philosophy under Hillary is likely to take us.

Paired with this is Trump’s powerful stance against political correctness, which brands a person as racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, or Islamophobic for the slightest difference of views. Trump’s anti-PC stance will especially resonate with white voters, who are almost always the target of these labels. Additionally, besides possibly Sanders, Trump is the only candidate to forcefully defend blue-collar workers, many of whom are white, and who make up a large portion of Trump’s voting bloc.

5. White People Are More Persuadable

So all the ingredients are in place for historically high white turnout. Yet some might object. After all, what is to be made of the 2012 Republican autopsy, which declared the solution to the GOP’s problems was to go all-out for the minority vote?

Although well-intentioned, this strategy may amount to wishful thinking. It’s much more efficient to aggressively increase the turnout of white demographics that vote Republican, then to reach white independent and swing voters who actually vote based on the issues, values, and quality of candidates, than it is to reach black and other minority voters. The latter tend to vote for Democrats based on ethnic identity in such a firmly consistent manner so as to be virtually unpersuadable.

In fact, even though 30 percent of black Americans self-identify as conservative, mostly based on social issues, they still won’t vote GOP. For Pete’s sake, even Ben Carson never got more than a small share of the black vote, and he practically walks on water. The same is true for the outstanding Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the black GOP lawmaker who lost 88 percent of the black vote in his election to the Senate.

The effort required to achieve even small gains in GOP support among minority groups may be far greater than the benefits, given the stubbornness of the voting blocs and their small share of the population relative to the 70 percent of the electorate that is white.

Further, and more critically, to follow the GOP autopsy’s advice and attempt to reach minority voters, Trump would have to give up many of his core beliefs that made him popular in the first place. This would include: embracing amnesty and open borders (to target the Latino vote), which harms the poorest Americans by flooding the labor pool at the low end of the market, among many other negative effects; embracing racial victimization politics, which defends criminals while blaming the police for black crime (this is like blaming your doctor for being obese!); and embracing political correctness, which dictates that emotions are more important than telling the hard truth that moves us forward.

So the question becomes: should Trump give up his unique, appealing message for the sake of attracting the small share of minorities that is unlikely to cross over anyway? I say no. Rather, staying on-message with laser focus while getting white voter turnout up to record levels is the key to Trump’s victory.

Black Lives Matter Doesn’t Know What It Wants,"Although the Black Lives Matter movement seems to have a formal cause, it struggles to settle on any specific tasks, steps, or legislation beyond catalyzing rage and indignation. The platform is practically immortal. There can never be a time when their mission will be accomplished, the standard can be rested, or wounds healed.

Black lives matter. Of course the vast majority of us believe and defend this proposition. Most of us also believe racism is still present around us. Almost no one believes violence against innocent police officers is acceptable. But I still have significant reservations about supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Here’s why.

The movement suffers from indirection. At blacklivesmatter.com, they explain, “Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. It is an affirmation of Black folks’ contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.”

The statement is at once bold and nebulous. It both affirms black issues and culture and establishes a broad platform for anti-racism. Although not stated, the ostensible goal of Black Lives Matter is to decrease police violence against blacks and, by extension, everyone. The loss of any life is tragic; the disproportionate loss of black lives at the hands of police is egregious. The shameful history of race relations in the United States makes this disproportionality even more painful and poignant.

Our (and BLM’s) yearning for equity and justice—if not in general, at least from the institutions and individuals sworn to protect us and uphold the peace—is intuitive. Unfortunately, it is also simplistic. It is a fact that black people are disproportionately targeted and aggressed by the police. But it is also a fact that black people disproportionately live in low-income communities that have a disproportionate level of crime.

Statistics like “25% of the people killed by the police so far this year were Black, even though they only represent 13% of the population” imply a misleading generality: They seem to suggest that in any interaction with police anywhere, black people are more likely to experience violence. Although this may actually be the case, the causal story is probably much more complex. I do not mean to excuse unjustified police violence, but if we really want to reduce deaths by police, we should pay attention to the underlying dynamics that produce those deaths. “Racism” is too easily misunderstood and too nebulous a dynamic to productively oppose and address.

Don’t Just Blame Police; Blame Everyone

I have no doubt that many cops witness gun violence frequently. The vast majority of that violence takes place in poor, minority neighborhoods. Still, I have no problem criticizing police violence or punishing guilty officers. I suspect the ego involved in penal authority attracts some of the best and worst kind of people. But at least part of the responsibility for their racism is my own. It is exacerbated by poor schools, the bad immigration policies, perpetuated ghettos, and social dynamics.

To some extent, we are all responsible for the racism we see exhibited in the police force. I have lived in downtown Minneapolis, about five miles from both Falcon Heights and St. Anthony’s. It is an incredibly diverse city bloated with gangs, ghettos, and immigrants from Laos and Somalia. I loved my time there and the people I met from a variety of religions and races. But I would have been blind to ignore the resulting complexities.

If the eyes of our police have been colored, it’s probably not the result of an ideological hatred towards black people but the messy result of complex and dysfunctional social structures—the very complexities we send our police officers to clean up. So while racism exists, we all shoulder some of the responsibility, which should make us generous in our critique even if more committed to change.

Unintended Consequences Still Matter

A good counter example of an effective organization with a similar political motive was the organization Freedom to Marry. This organization advocating gay marriage had a clear legislative goal, deep and dynamic organization, and specific plans for specific ends. Once they accomplished their goal, they dissolved the organization, hence why I’m speaking in past tense. Now all that remains on their website is the story of their success, from inception to fruition. While there is a lot of energy behind Black Lives Matter, I question its direction, productivity, and effectiveness.

The problem with indirection in Black Lives Matter is deeper than ineffectuality. A movement calling for protests, revolts, and rallies plays with fire. There is no room for ambiguity when a protester’s blood begins to boil, a rally becomes lively, or an ideology is given tinder. Such potent and deadly energy must be harnessed towards productivity or else risk erupting in unpredictable and catastrophic directions, as was the case recently in Dallas and Baton Rouge.

Of course the vast majority of protestors would never condone shooting a police officer, and the organization cannot be held entirely responsible for all actions of its members. As best I can tell, the Black Lives Matter movement has channeled the nonviolent protest of Martin Luther King Jr. over an early Malcom X. I am sure they are as horrified as I am by the violence that took place at their protest in Dallas. But the movement is not entirely innocent of the crimes, either.

An organization that actively promotes civil distress through inflammatory rhetoric carries some responsibility for the resulting consequences, even if unintended. Even if an organization denounces violence, if it creates violence there is still a conversation to be had. This should sound oddly familiar. Isn’t that the very thing Black Lives Matter says about police brutality? Every police organization denounces dishonesty, brutality, and racism. But if dishonesty, brutality, and racism still happen, suddenly what they claim to preach doesn’t matter so much. Perhaps police forces and Black Lives Matter have something in common here.

If Black Lives Matter is indeed channeling the nonviolent protests of the civil rights era, they should establish more pointed and particular goals—specifically legislative goals. In Selma, the civil activists protested for voting rights. In Montgomery, they protested racial segregation on the public transit system that a little over a year later culminated in the Supreme Court decision of Browder vs Gayle. Until the Black Lives Matter movement establishes specific goals beyond inciting indignation, it remains volatile and predisposed towards violence.

What It’s Like To Be A Black Cop In The Age Of ‘Black Lives Matter’,"I am a three-time Army veteran of Afghanistan and a former law enforcement officer. I am also black. Every male in my biological family has been to jail or prison at least once. I’m the sole exception, unless you count the many times I’ve escorted others to jail.

On my mom’s side—the ones I grew up with—that’s all four of my uncles and my two younger brothers. On my dad’s side—the ones I met later in life—that’s my dad (jailed once as a teenager for taking wood pallets from dumpster areas behind commercial buildings and selling them), at least two older half-brothers, and the youngest, my step-brother. Every one of them has experienced some degree of overreach with law enforcement officers they’ve encountered, from unlawful entry of residence to unlawful search and seizure to false charges to physical brutality.

As a black police officer, I found myself stuck in a balancing act from the start, like walking a tightrope right between two perennially warring foes. I belonged to both sides, but being in the middle put me at odds with each.

We Feel Racism in Our Souls

One motivation for choosing to become a state law enforcement officer was the poignant memory of my younger brother being pistol-whipped in the head by local law enforcement and knocked unconscious after he refused an officer’s demands (in front of other officers) to engage him in a fist fight. As the oldest brother I was accustomed to being the responsible one and the one to call on when my brothers needed me. It was the first time I encountered a blatant wrong and injustice, and I felt utterly powerless to help remedy it. Who could I call—more police? I cannot articulate the depths at which that kind of wrong hurts a person. It is felt in the soul.

My initial response and warning to my younger brothers was the same I see from so many today: “If you don’t break the law, you won’t encounter the cops in the first place and none of that would happen to you.” I had little empathy. I didn’t fully buy into racism at the time because I had been largely insulated from it, thanks to well-integrated schools, so I believed instead that the odds were against me because I was Christian and God was watching. What racism I did witness seemed largely avoidable by doing the right thing and was mostly from people raised on the black side of town.

My response was practical, and it addressed the way things are. Yet it simultaneously dismissed and therefore permitted the wrong in the way things are. I lived my own life by that same code. Be at least twice as clean as the other person in order to get the same treatment as that person. Be so clean that your reputation for it precedes you. That was normal survival for me, and it was effective. But that doesn’t make it right.

For example, a few years ago, one of my uncles robbed a bank and got away. Later he decided to turn himself in, and sought me out to escort him to do so. He was prepared to be justly punished for his crime but he was also prepared to be unjustly punished, via an officer’s personal vengeance, without my presence. When you live in this world where this is your common experience with the ambassadors of the law, it affects your incentive to respect and obey the laws—the same ones that don’t protect or respect you.

A Vicious Cycle of Disrespect for Law

It is clear how this quickly devolves into a self-destructive cycle. Lost respect for the law increases the likelihood of breaking it and disrespecting its ambassadors (cops), which increases the likelihood they will act harshly and outside the scope of justice, which reaffirms and increases loss of respect for the law, and so downhill it goes. No members of my family expected justice, at least not at first contact with the law. Similarly, I knew I was more likely to be treated harshly during encounters with law enforcement if I was on “the black (or impoverished) side” of town. This is the crux of the problem, and it eludes many who have never witnessed this alternate but very real world, and therefore it is difficult for them to conceive.

In fact, I told none of my biological family when I applied for the law enforcement job, and told none when I joined the academy. I knew what their reactions would be. When I graduated (with top honors), I told my grandmother that I was a police officer. With no emotion on her face and in a tone of thinly veiled disappointment, almost under her breath she replied, “I don’t know why you wanna go do that for.”

My brothers showed little reaction but wanted to be happy for me. My mother was more ambivalent. I broke the news to my father by raiding his house one night with the blinding lights of my patrol car flashing out front as I banged on his door, demanding in my disguised voice that he come outside. I had intended to tackle him to the ground as soon as he opened the front door before he could realize it was me, but when I saw the defeated look in his eye and in my stepmother’s face as he opened the door I immediately lost heart and just hugged him instead.

My adoptive family, who is white, by contrast was ecstatic and celebratory, along with my friends who did not grow up on the “black” side of town. Friends bragged about my achievement to other friends, wanted to see my badge when we went out to eat, and paid for my meal. The party was on that side of my dual universe. I understood both reactions. In this side of the universe, uniformed officers are highly esteemed daily heroes out battling the dark forces on behalf of the greater good. That is the version of law enforcement they regularly encounter.

The prank night-raid I pulled on my biological dad would never begin to succeed with my adoptive dad and family. I knew that, otherwise I would have pranked them, too. If officers came beating on their door at night, my adoptive family would be concerned but eager to open the door and welcome the officers in to figure out what the mix-up was. They would rest fully confident that their innocence would quickly exonerate them before any harm came to them.

My biological dad, despite being equally aware he had done nothing wrong, informed me later that he fully expected to be tackled to the ground, roughed up, and hauled off to jail before his innocence would prevail and exonerate him. This difference, difficult to articulate across sides, is what people miss when they make comparisons on what they see, often heard in statements that sound like, “If they would just do what I do in that scenario, there would be no problem.” I know because I am guilty of it.

Walking Around in My Skin

It took me a long time to understand my biological family’s point of view. I have worked hard to overcome the circumstances of my life and to succeed, and therefore am unlikely to turn around and act like a victim or perceive slights when there are none. Not only did I think police overreach was a serious issue, I also did not really experience racism.

Unfortunately, my experiences in Army boot camp permanently removed my racism blinders forever. It was only the beginning of continual exposure to racism that slapped me in the face no matter how hard I or other people around me wanted to deny it. I might be writing for the better part of this summer if I attempted to summarize all the accounts of racism and perceived racism I encountered between graduating high school and becoming a law enforcement officer and since. It reared its ugly head even during the law enforcement academy. I wish I had the time and space to share, because it was all meaningful and illuminates the realities of the alternate world where racism thrives.

The wonderfully integrated world I lived in prior to that point in my life was sadly a dream not yet realized. Walking around in my skin denies me the luxury of living in that world anymore. While racism happens primarily as headlines to those raised in the world of my adoptive family, it happens to me as small, not uncommon, often subtle acts that directly affect the course of my daily life and life at large. It colors the lens through which I must view the world around me, for better or worse.

Can’t We Mourn Police Instead Of Exploiting Their Deaths?,"Handwringing of the PC kind is a ritual exertion in my solidly Democrat town. Chappaqua is not called the Upper Upper West Side for nothing.

On July 11, our town board organized a “Community Gathering in a Time of Grief and Sorrow” to mourn victims of the Dallas shootings. It was the second such liturgy in four weeks. The first convened after the Orlando rampage. Contrast between the two was telling. The first was well-attended, self-congratulatory, even festive. The second was sparse and ambivalent.

Gun control was a subtext of both. Town dignitaries replayed Hillary’s response to the rampage in San Bernadino: “We must take action to stop gun violence now.” Mention of totalitarian Islam was inadmissible in the first gathering. Any recognition of black hostility toward whites—festering since the 1970s and detailed by David Horowitz in “Hating Whitey” (1999)—was absent in the second.

It’s Almost Out of a Clichéd Movie

The June rally began with a cantor from Temple Beth El leading the crowd in singing “Ya’asch Shalom,” a prayer for peace. A Congregational minister led “Amazing Grace,” and quoted Martin Luther King Jr. (“Hate confuses life; love harmonizes it”). Reluctant to place Omar Mateen’s murder spree in an ideological context, she crooned: “For those who decide to kill each other and cause such sorrow, I truly have a hard time believing that they have experienced love, absolute love, unconditional love.”

That Mateen had experienced Islam went unsaid. Nondenominational hate was the culprit in Orlando. Love was our shield and defender. Next day’s headline in local press read: “Love Triumphs at Chappaqua Vigil for Orlando Victims.”

Town Supervisor Robert Greenstein served the obligatory candy: “More love and less hate stands for a better tomorrow.” The crowd was encouraged to reach out lovingly to the LGBT community. Between rainbow flags and compulsory cant came calls for gun control. Listen to the lady cleric: “I pray in the aftermath of this horror we can find ways to support and honor our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer friends and neighbors while also being mindful of the cost that gun violence brings to many communities every day.”

Congresswoman Nita Lowey dispatched an envoy to convey her vow to ban guns. Undermining the Second Amendment is worth it “If it stops one person from doing something awful.”

A member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America read a self-referential essay by an unnamed gay woman whose sense of safety Orlando had shattered: “Last night I kissed my girlfriend in public in a simple act of love and protest that straight people participate in without thought or fear.” The lament was received solemnly, as if gay discomposure were the issue at stake.

On hand to keep attention fixed on guns and gays—and prevent any awkward references to Islam—was Khusry Elley of the Upper Westchester Muslim Society and Westchester Coalition Against Islamophobia. Elley, a key figure in the BCCI money laundering scandal of the late 1980s, is an unsettling fixture at public events like this.

He is former chairman of WESPAC (Westchester People’s Action Coalition), a coven of left-wing activists. Journalist Daniel Greenfield wrote on WESPAC last year, declaring them anti-Israel and Hamas-friendly. Elley’s own blog still retains older anti-Semitic comments that a man less confident of his own immunity would have removed by now. In January, 2008, he wrote that “the Jewish lobby has gone from strength to strength” and now dictates foreign policy. A month later, he called the United States “captive to a minority with money” and added: “No one can explain to me how a great nation like the US allows itself to be dictated by a few million Jews and the Zionist nation of Israel.”

Elley has praised Sayed Qutub, the Muslim Brotherhood theorist seminal to al-Qaeda. He calls him “a man demonized by the West but his book Social Justice in Islam should be required reading for all Muslims.” The San Bernadino killers thought so, too. Qutub’s Leninist-inspired writings were found among their effects.

Yet here was Elley extricating Islam from any role in the Orlando shootings: “It appears the only crime in the eyes of the killer was the sexual orientation of the victims. We should urge our lawmakers for the harshest measures for hate crimes and take whatever measures are available to prevent such dastardly acts.”

Our local florist donated long-stemmed pink roses to the occasion. The library honored the event by placing a selection of LGBT books on a prominent display stand inside the entrance.

We Love to Talk about Blacks and Gays, But Not Police

The timbre of July’s gathering was strikingly different. It was a schizophrenic event that strained to honor five dead officers and, at the same time, bow heads for two black victims of police racism. The crowd was thinner. There were no incantations about love’s healing power, no call to reach out to men and women in law enforcement.

Dozens of police and firemen came from across Westchester to remember their colleagues killed protecting Black Lives Matter protesters. All were in dress uniforms, their badges covered with black armbands. Formalities opened with the Emerald Society bagpipers and a presentation by the police department’s color guard. The president of the local school board led the Pledge of Allegiance. The names of the five dead officers were read aloud.

Then the talks began. Ceremony went off-key from there. The chief of police and the president of the local Police Benevolent Association gave the eulogies. Chief Ferry felt obliged to defend militarized weaponry in police hands to counter “militarization of criminals.” Officiating clergy and bureaucrats ascended swiftly to the Bigger Issues: gun control, “disparity in justice,” and covert support for the anti-cop pieties Ferry had just rejected.

Supervisor Greenstein set the tone. He was suitably aggrieved (by all the lives lost) but in that double-minded way President Obama would adopt next day in Dallas. After obligatory commonplaces about honor of service, Greenstein threw meat to the very movement that prompted a black sniper to slaughter five white policemen: “Americans of all races and all backgrounds are outraged by police misconduct. It is unacceptable. When one of us is victimized we all suffer.”

Chief Ferry felt obliged to defend militarized weaponry in police hands to counter ‘militarization of criminals.’

In other words: Those officers should not have been murdered; nevertheless . . . . Besides, the overriding issue lay elsewhere: “Whether the event stems from terrorism, hate crimes or any other motive is irrelevant. Gun violence as a tool of hatred targeting race, gender, sexual preference, profession or any other reason cannot be tolerated. We must say no to gun violence.”

The source of hatred in Dallas went unmentioned. Anti-white animus is a progressive motif that precedes the events of Dallas. It is also a taboo subject, the silence yielding covert complicity in what Jim Sleeper in “Liberal Racism” (1997) called “the color-coding of American life.”

Not one speaker uttered a word against the dangers of making race an organizing principle of our civic life. Instead, the tenor of things affirmed Sleeper’s comment of 20 years ago: “Liberalism no longer curbs discrimination. It invites it. It does not expose racism; it recapitulates and, sometimes, reinvents it.”

We Are Not in Selma Any More

The racial politics of Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a virulent product of that re-invention. Its website states: “Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.”

The ambiguity of his comment insinuated a moral equivalence between dead police and their murderer.

BLM decries the many ways “violence is inflicted on Black folks across the world” and refuses to behave while “white supremacy and antiBlackness live and thrive in every society, culture, and part of our world.” Stating its aim of “(re)building the Black Liberation movement,” the website lapses into radical left boilerplate that hints at a larger game: “Black queer and trans folks bear a unique burden from a hetero-patriarchal society that disposes of us like garbage and simultaneously fetishizes us and profits off of us, and that is state violence.”

No, Toto, we are not in Selma anymore. But local Dems refuse to notice.

They brought back Khusro Elley. With him came under-the-radar sympathy with the BLM movement. All innuendo, Elley mourned the “unfortunate and unnecessary deaths” of the past week. The ambiguity of his comment insinuated a moral equivalence between dead police and their murderer. He waxed bolder: “We are outraged by the killing of African American men and women.” Then the punch line, a veiled accusation that had to sear the marrow of every officer listening: “I would rather be Muslim than black in America.”

A rabbi followed, admonishing against indifference with quotes from Elie Wiesel, an Auschwitz survivor. But indifference to whom? To what? The implicit Holocaust reference suggested solidarity with black grievance, not with the uniformed men and women standing in front of him.

Sky Lanterns in the Dark

The Congregational minister appeared again to deliver another posy to gun control: “I truly pray I am not standing here in another month for another vigil for another senseless act of violence.”

America’s race industry is advantageous to the caliphate’s advance men.

There was nothing senseless about the Dallas murders. They were the inevitable response to a toxic ideology that rationalizes the spilling of Pig’s Blood. Micah Johnson set out to kill white people, specifically white law enforcement. According to his Facebook page (since removed), he had joined the Mississippi branch of the Black Panther Party. Johnson was an incendiary retread in the cast of Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, and Eldridge Cleaver in his cop-shooting days.

Those half-forgotten names represent a racial antagonism that considers itself justified in the name of historic grievance and claims of ongoing persecution. As a poster stated on the Facebook page of the African American Defense League on July 18: “Where was ‘All Lives Matter’ between 1619 and 1968?”

The character of Elley’s participation in these interfaith clambakes sends a signal: America’s race industry is advantageous to the caliphate’s advance men. A gun grab, too, has uses. His presence serves as warning that our existence is intolerable to some others, possibly even those who pray with us. But it is an alarm we prefer not to hear.

This month, the florist sent no roses. The library featured no relevant books. No one read an essay by a police widow. It was left to volunteers in the Chappaqua Fire Department to release sky lanterns into the gathering dark in honor of the dead.

Democrats’ Convention Is The Victim Group Olympics,"The Democratic National Convention this week in Philadelphia is Democrats’ chance to offer their vision for America. With the Republican National Convention ending last week, Democrats and their allies in the media attempted to paint Donald Trump and the RNC’s message as “dark.”

However, it’s actually the Democrats’ strategy of dividing America into victimized groups that is truly dark, as it creates discord and division for political gain. Let’s look at this week’s speaker lineup at the DNC to see this divisiveness in action.

Exploiting Family Tragedies

The speaker lineup includes a group called Mothers of the Movement, which consists of the mothers of black men killed either by police or someone else, including Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Dontré Hamilton, and Sandra Bland, among others.

Consistent with their strategy of dividing America into groups of victims that Democratic Party handouts and programs must save, this group’s messaging consists of three components: 1) Blame police for the deaths of black men they shoot, 2) Blame (white) racism for black people killing each other in such dramatically high numbers, and 3) Blame guns for the problems of crime and violent interactions with police in the black community—then call for further restrictions on gun rights.

Let’s be clear: everyone, myself included, sympathizes with the suffering and the loss of these women. I can’t imagine the pain of losing a child. Yet the message of Mothers of the Movement backs the Democrats’ dark strategy of division and victimization. For one, the gun control agenda they push amounts to punishing law-abiding American gun owners for the actions of criminals, who are made out to be victims of guns, not products of failed families, a dysfunctional culture, and failed policies that keep black people locked in poverty.

Second, blaming our police when criminals fight back or resist arrest makes it appear that the Democratic Party is defending criminals as victims while attacking the good guys as oppressors. Third, blaming white people for the dramatic problem of crime in black communities—a major plank of the Black Lives Matter platform—seems unfair, and as if they are avoiding a central cause of this problem, which is deep dysfunction in the black community. For example, many Americans watching this week are asking, “Where are the fathers?” and “Why did your son become a criminal or fight with the police in the first place?”

The GOP should capitalize on the Democratic strategy of division and victimization by defining itself as the party that stands for police and all law-abiding citizens of every race. They should contrast themselves with the Democratic Party, which defines black people as victims and the police, gun-owning Americans, and whites as enemies for the sake of securing a minority voting bloc.

Enabling and Apologizing for Law-Breakers

Further consistent with the theme of dividing America into victim classes, another group speaking at the DNC are “DREAMers.” “DREAMer” is the word Democrats use to describe the children of illegal immigrants who were also not born in the United States. A big agenda item of President Obama and the Democrats (and even Jeb Bush, which is one reason he lost the Republican primary so spectacularly) has been to push for legal status for this group.

Yet to many Americans, pushing to legalize those who came here illegally seems like an attack on fairness and law and order, rewarding lawbreakers who cheated our system. Further, studies show illegal immigration harms the poorest Americans and carries the threat of increased terrorism.

The GOP response should be to define itself as the party of fairness and of defending Americans from external threats, including illegal immigration. This is in contrast to the Democrats, who’ll go to any length to create a new victim group if positioning itself as the savior of that group will produce political gain, regardless of the division created and the harm to Americans accrued in the process.

Projecting Wrong Motives Onto Violence

Additionally, survivors of the horrible Charleston church shooting will speak. That shooting was of course an unspeakable, indefensible act. But I expect this presentation to further reveal the Democratic strategy of cultivating victim groups and then making itself the savior of those groups against their alleged oppressors—in this case whites and those who fly the Confederate flag. (As if the Confederate flag is making 5,500 black people kill each other every year!)

This approach also reveals another fundamental problem with Democrats’ philosophy: their willingness to claim systematic racism for the isolated act of a crazy, despicable individual such as Dylann Roof. They do such things while also typically claiming there is no systematic problem with Islamic terrorism despite repeated, consistent attacks from Muslims in the name of their religion on behalf of ISIS.

This presents an opportunity for the GOP to not only clearly showcase the Democrats’ confused beliefs towards extremism, but also to point out their willingness to divide the nation by designating gun owners and the Confederate flag as enemies for political gain, even though those are not the cause of this horrible incident.

Mischaracterizing Paperwork Mistakes for Political Gain

Next up, a young woman from Kansas named Jensen Walcott tells how she was fired by her employer, Pizza Studio, for asking why she was paid less than her male counterpart who started the same job on the same day. The obvious implication is that her lower pay compared to her male co-worker was due to discrimination, and she was fired because the company supported this discrimination.

But further investigation shows her lower pay was not due to discrimination or bias at all (her boss was a woman), but a paperwork mistake! Indeed, Ashleigh Siefker, Pizza Studio’s executive director of operations and a woman, has personally instituted anti-discrimination policies at the company, and indicated the pay discrepancy in this case was an HR mistake, not discrimination. The boss who incorrectly set Walcott’s pay was fired for the mistake. But don’t expect something as minor as the truth to stop the narrative of victimization that is the bread and butter of the Democratic Party.

Walcott’s story and the DNC’s shameless twisting of the facts in an attempt to show discrimination that wasn’t actually there is yet another example of creating division for political gain, this time with the victim group being women. This presents a great opportunity for the GOP to highlight Democrats’ negative and divisive strategy of dividing people into groups, then declaring each one a victim of discrimination, even when no discrimination is actually taking place.

The Democratic strategy is on full display this week: divide America into victimized groups, then showcase speakers and viewpoints that tell the victim narrative while blaming the alleged oppressors. The victim groups of choice this week will be blacks, illegal immigrants, gays, and women. The oppressors are those bad Republicans, whites, Christians, and men.

Time will tell which party’s approach gets the moderate swing voters. The GOP has a strong chance if they clearly highlight the harm done to national unity by Democrats’ dark strategy of division, victimization, and blame.

Did Black Lives Matter Just Oust NYPD’s Police Chief?,"One day after Black Lives Matter protesters attempted to occupy New York’s City Hall Park, one of their central demands was met. With the resignation of Police Commissioner Bill Bratton Tuesday, the group can claim a victory in its effort to transform policing in America’s largest city.



Although Bratton’s resignation had been rumored for some time and he and the mayor deny protests influenced the move, BLM activists toasted the decision today. Republican Staten Island city councilman Joe Borelli says: “Essentially, they got what they wanted. Causation is not relevant, perception is.” The unmistakable perception is that the move, long in the planning or not, is a concession to protesters.

Along with Bratton’s removal, the protesters demanded that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) be disbanded, with its budget redirected to community activism. If, for some reason, the city government refuses to disband the police, protesters demand that “broken windows” policing, first championed by Bratton in the 1990s, be abolished.

Broken windows is a police practice of focusing on small, quality-of-life crimes to stem larger, more violent crimes. Its implementation is widely credited with New York City’s steep drop in crime under former mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.

Black Lives Matter Protests

Late into Monday night, protesters in City Hall Park gathered and chanted “How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D,” as NYPD officers looked on. According to some protesters I spoke with, the plan was to stay in the park indefinitely, in the style of Occupy Wall Street. While that did not happen, a large gathering of hundreds did essentially take over the park, which was cordoned off by police and fencing.

The atmosphere swung from jubilant to angry as activists poured out their frustrations over what they view as a racist and corrupt police force. One protester told me “this movement is trying to bring to light stories from people who have no other access to [presenting] information.” But other protesters took a harder line, insisting New York City’s police force was beyond redemption and must be done away with.

By midnight, the protest had mostly dissipated, and a relative calm was restored to the downtown Manhattan neighborhood. According to Gothamist, the protesters left to go to 8 Spruce Street, a privately owned park where approximately 100 stayed the night. There were no arrests.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive Democrat, was a champion of Occupy Wall Street. While running for mayor in 2013 he said, “Occupy Wall Street pulled the growing crisis of income inequality out into the light of day.” He was also at speaker at the occupation of Zuccotti Park 2011. This makes for an awkward situation, as his city government is now being occupied. Although unlikely to fall to a Republican in next year’s general election, there have been murmurs, specifically from black city leaders, of a primary challenge.

With pressure already building from the black community, Monday’s protests turned the screws a little tighter. Bratton’s resignation Tuesday may well provide an exhaust valve for Black Lives Matter’s anger at the NYPD and mayor. While it is possible Bratton’s decision to step down was already scheduled for Tuesday, its announcement provides a clear victory for those who took to New York’s streets Monday night.

Nobody Elected Black Lives Matter

If the mayor and police commissioner’s decision, or even the timing of the announcement, was influenced by Monday’s protests, it represents a dangerous surrender. Mayor de Blasio was elected to serve New York City, not Black Lives Matter. And nobody elected the latter. Even to allow the appearance that protesters are influencing police policy sends a dangerous message. Handing a big win to people who sing songs about how racist the police are legitimizes that contention.

While many people of all political stripes acknowledge and address growing concerns about police violence towards minorities, succumbing to demands is not a sound policy. That’s especially so when the city has already reduced penalties for many of the quality-of-life or “broken windows” crimes BLM is protesting. How far will de Blasio go to foster the perception that progressive protesters can persuade him?

Giuliani and Bloomberg left de Blasio with a city that, unlike many others such as Chicago, is not suffering from a crisis of violent crime. This didn’t happen by accident. It is the direct result of policing policies that have influenced departments all over the country. It is a result of practices that work. For the city to now begin rejecting police policies that have kept millions safe is a terrible idea that should give Gotham’s voters pause next year.

Police violence is a serious and complicated issue. It deserves full attention, perhaps even protest. But decisions about how to fight crime must never result from or appear to result from frustration and anger. The mayor, who has a history of angering his police force to the point where they have asked him not to attend police funerals, should know better. The timing of this announcement is a smack in the face of the NYPD and a wink and a nod at their fiercest detractors.

Bratton is moving on to a lucrative new job. De Blasio may have calmed some of his critics in the black community. But tens of thousands of New York police officers must watch as those who call them racist and corrupt celebrate the fulfillment of one of their central demands. Out of simple courtesy to those officers and the millions they risk their lives to protect, de Blasio should have waited to have Bratton’s resignation announced. But he didn’t. Surely, today anti-police activists in New York City are wondering: what demand can we have met next?

Black Lives Matter Founder: 'Clintons Use Black People For Votes',"In an interview published by Bloomberg on Thursday, Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza dropped a bombshell and said that Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, just “use black people for votes.”

“Early on, [Hillary] would say, ‘Yes, black lives matter,’ but she wouldn’t acknowledge her role in processes that fundamentally showed black lives did not matter,” Garza said.

Garza also slammed former President Bill Clinton for loudly criticizing BLM activists at a campaign event in April.

“You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,” Bill Clinton said earlier this year while defending his administration’s crackdown on crime in the 90’s.

“I was angry about that for about a month, seriously, like every single day,” Garza said. “It’s reprehensible for him to defend the impacts his policies have had on our communities.”

The Clintons use black people for votes,” Garza said, “but then don’t do anything for black communities after they’re elected. They use us for photo ops.”

The 42nd president’s comments aren’t the only reason the BLM movement is upset with the Clintons. Hillary’s campaign events have been repeatedly foiled by activists who have criticized her use of the term “super-predator” to describe young, black men.

Last year, Hillary told BLM activists that she would only talk to white people about racial issues if they continued to disrupt her events.

In March, Hillary popped off at a young, black woman who asked her a question about her record on racial issues, suggesting the young women should “go run for something” if she wasn’t happy with the status quo.

Hillary also declared at a campaign rally that a lot of “well-meaning, open-minded white people” think black men in hoodies are scary.

“I mean if we’re honest, for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear,” Clinton said.

In 1996, Hillary Clinton famously referred to black youths as “super predators” who have “no conscience” and “no empathy.”

“[W]e have to bring them to heel,” the then-First Lady vowed.

How To Fight Black Lives Matter Harassment In Houston,"Rohini Sethi, the vice president of the Student Government Association at the University of Houston, has been suspended from that position, barred from participating in SGA activities, required to attend various diversity workshops, and must write a letter of reflection on how wrong she was. All this even though she has three stars on the victim meter: a racial minority, an immigrant family background, and a woman. Must be serious!

So what was her grand offense to warrant this punishment? Making the following post on Facebook: “Forget #BlackLivesMatter; more like #AllLivesMatter.” That’s it.

Yet predictably, outrage ensued from supporters of Black Lives Matter. The Black Student Union at the University of Houston called not only for Sethi’s suspension from student government, but for her complete removal from that body, using the Twitter hashtag #RemoveRohini to support that cause. The story has gained nationwide attention.



What are we to make of this incident? Let’s start by looking at what’s wrong with Black Lives Matter.

Get a Grip, Black Lives Matter

First, some have compared Black Lives Matter to raising breast cancer awareness, arguing that emphasizing breast cancer does not mean one is slighting other types of cancer. Therefore, goes the argument, saying Black Lives Matter doesn’t mean other lives don’t matter.

However, the problem with this analogy is simply that cancer is not anywhere near the same as race. It does not have the same sensitivity, history, and emotionally charged nature. So the cancer analogy does not even come close to having the same negative connotations and sense of unfairness that focusing on one race to the perceived exclusion of others has. The fact is, the slogan “Black Lives Matter” does sound exclusionary, as does the rhetoric of many of its proponents.

Secondly, Black Lives Matter is not actually focused on saving black lives. Indeed, in Chicago alone, 65 people were killed in July, making it the deadliest July in more than five years. At least three-quarters of those victims were black, and almost all of those poor souls were killed by other black people. Nationwide, black folks kill around 5,500 other black folks every year. Is BLM organizing protests and blocking freeways to combat the epic problem of black crime? Doesn’t look like it.

What about black education underachievement and the thug culture infecting black communities? BLM is silent. What about the massive problem of single motherhood? Seventy percent of black kids are born out of wedlock, even though studies clearly show that children from married, two-parent homes have better outcomes. Why the silence from BLM? If they were truly interested in helping black people, they’d be at the leading edge of fighting for all of these issues. So why aren’t they? Maybe someone can ask George Soros.

Speak Up for Free Speech

So now that we understand what BLM is and is not, what does the hostile reaction to Sethi reveal? Just like the DePaul University banning Ben Shapiro and Twitter banning Milo Yiannopoulos and craftily suppressing conservative content using a technique called shadowbanning, universities, social media sites, and the mainstream media are increasingly shutting out the voices of those who go against left-wing ideology. The standard for acceptable discourse is not truthfulness, but whether certain groups might be offended.

Groups that must not be offended are: racial minorities, women, gays, immigrants, and Muslims. On the other end of the spectrum, groups who do not have the right to be offended are: whites, Christians, men, and conservatives. Almost any amount of abuse against them will go unpunished.

My advice to Sethi: Rather than be force-fed diversity training and write an apology letter for a crime you did not commit, tell them you will not do it, and that you did nothing wrong. Document your experiences and share them across the nation. Might you even have a legal case against the university? Use this as an opportunity to advocate for free expression and exchange of ideas—what universities are supposed to be all about in the first place. Oh, and do an interview with Milo, too!

Why I’m The Only Non-Democrat In My Family,"Most black Americans are Democrats. My mom, dad, and siblings are all staunch Democrats. Yet this black person is not and has never been a registered Democrat, nor voted Democratic in any election ever.

I would like to lay out the reasons I chose to break rank, and why time only strengthens my convictions.

Capitalism Creates Economic Opportunity

Economic growth that lifts people out of poverty is personal for me, because it’s the story of our family over generations. But let’s step back and review some basics first to see how it works.

Human beings like money. So they make things and sell them to get money. People compete against each other to make better and better things for lower and lower prices in order to get more and more money. This results in the world getting higher-quality products at lower prices over time.

People who couldn’t afford refrigerators now have them, because firms have competed against each other to get more market share by offering better models for cheaper. People who couldn’t afford shoes, like my parents as kids, now have them, for the same reason. This process is known as capitalism, and it’s a powerful force that lifts humanity out of poverty.

I’ve seen what it’s done in my own family, who’ve gone from Southern sharecroppers who couldn’t read and write two generations ago to myself and my sisters, who not only wear shoes but have much greater opportunities and greater quality of life in every way than those before us. This is largely due to economic opportunity capitalism creates.

I believe strongly in supporting and continuing this process. This means unleashing human beings to fulfill their potential to build up our economy. Yet my sense is the current Democratic Party largely doesn’t agree. They seem to be instinctively uncomfortable with the workings of capitalism because it operates largely without government direction, which they believe is necessary for the world to improve. Whether it’s Obamacare, massive regulation, or shuttering entire industries by government fiat, Democrats seem to prefer government management as opposed to market solutions to our problems.

As a service provider myself, however, I’ve seen how the government has distinct disadvantages compared to human ingenuity expressed through capitalism. For one, government is shielded from competition, which means people can’t give their business to others who provide better services at lower prices, because there are no others. Second, no matter how poor their performance, government will never go out of business because lawmakers guarantee their existence and revenue streams rather than securing the same by providing quality services at good prices.

Thirdly, since there’s no competition and no threat of going out of business, there is no incentive to improve efficiency or quality. It thus seems to me that while some level of government involvement is necessary, ultimately fewer things, not more things, should be under government control. I am uncomfortable with the degree to which the Democratic Party wants to place things under government management and outside of the healthy, efficiency-generating domain of capitalism.

All that said, I will add two caveats. First, neither of the two parties has a great track record here. Indeed, George W. Bush dramatically increased the size and scope of government during his presidency. But between the two, the Democratic Party is worse, and getting worse over time. Secondly, capitalism all by itself can go awry when its participants are not generally guided by a moral compass. That’s why it must be coupled with a moral system, like Christianity, to function most effectively.

I’m not a Democrat because I’d rather unleash the potential in people, not the largess of government, to create economic growth.

It’s Best for People to Help People

Having worked for a Christian nonprofit organization, I’ve seen firsthand the positive effect on society when people driven by compassion, who have a personal relationship with those they are serving, work to make the world a better place.

On the other hand, I was deeply affected by a trip I took to the South recently, where I saw firsthand the abuse and fraud of those who live by unemployment checks, disability checks, and other government programs. Yes, these programs were designed to help the poor. But more often than not, rather than help, the recipients are robbed of the chance to develop their talents and character and use them to better the world by contributing to our economy through work. More often than not, far from being a temporary leg up on the way to self-sufficiency, these programs become a multi-generational way of life for many Americans.

So I’m skeptical of the Democratic Party’s claim they are the ones who stand for helping the poor, because creating government programs that give people money is not the same as truly helping them. Quite often, it actually hurts them. Neither are the party’s motivations noble; the purpose of these programs is to secure and maintain a loyal voting bloc by making them permanent aid recipients, rather than actually helping them. I can’t belong to a party that hurts the poor for the sake of political gain.

Victimization Doesn’t Create Racial Healing or Unity

Like other areas, this is personal to me. We’ve been making great progress on race over the past 100 years, but for the first time, I feel that’s in jeopardy.

One major reason we risk going backwards is the strategy of the Democratic Party. It seems to me their game plan is as follows: 1) Divide Americans into groups and argue that each is a victim of discrimination or bigotry. Then 2) portray itself as the party that fights for each group against the bigots and oppressors. Those used as victims in this strategy are black people, Hispanics, gays, Muslims, women, immigrants, unskilled laborers, and others, and the message to each is always the same: “Vote for us, because the Republicans are bigots.”

Those identified as oppressors in this strategy are almost always whites, Christians, and men, and the message to them is, “You are responsible for the suffering of others. Admit it or you are a bigot.”

I find this approach problematic for two reasons: 1) The groups often portrayed as oppressed and in need of rescuing by the Democratic Party are often not actually suffering oppression, and 2) The alleged oppressors who are attacked and demonized for bigotry are often not guilty of oppression in the first place. This is not only dishonest, as it creates division for sake of acquiring and maintaining a political constituency, but also deeply negative and divisive.

This creates division for sake of acquiring and maintaining a political constituency.

Further, defining someone as a victim when they are not cripples them. It does not serve them, uplift them, or unleash their potential. This is especially true in poor black communities, where 5,500 black folks kill each other every year, far surpassing the number of black people killed by police officers or whites. In fact, for every one black person killed by a white police officer, 71 are killed by another black person. I’m uncomfortable with Democratic rhetoric that gets angry about black deaths at the hands of police, but ignores the 15 to 20 black men who kill each other every single day, a far more common occurrence.

So the tough but true message black people need to hear is not “Racism is the cause of your problems.” Rather it’s “We must fix broken families, destroy the culture of underachievement, and demolish the thug culture that keeps black folks at the bottom of the barrel in almost every category.” However, the Democratic Party lacks the courage to confront these ills in the black community with honesty, so instead falls back on the easy message of blaming racism. It’s always easier to blame someone else than look in the mirror. I cannot in good conscience belong to a party that embraces this strategy.

What’s more, I am uncomfortable with how fast Democrats label someone as a bigot for disagreeing with them. Those who want to talk about the very real problem of crime in the black community are immediately branded as racist. I personally have been called “coon,” “house n***ger,” and “Uncle Tom.” Those who believe marriage is between one man and one woman are branded as bigots and hateful. Those who believe life begins at conception and oppose abortion are labeled as hating women, against women’s health, and against women’s rights.

We have to be able to disagree without calling the other person names. I don’t believe the Democratic Party gets that.

While most Americans trace their ancestry to immigration and are not against reasonable levels of legal immigration, those who voice concerns with the negative aspects of illegal immigration, or even suggest there are negative aspects to illegal immigration, are quickly branded as anti-immigrant bigots. Worse, these judgments are often made without even knowing anything else about the person, and based solely on their position on one single issue. That’s unfair.

My point is not to take a position on these issues; that’s for another time. It’s just to say that we have to be able to disagree without calling the other person names. I don’t believe the Democratic Party gets that. I don’t like the name-calling and quick judgmental attitude towards those who hold different beliefs. It’s another reason I can’t be a Democrat.

I Like America

When I hear President Obama and many Democrats talk about America, I hear a deeply negative vision. I hear of a place full of racists who committed genocide against Native Americans, who enslaved blacks and denied them rights, who denied rights to women and gays rights, who hate immigrants, and where white police officers casually kill hundreds, maybe thousands, of innocent black people every day.

In America I see a place where people of different races get along better than almost anywhere.

Yet aside from the questionable veracity of some of these claims, that is not the America I see. As a black American who has actually spent years living overseas and travelled to many countries, one quickly realizes black folks are treated much better in America than almost anywhere. The tribalism that defines most of the world—the Japanese hating the Chinese, the Koreans hating the Japanese, and the Chinese hating the Japanese (and that’s just East Asia!)—tends to be subdued in our American melting pot. In America I see a place where people of different races get along better than almost anywhere.

I see a place where the grandchild of Southern sharecroppers can achieve success. I see a place of hope and opportunity for those willing to do what it takes to succeed. I see police officers putting their lives on the line in dangerous neighborhoods to serve and protect residents terrorized by crime.

Yes, it’s true that we’ve haven’t always been where we should be, including slavery and segregation. Yet through it all we have moved forward together and gotten better together. I am proud to be American and proud of our unique culture, system of government, and phenomenal land. I don’t believe I am oppressed by white Americans or anyone else. I believe that white Americans are my brothers, just like black folks and all other Americans are my brothers. We are united as a people by common language, culture, history, and values, far more than we are divided because of color.

But I don’t believe the Democratic Party shares this vision. According to them, I am supposed to define myself first and foremost as a victim of racism and discrimination. I am supposed to see whites as my oppressors. According to Democrats, I’m supposed to vote Democrat because Republicans are racist. I’m supposed to see America as a greedy, evil, racist place that can only be saved if they’re in charge.

Respectfully: that is not my America, and that is not my vision. I can’t belong to a party that thinks it is.

Why ‘The Bachelor’ Will Never Have Racial Diversity,"As a black woman in America I can’t help but take exception to what I see as Hollywood’s cultural insensitivity. No doubt we’ve come a long way in diversifying entertainment, but it still stings when I see white actors cast in roles that traditionally belong to minorities, or black characters only being written as sidekicks or the “noble savage.” Other people share my sensitivity, and it’s why we hail the Shonda Rimeses and Viola Davises of the industry.

That being said, I’m not ignorant of the true purpose of entertainment—ratings, particularly in the realm of television. These days reality TV is big ratings, and one of the biggest ratings successes is the Bachelor franchise.

Recently there has been some talk of “diversifying” the show by bringing in more minority contestants and leads. The most recent Bachelorette, Jojo Fletcher, is half-Iranian. That’s the closest the show has come to that goal.

It’s Not About Casting

My husband and I watch the show (I through gritted teeth and dripping sarcasm, he with sincere curiosity and affection), and every season we have a giggle when the black contestants show up. You can’t cut the black person in the first couple of rounds (obviously!) so we take bets on how many rounds they’ll last. Even when they go further than we predict, we know there’s never any real danger of winning.

The consistent lack of chemistry between the white leads and their minority contestants is painfully obvious. This season of “The Bachelorette” was glaringly white when Jojo’s top three suitors all looked almost exactly the same, down to the color of their hair and their five o’clock shadows (or, more precisely, around 7 p.m.).

Lifetime’s “Unreal” follows the behind-the-scenes drama of a Bachelor-type show, and this season they explore the trials and consequences of having the first black Bachelor. This prompted ABC’s new Entertainment President Channing Dungey (the first black woman to head a major broadcast network) to respond to growing questions about whether reality TV life will imitate art: “I would very much like to see some changes there…we need to increase the pool of diverse candidates in the beginning, because part of what ends up happening as we go along is there aren’t as many candidates to ultimately end up in the role of the next ‘Bachelor’ or ‘Bachelorette.’”

Dungey is being diplomatic but not very specific. As a black woman, she knows what I know: this isn’t just a matter of casting more minorities. It’s a challenge of human nature. The entertainment industry commonly underestimates the viewing public’s capacity for change. Interracial dating isn’t that scandalous anymore. The problem isn’t the viewer—it’s the contestants.

Chemistry Is Key, and Culture Matters

Dungey is smart enough to understand that you can make all the conditions favorable, but you can’t create chemistry. There’s a reason why Bachelor/ettes never have any chemistry with their minority contestants. It’s actually not that common for people to mate outside their culture or ethnicity. According to a 2013 Pew Research poll, only 12 percent of newlyweds in that year married outside of their race. This is a record high.

American Indians had the highest rate of intermarriage. White people had the lowest, with just 7 percent of both men and women marrying outside their race. A quarter of black men married outside their race, as opposed to just 12 percent of black women.

This actually makes some sense if you are talking about a long-term commitment as opposed to casual dating. It’s one thing to date around, but for spending your life with a person it’s not inconceivable that most people would choose a mate with common experiences and cultural references. New couples must surmount a lot of personality hurdles when first settling down. It’s understandable that sharing the same cultural shorthand adds to an attraction and cuts down the difficulty of blending lives.

All of this is reflected in our biology—how we are attracted to each other. I don’t want to put words in Dungey’s mouth, but it seems she is well aware of these realities. The reason the Bachelor has never chosen a black woman as his fiancé is because they’ve all been white men, and white men, statistically speaking, are not attracted to black women as life partners, and vice versa. Obviously there are all kinds of exceptions to this rule (I am one) but statistically speaking that’s simply a truth.

It is the same for white women. Dungey understands that casting a reality show interracial love match isn’t just an uphill battle against audience reaction and Hollywood culture, it’s a battle against statistical truths.

Where Color Especially Matters

As a reluctant viewer I would be thrilled to see more minority finalists in the Bachelor franchise, especially a minority Bachelor or Bachelorette. They don’t even have to be black (I mean, can my Asian brothers and sisters get a little love?). If they could just not all be carbon-copy of the same twenty- or thirty-something, blonde bland guy, that would be fantastic.

However, I’m not ignorant. I understand bringing more color to a show like the Bachelor goes way beyond casting numbers. I would simply settle for a stronger attempt at diversity and let the pheromones fall where they may.

The reality of reality TV is that there are huge cultural hurdles that could spell reduced ratings. It’s a risk at the very least, and in the entertainment industry at the end of the day the only color that matters is green.

Defending Abortion For Zika Proves Trevor Noah’s A Coward,"Trevor Noah is showing his stupid again by wishing “a giant mosquito would f–k [Marco] Rubio and leave him pregnant with a Zika baby” after the senator said women infected with the Zika virus shouldn’t abort their babies.

Noah lashed out on “The Daily Show,” saying, “It’s not just mosquitoes that suck,” it’s politicians who get involved in a woman’s right to choose. “I don’t understand how any man thinks that he has the right to dictate to women what they should do with their body,” he said. “Men know nothing about what it’s like to be a woman. So why do men always get to make laws about women’s health issues?”

First of all, Noah’s right: mosquitoes aren’t the only thing that suck. His show sucks, and he sucks. His jokes are lame, unoriginal, and downright stupid. This is just one more example. He compares men telling women not to get an abortion to black people telling white people not to wear sunscreen, which is kinda funny but not in the way Noah thinks—and that only makes him look more stupid.

Men Do Have a Vested Interest in Babies

“Imagine if black people were the only ones who could decide whether white people are allowed to use sunscreen,” Noah said. “People would be like, ‘What do black people even know about getting sunburnt?’ Black people like, ‘No, yo, yo, I hear what you sayin’ b., I hear what you sayin’. All I know is, I’m pro-melanin.”

He’s trying to make the point that men and women are so different that one can’t tell the other what to do with their own bodies, yet he fails to see that regarding babies’ bodies, men do have a right to speak (and pass laws).

The baby inside the woman—a separate, yet dependent, entity from the mother—is equally part of the man and the woman. The man has just as much of a vested interest in that child as the woman. After all, without him, there would be no baby. It’s the baby’s body that is at issue here, not the mother’s, and the father shares that child with the mother. (Since Noah might not have studied genetics at any point in his life, this might help explain how human life begins.)

Ironically, his comparison to blacks and sunscreen actually supports this general point of commonality. The fact is black people do wear sunscreen (30 percent of them), and all black people need it no matter the shade of their skin. Black, white, it doesn’t matter—we all need protection because skin can be damaged and, yes, black people get cancer too. In fact, blacks are more likely to die of melanoma than whites. “Yo, b. I hear what you’re sayin’. On second thought maybe I am pro-sunscreen!”

Of course, all that might just be too complex for someone like Noah, who is more concerned about pushing a liberal agenda than making good jokes rooted in truth (which are the best kind). But because he puts his ideology first, he fails as a comedian and comes across as a blabbering buffoon.

Real Men Don’t Support Abortion

This is particularly evident when he talks about abortion and shows himself as merely a typical wimpified pro-choice beta male. His faux-chivalrous defense of women and their bodies is nauseating. I want to vomit every time I hear some pansy man who sold his balls to the feminist movement whine about respecting a woman’s right to choose death over life.

“It’s a woman’s body, and I respect women,” they bleat repeatedly like emasculated sheep. Sure you do, buddy. You’re a shining testimony of male strength by knocking up women then removing yourself from any responsibility and saying a woman should get an abortion if she wants. Very convenient for you.

A real man makes a stand to protect both women and children—and, yes, abortion is not good for women; in fact, it’s more dangerous than childbirth. So a wimp who says he’s all for a woman’s right to choose an abortion doesn’t care about women at all. He just wants to remain safely neutral as she puts her life at risk for something in which he was intimately involved.

A real man commits to loving and caring for a child, even if that child comes into this world with a birth defect. Too many men today are all about having sex, but when it comes to the hard work of raising children, they’re MIA. Involve a child who has special needs, and he’s out the door faster than Planned Parenthood can hide profits from selling baby parts.

One of the most common arguments for abortion is “we don’t want to bring more children into the world where they have no one to care for them, and they’ll be raised in poverty” (as if poverty is worse than death). Well, that problem would be erased quickly if the men who impregnated the women in the first place acted like real men and took care of the women they had sex with and the children created from that union. It’s not like the woman magically got pregnant on her own. (And shut up, little miss feminist, who’s screeching right now, “I don’t need a man!” Sure you do, honey. You certainly needed a man when you wanted to have sex. So like it or not, he’s involved.)

Cowards Run from Their Choices

The point being, it’s not Virgin Marys going to get abortions. Men are part of this process, part of the decision-making, and part of the solution if only they stand up and be reliable men who provide for their children.

“But it’s about CHOICE!” the yellow-bellied pro-abortionists wail. They’re so right. It is about choice. That choice was made when a guy and a girl decided to have sex (even if they used birth control, which is never 100 percent). So, yeah, it is about choice, but a coward runs from the responsibilities that are inextricably bound to that choice.

A real man, on the other hand, sacrifices his own needs to care for the child he helped to create when he and the woman made the CHOICE to have sex. When they made that CHOICE, they both became responsible for any consequence of that CHOICE. That consequence is human life. Small. Dependent. Vulnerable. But still life.

A responsible, good man protects that life, even if that means sacrificing his own. That’s what real men do. That’s what pro-life men do. Pro-choice men are cowards. They screw anything with two legs without taking responsibility for their actions and then imagine themselves noble when they let the woman take on the burden of aborting her child.

These sensitive soft males with their manhood stuffed under their mommy’s pillow haven’t a clue of what nobility, strength, and respect really look like. If they want to show women respect, they need to start by being someone worthy of respect. They need to be men who do the hard work of taking responsibility for their own actions and caring for the life they have brought into this world and for the women they have used for their own gratification.

If these pro-choice cravens can’t do that, they’ll continue to prove they’re the real misogynist pigs in this world, not men who stand for life.

How We Can Make Milwaukee’s Race Riots The Last,"Milwaukee had a rough weekend. After a controversial police shooting, rioters burned businesses, threw rocks at police, and damaged multiple police cars. It’s a hot conclusion to a hot summer, and few have felt the heat like America’s police officers.

After July’s tragic beginning, many of us were quietly relieved when the violence tapered off, allowing the news cycle to turn to political conventions and the Olympic Games. Clearly, though, it’s no time to relax. Winter is coming, but maybe not quickly enough.

The New Race Riots

As this weekend clearly showed, America’s cities are still roiling with discontent. In Chicago, violent crime is spinning out of control. Last week the U.S. Department of Justice released a lengthy report on Baltimore’s Police Department with disturbing allegations of people being tased for no real reason, arrested just for loitering on sidewalks, or beaten even when they were already restrained and under officers’ control. Now we have a riot significant enough to activate the National Guard. When Barack Obama first took office in 2008, did any of us anticipate that his administration would end with widespread race riots?

Here’s a shred of comfort: major riots tend to be a summer thing. Cold weather has a chilling effect on everything, including racial tension. Thus far, America’s major riots have always taken place between April and August (although we should note that unusually warm weather is forecast for this September).

There may still be time to head off violence on a level of Watts, Rodney King, or the Holy Week uprisings of 1968. Any viable solution to the problem, however, must involve greater accountability on everyone’s part. Stop finger-pointing. Start cleaning your own house.

First, The Police

There’s no way to know for sure, but I bet the incredible grace with which Dallas Police Chief David Brown handled his city’s policing crisis has saved lives. He spoke warmly of the courage and commitment of his officers. He unashamedly asked for the nation’s prayers. But he also made clear that he understands why so many poor, black kids grow up mistrusting the police, and that he’s personally committed to helping rebuild trust. Dallas has, in fact, been working to improve community relations, especially with black residents.

Brown’s masterstroke was inviting Black Lives Matter protesters to put in an application and come work for him. He’d love to put them back into their own neighborhoods as trained and salaried problem-solvers. We could use a lot more sane and compassionate people like Brown.

Policing is difficult and dangerous work. Sometimes our officers are judged too harshly. Sometimes we expect too much of them. The police are at the front lines of most public safety initiatives, and are more trusted than any state actor except the military. That’s both a blessing and a curse.

We can respect the police, though, without writing them a blank check. Turning a blind eye to police misconduct isn’t any kind of favor, either to good police officers or to citizens who feel threatened by the police.

The DOJ’s report on Baltimore leaves a strong impression that the department’s police officers are undertrained and overwhelmed, and discipline has lapsed as a result. It describes officers shooting at retreating cars (which endangers the public and rarely disables the suspect) and chasing down residents merely on the suspicion that they might be armed (which, needless to say, is not itself illegal). They tase suspects who are already restrained in an effort to make them more cooperative. They ignore departmental guidelines for dealing with teenagers and the mentally ill.

It seems pretty clear that black citizens of Baltimore are disproportionately likely to suffer the consequences of these mistakes. Although they plausibly aren’t (in most cases) manifestations of overt racism, they’re the sort of abuses that undermine trust and make neighborhoods more dangerous for officers and residents alike. We shouldn’t try to paper over these problems. The BPD needs to do better, and so do many other departments around the country.

Next, Local Government

The DOJ concluded that Baltimore’s policing issues “result from a longstanding practice of overly aggressive street enforcement with deficient oversight and policy guidance.” That seems quite plausible, and it means we shouldn’t lay all the blame on the beleaguered beat cop.

We should note, as well, that Baltimore has languished under corrupt and incompetent Democratic governance for decades, which explains a lot about its training and oversight problems. Like Chicago, Baltimore can’t plausibly complain its bad reputation is attributable to Obama’s inflammatory rhetoric about racial bias in policing. The department has long been infamous for criminal misconduct, kickback scandals, and harassing citizens. There are many good officers who don’t want things to be this way. It’s hard to change things, though, when the city’s government is riddled with similar problems.

There are lots of ways for a city to neglect its poorer citizens. Quite often, the officers are just the hapless enforcers who get the blame for everyone else’s failings. For instance, many cash-strapped cities pressure police to issue scores of fines and citations to collect revenue. Turning cops into low-level tax collectors is a great way to destroy community relations, but the officers themselves may have little choice if they want a paycheck.

On other occasions, cities may simply prioritize the demands of wealthier and more established citizens, leaving poorer neighborhoods underserved. When inexperienced officers are coping with unmanageable crime control problems, they may just decide the Constitution is a luxury they can’t afford.

In the wake of the Baltimore report, some have stepped up to defend stop-and-frisk and broken-window policing, which in some circumstances has shown real success in deterring crime. Insofar as we use these strategies, we need to note this important caveat: Aggressive policing must be done in such a way as to assure local residents that it serves their interests. That will only happen with adequate oversight provisions, and a governmental structure that shows concern for neighborhood order instead of lining its own pockets.

Your Turn, Black Lives Matter

Let’s start here: Riots don’t fix anything. They ruin the lives of innocent people, undermine trust, and exacerbate tensions with law enforcement. We should all resist the urge to call rioters “protesters” and to justify lawlessness on the grounds that “people are upset.” This is America. We can express our anger without resorting to arson.

This is America. We can express our anger without resorting to arson.

Next, let’s talk about police safety. Black Lives Matter doesn’t sanction the murder of police officers, and last month’s cop killers seem to have been acting independently. Black Lives Matter put up a public statement that clarified, somewhere in the middle of the third paragraph, that it didn’t condone the violence. That’s pretty representative of the organization’s response. It’s something, but it would be awfully nice to see more.

It’s not fair to blame whole groups of people for the atrocities of an isolated few. Nonetheless, the reality is that Black Lives Matter protests are now legitimately dangerous for police officers, and they go anyway, because it’s their job to keep protesters safe. This is the life of a police officer.

Black Lives Matter could massively increase its credibility by showing they too can show concern for people outside their own ranks. A few small gestures could go a long way. How about putting up a “Blue Lives Matter” on the website? Why not distribute a list of tips for protestors: “Keeping Rallies Peaceful”? Urge participants to see it as their responsibility to ensure that everyone present is safe, including law enforcement.

Clearly, this wouldn’t be popular with all BLM participants. A brief foray into social media will demonstrate that many activists feel serious malice towards the police. In the end, though, these are the decisions that distinguish mature social movements from the more juvenile. Mature movements can restrain negative emotions for the sake of promoting lasting change.

Many Americans still seem to be deciding whether BLM represents a serious social movement or just one more excuse for unruly youngsters to wreak havoc. Every time a protest devolves into violence and vandalism (as happened in Milwaukee this weekend), a few more people are tipped into the latter view. Rein it in, Black Lives Matter. Many desperate people are counting on you.

That Means You, the Reader

I’m not a big believer in collective guilt. I’m not going to ask you to wander into your local coffee shop and Start A Conversation About Race. I won’t demand that you search your subconscious for some hitherto-unsurfaced bigotry that needs addressing.

Here’s what I would ask. Get beyond the impulse to defend either protestors or police at all costs. Don’t hit “share” every time you encounter a piece of evidence that The Other Guy (the one who doesn’t have your sympathies) is the real problem. Try to keep in mind that riots are a lose-lose sort of event, while genuine law and order is good for just about everybody.

Support good cops, but also keep an eye out for activists who seem to be making a thoughtful effort to promote peaceful change. Don’t apologize for corrupt officials, bullying officers, or violent vandals. Let’s have a nation with more David Browns and fewer Rahm Emanuels. That should be common ground we can all support.

Black Licorice: Divine Or Demonic? Vote Now,"There are no moderates in the debate over black licorice. Confections forged from glycyrrhiza glabra extract divide more people than the prime meridian, inspiring either instant vitriol from the enemies of black licorice or a furious defense from its fans.

Recently, Federalist Staff Writer Bre Payton and Senior Contributor Hans Fiene assumed their battle stations and began lobbing licorice-related bombs at each other, a spat that spread to the rest of the Federalist team and quickly divided them into those who love black licorice and those who believe it to be the source of all societal ills.

Bre: Gummy bears are among my favorite treats. Whenever I see a Haribo display at a mini-mart, it takes every ounce of restraint to not buy one of every single bag. So imagine the shock and horror I experienced when I spotted these bad boys near the checkout counter of my local CVS.

This is a sin pic.twitter.com/NKzN8SFasB — Bre Payton (@Bre_payton) August 22, 2016

Blech.

Apparently not everyone else can see the obvious — that black licorice candy shaped like gummy bears is a confectionary wolf in sheep’s clothing — because I got this response.

@Bre_payton You mean not buying them and immediately horking them down in the car is not a sin? Agreed. — Hans Fiene (@HansFiene) August 22, 2016

Hans, you are WRONG, my friend. Black licorice is gross. It smells like Satan’s breath and looks like it belongs inside the mouth of a rotting mummy.

Hans: “Gummy bears are among my favorite treats.” I believe I’ve found the source of the infection, folks. Your favorite treats, Bre? Treats? Are papercuts your least favorite kind of boo boo? Is your favorite relative Unkie Bwyan?

The problem is quite clear. While you may be a grown woman, you have the palate of a five year old. Like a child, your taste buds are unable to appreciate the glorious complexities of black licorice. When black licorice offers you richness and boldness with hints of bitterness and perfectly subtle sweetness, you demand chewy sugar molded in the image of Teddy Ruxpin. When black licorice invites you to savor its perfectly balanced symphony of flavors, you point to a box of Nerds, transfixed by their pink-and-purpliciousness, and demand crunchy diabetes.

Lest we waste our time comparing kiddie apples and adult oranges, let me make a clear distinction: Black licorice is not a treat. Nor is it a yummy or a nom-nom. Black licorice is a delicacy, a dessert for patriarchs and matriarchs, philosophers and generals — a dessert to be chewed, savored, swirled about on the tongue like a fine scotch. In fact, black licorice pairs perfectly with a twelve-year single malt, a pipe, and embracing adulthood.

Black licorice has filled the candy bowls of history’s most important grown-ups as they made history’s most important decisions. I have it on good authority that Ulysses S. Grant offered Robert E. Lee a handful to calm his nerves at Appomattox. Had Grant handed him a box of Jujyfruits, the Civil War would have raged for another decade, the Confederate general refusing to eternally destroy the South’s morale by surrendering to a bearded toddler.

Bre: I don’t need to eat jellied asphalt to be a grownup. Also, some of us can’t eat everything we want and still keep our girlish figures. We have to be strategic about the sweets we indulge in, and if I’m going to eat CANDY — which definitely gives me new dimples on my thighs every time I indulge — it better be worth it. There is no way I’m going to risk cellulite over a food that tastes like a combination of a leather sandal and a tire.

Black licorice is NEVER WORTH IT. It’s the tequila shots of candy. The aftertaste is unbearable and the self-loathing that soon follows is eerily similar to a night spent licking salt from one’s hands.

Hans: I’ve never dined on a feast of Tivas and Firestones, so I’m afraid I don’t have a point of comparison. Nor have I ever spent an evening seeking my daily dose of iodine from my own palms, but it seems clear that your hatred of black licorice is but one drop of water in your ocean of bad decision-making.

Bre: This is probably true. I sometimes make bad decisions — like trying black licorice a second time.

The first time I ever tried it was when my great-grandma Bernie offered me a piece of this sticky, black, gummy stick. Being a naturally curious child, I tried it and thought a bug soaked in arsenic had crawled into my mouth and died. My self-preservation instincts kicked in and I immediately spat it out. My dementia-addled grandma (God bless her) forgot the incident a few minutes later and again offered me a piece — which I politely declined. This happened several times over the course of our visit.

What I learned from that experience is that black licorice is for forgetful old people who won’t remember how bad it tastes.

Hans: You’ve clearly never had good black licorice. Saying “I know what black licorice tastes like because, once upon a time, I tried some imitation licorice-flavored abomination” is like saying “I know what a Steinway grand piano sounds like because my cousin used to play a Casiotone 405.”

Real black licorice is not waxy. It is not gummy. It does not come in bean form or find its truest expression in the consistency of jelly. Real black licorice is tender, like a prime cut of kobe beef. To savor it is to sink your teeth into an ebony cloud of instant sophistication. It’s molasses-infused ambrosia, a gift given to all mortals that, tragically, only few will embrace.

Bre: I think Hans is describing a food that doesn’t actually exist and mistaking it for black licorice To be clear, this is the food we are talking about right now:

It’s twisted black rope that makes your mouth feel like you’ve smoked an entire pack of Virginia Slims, Homer Simpson-style.



Black licorice can apparently be dangerous if consumed in large quantities. It can raise one’s blood pressure and put strain on the heart and lungs — especially for the over-40 crowd who Hans seems to think should be eating this stuff on the regular. It can also mess with your hormonal levels and make you retain sodium and fluid. In other words, black licorice might make you bloat! Gross!

Hans: You know what else raises your blood pressure and puts strain on your heart and lungs? Exercise, Bre. Exercise. All good things should be enjoyed in moderation, my friend — licorice, wine, and above all, jogging.

Bre: Hans, you literally tweeted at me that it’s a sin to not buy these and immediately “hork them all down” in the car. This does not sound like moderation to me. Also, much like black licorice, jogging is an activity that should be avoided at all costs.

Hans: You were foaming at the mouth with black licorice hatred. You needed the confectionary equivalent of an adrenaline shot in the heart.

Bre: Okay, fair.

Hans: Bre is intent on concluding our debate with a poll. Let me say, for the record, that I know my side will lose. Badly. But this will not cause me to reevaluate my position, in the same way that I wouldn’t consider burning my Bible after learning that 89 percent of Americans would rather have all-you-can-eat-ribs than divine wisdom. People are the worst. They’re wrong about everything. That’s the obvious lesson of 2016.

Bre: The most important lesson of 2016 is that the American people are sick of elites telling them what they should and shouldn’t like. Let your voice be heard! Let the hate flow through you! Vote, yo!

"Colleges Need To Resist Racial Segregation, Not Foster It","Concordia College St. Paul’s administrators doubtless had the best of PC intentions when they mailed out an orientation letter this month to minority students, announcing a meeting that “all new students of color are expected to attend.”

Students rightly decried this as a segregationist policy. “Make this public and let the world school them why this is 1. Unnecessary 2. Unwanted 3. Discriminatory 4. Dumb,” wrote one outraged Facebook user quoted by Inside HigherEd.

Unfortunately, in an era where college and universities are increasingly obsessed with identity politics, the far-Left has found itself championing a toxic form of second-wave segregationism than only exacerbates division.

This Isn’t an Isolated Incident

Regrettably, Concordia College is far from alone. After police fatally shot two black men, one in St. Paul and one in Baton Rouge, and after a Dallas shooter killed five police officers, the University of Wisconsin-Madison held “processing sessions” this summer, segregating the meetings by race to provide “affinity spaces for people of color and for white people.”

Similarly, last semester, a records request by College Fix revealed Oregon State University had spent $11,500 on racially segregated retreats, discussing topics including microaggressions, oppression, and white privilege. The University of California-Berkeley will open a segregated student union this fall. “Black people, no matter our location, need a space of our own to heal, create, build and decompress,” said the Black Student Union’s chair.

Segregated housing is also making a comeback. Some University of California-Los Angeles students demanded a black-only so-called “Afro-House.” The University of Connecticut will open black-only housing this fall. Students at the Claremont colleges advertising for an off-campus roommate publicly wrote they wanted only people of color to apply. “I don’t want to live with any white folks,” one of them said.

Diversity Meets Privilege

This same attitude is also changing college curriculum across the United States. At Yale University, Seattle University, and elsewhere, activist students have decried “too white” or “too Western” curriculum, demanding universities axe classics, instead determining the merit of a work based on the race, ethnicity, gender, and class of its author.

At the same time campuses are calling for more diverse curriculum, they’re also perpetuating the absurd notion of cultural appropriation. Where students were once encouraged to explore diverse opinions and perspectives, allowing themselves to be inspired, they’re now taught that drawing from cross-cultural knowledge is tantamount to theft.

It rejects the notion of universal truth, seeking instead a wisdom wholly bound and limited by gender, ethnicity, race, and background.

Higher education has long focused on universal values, pointing students to the good, the true, and the beautiful. Great works, from the plays of Shakespeare to the Federalist papers to the poetry of Langston Hughes to the books of Salman Rushdie, belong in the literary canon because they teach us something about what it means to be human.

But the second-wave segregation on campuses—especially when combined with the ghettoization of curriculum and the suppression of any thought or discussion deemed controversial or “offensive”—inflames divisions. It imposes physical and intellectual separation of students, making it harder for young adults to bond with anyone unlike them. It rejects the notion of universal truth, seeking instead a wisdom wholly bound and limited by gender, ethnicity, race, and background. It narrows our view of humanity. To borrow a hideously awkward but pervasive academic phrasing, it perpetuates “otherization.”

It’s worth noting that not everyone on campus, including many minority students, subscribe to such radically divisive ideas. For instance, records from Ohio State University show that a black student was horrified after she was handed a flyer last semester advertising, “Shhh! Black only speak easy.”

She wrote to administrators that while she “overwhelmingly support[s] dialogue between members of a marginalized race,” the idea was “openly discriminatory,” adding, “we are a public institution, and can cause a much more severe fallout and undesired consequences if this meeting actually happens.”

In their zeal to appear enlightened in an era of identity politics, administrators are caving to the loudest, most divisive voices on campus. Faculty see an opportunity to advance their academic careers by carving out specialties and supporting their most radical students.

But campuses’ embrace of second-wave segregation will be every bit as devastating as the first wave. Colleges and universities need to show the courage to stand up to this culturally toxic trend. Those who don’t can expect more turmoil, division, and tragedy.

Conservatism’s ‘Racism’ Isn’t What You Think It Is,"Conservative intellectuals are saying the Republican Party is doomed because the ideals of conservatism have been inextricably marred by “white nationalism.” Leaders of the conservative movement, they say, must therefore abandon the Republican Party to “cranky old white people” and create a “new conservatism—a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America.”

This argument is wrong on two points. It fails to appreciate (1) how the politics of race is not just about race itself but the changing nature of politics since the 1960s (to see race within the frame of the 1960s and not 2016 is a grave error) and (2) how the Left has effectively used social psychology strategies to label, stigmatize, and delegitimize conservatism, principles of liberty, and traditional American values.

While I agree racism has stained the Republican Party, it’s not in the way conservatives like Avik Roy (whom I greatly respect) and those on the Left who make similar arguments assume. The relationship between race and politics in America has been misunderstood for quite some time, and it continues to be misunderstood, as is evidenced by those who are now beating the “white identity politics” drum and repeating mythologies about the inherent racism of the GOP that leftists started in the 1960s and are now assumed to be fact.

The argument that conservatism has never escaped the “racist” politics of George Wallace and Barry Goldwater, the GOP’s Southern strategy, and Richard Nixon’s “dog-whistle” law-and-order campaign has been effectively answered by conservatives such as Kevin Williamson of National Review, among others. But intellectuals like Roy aren’t buying it.

The problem, they say, is that conservatives have been blind to covert racism within the ranks of the GOP for too long precisely because they have accepted the “wishful thinking” of people like Williamson. As a result, they argue, conservatives have been blindsided by the white supremacy of Donald Trump supporters—and now they’re at risk of losing their party and influence (i.e., moral authority) on the political stage.

The Myth of Covert Racism

To believe the GOP is inherently racist, you have to believe in some degree of covert racism, which is—as described by Paul Sniderman and Thomas Piazza in “The Scar of Race”—“a racism that is disguised and subtle but real all the same.” Because racial prejudice is now socially unacceptable, “People therefore favor disguised, indirect ways to express their bigotry.”

They will not say they are opposed to blacks getting help from government because they are black; they will instead say that blacks are not trying to help themselves, and because they are not making a genuine effort on their own, they do not deserve help from others. The perception that blacks “violate cherished values,” particularly the values of hard work and individual initiative, has spurred a new kind of racism.



This new racism, by expressing itself symbolically as support for traditional American values, can disguise itself. Ironically, then, what is new about the new racism is its expropriation of traditional values as a cloak to hide its true nature, which consists of prejudice and bigotry.

Conservatives who believe this see Trump supporters as a manifestation of this new kind of racism. They argue that any adherence to conservative principles by these “cranky old white people” has been merely a sham to hide their true white supremacism.

I reject this assertion. This “new racism”—when applied across the board to define conservatives and even most Trump supporters—is merely a myth that has been popularized by the Left and debunked by writers like Sniderman and Piazza dating back to the 1990s. This doesn’t mean there aren’t actual racists who are mum about their true feelings—anyone can go to the comment sections on certain websites and see that there are racists among us. They’re there on the Left and Right, but they don’t have a dominant presence in American politics. As these researchers wrote in the 1990s (and it still applies today),

Prejudice has not disappeared, and in particular circumstances and segments of the society it still has a major impact. But race prejudice no longer organizes and dominates the reactions of whites; it no longer leads large numbers of them to oppose public policies to assist blacks [or other minorities] across-the-board. It is . . . simply wrong to suppose that the primary factor driving contemporary arguments over the politics of race is white racism.

Racism is what it has always been, but there is no new, covert racism, and neither conservatism nor the GOP has been cloaking clandestine bigotry. There is, however, a group of people reacting to a “race-conscious” agenda (racial identity politics), which “produces resentment and disaffection not because it assists blacks—substantial numbers of whites are prepared to support a range of policies to see blacks better off—but because it is judged to be unfair.”

Of course, those who argue that the GOP, particularly the Trump wing, is full of racists point to online trolls who attack both conservatives and liberals on various websites. But it would be a mistake to use anonymous social media basement-dwellers as proof of covert racism on the Right (just as it would be a mistake use online trolls to define any group, including those on the Left). We don’t know who these people truly are or even how many of them actually exist. The number could be very small, and they could just as easily be leftists pretending to be racists from the Right. It’s important, therefore, to step back and analyze exactly what the truth is about race in today’s politics.

The Interplay Between Race and Politics

An example of a race-conscious agenda and not racism impacting politics and people’s perceptions of minority groups is affirmative action. Conservatives oppose it, not because they hate black people, but because they think the policy is unfair. “At the deepest level,” Sniderman and Piazza write, “racial politics owes its shape not to beliefs or stereotypes distinctively about blacks but to the broader set of convictions about fairness and fair play that make up the American Creed.”

The “charge of covert racism is destructive,” and we’re seeing the result of it today. “Accusations of racism have been leveled so often and so recklessly that the public discussion of the place of race in American life has become politicized and deadlocked,” Sniderman and Piazza write.

Those accusations increased so dramatically during the Obama presidency that I would also add it has created an emotional backlash that has caused many Americans to develop negative feelings toward minority groups. We are seeing much of this negativity expressed in politics today. It is important to understand this development in the right context. It doesn’t stem from white supremacism, but frustration born of racial identity politics.

While race-conscious agendas can cause whites to have negative feelings toward minority groups, this does not mean whites think they are superior to blacks. They don’t. They simply find the agenda unfair, and associating the minority group with that agenda creates a negative response. Significantly, this negativity does not extend to individuals—a point that supports the premise that there is no covert racism. In fact, Sniderman and Piazza found that most whites have positive feelings toward black individuals and are willing to help those who are in need, but only develop negative feelings when a minority group is put in the context of a race-conscious agenda.

When comparing how conservatives and liberals react to black individuals (not groups), Sniderman and Piazza found that conservatives are willing to meet a black individual’s need even if they don’t approve of a race-conscious policy such as welfare. Surprisingly (or not), they also discovered that in these instances involving individuals, conservatives are actually more willing to help blacks than liberals are.

Whites today are angrily reacting to a race-conscious agenda that has been relentlessly imposed on Americans in every sphere of society.

It is only common sense that is just as true today as it was in the 1990s. Americans have not suddenly become more racist during the past couple of decades—years marked by an expanded race-conscious agenda. More likely, whites today are angrily reacting to a race-conscious agenda that has been relentlessly imposed on Americans in every sphere of society than expressing covert racism.

Polls that show Trump supporters having negative feelings toward minorities reflect this backlash. Unfortunately, too many conservatives have misinterpreted such polling, using those errant interpretations to promote the false narrative that Trump supporters on the whole are racist, when they’re actually reacting to the charge of covert racism and to racial identity politics. (A warning: the longer the charges of racism continue, the greater the backlash, and the more likely to foment real racism. But even in this, it’s not the same as traditional racism, which is rooted in the fundamental belief that whites are superior.)

The other destructive aspect of this charge of covert racism is that it is no longer just directed at groups and individuals. It “has become a handmaiden of a larger argument to call into question the principles of American society. A generation ago, scholars and public commentators saw racism as antithetical to the central values of the American ethos. Now, some researchers see contemporary racism as an expression of these very values.”

Covert racism is alleged to be commonplace, reinforced by quintessentially American values such as self-reliance, individual initiative, the desire to achieve and to excel—above all, the master idea of individualism. Moreover, rather than being concentrated at the margin of American life, racism is now said to have entered the mainstream and to have become, if not ubiquitous, at any rate all too common throughout contemporary American society.

If American values themselves are racist, as new-racism liberals maintain, this begs the question: How can someone hide his racism behind something that is racist? One would have to assume that if covert racism were real, conservatism and traditional American values would have to be inclusive for it to be an effective cover for all the racists who’ve been hiding behind it. According to this logic, covert racism can only be found among groups espousing liberal ideologies.

The Scar of Labeling

Yet conservatism is not racist. Traditional American values are not bigoted, but many people think they are because the Left has effectively labeled them racist. This labeling has been reinforced by the education system, the entertainment industry, and the media.

Conservatism has been effectively negated in a society that is being transformed by an ideology that rejects limited government and personal liberty.

With the Right doing very little to stop the labeling (and a big part of that is because it abandoned education, the arts, and the media to the Left), stigma has taken hold. This has robbed the Right of its moral authority and delegitimized its institutions: the GOP, conservative media and associations, the church, and even the family. Conservatism has been effectively negated in a society that is being transformed by an ideology that rejects limited government and personal liberty.

Zack Beauchamp, who interviewed Roy for the Vox story, says the Republican Party and conservatism are “wedded to and marred by white supremacism.” The Republican Party is in a very real sense scarred by racism, but it’s not actual racism. It’s the Left’s successful labeling of Republicans as racists, which has led to their stigmatization and consequent delegitimization.

Shelby Steele in his book “White Guilt: How blacks and whites together destroyed the promise of the Civil Rights Era” makes the case that the black power movement has sought to delegitimize whites to maintain its moral authority and gain power. This is true for liberalism as a whole in its quest to defeat conservatism, and it has been powerfully effective.

Instead of recognizing what the Left has been doing and fighting it with their own social psychology counter-strategy, conservatives have allowed themselves to be stigmatized. They have unwisely accepted the premise (consciously or unconsciously) that they’re somehow guilty for America’s racist past, and have set out to prove they aren’t racist. They have failed.

This “white guilt” is a “powerful, powerful force,” Steele wrote. “Not because people feel guilty, but because people are stigmatized, and again have to prove the negative all the time, and living forever under threat of being stigmatized.”

‘People are stigmatized, and again have to prove the negative all the time, and living forever under threat of being stigmatized.’

Conservatives have tried to prove they’re not racists by trying to be conciliatory on policy; ignoring the labeling and resorting to high-road intellectual arguments on points of principle; and—at worst—deflecting the label by joining in stigmatizing other Republicans by calling them racists (sexists, homophobes, fascists, etc.—we saw this in response to the religious right, the Tea Party, and now Trump supporters). At every point, they have only dug the racist hole deeper for themselves.

Conservative intellectuals like Roy argue that if only conservatives could set themselves apart by creating a new conservatism via a third party, or somehow actually purging the GOP of those cranky white bigots, then they will save the conservative movement from the blight of Trumpism and its stain of racism. But they’re wrong because they’re stuck with the label of racism no matter what. That’s true of anyone who embraces principles contrary to Leftist ideology.

Everyone Who’s Not a Liberal Is Branded a Racist

Not all opposing factions to liberalism are on the front lines at any given moment, but the minute one opposes a sacred liberal policy or supports a conservative position, the labeling begins and the stigma takes hold. In the end, all lovers of freedom are labeled and eventually delegitimized—libertarians, conservatives, populists, elitists, Republicans, even conservative intellectuals who want to rebrand conservatism with a more inclusive tone to make liberty more palatable to their fellow citizens. Try as they might, they won’t be able to get out the damn spot of racism.

Groupthink has won, as a majority of people now believe the lies of the powerful in-group (liberalism).

That spot remains because they have already been delegitimized. The entire history of America’s founding has been labeled. Individualism has been labeled. Personal responsibility has been labeled. Free markets have been labeled. Christianity has been labeled. Conservatism has been labeled. The United States of America as a nation has been labeled and stigmatized.

That’s why so many people—millennials especially—want to be identified as globalists. They’re ashamed of their disgraceful nation, which has been effectively stereotyped as hateful and bigoted—a belief Barack Obama reinforced when he said “Racism is in our DNA” and reinforced by Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, who recently called for whites to become a “minority” to atone for racism.

Everything conservatives hold dear culturally, politically, and socially has been labeled and stigmatized, not because of actual racism or covert racism, but because leftism has been a raging success. Groupthink has won, as a majority of people now believe the lies of the powerful in-group (liberalism), and shun anything the Left has deemed untouchable, including principles of liberty.

You can try to reason with them. You can put studies and evidence before them. You can try to clothe conservatism in a cool new dress, but it won’t work. As soon as the truth is revealed that your beliefs run counter to liberal ideology, you will be shunned.

Here’s the bitter truth all conservatives must come to grips with: Conservatism has been negated by stigma. People can’t see the truth because they’re afraid of the stigma. There is no beauty in traditional American values; there is only shame. This goes beyond even political correctness, which seeks to control speech. It seeks to assign blame. Conservatives are now the scapegoats of society’s ills. They—the stigmatized ones—are the cause of all our troubles.

Conservatives Are the Modern Scapegoats

Scapegoating is not just about control, it’s about disassociation, even eventual annihilation. One group (the most powerful, the in-group: Democrats and liberals) targets an opposing group (Republicans and conservatives) and blames them for all the problems of society—economic ills, racial conflicts, cultural clashes, even personal struggles and unhappiness.

This is a dangerous progression because hostility will inevitably break out against the out-group that has been maligned.

This is a dangerous progression because hostility will inevitably break out against the out-group that has been maligned. We see some of this with the conflicts between Black Lives Matter and white cops (cops being the out-group). But, in time, it will spread beyond law enforcement. The scapegoating will eventually extend to anyone who opposed the liberal agenda.

Today, the violence is directed against police. Tomorrow, other stigmatized groups will be targeted. The question is, what is all this leading to? What’s the endgame? What happens when you stigmatize a group, negate it, make it powerless, and then blame it for all your struggles? They must be annihilated.

Some might wonder why the Left has done this. Was it even purposeful? Yes. By labeling and delegitimizing their ideological opposition, they retain and grow their power. The Leftist ideology is untenable, so it must not only hide the truth of what it is—a philosophy that strips individuals of their rights and liberty—but also transform the identity of its freedom-loving enemies into one so horrible that no one will want to be associated with it.

That’s how they win. Anything that threatens that power will be stigmatized with the label of racism (or sexism, homophobia, etc.) and devalued to the point of complete impotency. You’re a bigot, not because you actually are a one; you’re a bigot by the sheer force of social labeling.

You’re a bigot, not because you actually are a one; you’re a bigot by the sheer force of social labeling.

No third party will change that reality. No accommodation of policies that are “sensitive to diversity” will make it go away. No form of compassionate conservatism will rip off the label. The values of liberty have been successfully marked Bigoted. The label has been sealed, like a hot brand on our collective skin.

Given this reality, Beauchamp’s original statement needs to be rephrased: “Republicans and conservatives are wedded to and marred by the stigmatized label of white supremacism,” not white supremacism itself. Understanding that difference will hold the key to figuring out how conservatism can be saved—and our country along with it.

The Truth About White Resentment

Beauchamp said, “Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty.” He is in one sense right, especially when talking about voters in 2016. But his interpretation of “white resentment” is wrong.

To fight back, they must unite, overcoming differences to face a common enemy.

There is resentment among white voters, but what we’re seeing is not white resentment; it’s out-group resentment, and not because they’re being infringed upon by minorities. It’s the resentment of a culturally delegitimized group whose beliefs, principles, and values have been stigmatized with the racism label.

There is hope, however. If this web of “manipulated stigma,” as Steele called it, and its impact on politics can be unraveled, if the stigma can be removed and legitimacy and moral authority once again brought to those who have been stereotyped in this way, then to conservatives’ relief, we will find that Americans on the Right do, in fact, care about individual liberty. Will there still be racists in America? Yes, but once we remove the stigmatized identity, we will be able to see the true racists for who they really are (and we’ll discover there aren’t that many of them).

For conservatives to successfully de-stigmatize their identity, they must do something that is not happening right now. They must unite with all stigmatized out-groups. Everyone who opposes the Left has been labeled by the same brand. To fight back, they must unite, overcoming differences to face a common enemy. If they don’t, if they continue to fight among themselves, reinforcing the labels of the Left instead of reversing them, our nation will be lost—and many lives with it.

In Defense Of Campus Segregation,"Most people thought segregation in education was a topic for history books, something that Brown v Board, the Little Rock Nine, and school bussing battles ended decades ago. But increasingly, the idea that students on college campuses should be segregated by race in clubs, classes, discussions on race, and even housing has made a comeback.

Many on the Right see this, not wholly unreasonably, as evidence of how unhinged progressives have become on racial issues. What could be clearer evidence of wrongheadedness than physically separating students based on the color of their skin? While I share conservative consternation at the trend as a whole, it is important to understand the historical and social roots of the Left’s support for racial segregation.

This stuff has been bubbling up for a quarter-century now and slowly getting legs. When I was a senior at Germantown Friends School in 1993, the progressive school’s Multicultural Students Union wanted a space on campus where white people were forbidden. At the time enough of the faculty and administration were from an older generation for whom such an idea was anathema, so it didn’t happen. But it was clear even then that the younger generation of teachers was much more open to the concept. This was directly related to the emerging ideas of privilege theory and valuing differences, for which my school was a laboratory.

We Can’t Talk with White People Around

I don’t find this desire for segregation completely absurd, though I do think the net negatives likely outweigh the positives. Basically, people of color feel they can’t say what they really feel in front of whites, who outnumber and judge them. Never having been in that position, I can’t really argue that this is or isn’t true. But as a white person, I have been in a similar, inverse situation many times.

One of the core concepts of privilege theory is that whites generally spend time surrounded by other whites, especially in upper-middle-class, professional, or higher education environments. For minorities, of course, the opposite is true. While I’m sure many white people would like to pretend this has no impact on what we say, or how we say it, experience tells most of us otherwise.

Most of us have been in rooms of only white people where someone says something we might not say if a black person were in the room. It’s not just jokes or slurs, it’s also issues like affirmative action, police violence, and black communities’ responsibilities. All by themselves, in my experience white people are more open to discussing controversial aspects of these issues without caveats. They need not begin by saying “I’m not talking about all black people, but…”

In many cases people of color are trying to avoid those exact caveats by banning white people from their conversations and social settings. They are trying to avoid apologizing for or explaining statements to people who do not share their experiences. The commonplace ability to do so may well be something whites take for granted.

Also, people of color aren’t the only people on college campuses who segregate themselves to have conversation with like-minded students. Colleges have Jewish groups, pro-life groups, pro-choice groups, women’s groups, Republican and Democrat clubs, and many more. All of these are an attempt by participants to engage in discussion, even debate, in an environment of people who generally either agree with them or share their experiences. In and of itself, there is nothing wrong with this.

But You Can’t Stay Segregated All the Time

Even if such segregated space is afforded to minority communities or other interest groups, obviously at some point a discussion with whites or the broader community becomes necessary for any change to occur. Whether it is black students demanding change or Jewish students resisting divestment from Israel, once the internal discussions are done, it’s time to talk to everyone.

This is exactly where many colleges are failing badly, specifically with regard to black campus groups. The mechanisms by which their segregated deliberations are presented to the communities at large have never been well established. Instead, well-intentioned liberal whites just nod their heads and agree, and conservatives roll their eyes.

Instead of fostering serious conversation between people of goodwill with disparate views, colleges are too often taking sides before that conversation can take place. Time and again students are being punished and even suspended for making statements that run counter to the narrative of progressive race theory. Students are literally prohibited from asking why Black Lives Matter shouldn’t be “All lives matter.” This is an illiberal and dangerous practice.

We arrived at this situation through a permutation of privilege theory over the past decade or so. My critique of privilege theory has never denied that it describes phenomena that exist (at least in the aggregate) in society. Yes, white people, on the whole, have advantages. This should be fairly obvious. But simply stating or confessing that fact does nothing to help the situation.

What began as a description of hidden societal advantages whites enjoy became a prescription for how to mitigate those supposed advantages. The snake oil provided as the cure to privilege was a pernicious belief that speech should be valued, not by its content, but by the level of privilege of the speaker.

This is more than simply amplifying voices that have traditionally been under-heard; it is inoculating them from the criticism of the privileged. While there may be nothing wrong with people of color deliberating on their own to present recommendations to the campus at large, such deliberations must not result in demands—especially when students are punished for even questioning the principles underlying the demands. Sadly, that is exactly what is happening.

Race Doesn’t Give Speech Priority, Though

Back in 1993 when intellectual tempers flared at my school over the Multicultural Student Union’s demand for segregated space, there were assemblies, meetings, and school-wide conversations. It was a healthy approach that embodied the value of classical liberal education. Nobody expressed the belief that anyone’s speech or ideas were of less value because of his or her complexion.

Today, not only on campuses, but also in the arts and in progressive protest culture, weighting speech’s value based on the speaker’s demographic identity is de rigueur. In all of these areas, the precious (and arguably condescending) ways some treat the ideas of those they consider oppressed is doing harm. College debating is being transformed from a competition of ideas into one of emotion. Theater artists are asking that for a full year the nation’s stages perform no plays by straight, white men. Black Lives Matter is currently demanding the abolition of the New York Police Department.

All of these absurd and untenable ideas are a result of considering the speech of the underprivileged untouchable. Even as an opening bargaining position, barring plays by white men or disbanding the police are simply non-starters. Rather, they are fantasies being coddled by academics that prefer pandering to rigor.

What To Do Instead of Pandering

Colleges walk a fine line in dealing with segregated spaces. They should be doing as little as possible about them. Colleges should allow student groups, especially advocacy groups or protests, to be as self-selecting as possible without making broad exclusionary rules. The vast majority of white students have no desire to march into the Black Student Union and demand inclusion. If one does, deal with it individually.

Colleges should allow student groups to be as self-selecting as possible without making broad exclusionary rules.

Housing and courses present different challenges, as colleges administer them more directly. Concerns that accommodations and educational opportunities should be provided without racial bias deserve consideration. But students of color who desire more segregated social or educational opportunities need not be shouted down as racists like those who dare to say “All lives matter.” There is a more tolerant and caring conversation that can be had about these issues than yelling “You’re the real racists.”

That conversation delves deeply into our society’s policies on race over the past century. The result of the civil rights movement was a government that may coerce integration. Private choice regarding freedom of association was abandoned. Rand Paul got into hot water for suggesting the 1964 Civil Rights Act went too far in this regard. But now progressives seem convinced that private choice in association is in fact a right. How we can have “non-white” spaces while still prohibiting “all-white” spaces is not clear.

Privilege theory justifies this double standard for progressives, but nothing in the law codifies this distinction. If we are to adjust course towards a society that embraces the right to associate on a segregated basis even in institutional settings, it may well require a sea change in how whites, Christians, men, and other “privileged” classes are allowed to segregate themselves.

Balanced approaches can accommodate students of color who want their own spaces or opportunities to engage with each other. Segregation is not the problem; it’s a symptom of the problem. The real problem is that the ability of people from different races, cultures, and experiences to share ideas is breaking down. That problem will only be solved when we return to the goal of considering people’s ideas, rather than their identities. Until that happens, regardless of which rooms people occupy, nothing will substantially change.

A Former Cop Takes On ‘The War On Cops’,"When news of the Milwaukee police shooting and the ensuing riots broke earlier this month, it’s safe to say I watched the news more intently than most. I’m a former beat cop who worked the some of the worst neighborhoods in a large Midwestern city. If America’s having an ongoing debate about the police response to inner city crime, well, it’s a subject where I have a lot of first-hand knowledge.

Aside from a few years as cop, I have worked in law enforcement my whole adult life, in one way or another. In the Army, instead of counterintelligence, I was accidentally assigned to a criminal investigation team. (It turns out that in the Army both are abbreviated “CI.”) That investigation involved looking into a new bunch of suspected terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay. I worked with those agents for 10 years as a criminal intelligence analyst. I have been a criminal intelligence analyst since then, and I provide training for criminal investigators today.

I am also a “law and order” kind of guy, and while I agree that government is wasteful and often uses force capriciously, I also believe police need a few armored vehicles and SWAT teams. But I see the abuses and the errors, and I know how painful police mistakes are to the fabric of our nation.

But when I first started to tackle Heather Mac Donald’s latest book, which at 233 pages shouldn’t require a running start, I was too busy rolling my eyes over the title. The War on Cops:How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe seems like hyperbole at a time when nuance and thoughtfulness is desperately needed in the debate over criminal justice reform and allegations of police brutality. I was worried this was going to be the same kind of breathlessness, only from the police point of view. We’ve already had enough mania resulting from Black Lives Matter rhetoric.

Not Hyperbole

The original “Ferguson Effect” was supposed to be attacks on police everywhere, and for months that never happened. Instances of police being killed were actually dropping. But then Baltimore protests over the death of Freddy Grey turned into rioting; then Baton Rouge, Dallas, Minneapolis, and now Milwaukee. I began to realize this wasn’t hyperbole.

Mac Donald’s book starts with Ferguson. The Ferguson incident brought the issues of police racism and brutality to the forefront, and gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. It is, unquestionably, the most divisive environment American law enforcement has seen since the Rodney King incident in California in 1991. The current environment may be worse, as the Rodney King issue was often framed as a California problem. The riots after the police officers were acquitted in the King case were severe, but they were limited to Los Angeles. Now, 25 years later, every city seems to be capable of bursting into flames as soon as a police officer fires a weapon.

We must remember, though, that Ferguson is a massively important milestone in criminal justice reform, but not for the reasons that most people understand. Ferguson was, and continues to be, mostly ignorant myth and deliberate deception. Every credible assessment of the shooting that prompted the rioting found it was justified.

That’s not to say that the incident shouldn’t prompt some soul-searching from law enforcement. The Justice Department review of the Ferguson Police Department found a disturbing trend: not of random executions of unarmed teenagers, but of a systematic fleecing of the people of Ferguson by their own police department. Policing was used by the city’s political leadership as an important source of revenue generation. Unsurprisingly, a reflexively liberal media did not seize upon political corruption and excessive taxation as important contributors to the violence and tensions between police and poor urban communities.

Addressing Reality

This is an important theme that runs though Mac Donald’s book. There are major issues within American policing. We are in desperate need of significant reforms of our criminal justice system. But, as Mac Donalds’s book shows with clear prose, credible data, and statistical analysis, the problems are often not what we see reported in in traditional news media. We are not having a useful debate about policing, because we are talking about the wrong things, and in many cases, we are debating the finer points of completely imaginary environments.

Mac Donald’s data helps cut through the haze of poorly written headlines, social media outrage, and sensationalized cable news coverage. The effect of this, however, is a bit like Alice down the rabbit hole. It is distressing to see that much of what passes for debate and discussion about criminal justice reform, police brutality, and the racism of our criminal justice system is simply not addressing reality.

Once she establishes the wrongness of the initial Michael Brown “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative, andshe demonstrates how the U.S. attorney general and President Obama callously exploited it. This helped set the stage for Baltimore.

Since the publication of The War on Cops, prosecution of the police officers accused of being either directly involved or potentially negligent in the death of Freddy Grey have collapsed. Mac Donald discusses the Baltimore riots at length, and notes especially the contrived, almost scripted nature of how the riots played out.

City leadership’s orders to essentially let the riots go on reinforce this point. It seems that any opportunity to let a city burn is abated by a news media that cheerfully parrots Black Lives Matter talking points, while politicians who have been capitalizing on the plight of African Americans gravely condemn the actions of police they command before the crime scene has even been processed.

The Virulent Strain of Libertarianism

Part two of Mac Donald’s book, subtitled “Handcuffing the Cops,” builds on the theme that much of what we think we understand about policing and the debate about criminal justice reform is based on so few facts that we are missing the point completely. She begins a litany of other criminal justice issues, refutes the conventional (or at least popular) wisdom, and manages to get in solid blows against narratives of both social justice warriors and the more anti-cop libertarians.

Maybe the social justice warriors are a lost cause, but I hope libertarians are at least receptive to some of what Mac Donald has to say. I know most libertarians don’t think of themselves as anti-cop. Some are very thoughtful about the massive power we give flawed people and systems, which I understand and appreciate a great deal.

But libertarians also need to be cautious about encouraging a strain that hates the concept of any authority, law, or police. Libertarians have some of the best ideas about criminal justice reform out there and are right to worry about the excess militarization of police. But at times they seem a bit too ambivalent about the reality that we will always need people with guns on patrol.

As for the Justice Department’s new rules regarding citizen complaints against the police, Mac Donald argues they are mostly a power grab. Complaints and lawsuits about stop and frisk in New York City, Mac Donald argues, have only left people in the poorest, most dangerous neighborhoods more at risk as police are further restricted from being proactive.

A Criminal Disconnect

Part three lays out a series of anecdotes, chiefly designed to refute sociologist and TED-talker Alice Goffman’s book, On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City. Part three is subtitled “The Truth about Crime,” and I expected more data here. This section, while a scathing retort to Goffman’s book, seems out of place for anyone, like myself, who had never heard of Goffman or her book. Goffman, Mac Donald claims, is endemic of a white, liberal class of sociologists who place blame for crime entirely on police and the courts.

I have not read Goffman’s book, so I cannot evaluate the strength or weakness of her research or arguments. It is worth noting that Goffman has been accused of getting so close to the subjects of her study in criminal justice that, among other things, she may have driven the getaway car in a murder plot.

I can certainly vouch for a serious disconnect between the realities of crime and the world of some criminologists and sociologists. There is a trend of empathetic, well-meaning people who can’t seem to remember the pain, danger, and fear criminals cause once they have met some of those criminals and found out criminals have experienced pain, danger, and fear themselves. They mistake empathy for tolerance, and slide into weakness.

There is a simple antidote for this: Talk to victims and survivors of crime. Since the vast majority of victims never turn to violence, theft, or drugs, I don’t find pain and hardship quite the excuse that many sympathizers with criminals do.

The Marijuana Myth

Part four focuses on prisons, and some of the misconceptions about “mass incarceration” and the perceived benefits of decriminalization of some, or all, illegal drugs. I found this section very interesting, as I do not normally read or think much about the penal system. The biggest revelation in this section, which is hard to refute thanks to the data, is the fantasy that there are significant numbers of people in jail simply because of drug possession, especially marijuana possession.

We must not believe our prisons will empty and the criminal underclass will be liberated from the tyranny of the police if we just decriminalize marijuana.

In reality, most people in prison are there for violence. Certainly, some of that violence is associated with drug trafficking, which some will say is an argument for de-criminalization. Some of that violence is committed while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, which some will say is an argument for treatment-based responses. But we must not believe our prisons will empty and the criminal underclass will be liberated from the tyranny of the police if we just decriminalize marijuana.

Mac Donald notes clearly this would have a minor, possibly negligible impact on our prisons. We can academically debate the merits of decriminalization of marijuana. I believe we should be experimenting with decriminalization and legalization, and I am happy to see various programs being tried. In my experience in law enforcement, I never had to fight a guy who had been smoking marijuana, but I had to fight a lot of people who had been drinking. Maybe that’s not a scientific survey, but I’m open to the argument that marijuana could be part of an orderly society.

That being said, I would like to send an additional 100,000 cops into the streets to smash heroin, meth, and cocaine dealers. If that didn’t work, I’d send another 100,000. I don’t have any sympathy or mercy for dealing hard drugs.

The Cycle Repeats Itself

If nothing else, Mac Donald’s book is a good reminder that we need more data in our debates about criminal justice reform. We need more evidence, and more rational thought. Black Lives Matter activists scream that young, black men are being executed in the streets, but this just is not true. This irrationality is getting worse, not better, and time is making this hysteria more prevalent, not less.

These demonstrably false impressions feed fear and irrational actions that put people in danger.

The recent rioting in Milwaukee has turned this into a farce after a black police officer killed an armed black man. It seems no pretense or distortion is needed to justify a riot anymore. There’s no need to even concoct the fantasy of Mike Brown surrendering and then being executed for no reason by a racist white cop.

The tragedy is that these demonstrably false impressions feed fear and irrational actions that put people in danger. Black Americans have been told that police execute them for no reason, so of course they run from and fight with police. Running and fighting only increases the chances for violence, and the cycle repeats itself.

The unavoidable reality is this: The police are the only part of the government that is authorized to kill Americans on the spot, and make the decision to kill in an instant. This is not true of Special Forces, the CIA, the NSA, NASA, Congress, the president, the IRS, the Department of the Interior, Exterior, or somewhere in between.

They are also the people called to respond to every single problem in poor, mostly minority communities. Noise complaint? Cops. Kids hanging out on the corner? Cops. Someone is hungry or drunk? Cops. Your kids won’t obey you? Cops. Your cousin is suicidal? Cops. Your neighbor is schizophrenic? Cops. Your landlord is a jerk? Cops. After all the rhetoric and nonsense, poor, urban neighborhoods call for police services more than anywhere else.

I don’t know if this is evidence that the Black Lives Matter movement is totally disconnected from normal urban culture, or if this is evidence of an astounding lack of self-awareness. Remember that the defining quality of the role of police, versus all other social and governmental support, is that they are expected to be obeyed or they can, will, and often are required to use force. Police are government power in its plainest form.

This is a concept called “The law of the instrument,” coined by Abraham Maslow to describe the over-reliance on familiar tools. “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” Maslow said. For our social decline in the inner city, all we have is police, and we are amazed that everyone has started to look like a criminal to them.

Colin Kaepernick’s Stunt Exploits Black People’s Pain,"During a preseason game, San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem, citing “black oppression in America.” Kaepernick is a biracial NFL quarterback worth an estimated $22 million, yet he feels America has oppressed him. He’s sent out a statement preemptively bracing for the “backlash” to his heroic gesture. We should all be so oppressed.

Kaepernick is just the latest in a string of black multi-millionaires who have decided that the same America that has made them wealthy beyond their wildest dreams is now oppressing them and other blacks. Beyoncé Knowles, Jay Z, Russell Simmons, all those who tout the mantra of “Black Lives Matter” when it’s economically or publicly convenient for them may need to rethink their tactics. Their behavior has the exact opposite of its intended effect nearly every time.

Instead of talking about the real problems in the black community we end up talking about the celebrities’ upcoming contracts or projects. So maybe the plan works out perfectly for that black celebrity, just not for the blacks living below poverty level buying their music, jerseys, and swag.

Free advice for Kaepernick and his celebrity-lecturing friends: America has been good to you. Show some grace for the blessings you’ve been given. Give back to your community in more than just “protests” for personal gain. Write some checks, get involved. Start a charity. Use your platform to enact real change for those less fortunate than you. Your colleagues do it all the time without the cameras running.

Don’t Hate What Made You Great

Beyoncé made headlines earlier this year with her Super Bowl performance highlighting her upcoming “Formation” tour. The tone, language, and costumes were an ode to the Black Panthers movement, or so some thought. Beyoncé fueled the speculation to the tune of millions of dollars as she moved from that free publicity to that she generated with her “Lemonade” hour-long promotional video. “Lemonade” then consumed the news cycle long enough to pay off the debt incurred by her husband’s flailing streaming company.

Since “Lemonade” was released, we’ve heard more about “Becky With The Good Hair” than we have about Black Lives Matter from the BeyHive. Knowles has been working since she was old enough to sing. Her dedication to performing brought her from black middle class to one of the wealthiest women on the planet. That is a fantastic American success story. Why isn’t it enough?

Recently, Russell Simmons spoke out about the oppression of blacks in the entertainment industry. Billionaire media mogul Simmons was heralded for his brave stance against oppression. Meanwhile in the real world, Simmons is a perfect example of American exceptionalism. His role in music history is unquestioned, as his production gave rise to what we now know as hip-hop.

Simmons co-created one of the largest most successful labels, Def Jam Records, which launched hundreds of careers. Def Jam became one of the first “brands” in the black community. Simmons expanded his brand beyond music to comedy, clothing, and lifestyle products. He even married a beautiful teenage supermodel. He is literally living the American dream. Instead of talking about that and encouraging other young blacks to work as hard as he did, “Uncle Rush” wants praise for his passion for the struggle as he sips Moet on his oceanside veranda and tweets. This makes no sense.

Stop Exploiting Violence and Start Addressing It

Speaking of things that don’t make sense, Quentin Tarantino. Here is a dorky white guy who loves violent, sexual comic books and is now worth millions for bringing them to life. His films include more use of the N-word than any other movies I’ve watched in three decades, including those about actual gangs and the civil war. Tarantino is every nerdy white guy’s id come to life, and he is beloved for it. He likes to use words that make people uncomfortable. Black actors line up to be involved in his films.

It was no surprise that people applauded him for showing up at a Black Lives Matter protest. What was shocking was that no one pointed out the glaring hypocrisy—not even actual black people. Perhaps those in black communities are just thrilled that someone, anyone is paying attention to them, even if it’s this crazy white dude who uses the N-word all the time. Other than exploiting the black community, however, what has Tarantino done for them?

Dwyane Wade, the NBA superstar currently with the Chicago Bulls, has been vocal in supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Yet he has unfortunately lost a cousin to what appears to be gang violence in Chicago. Our hearts go out the family and friends, and we hope this makes Wade speak out about violence within the black community as well. It’s a complicated time to be alive.

Wade and his wife, actress Gabrielle Union, have outspokenly supported the families of the famous Black Lives Matter martyrs. Both seem genuinely interested in helping their communities, so perhaps this will redirect their energies to something a little closer to home. Neither would commit the crimes or violence being perpetrated in the black communities; they shouldn’t have to defend it, either.

Some black celebrities would obviously like to use their fame to draw attention to black communities in crisis, yet they don’t get as much press as those who prefer to lecture us. These lectures grow tiresome, and eventually America will tune out. The movement will fade into oblivion as will the spotlight. The celebrities will go on to their next project, and the black community will continue to deteriorate. There are real problems within the black community, and real leaders are needed, not just people seeking media coverage.

Why Is White Pride Creepy When Black Pride Isn’t?,"Is it wrong to take pride in being white? This is not meant as a trick question, but it might be a little tricky. Americans generally associate white pride with slavery, segregation, and skinheads. For most of us those are negative associations so, yes, we think it’s creepy to be proud that you’re white.

There’s a complication, though. If whites can’t take pride in our ethnicity, is it okay for blacks or Hispanics to have ethnic pride? Our society looks on that kind of boosterism with a much more tolerant eye. What’s the difference? Have we so succumbed to the siren song of privilege theory that white people are the only ones left who are not allowed to feel good about ourselves?

That Damned ‘Invisible Backpack’

As David Marcus explained in this insightful essay, privilege theory is indeed a real problem. It helped re-awaken tribal loyalties that would have been better left shifting in their shallow graves. Everyone is better off when whites don’t think too much about their whiteness. It should be normal without being normative, and regular without being right. It’s having a one-story house. It’s writing in black pen. It’s Times New Roman.

Liberals, sadly, were not prepared to let whiteness remain Times New Roman. They poked and they prodded, and eventually got the resentful backlash they were provoking. Privilege theory has done real damage, and white liberals should be assessing their mistakes. Nevertheless, it’s hard to believe that privilege theory is the only culprit.

When higher allegiances break down, lower ones become more prominent. Everyone wants to fit in somewhere, and that involves finding reasons to align yourself with this group of people, instead of that other one. Group allegiances are not necessarily an excuse for hatred or bigotry (although they can give rise to those evils). They’re about belonging somewhere, and having people you can turn to when the road gets rocky. People need that.

It’s no secret that Trumpism and the alt-right have found their strongest footholds in places where social and economic breakdown are the worst. Family structures break down, church communities dwindle, the economy sags, and ethno-nationalism becomes more appealing.

Proud to Be a (White) American?

Is Trumpism racist? It’s been a contentious question of late. While it’s perfectly evident that Trump does have racist supporters (which he is suspiciously reluctant to condemn), many contend that Trumpism is itself not racist, but merely a justified reaction to the Left’s racial patronage. All Trump’s supporters really want is a properly colorblind society.

It’s not a terribly convincing argument because, among other reasons, Trumpism so obviously represents a desperate cry for group recognition and a demand for group patronage. How has the market been good for us? Bring back our jobs. Even the “America first” motto is clearly focused on a particular vision of America that only a minority of its citizens seem to share.

We may be reaching the point where we need to define more carefully what “racism” really means. To that end, the rhetoric of the alt-right may perhaps be worth examining as an indicator of what some of our “white boosters” are thinking nowadays. There’s admittedly some distance between ordinary Trump supporters and alt-right quasi-intellectuals, but the latter have clearly attracted a non-trivial following in the Trump camp. Alt-rightism shouldn’t be lazily dismissed as a totally detached, insane fringe. It has hit a chord with many ordinary Americans, thriving on the mainstream’s predictable preference for shunning its arguments instead of answering them.

Many alt-right thinkers are willing to argue openly that race matters, that genetics play a non-trivial role in the progression of cultures, and that race is naturally a deep component of personal identity. These arguments can get a lot of oxygen in a world already obsessed with race. Liberals have had their identity politics parties and now alt-righters want theirs, which they expect will be truly amazing because they are in possession of western culture, the best cultural heritage there is.

Conquering Western Civilization

Hear them roar! Alt-righters love to talk about how smart and strong and savvy they are. (Fun game: count the number of times this article brags about those smarty-pants alt-righters and their incredible intellectual heft.) They usually get away with it because they surround themselves with amateurs, who are unprepared for their juvenile jibes. After Steve King’s offensive implication that white people own Western civilization, Chris Hayes predictably responded with an idiotic remark about Western civilization giving us Hitler.

Try again, Hayes. Don’t validate the white supremacist’s claim to own Homer, Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Boetheus, Bonaventure, Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Milton, Da Vinci, Tolstoy, Columbus, Newton, our Founding Fathers and alright, yes, possibly Hitler. Instead, ask him to justify his emphasis on whiteness as a cornerstone of western thought.

Undoubtedly, white men feature prominently among the heroes and visionaries of the West, and it’s reasonable to conclude on those grounds that white men can’t just be natural degenerates, as some liberals seem to suppose. Still, the greatness of the Western tradition doesn’t lie in its whiteness and maleness. It lies in its breadth, adaptability, and universality.

Terence, great playwright of the Roman Republic, told us “I am a man; nothing human is alien from me.” St. Paul told us that in Christ, “There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female.” The great thinkers of the high Middle Ages were intensely focused on the human condition, not the Italian or French or male condition. No student of the Western canon ever pauses in the middle of “City of God” to ask, “Wasn’t St. Monica born in Northern Africa? Why are we reading this Augustine clown?”

In short, the Western ethos at its best is profoundly un-tribal. To claim this rich tradition specifically for whites, therefore, is to muddy it and betray its core tenets. American whites can absolutely take pride in their Western heritage. They came from the old world and settled this immense, wild place, extending the great traditions of their forefathers to a whole new land. But if we’re going to take pride in our Western heritage, we should understand that legacy calls for transcending xenophobic ethno-nationalism. We shouldn’t need that, and we have something much better.

The downside of the glorious Western tradition, though, is that its perversion can be ugly, raising dreams of totalitarian domination. (Now a Hitler reference would be acceptable.) Especially here in America, a young nation founded by old-world immigrants with classically liberal commitments, there just isn’t a healthy or grounded way to take pride in whiteness per se.

Slouching Towards Bethlehem

Let’s return to the title question. Why is white pride creepy when black pride isn’t? Shouldn’t we have to choose between a universal ethic of colorblindness, and one that endorses ethnic tribalism at least to some degree?

It turns out that white pride really is categorically different. To understand why, though, we have to think carefully about traditions and their role in lives and cultures. Melanin levels are not in themselves a significant indicator of human character or worth, and whites are not morally inferior (or superior) to any other ethnic group. Nevertheless, cultures do matter, and it could be that “white culture” just isn’t a healthy or organic phenomenon in the way that black culture is or at least can be.

Ethnic pride really isn’t a necessary feature of a healthy psychology, but it can be acceptable when attached to a meaningful tradition that also imposes expectations and requirements. Most of us have probably known kids from Asian backgrounds whose elders are constantly reminding them that their behavior and work ethic will reflect back on their family and clan. That ethos definitely seems to contain an element of ethnic pride. However, it’s incorporated into a tradition and community ethos in such a way as to be a mostly positive influence.

Black pride is connected to a minority subculture that developed in response to intense historical oppression. For most of American history, the non-integration of blacks into mainstream culture was imposed from the outside, so taking offense over the existence of a distinct black subculture would hardly be reasonable. (Of course it doesn’t follow that this culture should be impervious to critique.) It’s an authentic tradition that incorporated an ethnic element for extremely understandable historical reasons. Something similar could be said of most Native American traditions.

Blacks and Native Americans, as the most obviously oppressed ethnic groups in our nation’s history, have also been the most averse to mainstream integration. Other ethnic groups tend to be absorbed more organically into mainstream American culture with the second, third, and fourth generations. They may retain a certain cultural distinctiveness in their names, diets, or cultural festivals, but insofar as they do stand apart, these groups generally adhere to traditions that are substantive enough to keep megalomaniacal urges in check. Ethnic pride isn’t just an entitlement; it’s also an expectation.

Will the Real Cuckservatives Please Stand Up?

White pride really doesn’t have an honorable tradition to call its own. Its claims on Western culture are tenuous, and none of the other reference points (segregation and skinheads) are particularly admirable. So it really does seem reasonable to say that whiteness, although in no way shameful, is not per se a healthy source of pride.

Viewing the matter in this light, it’s somewhat unsurprising that our alt-right partisans actually seem to pride themselves on being brainy rebels and devil-may-care pranksters. They’re not traditionalists in any normal sense, because they stand outside the circle of ordinary civil discourse, and even take joy in the fact. They’re what happens when traditionalism meets expressive individualism, in a world with too many resentful loners and not enough churches. They brilliantly combine the worst of cosmopolitanism (its rootlessness) with the worst of provincialism (its narrow-minded tribalism).

Just as much as the progressives they loathe, alt-righters are the bad fruit of a collapsing culture, taking pride in whiteness because they’re too alienated from more-substantive cultural institutions (family, church, community) to find a more fitting link to their Western forbears. Will the real cuckservatives please stand up? I don’t think it’s the Paul Ryans of the world who are disgracing the legacy of the West.

As every literate conservative has now realized, the collapse of Middle America is one of the great challenges that faces our society in the present moment. We need to rebuild our families and our cultural institutions so people of all backgrounds can find meaningful community and personal identity. White pride is a bad starting point, however. Let’s not sell our Western heritage for a mess of identity-politics pottage.

7 Reasons This Black Man Supports Donald Trump,"I’m black and I’m proudly supporting Donald Trump for president of the United States. I’m not only supporting Trump this November, but also voted for Trump in the Republican primary this past March.

Some may feel I’m playing the race card by declaring my ethnicity. But I only do so because I’m in a demographic that’s supposed to be anti-Trump: a (late) millennial black male with graduate-level education. I’ve read Trump’s book “Crippled America,” watched several rallies online, and read his policy positions. I’ve investigated the claims of racism, sexism, xenophobia, mocking a disabled reporter, and being a business failure—all of which I’ve found to be patently false.

I can explore those accusations in detail on another day. What you need to know is I’ve done my research. Here it is.

1. Freedom of Choice

Unlike most Americans, 72 percent of whom supported the Iraq War when it started, I was against that war from the beginning. I was disappointed to see the Republican Party jump headfirst into two major wars at the turn of the twenty-first century, embrace massively increased government spending, and embrace the erosion of civil liberties in the name of allegedly increased security.

That’s why it was a breath of fresh air watching Trump’s rallies and realizing his beliefs mirror my own: although he’s in the Republican Party, he’s not part of the big government, pro-war faction that has taken over in recent decades. Like me, and unlike Hillary Clinton, he was against the Iraq War shortly after it started and has been consistent on that in the 13 years since then, contrary to claims otherwise.

I almost had an emotional moment watching him blast the Iraq War to pieces in South Carolina. Wow! That’s a bold and risky thing for a Republican candidate to do, and it shows courage. More broadly, because Trump hasn’t had strong allegiances to either party in the past, he has the freedom to decide policies without regard to the party line. As such, he’s crafted a beautiful, nonpartisan policy plank to address the key issues facing our nation in the coming decades: an end to illegal immigration, aggressive job creation through better trade policy and tax policy, a stop to endless wars, and dismantling political correctness. Now that’s exciting!

Almost every major problem the United States is facing can be attributed to one of those four issues. Trump is the first major candidate to buck the bipartisan consensus on these and take a pro-America position. This is because he has the freedom to choose the best policies without bowing to partisanship or bad tradition.

2. He’s Better for Black People

Black people are in crisis. Families are completely broken, with 70 percent of kids born to single mothers. There’s an astronomical crime rate, extremely poor school performance, and the highest unemployment rate of any racial group. There’s a thug culture that elevates violence, misogyny, and accepting incarceration as inevitable. Studies even show black kids’ popularity decreases as their GPA increases, which means that parts of the culture sadly value being dumb.

Yet against all this, black folks are being coddled with a simplistic, cowardly message that blames racism and white privilege as the source of all these problems, and sees more government programs as the solution. But the War on Poverty and the $22 trillion spent on it have been a stunning failure at raising the conditions of black people. I’ve personally observed abuse of the welfare system.

Trump will not go for this. He will not blame police for the problem of black crime, he will not blame racism for the dramatic problem of black underachievement, and he will stop illegal immigration, which will increase wages and job opportunities for all unskilled American workers, especially black folks.

So while Hillary says, “Let’s fix white people to solve black problems,” Trump says “Let’s fix black people to solve black problems.” If you love someone, you don’t blame their issues on someone else. You help them look in the mirror. Trump’s philosophy is the right one to start the hard process of healing the black community. That’s why he’s better for black people.

3. Courage

Trump is a white version of a black preacher. No, he’s not talking about spiritual matters. But he has the persona, charisma, confidence, and focused message to uplift and captivate, just like a good preacher. I try to watch Trump rallies online when I can, and after every one, I feel like political correctness has been smashed, the space for honest conversation has been expanded, and those of us who are not PC have been empowered, all a little bit more than when we started.

Indeed, because of Trump, entire realms of conversation that were previously off-limits or not often discussed due to fear of the PC police are now on the table. I can talk about the devastating depth of black crime and the failure of government solutions to solve the problem. I can talk about the negative impact of illegal immigration, especially on poor Americans. I can talk about tremendous media bias in favor of the Democrats, which this election cycle is unmasking like never before, and about the degree to which both parties have been in cahoots on trade and endless war.

Regular Americans like me can talk about these issues more boldly because Trump led the way for us. This is how leaders transmit courage.

4. Financial Independence

I’m concerned about the influence of money in politics. Yet Trump, already being independently wealthy, does not need to take money from the big donors who have until now exercised strong control over both parties. Since they’re not giving him money, they cannot dictate his positions. He is free to decide his positions based on the needs of the nation, not what’s best for mega-donors and special interests. This is also known as independence, one of the core American virtues.

I’ve donated to the Trump campaign more than I’ve given to any other presidential candidate before (which admittedly is not a huge amount), because when I give to Trump I know I’m not being drowned out by billionaires. It seems many agree; Trump raised the bulk of his money in July from small donors like me, while Clinton, by contrast, is heavily backed by big-money Super PACs—mega-donors she’ll listen to before she obeys those pesky regular Americans (like me).

5. Donald Trump Likes My Neighborhood

After having lived on the east coast, the west coast, and in Tokyo, my favorite place of all is the town I grew up in and now live in. It’s a very American Midwestern town that’s not too big and not too small, where people know each other more than on the coasts, housing prices are cheaper, and people of different races get along.

Because I love my town, I don’t want it to become like Mexico or Somalia, and I say that with the greatest respect to the poor people in those countries. I don’t want to go to our mall that I grew up going to as a kid only to face regular terrorist attacks like what is happening in Germany after accepting of 1 million “refugees” from the Middle East. In fact, a recent study found that half of all Germans feel like strangers in their own country! I would rather not feel that way in my own city.

Further, did you know that from 2007 to 2014, more people were killed in the Mexican drug wars than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined? That’s a stunning 160,000 souls dead in Mexico. My heart breaks for the poor people of that country. But unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, the Mexican war zone is right next door to us, yet stunningly the border with Mexico is unprotected, allowing drugs, drug cartel members, and criminals to enter our communities freely.

Border Patrol agent Chris Cabrera indicates, “at best we apprehend 35-40% of the illegal immigrants attempting to cross. This number is even lower for drug smugglers who are much more adept at eluding capture.” This is totally unacceptable. I don’t want the Mexican drug wars to come to our town the way they have come to Southern California and the border states. Trump is the only candidate who really understands the heart of people like me who care about how this issue will affect our towns.

Democrats are extremely hostile to these kinds of concerns because uncontrolled illegal immigration will bring in millions of new Democratic voters, and Republicans haven’t taken up the issue because they don’t want to be seen as racist and or their supply of cheap labor interrupted. All this means Trump is the only man left standing who wants to protect my neighborhood from similar fates.

He’ll do this in two ways: By issuing a temporary moratorium on immigration from countries with a history of supporting terrorism, and by building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, along with greatly strengthening border enforcement, to stop illegal immigration. The combination of these policies could prevent American communities like mine from becoming like Germanystan or Juarez, Mexico (until recently the murder capital of the world). I support Trump because he cares about protecting my neighborhood.

6. Record of Execution

As a former software engineer, I understand that building actual products that have to work with quality and precision is harder than simply delivering rhetoric. Trump gets this. He has a track record of execution. Building a gigantic skyscraper requires bringing various parties to the table for intense negotiations and making sure all parties’ needs are met. It requires meeting deadlines, strict safety standards, and budgets, and building a reputation that attracts clients, partners, and investors for future projects.

These megastructures must function properly for all clients, whether Republican or Democrat, black or white. If the power grid in a skyscraper doesn’t work, you can’t blame racism or a vast right-wing conspiracy. You just have to make it work, no excuses. This is in contrast to a number of career politicians of both parties, of whom many have actually produced nothing of tangible value.

7. Protecting the Constitution

Last but not least, at least two Supreme Court picks may need filling during the coming years, and Trump would nominate justices who would interpret our Constitution correctly and faithfully. Trump has made public a list of justices he would nominate and it’s impressive. I believe Clinton, by contrast, would nominate judges that would use the court as a platform for ideological activism, eroding core aspects of our American culture that I treasure, such as the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and others. There’s no way I can support that.

As For Hillary Clinton

Although I believe Trump would make a better president than Clinton, my support for Trump is not driven by distaste or hatred of Clinton. It’s driven by my belief that Trump is energizing, uplifting, and speaks to the issues I care about. That’s why I’ve avoided bashing Hillary, even though she has much that can legitimately be criticized. That being said, a word bears mentioning regarding a deal-breaking disqualifier for Clinton

The evidence we have indicates the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative are a billion-dollar pay-for-play criminal influence-peddling and racketeering operation.

The evidence we have indicates the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative are a billion-dollar pay-for-play criminal influence-peddling and racketeering operation of a complexity, scale, and brazenness that would make Al Capone blush. They took money from foreign entities and gave out U.S. government favors in return, with Hillary using her (illegal) private email server at home—outside of government security screening—to operate the scheme. I suspect this is what the 33,000 deleted emails will reveal.

That the founders of this scheme are still walking free is a miracle rivaling the raising of Lazarus from the dead, and would be the story of the century if the mainstream media had any sense of investigative spirit and nonpartisan objectivity left. Since I’ve lived in Japan—a country run by organized crime—I don’t want my beloved country to meet the same fate. I thus could never entrust our presidency to the namesake of the Clinton foundations. (For this same reason, even if I hated Trump I could never stay home on election day or vote third party, because purely from a mathematical perspective, those actions help Clinton to gain a plurality of the vote.)

Although I believe accusations of racism and other isms against Trump are totally without merit, some parts of Trump’s platform give me a little concern. Those include his position on the minimum wage, the depth of his newfound commitment to the pro-life position, and his statements on attacking ISIS that indicate he could possibly repeat the futile warmongering of the early 2000s. But my response to those legitimate concerns, and why I believe they are not deal breakers, is for another article.

Ultimately, despite fighting a three-front war against the Democrats, Never Trump Republicans, and the mainstream media, all of whom in their hatred of Trump are perfectly aligned for what has to be the first time in history, our resolve only is strengthened by the challenge. We’re gonna win, we’re gonna win big, and it’s gonna be yuge. Believe me.

"To Help Blacks, Colin Kaepernick Needs To Put Up Or Shut Up","Much has been made recently of Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for our national anthem to protest what he sees as the oppression of black people. It now appears Kaepernick’s actions have influenced other players, with additional NFL athletes refusing to stand at attention for the anthem, and some even raising the black power fist in protest.

As a black person who is a football fan, I state plainly: this is stupid. The simple reason is the flag, our anthem, and the best parts of America that it represents are not the cause of black people’s problems.

Thus instead of insulting our nation and Americans who actually like what our flag stands for, these NFL athletes should use their money and fame to work towards actual solutions to the black issues they purport to care about. Here are four ways they can do so.

1. Rebuild the Family

The black family is in complete disarray. More than 70 percent of black children are born to single mothers. The studies show that children born to single mothers have worse outcomes in many significant areas compared to those born into stable, two-parent homes. That means our protesting athletes really need to address this problem.

How? They should start advocacy groups and research centers that press state and federal governments to eliminate welfare, housing subsidies, and other government handout programs that destroy incentives to work and eliminate the role of the black father as provider, thus decimating the black family and communities. While some conservative groups already do this, it would be much more powerful and meaningful coming from black NFL players.

Additionally, they should create awards, financial and job incentives, training programs, and counseling and mentorship centers for black men and women who choose to marry and raise their children the right way as married couples. Why not even start an ad or social media campaign around something like “Marriage is cool” or “Marriage pays,” featuring black celebrities who are happily married and showing the various health, economic, and sexual benefits of marriage?

2. Rebuild American Education

It is obvious that public schools in poor, black communities are an abysmal failure, with studies showing the blacker the school, the worse the performance. Protesting athletes should thus use their wealth to start excellent private schools in the poorest black neighborhoods, and then invest in research and collaboration to turn the schools into a national movement.

Studies also show that black kids become less popular as their GPA increases. This unfortunate phenomenon is known as “acting white.” Why can’t protesting athletes be or highlight role models who did well in school, and promote academic achievement? How about national awards and prizes for kids who do excellently in school?

Further, because many children in poor, black areas weren’t raised in loving, intact homes, many have serious problems with work ethic, discipline, attitude, and people skills. That means the educational projects athletes implement will have to include training in the type of soft skills that many poor black kids never got at home and that are not typically taught in schools—such as how to be on time, dress professionally, and speak proper English. All this may seem like a tall order, but given that Kaepernick has a $114 million contract, he certainly has the resources to get started.

3. Rebuild American Jobs

With their combined hundreds of millions of dollars, the protesting NFL players could start a venture capital investment fund that finances innovative entrepreneurs who’ll create jobs in poor, black communities. They could even partner with established venture capital firms for guidance, mentorship, and additional funding.

They could work with Walmart, which has announced a plan to spend $250 billion bringing jobs back to the United States, to develop programs to steer some of the incoming manufacturing to poor black areas, and then train the people in those areas to succeed in these new work opportunities. There are lots of possibilities here with as much money as the protesting NFL men have. It’s time for them to use their fame and fortunes to start serious initiatives to bring jobs to poor black areas.

4. Stop the Killing in Black Communities

Kaepernick says he has a problem with police brutality. But the facts clearly show that black brutality is a much bigger problem than police brutality: approximately 6,000 black people are murdered by other black people ever year, compared to just 300 killed by the police, and even fewer than that killed by white police officers.

Black crime is astronomical. The rate at which black people commit murders is a whopping eight times that of whites—34.4 per 100,000 versus 4.5 per 100,000. Despite being just over one-tenth of the population, black people also commit more than half of all carjackings. Just wrap your head around this reality. We absolutely must end black crime. It kills more Americans than terrorism, by a large margin.

Our protesting athletes should thus leverage their money and fame to end violence in black communities. Some ways they can accomplish this are: buying up drug houses and shutting them down; building up neighborhood security patrols in the most dangerous black neighborhoods, which has been proven to be a low-cost way of reducing crime in several studies; and by raising nationwide awareness of black crime in order to call for help and solutions.

I hope Kaepernick and friends will get to work ASAP on what I’ve outlined here, for the sake of their needy fellow Americans. And stand up for the anthem, for Pete’s sake!

If Black Lives Matter Planned Parenthood Should Stop Killing Them,"Nothing could be more hypocritical than this tweet by Planned Parenthood in support of Black Lives Matter in Charlotte, North Carolina:

Planned Parenthood is one of the greatest perpetrators of violence against African Americans in this country. It’s founded on racism, perpetuates racism, and kills more than 850 African Americans every day.

Black people make up about 13 percent of the population, yet comprise 37 percent of all abortions. Black women are 4.8 times more likely to have an abortion than white women are. Approximately 78 percent of Planned Parenthood’s clinics are in minority communities, and black babies are three times more likely to be killed from an abortion than white babies.

This shouldn’t come as a surprise since Planned Parenthood’s founder Margaret Sanger was an actual racist who wrote, “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.” Abortion was a tool to bring about a white supremacist agenda.

In an undercover investigation, Live Action found this racist agenda is alive and well at Planned Parenthood today.

Live Action investigated the financial dealings of Planned Parenthood and made some shocking discoveries about the clinic-owning ‘nonprofit.’ We obtained the information by having an actor call clinics across the country and pose as a donor. The actor communicated to the Planned Parenthood representative a very racist agenda—the one that Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood’s founder, had envisioned. He then asked to donate money specifically for the abortions of African-American babies in order to ‘lower the number of blacks in America.’ Despite his bigoted requests, no Planned Parenthood employee (or director of development, in one case) declined the tainted money. Some even asked to speak with other employees to get permission. In the first day of calling seven clinics, not a single Planned Parenthood representative expressed outrage or concern at the racism behind donations specifically ‘to reduce the number of blacks.’ In fact, some even went as far as agreeing with the anti-black agenda.

Clearly, if anyone should “stop killing black people” it’s Planned Parenthood. The real violence against minorities in America isn’t on the streets of Charlotte or any other city, it’s in the clinics of Planned Parenthood.

As Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., writes, “The killing tools of abortionists are as aimed at blacks today as the fire hoses of segregationists 50 years ago. Taking more African American lives than gun violence, heart disease, cancer, and AIDS combined, abortion seems to have targeted blacks in a way that can only make remaining Ku Klux Klan members smile.”

“The connection between abortion and racism is not surprising,” she continues. “Both are based on the lie that certain people are somehow not fully human. Like racism, abortion allows us to treat people inhumanely if it makes our lives easier. And like racism, abortion provides a sense of justification for actions we know in our hearts are wrong.”

"Question The Stories You Tell Yourself About Terrorism, Shootings","This last week I attended a panel discussion on Islamophobia and my Facebook friends reacted to the news that in North Carolina a black police officer had shot a black man who may have been armed. These might seem unrelated, but they were not. These experiences were really about the exact same thing: the human capacity to form narratives and hold on to them regardless of the evidence.

Let’s start with the panel. Three professors took turns speaking, concluding the narrative many Americans have developed about Arabs and Islam is not accurate. Many people fear Arabs because they’re Muslim. But there are in fact a lot of Christian, Sikh, and even agnostic Arabs.

Many people also often fear Muslims because of all the terrorist attacks. However, you are much more likely to be killed by lightning than by an Islamic extremist. According to one of the lecturers, Islamic extremism has only killed 109 Americans since September 11, 2001. That might sound like a lot, and every life is precious, but if you run the numbers, there is an infinitesimally small chance that you’ll be one of them. Many more people die falling out of bed: that kills 737 Americans annually.

This panel pointed out that often the narratives we develop are inaccurate, and need to be questioned. If we don’t question them, bad things happen—in this case, Islamophobia. Islamophobia has led to violence against Arabs, hate killings, and alienating many American citizens. Although many people struggling with Islamophobia might feel that Muslims and Arabs are attacking their way of life, destabilizing their country, and undoing the social fabric of their community, these feelings don’t make it true. But people typically continue to believe their narratives despite the evidence.

To Wake Others, We Need To Respect Them

Now, people’s feelings still matter even if they don’t reflect the truth of a situation. If people feel this way, we need to address it. We need to talk about it. We need to be open to hear their voices, and offer our own alternative interpretations respectfully, lovingly, and with an open mind.

In other words, we have to be willing to question our own narratives if we want to ask others to question theirs. We need to be open. If we’re not open, it’s very easy to become extreme. That’s the message I took away from the panel.

However, the opposite message filled my newsfeeds the day after Keith Scott was killed. A lot of my friends posted articles about how we need to shut down the hurtful narratives that oppose Black Lives matter. One article went so far as to say if you can’t promote BLM then give the mic away and let someone else speak.

I value the idea of letting someone else speak, but this was not a message of openness. It was a message of restriction, and of doubling down on a single narrative. The idea was that if you don’t agree with this message, shut up. There was no place for an alternative narrative. Of course not everyone feels this way, but apparently a lot of my friends do.

So what’s the problem with just validating someone’s narrative? If they feel that way, shouldn’t that be a good enough reason to validate it? Well, not when it comes to Islamophobia. Instead, when people feel one way, sometimes the most important and healthy response is to lovingly present an alternative narrative.

This is a basic skill for maintaining mental health. It’s the primary skill cognitive behavioral therapists teach to their patients. When people are depressed, it’s often because they have a hard time not interpreting their experiences in a singular way. When someone is anorexic, it can be the result of inaccurate stories he tells himself about food and health. When someone is paranoid, it often comes from false beliefs about the world.

It’s Time to Question Your Own Narrative

Cognitive behavioral therapy isn’t just for people with mental illness. Opening our minds to alternatives helps us all deal with things more intentionally and productively. For example, The New York Times publicized a study conducted by Roland Fryer, a black professor at Harvard University who studies methods of reducing racial achievement gaps. Fryer studied more than 1,000 shootings in 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida, and California. He found police officers were slightly more likely to shoot white individuals than black individuals (his study of course adjusted for all those things like racial density). This surprised Fryer.

When we’re dealing with people being killed, I feel a need to say that a death is always tragic regardless of who the person is, where he is from, or what he has done in his life. Killing someone ends possibility, crushes expectations, and affects many people. Yet if we’re honest, very few people are shot and killed by police officers, and there’s a good chance race may not be a significant deciding factor.

If on average it’s not a racial issue, we can still talk about restricting lethal force, but we would need to start by finding out how much there really is. According to Fryer’s study, there were 1.6 million arrests in Houston over five years and officers only fired their weapons 507 times. That means a gun wasn’t fired during an arrest 99.97 percent of the time. So while we are all more likely to be shot by a police officer than by an Islamic extremist, you’re still pretty safe from both.

If you’re walking down the street scared that an Arab is going to kill you, you need to question your narrative. And if you’re walking down the street fearing the cops are going to shoot you, you also need to question your narrative. So why are people scared of these things? Because our brains are storytelling machines and once you’ve developed a narrative it’s very hard to doubt it. Instead, whenever another bomb goes off or another black man is shot, we add that to our bag of confirmation.

But our ability to confirm our own narratives doesn’t change the facts. The fact remains that you’re pretty safe from cops and Islamic extremists alike.

Keeping an Open Mind Helps You Stay Free

Clinging too tightly to a narrative can cause you to miss the more compelling and honest story. When Fryer allowed himself to question the pervasive narrative, he realized that while lethal force is not very common, nonlethal force is. As a result, he discovered that black people are more likely to be frisked, cuffed, pepper-sprayed, etc. than white people. Rather than reinforcing an old narrative, his openness allowed him to discover something perhaps even more crucial.

So Fryer began to focus on the ways minor acts of force might have a larger effect on black lives. By questioning his narrative, Fryer might have found something more interesting, vital, and ubiquitous. Fryer’s conclusion is that perhaps we should focus on the nonlethal stuff because that happens all the time and leads to black disillusionment.

In his own words: “Who the hell wants to have a police officer put their hand on them or yell and scream at them? It’s an awful experience. Every black man I know has had this experience. Every one of them. It is hard to believe that the world is your oyster if the police can rough you up without punishment. And when I talked to minority youth, almost every single one of them mentions lower-level uses of force as the reason why they believe the world is corrupt.”

So what did the incidents following Scott’s death and the panel discussion at North Carolina State University about Islamophobia have in common? They’re both about humans and narratives. Narratives are like ruts our brains follow. We have to be willing to step out and consider other perspectives if we want to see where we’re going. Questioning our narratives is hard and uncomfortable, and can leave us feeling anchorless. But it can also free us to sail and find new and better moorings.

"Black Leaders Protest NAACP, Black Lives Matter On School Choice","For a long time, national organizations that claim to advocate on behalf of black Americans have actually not represented their views very well on key topics, and that rift became public again recently in controversies about charter schools.

Former Black Lives Matter St. Paul leader Rashad Turner recently quit his position over BLM national’s opposition to charter schools. Charters are public schools that boards of local citizens can apply to open and run under state oversight, and that any child can attend.

“Our public education system has people who are sometimes literally dying for the lack of educational opportunity. And when I think of charter schools in my community here in St. Paul and their benefit to students of color — low-income students — to call for a moratorium or an end to charter schools just lets me know that something funny is going on,” Turner told The74, a progressive education-focused website.

Turner also criticized the NAACP’s similar, long-held opposition to charters, which aligns with labor unions rather than black Americans. A plurality of African-Americans support charter schools, with 46 percent for and 29 percent against in a recent nationwide poll. In a 2015 poll conducted by the Black Alliance for Educational Options in Alabama, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Tennessee, majorities of black Americans supported charters, typically by approximately two-thirds.

Meanwhile, a group of 160 African-American community leaders sent NAACP a letter detailing their own objections to its charter-school opposition on behalf of “700,000 black families choosing to send their children to charter public schools, and the tens of thousands more who are still on waiting lists.” In October the NAACP board will meet to consider a resolution that calls for banning more charters from opening, which prompted the group letter in opposition.

“For many urban Black families, charter schools are making it possible to do what affluent families have long been able to do: rescue their children from failing schools,” the letter says. “The NAACP should not support efforts to take that option away from low-income and working-class Black families. A blanket moratorium on charter schools would limit Black students’ access to some of the best schools in America and deny Black parents the opportunity to make decisions about what’s best for their children.”

A similar coalition of black leaders in Florida has spent years going toe-to-toe with labor unions that keep suing to stop the nation’s largest state program that allows private donations to fund K-12 scholarships for poor children. The recipients of these tax-credit scholarships are predominantly minority students, and many of their parents are labor union members themselves. Nevertheless, the state teachers union keeps renewing lawsuits against the program despite a steady string of court decisions against them.

“While they’re fighting the old fight of integration versus segregation, our children are falling through the cracks. And in this issue, I believe they’re on the wrong side,” said the Rev. Manuel Sykes, a former president of the NAACP branch in St. Petersburg, of the NAACP’s opposition to school choice. “So at this point, we’re out here to advocate for and inform our African-American community that this (school choice) is something they need to support. Because while everyone is fighting on the top levels, it’s our children that’s at stake.”

The group letter to the NAACP cites a Stanford University study showing that black students who attended charter schools exhibited the equivalent of 14 days’ more learning in both reading and math per year compared to black peers in traditional public schools. Poor black students’ learning gains in charter schools were even more dramatic, at the equivalent of 29 more days’ learning in reading and 36 extra in math.

Turner said he doesn’t know why Black Lives Matter opposes school-choice programs that help black children access higher-quality schools, but he has a few theories.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/27/black-leaders-protest-naacp-black-lives-matter-stances-school-choice/,2016-09-27
How Black Lives Matter Is Bringing Back Traditional Marxism,"It isn’t surprising that Black Lives Matter is a communist organization—but the type of communism they subscribe to is. They are conservative communists attempting to fold the progressive movement back into traditional Marxism.

BLM has turned its back on intersectional theory, the modern conflict theory that birthed safe spaces, trigger warnings, and the Oppression Olympics. Instead, BLM is rebirthing the traditional class struggle, reframing it in terms of black and white.

The policy platform proposed by BLM in August did nothing to hide this traditionalism. Its calls for collective ownership of resources, banks, and businesses, a highly progressive income tax, a guaranteed minimum income, and government jobs are lifted straight from the pages of Karl Marx’s “Communist Manifesto.” Here are two excerpts for comparison:

“Communist Manifesto”: Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. Black Lives Matter: A right to restored land, clean air, clean water and housing and an end to the exploitative privatization of natural resources — including land and water. We seek democratic control over how resources are preserved, used and distributed and do so while honoring and respecting the rights of our Indigenous family.

Black vs. White Is the New Proletariat vs. Bourgeoisie

But more important is BLM’s use of the black versus white dichotomy. While race has a long history as a wedge issue, BLM incorporates nearly all forms of modern marginalization—“including but not limited to those who are women, queer, trans, femmes, gender nonconforming, Muslim, formerly and currently incarcerated, cash poor and working class, differently-abled, undocumented, and immigrant”—into blackness. Conversely, whiteness represents all forms of privilege (economic, social, and legal) throughout the platform.

BLM has simply substituted Marx’s class conflict between the proletariat and bourgeoisie for class conflict between blackness and whiteness. But unlike income and wealth, blackness and whiteness are not temporary states: while 56 percent of American households occupy the top 10 percent of the income bracket at some point during their lives, such transience does not occur with an immutable characteristic like race.

The black vs. white dichotomy creates a permanent enemy class, to which defection is always incomplete. And unlike the proletariat class consciousness, race consciousness already exists, making mobilization easier. This can be seen in the comments of a Milwaukee protester from August: “We do not want justice or peace anymore. We done with that shit. We want blood. We want blood. We want the same shit ya’ll want. Eye for an eye. No more peace. F–k all that. Ain’t no more peace. Ain’t no more peace. We done. We cannot cohabitate with white people, one of us have to go, black or white. All ya’ll have to go!”

Why Black Lives Matter Rejects Intersectionality

Where Marxism prioritizes the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat (or between black and white), the modern theory of intersectionality prioritizes differences between identity politic groups. It posits that while white women face marginalization for their sex, they gain privilege from their race. Conversely, black men gain privilege from their sex while facing marginalization because of their race. Black women experience “double jeopardy,” suffering from both sex and race. This creates a hierarchy of oppression that is in constant flux as new forms of marginalization are recognized. Intersectional theory fractures the class conflict from two opposed groups into an unlimited number of conflicts within the hierarchy of oppression.

This is why the LGBTQQIAAP coalition is beginning to segregate itself by race. For example, some elements of the community argue that “white cis gay men are relative enablers, rather than victims, of oppression.” Intersectionality has created similar instability in the feminist movement. At a National Women’s Studies Association Conference in 1992, American Enterprise Institute Scholar Christina Hoff Sommers observed the effects of intersectionality on feminist solidarity:

“[P]articipants met in groups defined by their grievances and healing needs: Jewish women, Jewish lesbians, Asian-American women, African-American women, old women, disabled women, fat women, women whose sexuality is in transition. None of the groups proved stable. The fat group polarized into gay and straight factions, and the Jewish women discovered they were deeply divided. … This year’s concern extended to ‘marginalized’ allergy groups. Participants were sent advance notice not to bring perfumes, dry-cleaned clothing, hair spray or other irritants.”

Could Communism Be Making a Comeback?

While this sounds like a scene out of Portlandia, it exemplifies why BLM is shifting toward traditional Marxism. Devotees of intersectional theory are too triggered by the lack of gluten-free cupcakes to organize and fight capitalism.

BLM treats intersectional conflicts and “non-black people of color” much the same way Marx treated the reserve army of labor and petty bourgeoisie: as auxiliaries to the proletariat and bourgeoisie conflict. In their glossary, BLM defines the term “non-black people of color” as intended “to provide greater context to the distinct and unique oppression imposed on Black people, while recognizing the struggles of other people of color.” Which is to say that while intersectional conflicts exist, the Black vs. White conflict takes priority.

On one hand, the thought of trigger warnings and safe spaces falling out of vogue is uplifting. However, early 20th century Communist parties were highly effective in the political sphere. If BLM is successful in winning the progressive movement over to traditional Marxism, they may garner significant political power and send us further down the road to serfdom.

How Black Lives Matter-Style Activism Is Ruining America,"When the Ferguson riots broke out in 2014, the nation was shocked and alarmed. The press gave the event wall-to-wall coverage for a week. For young people this was fairly new territory, while older people had flashbacks to the Los Angeles riots of 1992, or even (if they were old enough) the Watts riots of 1965. These were alarming connections. Weren’t we past all this stuff?

The Baltimore riots in 2015 were a bit less shocking. This was a movie we’d all just seen. By the time we got to Charlotte, the element of surprise had been completely lost. Deadly race riots are starting to take on the banality of “same old, same old.” I’ve actually started looking forward to winter as a less riot-friendly season. It’s pretty depressing that we’ve reached the point where that line of thought makes sense.

Here’s the real tragedy of Ferguson, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Charlotte, and any other cities that haven’t yet been sacked but soon may be. Taken in themselves, the problems that drive this frustration are reasonably soluble. Unfortunately, just about everyone seems to prefer narrative-peddling to problem-solving. It’s easier and more fun.

As we all double down on our rightness, soluble problems morph into massive, mangled webs of anger and angst, and American cities go on burning.

America Is Not Drowning in Crime

Here’s the basic reality. Crime rates in America have gone down quite a bit since the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, we still have relatively high rates of violent crime compared to other Western nations, and our murder rate has ticked up a bit over the past year.

Crime is again bubbling up as a domestic concern for ordinary American voters. At the first presidential debate, Donald Trump gave a mostly incoherent speech on crime, in which he took care to use the words “law” and “order” repeatedly, obviously signaling that he wishes to inherit the mantle of law-and-order conservatism. Those memes had been fading from the conservative electoral playbook, so Trump’s ham-fisted attempts at reviving them are worthy of comment.

Most people fail to understand that crime is quite a localized problem in America. There are places where murder is rampant, and places where it’s shocking and rare. That’s partly related to gangs, which are turf-oriented such that you pretty much know where to find them.

Actual gang murders are just one piece of the puzzle, though. In some neighborhoods, the social fabric has decayed, and bad blood between police and residents goes back many years. Solving crimes is challenging when residents are afraid of being labeled “snitches.” Cops get frustrated, and some start bending the rules. Relations deteriorate further.

It’s understandable that residents of these neighborhoods are frustrated. It’s tough to grow up in a place where you regularly feel unsafe. It’s hard feeling that you (or your kids) are seen as suspicious every time you wear a hoodie or have something bulky in your coat pocket.

Still, we should understand that this is not most of America. We’ve heard a lot lately about elite “bubble dwellers” who can’t understand the problems of ordinary people, but with respect to violent crime, it might be more accurate to see these sorts of neighborhoods as “bubbled.” Crime is still a problem in America, but it isn’t the sort of pervasive problem that’s driving people into gated-community islands of safety. In most places, our police are doing a pretty good job.

Crime Control Problems Are Soluble

That’s the first piece of good news. The second is that we’ve made significant advances in crime control over the past 20 years. Research and data analysis have given us vastly improved analytics, enabling us to direct resources to criminal hot spots. Better surveillance and communication reduces response times. Advances are also being made in training methods that help police to respond more appropriately to addicts, juveniles, and the mentally ill.

In many areas, improved transparency for police departments is also warranted. Unions and corrupt officials have enabled bad policing practices to become entrenched especially in many urban areas that have for decades been under near-exclusive Democratic control. In some cities (most obviously Chicago), law enforcement needs some restructuring and rebranding. But even in Chicago, substantial improvement should be possible, if we could think of the problem in terms of police transparency and crime control.

Unfortunately, it’s hard to fix anything in America today, when reform efforts are so easily hijacked by nefarious national narratives.

A Problem of Misdiagnosis

Americans have a narrative problem. We just like our narratives way, way too much. We’re starting to fall prey to narrative-induced paralysis.

This problem has fairly deep historical roots, especially for the black community. Looking at our list of American heroes, what sorts of people do we find? In general, our most-prized moral exemplars are prophetic figures whose main social contribution was to speak truth to power.

Martin Luther King Jr. never had much of a head for policy, but he was a genius at making a moral point. In a similar mold, we lavish admiration on Mahatma Ghandi, the suffragettes, and heartstring-pulling writers like Upton Sinclair, W.E.B. DuBois, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Americans just love our awareness-raisers. We like them enough that we’re even sometimes willing to forgive certain lapses from Ghandi’s and King’s non-violent protest model.

In some cases, awareness-raisers really are heroic. (Jesus Christ is my personal favorite, although Elijah was also pretty great.) At other times, our obsession with awareness may actually blind us to the real solutions. Not every problem comes back to a widespread deficiency of human concern.

What if most Americans already agree that “black lives matter”? What if our policing and crime-control problems actually call for some prudent policy adjustments, and not a nationwide lifting of hearts and minds? High-minded but ineffective solutions can often be worse than useless insofar as they deter people from focusing on what really needs to be done. If a friend has a headache, you offer him an aspirin first, not a Bible.

Black Lives Matter is currently giving us a heartbreaking tutorial in the consequences of misapplied social activism. Just a few months ago we could argue about the reality of “the Ferguson effect,” but now we seem to be hurtling forward to a point where every black victim of a police shooting is potentially seen as the next Rodney King. It’s no longer necessary to wait for the verdict, or even for basic forensic analysis. Hearsay is enough to start the looting.

Needless to say, these developments are creating an extreme crime control challenge for city officials. No cop wants his city to be the next Ferguson. But how can police chiefs send cops into high-crime neighborhoods without giving them leave to defend themselves against potentially deadly attacks? The longer-term consequences of that kind of undisciplined “demonstration” will be more gang-controlled neighborhoods, and more black deaths.

Meanwhile, if Black Lives Matter goes on demonstrating its disdain for relevant facts and procedures, more and more Americans will lose sympathy for the cause. Can a narrative kill you? In a way, maybe it can.

Leashing Our Unruly Narratives

I’m not trying to blame everything on liberals. Conservatives have narrative problems too. We have a bad habit of deflecting any criticisms of our justice system by playing the “Daniel Patrick Moynihan” card. Rather than discuss seriously whether our police, courts, or correctional policies would benefit from reforms, we’d prefer to talk about the collapse of the family and how this is mostly the fault of liberals and the welfare state.

We could buy ourselves some credibility by taking an interest in shorter-term solutions for struggling neighborhoods.

This all makes perfect sense when you understand the twin policy arcs of the late twentieth century, along with their corresponding political narratives. Liberals responded to poverty and social decay with a spate of entitlement programs, while conservatives promoted aggressive law enforcement. Both approaches had some drawbacks (not necessarily equally serious), but naturally everybody prefers to discuss where the other guy fell short.

Moynihan’s argument that the welfare state would further destabilize the black family, thus locking millions in a crippling cycle of poverty and dysfunction, looks awfully prescient in hindsight. That’s somewhat beside the point, though, for addressing immediate crime-control problems. We’re not going to re-instill the traditional family model overnight. When conservatives talk about Moynihan in the wake of a controversial police shooting, liberals (understandably) read that as, “Nothing can actually be done here, but just so you know, this is all your fault.”

Moynihan’s analysis can be mostly true without being the most relevant truth for every circumstance. We could buy ourselves some credibility by taking an interest in shorter-term solutions for struggling neighborhoods. It’s easier to give lectures on family values when you’re already involved in the neighborhoods that need to hear them.

There are times when activism and high-minded moralizing really are effective catalysts for positive change. There are other times when the sermonizing just wastes time and energy that could be put into building things that work. Let’s fire the activists, and start hiring more good cops.

The United Nations Call For U.S. Reparations Is Completely Whack,"A United Nations team called the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent conducted a 10-day mission to the United States this past January to investigate the state of black people in our country. The team did not just decide to come on their own; they were invited by “the government of the United States,” presumably at the behest of President Obama. Naturally, as a black person I was keenly interested in their findings.

The members of the UN team were Mireille Fanon-Mendès-France, Sabelo Gumedze, and Ricardo Sunga III. Does that first name sound familiar? Fanon-Mendès-France is the daughter of the famous Marxist, anti-colonialist, far-left activist Frantz Fanon. Some might see similarities between his philosophy and that of President Obama, but I’ll leave that to readers.

During their week and a half visit, the working group visited New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, Baltimore, and Jackson, Mississippi, meeting with various local government bodies and activist groups. They also met with the White House and the Congressional Black Caucus. Many of their meetings were coordinated by the U.S. Human Rights Network, a conglomeration of leftist activist groups, as well as the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, an organ of the State Department engaged in left-leaning causes and headed by a Democrat and Obama appointee.

As the final product of their U.S. travels, the working group has released a report with their findings and recommendations. Sadly, it fails to mention much, and what it does mention is largely wrong. I’ll highlight three of the report’s findings that are problematic, three things they failed to find, and then generally why the report is misguided.

What’s Wrong with the Findings

Firstly: The panel argues “The dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion among the United States population. Hate crime groups, including white supremacist terror groups, are still active in the United States, targeting African Americans, as was seen in the attack at a church in Charleston in 2015.”

The Charleston shooting was not carried out by a white supremacist group. It was carried out by a lone crazed maniac. Also, those influenced by or sympathetic to Black Lives Matter have called for and actually carried out police officer killings.

The Dallas sniper who murdered five police officers told negotiators “he was upset about Black Lives Matter. He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” A black Dallas police officer is even filing a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter for inciting violence against police officers. Further, Black Lives Matter supporters have rioted and destroyed property in Charlotte, North Carolina, and have called for killing white people. So why no mention of their hateful, racist ideology?

Secondly: The report erroneously elevates incidents of police killings of black people to a serious national problem, when in fact far, far more black people kill each other than do police. In fact, for every one black person killed by a while police officer, 71 black people are killed by another black person.

Also, the data shows that blacks are killed by the police in proportion to the rate at which they commit crime, meaning the police do not disproportionately target them for violence. The report fails to consider these facts when painting the false picture that out-of-control police are unfairly targeting black people.

Thirdly: The report says we should address today the evil problem of past lynchings. But there are two problems with this. First, white people today are not responsible for lynchings of the past, so making them pay for it is unjust. Secondly, as with incidents of police killing black people, this past problem is dwarfed by black murder. According to Tuskegee University, a total of 4,733 black people were lynched from 1882 to 1959. Yet over the past 35 years, an average of about 9,000 black men have killed each other every single year.

Wrap your head around that. Every single year, black men are killing each other at numbers higher than the total of all of the lynchings that ever happened in the history of the United States.

Here’s What the Report Fails to Mention

The report contains no mention of the fact that 72 percent of black kids are born to single mothers, and that this is a major contributing factor topoverty, crime, and educational outcomes for black Americans. It makes no mention of putting the family back together as a way of improving conditions for black people in America.

The report does not mention that the black murder rate is eight times higher than the white murder rate, and that even though black people are only 14 percent of the population, they are about half of all murderers. Indeed, black people are painted only as victims of crime, not committers of crime with deep family, community, moral, and spiritual dysfunction causing them to be that way.

Although the report makes cursory mention of the “root causes of crime,” the authors never develop this into an argument about methods to stop black people from killing each other.

The report also contains no mention of the deep brokenness in black culture, including: a thug culture that glorifies violence, misogyny, criminal behavior, and incarceration, and is spread by a complicit media through music and pop culture. Nor does it tackle the “acting white” phenomenon, in which black kids’ popularity goes down as their GPA goes up. This means certain segments of black culture actually glorify being dumb and the criminal lifestyle. Any solution to the issues facing black people must address these problems, but they’re totally absent from the UN report.

The report concludes with a long list of recommendations, including a call for reparations for “enslavement and racial discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present.” The problem is that the United States has already spent $22 trillion on the War on Poverty, even though it’s been largely ineffective in eliminating poverty among black people.

Does this not count as reparations? What about other programs, like minority preferences for government contracts? How would one measure how much reparations is enough? And why should white people today have to pay for what happened in 1619? Further, why doesn’t the working group call for involving the black church in the solutions to these problems, since it’s one of the oldest and most influential of institutions in black communities?

Ultimately, although the report was published by the UN, it reads like it was written by Obama, the Congressional Black Caucus, and leftist activist groups. The working group would have more credibility if it included voices other than the far-left, such as churches, think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, and beat police officers who deal with black criminals and witness daily the terror they cause in black communities.

Thankfully, the report is non-binding and its recommendations will not be adopted. But it’s perhaps a sneak peek into the kind of policies that President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats might implement if they had complete control of all branches of government.

Obama Admin Tells Black Parents Their School Choices Are Racist,"In the heart of the Mississippi Delta stands a city that has overcome an economy built and sustained on slave labor, a cotton industry built on the backs of field hands, and now a high school that has integrated itself more equitably than any school in the Delta.

But while Cleveland, Mississippi, has transformed itself from the land up, federal government has chosen to make the city’s schools a national example, forcing local schools to consolidate in the name of desegregation. But many local families of all races don’t want that, and they don’t necessarily consider the effects their individual choices to constitute systemic racism.

U.S. courts hold a legal responsibility to eliminate forced integration. So last May, Judge Debra Brown ordered Cleveland’s middle and high schools to consolidate, in keeping with a 2011 U.S. Department of Justice motion “to enforce the previously-entered desegregation orders governing the district and compel the district’s compliance with federal law.”

This meant combining the mostly African-American East Side High with the racially mixed Cleveland High. Yet the demographics of Cleveland schools are due to parent choice, not forced integration, and occurred naturally. The government’s intervention is heavy-handed and far-removed from the reality of life in Cleveland.

The DoJ has resurrected a 1965 case, Cowan v. Cleveland School District, to impose its faraway will on local schools, ignoring the district’s efforts to integrate the education system since the 1960s through school choice instead of government force.

“East Side has an award-winning and highly respected principal—who happens to be white—and many white teachers who prefer teaching there over teaching at Cleveland High,” said Michael Carr, a public defender in Bolivar County and graduate of Cleveland High School. “CHS had a black student body president last year who won top awards at the MS High School Mock Trial Competition and got a full ride to Ole Miss. It’s not just ‘us’ and ‘them.’ We are all mixed up here. And that’s on purpose and how we want it. This lawsuit has just brought race to the forefront when it really was not headline news in our town.”

Local Problem-Solving Versus Federal Race Quotas

Since the landmark U.S. Supreme Court desegregation ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, public schools across the country have seen an “alarming” increase in segregation, said Leslie Hiner, a vice president at EdChoice. But Cleveland’s public schools are not following this national trend.

“Fifty years ago, desegregation focused on improving academic opportunities for African-American children who had been forced to attend under-funded, under-performing public schools,” Hiner said. “Today, in Cleveland, African-American children have the right to choose the public school, and public school classes, they wish to attend.”

In other words, forced desegregation was a policy for times in which individuals had less leverage to solve their own problems, before today’s greater access to school choice. Since Cleveland lets families choose which school their kids will attend, the fact that East Side is majority black is only so because families choose to put their children in a school with that composition. The federal lawsuit is telling these mostly African-American families that their choices have created systemic racism that requires federal intervention.

“Cleveland School District has genuinely tried to find ways to continue black and white students going to school together while keeping the character and identity of neighborhood schools,” Carr said. “East Side is a neighborhood school, and that neighborhood happens to be black. It’s the majority race in Bolivar County. It has always been that way since our county was founded.”

Following a series of parent meetings and focus groups prior to trial, the Cleveland school board decided their bottom-up approach to social and racial integration is better than the Obama adminstration’s top-down demands. So on July 11, the Cleveland School Board formally appealed the court’s order.

Atop local choice policies, the state legislature has been attempting to address Mississippi’s long history of offering some of the nation’s worst public schools. Vouchers for disabled students and an education savings account law for special-needs children became law in 2011 and 2012, and have proven popular with parents. Washington bureaucrats descended on the state precisely as these local efforts to offer greater opportunity to needy children materialized, Hiner said.

“Ordering schools to consolidate as a means to desegregate goes against local efforts of parents, teachers, and public school administrators to build an educational culture in the schools that offers greater opportunity for all students, regardless of their school of enrollment,” Hiner said. “If a school’s enrollment remains segregated as a result of the free choice of African-American families, does the government have a right to force these families to send their children to a different school against their wishes?”

Cleveland: A History of Poverty, Poor Education

Black Americans are used to outside entities overriding their education choices. It’s part of Mississippi’s disgraceful history.

“There were a lot of race issues [in Mississippi], and white supremacy dominated the thinking for much of the twentieth century,” said Ellen B. Meacham, a professor of journalism at the University of Mississippi. “Many of the state’s leaders did not see the point of funding the education of someone they thought was only going to work in the fields.”

Prior to mechanization, farming in the Delta was labor-intensive, and farmers used debt and even force to make it difficult for poorer workers, who were mostly black, to leave, Meacham said. The mechanization of agriculture in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including equipment like the cotton picker and harvester, contributed to a huge displacement of workers from 1960-66.

“You had thousands of people working in the Delta who were suddenly put out of work and generations of people for whom the state had been resistant to providing any kind of education for their poor population because they needed them for agricultural purposes, and then suddenly they no longer needed them,” Meacham said. “They hadn’t been educated and there weren’t any jobs left. They were in quite a bind.”

These folks had often received only a third- or fourth-grade education around the cotton season in inadequate schools, many of which had no school books and no school buses, Meacham said.

Today, an Oasis of Choice in the Delta

According to locals, while poverty and uneven funding for public schools still remain, the racism that once dominated Cleveland’s education system is not foremost in the high schools today. In fact, Cleveland parents’ ability to choose which public schools to enroll their children in allows for more freedom than many school districts nationwide, let alone the Delta.

“Cleveland High School is the last truly integrated public high school in the Mississippi delta,” Carr said. “It is literally 50-50. You will not find another integrated high school until you get to the hills, at least a one-and-a-half hour drive in any direction.”

‘This would perpetuate re-segregation, and would undo all the progress we have made since the 1970s.’

Carr could have attended East Side, but chose to attend his neighborhood school, Cleveland High. Nevertheless, the students in both schools regularly spent time and exchanged classes with each other.

“We also went to East Side every day to take certain classes, like calculus and French,” he noted. “East Side students came to Cleveland High to take drama and Spanish. And we all went to a local vocational tech center to learn trades… They still do it to this day.”

When parents are the ones making the decisions about where their children will attend school, it takes away the worry that racism has influenced someone else’s placement decisions, Cleveland school board attorney Jamie Jacks noted: “Parental choice is a key component in maintaining community buy-in for a school district.”

In fact, the Obama administration’s push for racially gerrymandering schools could make segregation worse.

“From a strict interpretation legal analysis, [Judge Brown’s] ruling is absolutely right,” Carr said. “However, I am concerned this ruling will unintentionally have a negative impact on integration in our school system. I’m afraid that white parents, if their son or daughter is suddenly made into an overwhelming minority group in what is already only a ‘C’-rated high school, with no promise of a new facility, better teachers, or new technology, will place their children in segregated academies. This would perpetuate re-segregation, and would undo all the progress we have made since the 1970s.”

The federal lawsuit makes a race issue out of what is really a funding issue, Carr said.

“The state or the Feds aren’t going to build us a sparkling new school where I can send my kids,” he said. “It would have to be funded by a massive local bond, and we don’t have the tax base for it.”

It could take a year for the district’s legal appeal to be heard and decided.

In this case, “the Department of Justice appears to be arbitrary and unfair to African-American parents, who stand to lose their freedom to choose what’s best for their own children,” Hiner said. “African-American children are being pushed around by bureaucrats in Washington to achieve what the bureaucrats believe is a perfect balance of the races—regardless of the wishes of parents, regardless of the impact on those children and the quality of their lives.”

2016’s Black Swans Have Arrived With A Warning To Americans,"Some months back, I speculated this election might well be best remembered by a black swan appearance. When pressed for detail, I found myself unable to articulate what form it would take. It was visceral—a perception that defied specificity. Yet it seemed certain.

A black swan event is one considered so unlikely to occur that it is usually dismissed offhandedly as being highly improbable, if not pure fantasy. When they happen, black swans are high-impact happenings, demonstrably reshaping the status quo and often changing history.

In the 2016 election, one might suggest that Donald Trump’s candidacy itself was a Black Swan event, unexpected and tapping into a volcanic fountain of anger against the establishment. It has also attracted some unlikely allies. Did anyone actually believe voter angst ran as deep and wide as we have witnessed?

A rude, crude, and poorly informed Trump has demonstrated strength in the polls few could have imagined. It is abundantly clear that America holds politicians in very low regard. Perhaps that explains his strength in the polls.

Some pundits have speculated that because of Trump’s candidacy the Republican Party is, for all practical purposes, on its deathbed—that being the fate it deserves for Republican lawmakers’ repeated negligence in promising to roll back the march of Marxism embodied in the progressives’ agenda.

Millennials and orthodox blue-dog Democrats also hold Democrats in serious contempt. Strangely enough, the large labor unions remain loyal to Democrats while Democrats’ immigration policies are anathema to the welfare of middle-class union membership. One has to wonder how the union leadership profits while the members lose. In our current political atmosphere, it seems nobody wins except the politicians.

Hitting the Reset Button

The answer is to go back to our Founding Fathers’ principles, which made this nation a world leader. It’s all about learning those lessons from history so as not to repeat them. Perhaps that’s a hill too steep for the children of our education system.

If we are going to “hit a reset button,” let it be to restore a government of the people and for the people, as opposed to serving the needs of the ruling class. Every John Doe on Main Street knows the middle class has been sacrificed on the altar of greed, corruption, and fealty to the almighty dollar: principled leadership born of character is how to reset our politics.

That reset button means the American people must awake from their distracted slumber and hold our politicians responsible for their malfeasance. No consequences means no change.

Then the Black Swans Appeared

Like many voters, I hated the idea of voting for Trump—except that a non-vote was a vote for the equally repugnant Clintons. It was an exasperating situation to find myself in. Then, the first of two black swans appeared. The release of the Trump audio tape demeaning women should be the coffin nail in the Trump presidential race. If it is not so with the GOP, it is for me. I’ll stay home and pray for divine intervention.

As much as I regret to admit I believe Robert De Niro, the liberal actor, he has it right; Trump is a punk. He’s ignorant and lazy, a BS artist and an embarrassment to our country.

His attitude toward women is a national disgrace. We have witnessed how this egomaniac treated Megan Kelly, Carli Fiorina, and other women, then conveniently forgot it. Chalk it up to a concession to the greater contempt for the Clintons’ corruption, salacious lifestyle, and anger against establishment politicians in general. Trump, like Hillary, will command respect from foreign leaders only a millimeter less than Barack Obama has.

The second Black Swan landed when WikiLeaks revealed Hillary’s contempt for America’s working class during speeches to the pirates of Wall Street, the Podesta revelations, and her embrace of open borders.

She supports an economic system tailored to enrich the globalist oligarchs’ welfare and a border policy designed to drive the working man’s wages down. It’s all right out of the George Soros playbook. The Teflon coating the Democratic Party and their sycophantic mainstream media have bestowed on the Clintons during 30 years of corruption and openly disdainful regard for rule of law is equally damning.

Furthermore, one could reasonably ask, “How different are the Clintons in disrespecting women?” Do we really want a rerun of Bill sexually exploiting women in the White House and Hillary aiding and abetting the crimes?

Their vulnerability to blackmail in a world where no secret is safe is another matter of grave national implications. Nobody has a greater deficit in moral character than the Clintons.

If there ever was a grain of truth to the timeworn adage “Birds of a feather flock together,” our two presidential nominees personify it. These two camps competing for the same position is a bit of irony. Perhaps Satan has a sense of humor after all.

Naaah, he was just hedging his bet on the outcome of this election.

Salvaging Our National Honor

Our nation has reached a critical juncture in our body politic. Either politics is about money and power, values be damned, or integrity matters. There is no escaping the message of the black swans. Both candidates are loathsome. If either is elected, the stain on our national honor is indelible, irrefutable, and damning.

Republicans have a way out of their conundrum.

Republicans have a way out of their conundrum. Exercise whatever emergency candidate replacement rules they have, or formulate some, in order to dump Trump immediately and boost Mike Pence to the top of the ticket.

Meanwhile, search out a competent lady who is a lady, and put her on the ticket for vice president. America wants a lady, and both Golda Maier and Margaret Thatcher proved they can be smart, tough, and thoughtful. Any delay in the “dump Trump” undertaking underscores the reasons for America’s contempt of politicians—it is all about money and power.

Yes, Democrats need the same anodyne. If they fail to rid their house of the ethically and morally challenged Clintons, they offer the Republicans a windfall propaganda opportunity.

Character Either Matters or We Are In a Suicidal Vortex

Our American culture has reached a crossroads that offers renewal on one path or national suicide on the other. We, the American people, share part of the blame for our sorry state of affairs.

The ruling-class objectives are globalism, dilution of any national culture embodied in the Founding Fathers’ principles, and accumulation of wealth and privilege for the select few and their progeny. Chelsea Clinton is exhibit A. By systematically polarizing Americans against one another (divide and conquer), promoting class warfare, addicting classes of Americans to actual drugs and a substandard paternal government, the ruling class is on the threshold of total victory.

We need to renew our national sense of purpose, economy, and cultural norms, and learn the lessons of history.

Millions of young people have been schooled to believe they are entitled to a nanny system of government where personal responsibility is dismissed off-handedly and a perceived micro-aggression sends them frantically seeking a safe place. Such people are incapable of leading small businesses, let alone a nation in a world where global competition will only intensify.

We need to renew our national sense of purpose, economy, and cultural norms, and learn the lessons of history progressivism offers up around the world. If we are to save our nation from social and economic decay, not to mention foreign enemies who despise freedom of thought and opportunity, it will take every talented man and woman we can come up with.

Americans have three choices. Enforce our demands for responsible government, replace the government wholesale, or fade into obscurity like other banana republics. We cannot continue to sleepwalk through meaningless elections, tolerating feckless government at every level, and indifferent to our own culpability in the sorry state of affairs in which we find ourselves.

We can choose freedom, life, and opportunity for ourselves, our children and theirs, or we can blithely stroll into the dustbin of history as another nation condemned to death by its own slothful hand.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/11/2016s-black-swans-arrived-warning-americans/,2016-10-11
"Listen To Black Lives Matter Supporters, Don't Dismiss Them","In a September shooting that stunned the nation, a Tulsa police officer shot Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man. That same week, the shooting of armed black man Keith Lamont Scott sparked protests and rioting in Charlotte.

These cases followed a series of shocking deaths over the summer, particularly the shooting of Philando Castile as his girlfriend watched from the passenger seat.

Most recently, San Diego police killed an unarmed man—after his sister asked officers to help him because of his mental state.

We don’t know all the details of these cases. But we can still discuss how we should respond to them. Specifically: How should pro-life advocates respond to police brutality and growing frustrations in the African-American community?

When police brutality comes up in conversation, I’ve heard fellow pro-life advocates shift the dialogue to high abortion rates in the black community. “If black lives matter, why are you aborting your children?” they ask. Their underlying message: it’s hypocritical for the black community to care about those dying from police brutality and not for those in their community who choose abortion.

Meanwhile, I’ve read countless comments discussing police brutality, in which abortion statistics are brought up solely to suggest that there’s a bigger issue we should worry about. While it’s true that statistics show more black pre-born children die from abortion than black people die at the hands of the police, these are two separate issues. Both deserve attention without being pitted against each other.

Abortion deaths may be “bigger” in numbers, but this doesn’t negate the fact that any life lost through violence is a tragedy.

#BlackLivesMatter Should Be A Pro-Life Message

I remember when #BlackLivesMatter first began surfacing after the death of Trayvon Martin. When I saw the hashtag, it spoke a powerful truth to me. The message that black lives are valuable is one I identify with and believe in. I have worked more than a decade to show my people how high abortion rates have devastated our communities. I’ve educated others on the racist history of Planned Parenthood, revealing how founder Margaret Sanger aimed to decrease the black population.

Black Lives Matter activists communicated a truth I believed in—but for a different purpose. I felt conflicted, because I couldn’t reconcile our messages around a mutual desire to preserve life. I also grieved over the tragic deaths of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, and 12 year-old Tamir Rice, among others. At the same time, I grieved over the 16 million black children aborted since Roe v. Wade. It’s why I spent years praying at the Supreme Court for innocent lives. It’s why I serve in a local pregnancy resource center today.

I wanted to join these causes together. I longed for my black brothers and sisters to take to the streets in protest for the unborn, as well as for those harmed by police brutality. That desire to fight for life at every stage is good and right. But I fought a growing judgment towards those passionate over lives lost to police brutality, yet seemingly apathetic towards those lost to abortion.

Both Movements Seek to Protect Life

As the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement continued, I began to listen more attentively. Listening doesn’t mean I must agree with everything a person says or does. Listening is an act of love—an opportunity to be humble and hear the heart cry of another. As I listened to both friends and strangers, I heard stories of discrimination, decades of pain, and legitimate fears.

While listening, a thought came to me. I wanted my people, the black community, to hear my pain over children killed via abortion. But they wanted others to hear their pain over the loss of their sons and daughters via police brutality. That realization led me to understand, in a deeper way, that the black community is collectively in mourning.

This new empathy inspired me to commit to speaking with compassion and hope. I decided to look at police brutality and abortion as separate issues, both deserving of attention. I challenged myself to not interject abortion into the discussion of police brutality in ways that might accuse or shame the black community.

This does not mean I am unaware of the fact that Black Lives Matter as an organization supports abortion rights. BLM leaders partner with the pro-choice women of color organization Sister Song. This is one of many planks in the BLM platform that I clearly do not support.

How To Empathize With A Cause That’s Pro-Choice?

This puts me in an interesting place. How can I empathize with a movement that advocates for something I disagree with? I’ve found the best way to do this is to see the movement for what it is: a broad group of people with varying levels of involvement, all trying to raise awareness and fight the specific issue of police brutality.

The person who leads a BLM march and the teenager who tweets #BlackLivesMatter are different people with unique ambitions. But they both want to protect black lives. Black Lives Matter as an organization has initiatives and an agenda. By acknowledging black lives are important, I do not support every action members of the Black Lives Matter movement take.

Rather, I look at the people in BLM as individuals in a larger movement—and I show solidarity to them in their cause for justice. I do not agree with every tactic or protest on behalf of BLM. But I believe police brutality is real and should be addressed. I am glad BLM is having this dialogue and bringing it to the national stage. Perhaps through open lines of communication, we can all work together to bring positive change.

Pro-Lifers Shouldn’t Ignore Police Brutality

What does the mean on a practical level? For starters, I’ve come to believe that using certain questions as a knee-jerk response—“If black lives matter, then why are your abortion rates so high?”—is hurtful to the people I want to reach. It deflects from the issue BLM is fighting for. It suggests that if black people don’t care about unborn lives as much as adult lives, then they don’t care at all.

But many in the black community do care about the lives of the unborn as much as the lives of adults dying in the streets. Most of my black friends are staunchly pro-life. But they admit to feeling isolated among white pro-lifers when issues of race are discussed. Black leaders who’ve united with the pro-life movement are at times rejected and accused when they speak against racism. They are told to move past it, to “not see color,” to focus on more important issues like abortion (even when they already are) or “black on black” crime.

What about those who care about people dying from police brutality, but not from abortion? These are the people we pro-lifers must reach. Just as the BLM movement has rallied people, we as pro-life advocates can use our creativity, passion, and message to do the same. Instead of accusing the black community of not caring, let’s work to help more of them see abortion as a human rights issue worth caring about.

How do we bridge the divide? How do we all—regardless of race—stand for the pro-life message and communicate it to the black community with love?

Pro-Lifers Must Display Compassion and Care

First, we must seek to listen and care. We must refuse to use tools of shame, and instead uplift people with hope. Many black Americans already understand the issues that ravage our communities. They are not looking for a lecture. They are looking for compassionate people who will fight for change.

If we want others to listen to our concerns, we must listen to theirs as well.

I work with women daily who make decisions to parent, place their child up for adoption, or abort. I’ve never had an abortion-vulnerable woman talk about politics or race while making a pregnancy decision. Instead, these women share their financial issues, fear of abandonment, and need for practical resources.

Discussions of movements and politics definitely matter. And I’m not saying we should stop discussing abortion with the black community. These discussions are vital. But how we have these discussions, and when we have them, is important. If we want others to listen to our concerns, we must listen to theirs as well.

As the black community sees the pro-life movement act in caring, compassionate ways, they will understand that we care about the fate of their children. Black lives do matter—from the unborn child to the elderly. As pro-life advocates, we of all people should make that message clear.

NAACP Tells Black Parents To Keep Their Kids In Crappy Schools,"Despite public resistance by black leaders across the political spectrum against this impending decision, the NAACP Saturday released yet another resolution condemning school choice and calling for a nationwide ban on new charter schools.

“The NAACP opposes privatization of public schools and public subsidizing or funding of for-profit or charter schools,” the organization said in a statement. “Privatization of public schools” is survey-tested union talk attempting to manipulate people into disliking the idea of a more diverse ecosystem of publicly funded education through mechanisms such as vouchers, education savings accounts, and charter schools. These allow all families to have the same opportunities to attend schools of choice, as rich families do.

A coalition of 160 black leaders pointed this out in an attempt to get NAACP to back off this resolution when it was first proposed this year: “A blanket moratorium on charter schools would limit Black students’ access to some of the best schools in America and deny Black parents the opportunity to make decisions about what’s best for their children.”

Unlike many Americans, of course, and particularly unlike African-Americans because of their higher levels of poverty, wealthy families can afford to pay taxes for public school plus tuition to private school, or buy their way into high-performing public school districts. The NAACP insists it instead wants all Americans to pay the eye-popping property and other taxes the rich do to fund local schools of comparable extravagance, and therefore black kids should be held hostage in poorly performing public schools as leverage to push for this political arrangement.

All increases in spending equate to tax increases, either immediately or later if contracted through debt. So NAACP here is effectively demanding tax increases to increase education funding nationwide: “The NAACP has been in the forefront of the struggle for and a staunch advocate of free, high-quality, fully and equitably-funded public education for all children,” said Roslyn Brock, NAACP’s national board chairman. “We are dedicated to eliminating the severe racial inequities that continue to plague the education system.”

This stance is a head-scratcher on myriad counts. For one, the United States already boasts the highest-funded public education system in the world, at an average cost (not including public debt, typically for facilities costs, which is massive) of $12,000 per student per year. The districts where black students are concentrated tend to spend even more — Washington DC, for example, spends approximately $25,000 per child per year, Baltimore spends $15,000 per student, and Detroit $14,000. U.S. education spending has quadrupled since the 1970s while student achievement has stagnated, and seems to have had little effect on black kids particularly (once raised above segregation-era pittances).

Now, the average charter school — which is a fully public school that local citizens can apply to run as independent boards following public transparency laws — spends approximately $7,600 per student per year. Despite the huge cost savings charters offer, quality studies show their students learn at least as much, and often more, than their peers in traditional public schools.

In fact, the children who seem to academically and socially benefit the most from enrolling in a charter school are the very children NAACP claims to represent: poor, minority children. For example: “Black and Hispanic students who attended charter schools in [New York City] for eight years closed the achievement gap with affluent suburbs like Scarsdale by 86% in math and 66% in English,” found a National Bureau for Economic Research study. “Public charter middle schools in Boston cut the black-white achievement gap in math by as much as half in a single year.”

Massachusetts charters close the racial achievement gap on half the funding of traditional public schools — and charters are legally forbidden from refusing any student for any reason. They have to take low performers, English learners, and disabled kids. Closed the achievement gaps between white and minority students! That’s practically the Holy Grail of education reform! And at half the cost! What more could you want?

Let’s just hold for a minute here and look at that achievement gap, because it’s distressing. Keep in mind that black children disproportionately attend some of America’s worst public schools, which poorer families cannot escape unless they can pay higher rent or mortgages to live in a better school district or private tuition fees. For a national overview of that problem, let’s start with latest federal high-school graduation stats:

What do we see? Almost 18 in 20 white kids graduate high school. Only about 15 in 20 black kids does.

Next, the latest national reading and math stats, because graduation rates are easier to juke (just pass kids whether they can read or cipher or not). Look at the proficiency rates of students about to graduate from high school, at grade 12. Just 7 percent of black kids are proficient in math when they graduate, and just 17 percent proficient in reading.

Notice how the white kids’ average quadruples or triples black kids’ proficiency rates. Closing the gap between these two — bringing the black kids’ average up that far — is crazy awesome. If they cared about black kids’ futures, the NAACP’s board would be begging more charter schools to open as quickly as possible, not demanding the opposite.

Results like this are probably a major reason black parents support charter schools and voucher programs at massively high levels. A national poll out this month showed that, if they could pick any schools they wanted for their kids, a plurality of 44 percent of black Americans would choose a private school. Obviously their preferences are not in line with NAACP’s stance against “school privatization” and supporting only traditional public schools.

Just a quarter of African-Americans would pick public schools if they had a choice in the matter; and 20 percent would pick a charter school. In that same poll, a whopping 74 percent of black respondents favored charter schools, and two-thirds supported vouchers and tax-credit scholarships. Clearly, the NAACP doesn’t represent most black families on this matter.

Enrollment patterns show a similar reality. According to the latest federal data, 27 percent of charter school students are black, more than double their proportion among the general population of 12 percent. About a million African-American children attend charter schools exclusively because of their parents’ choice to enroll them in those environments.

NAACP is telling these black parents they’ve made bad choices, that their individual success is a threat to their peers. That sounds like a more polished rendition of the “acting white” slur that says black kids who study hard and make something of themselves are somehow betraying peers who don’t make those choices.

In reality, again, the opposite is true. School choice not only gives poor and moderate-income parents education buying power and thus leverage equal to that of wealthy families, it cultivates the social capital and infrastructure money can’t buy, which is a far more fundamental precursor to success and ability to withstand adversity. Andy Smarick wrote movingly about this recently:

For instance, assigning students to schools by rote can undermine individual agency. Explicitly creating highly similar schools (PS 1, PS 2, PS 3, etc.) can be seen as homogenizing cities with vast diversity. Allowing only one public body to run schools, and then centralizing key decisions in its large bureauc­racy, can inhibit the initiatives of neighborhood leaders. And empowering a citywide elected board enables the priorities and values of the majority to take precedence over those of discrete communities and neighborhoods… Families, no longer merely told where to send their children to school, have collaborated to push for new types of schools and directed the evolution of existing schools. Educators, no longer merely assigned to a school by a district central office, have teamed up with colleagues to found new schools. A recent study on D.C.’s charter-school governance found that chartering has given hundreds of citizens (parents, lawyers, neighborhood leaders, business executives) an opportunity to participate more fully in schooling through seats on governing boards.

Black families are among those worst injured by poor public schools and our nation’s system of ZIP code-assigned schooling. Their choice to better their family and children is not made at the expense of other kids. In exercising these choices, black parents are creating better futures both for their children and for their communities. They should be celebrated, not condemned, for taking individual responsibility for their families and communities in this way.

This is yet another signal that organizations that purport to represent African-Americans often actually represent the opposite of what these citizens themselves think will give them a hope and a future. The NAACP’s refusal to represent not only the best interests but the expressed desires of a vast majority of their supposed constituents is a major strike against their credibility.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/18/naacp-tells-black-parents-keep-kids-crappy-schools-leverage-hike-taxes/,2016-10-18
A Medical Journal Descends Into Partisan Politics On Police And Racism,"Is the United States a fundamentally oppressive society, beset with entrenched “structural racism”? That is what many may believe after reading “Structural Racism and Supporting Black Lives—The Role of Health Professionals,” in the current edition of The New England Journal of Medicine.

Rachel R. Hardeman, Ph.D. and Katy B. Kozhimannil, Ph.D. (neither of whom are physicians) authored the piece along with Eduardo M. Medina, M.D., a family medicine physician at the Minneapolis-based Park Nicollet Clinic (who graduated from medical school all of three years ago). Their article is bitter and tendentious, using classical radical-leftist arguments and rhetoric one might encounter in the neo-Marxist manifesto of Black Lives Matter.

The New England Journal of Medicine appears eager to join the ranks of Hollywood and the mainstream media—not to mention other high profile, apolitical institutions—in touting progressive principles and rhetoric. In publishing this piece, the august and famous journal seems to have become an organ of the left’s propaganda machine.

What Philando Castile and Health Care Have In Common

Hardeman, the article’s lead (and sole African-American) author, told a St. Paul, Minnesota ABC News affiliate that she was inspired to write about “pervasive” societal racism after the fatal shooting of Philando Castile in July. The incident, which occurred during a traffic-stop in St. Paul the day after an officer-involved shooting in Baton Rouge, caught national attention. President Barack Obama declared at the time that such incidents were not isolated, but indicative of “racial disparities” inherent in the U.S. criminal-justice system.

The authors use the shooting tragedy as a springboard to launch their tirade against racially motivated police brutality. This is quickly conflated with the issue of disparities in health outcomes (which they attribute to racial bias), thus formulating the premise that clinical teaching, practice, and research are all tarnished by America’s history of white supremacy and slavery. Those who engage in medical practice in the United States are culpable by extension (or association), “despite [our] best efforts.”

Evidence for this claim, however, is not provided in any scientific sense. Instead, the reader is referred to other works that deal primarily with the various societal incarnations of racism, and how they have at times interfered with the practice of medicine.

Having admonished their audience, the authors proceed to sermonize on necessary lessons for the guilty reader. Adopting a stridently authoritarian and didactic tone, the authors mete out these instructions, proffering explanations that belittle, rather than educate, the reader. “First, learn about, understand and accept the United States’ racist roots,” they write. “Second, understand how racism has shaped our narrative around disparities.” “Third, define and name racism.”

Political Correctness Can’t Fix Medical Disparities

The authors conclude their manifesto by exhorting us to “center at the margins”—a thoroughly meaningless concept that appears to be another way of saying what they in fact spell out, in textbook Marxist-Black Lives Matter fashion: “helping to ensure that oppressed and underresourced people and communities gain positions of power.”

The authors’ withering, arrogant, and fraudulent perspective is, more than anything, an exercise in the art of moralizing and political correctness of the highest order. It is indeed a maladroit thesis with totalitarian overtones, framed in ideology rather than science. Its publication seems inappropriate for a prestigious medical journal whose mission is the publication of dispassionate medical science. Nevertheless, it no doubt pleases some (likely the Journal’s editors or their masters, judging by some of the shocked reactions of readers in the online comments section).

It is true that racial bias does play a significant role in the genesis of suboptimal health outcomes, particularly for African-Americans—but also for Hispanics, Native Americans, and other minorities. That infant mortality rates and many other parameters of the health of a society are so unevenly distributed—often in a pattern that accords with race and/or ethnicity—are egregious matters in need of correction.

But the authors, misleadingly, do not actually consider other reasons for these problems. Indeed, on some level, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control, statistics are improving (e.g., in heart disease, life expectancy, and deaths from any cause). This alone serves as a countervailing argument to any suggestion of stubborn structural racism.

On the subject of racially-determined disease, the authors might be interested to learn that people of African descent—as well as Hispanics, Asians, Australian aborigines, Maoris and others—are more predisposed to type 2 diabetes and certain diabetes-related complications than those of white ancestry, while unique challenges to treating high blood pressure in African-Americans are well-documented. These are health inequities that will persist no matter how sanctimonious one feels driven to be.

Addressing Bias Must Begin With the Community, Not the State

Dr. Keith C. Ferdinand, President of the Association of Black Cardiologists acknowledges that physicians must address three types of barriers in order to achieve treatment goals in all patients: patient-related, treatment-related, and physician-related barriers. With respect to the physician-related barriers—and to an extent, treatment-related barriers—there is no doubt that elements of racial bias continue to exist within the healthcare community.

However, this bias is almost always unconscious and unintentional. The automatic conclusion that such biases are therefore the result of an inherently racist system—the default argument of those on the Left—is a mischievous and intellectually dishonest attempt to perpetuate a narrative that coheres with their ideological worldview, and that succeeds in cultivating and maintaining a victimhood mentality.

The authors appear unwilling to address some of these hard realities in their demonization of American society. A more useful way of thinking about health disparities and inequities—rather than assuming racist attitudes and a victim mentality—might be to explore all the potential causative factors that potentially contribute to the problem. The national community-based organization PolicyLink proposes such a position. They consider the social and political determinants of health: the economic environment, social environment, physical environment, and access to necessary services.

Such a model relies on civic engagement and robust “mediating” institutions (schools, churches, and other community-based services), and is based on the concept of subsidiarity—the idea that social problems are best addressed by the nearest and smallest competent authority, rather than by a faraway state.

How to Empower African-American Communities

This of course is the antithesis to centralized bureaucracy. It is something the left would do well to consider, but will not—because it would diminish our reliance on the liberal philosophy of centralized power, governance, and redistribution of wealth. These are central planks of Democratic administrations. Any serious observer of American society over the last five or six decades—as Yuval Levin eloquently explains in The Fractured Republic—doesn’t need to be reminded how many times this has been tried and shown not to work.

Jason Riley, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a conservative African-American commentator, chronicled in his 2014 book Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed how Great Society-era government welfare programs, affirmative-action programs, and soft-on-crime laws (among other well-intentioned policies) have had the paradoxical effect of inhibiting the potential for black Americans to succeed. They’ve fostered a dependence mindset and made black neighborhoods more dangerous. In fact, these efforts form “massive barriers” to moving forward.

Another regrettably underappreciated social phenomenon prevalent among many African-American communities across the nation (although not unique to them) is, in the words of the economist Walter E. Williams, emblematic of “the decline of civility.” As Williams points out, the 1960s saw an attack on values that were elementary to civility, including a ban on corporal punishment and the launch of a liberal educational-establishment agenda that “undermined lessons children learned from their parents and their church.”

He continues: “Sex-education classes undermined family and church strictures against premarital sex [and teaching the merits] of abstinence were ridiculed… Further undermining of parental authority came with legal and extralegal measures to assist teenage abortions, often with neither parental knowledge, nor consent.” Williams argues that the abandonment of such traditional values has had a deleterious on society in general, asserting that “blacks have borne the greater burden… seen by the decline in the percentage of black two-parent families.”

The Social Justice Agenda Doesn’t Help Fight Racism

That last point cannot be overstated. Today, about 30 percent of black children live in an intact family. Illegitimacy among blacks is 73 percent, compared to 30 percent among whites (compared with 11 percent and 3 percent, respectively, in 1938). Leaders like the Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson champion communitarianism within African-American communities, seeking to fill the damaging void left by absent black fathers. Peterson describes this void in his book The Antidote: Healing America From the Poison of Hate, Blame and Victimhood. He has dedicated himself to providing psychological and spiritual support for members of his community disenfranchised by family enucleation, while also re-tooling them with life skills and leadership training. Unfortunately, too few such good men exist.

A highly influential medical journal repeats a false narrative that depicts the United States as a racist, villainous society.

As if the current conditions afflicting African-American civic and social cohesion weren’t problematic enough, the NAACP and the Democratic Party will soon vote on a resolution calling for a moratorium on charter schools. As The Wall Street Journal noted recently and again last week, black and Hispanic students who attend charter schools in New York City scored nearly 75 percent higher grades than their counterparts at local publicly-run schools, according to a recent analysis by Families for Excellent Schools. Thomas Sowell has been a prominent voice in drawing attention to this travesty.

This is not some trope pushed by African-American conservatives, as Joy Pullman of The Federalist notes in her detailed analysis of the issue. In an appeal to the NAACP in September, the160 black leaders called for an urgent meeting “to discuss the very serious implications the proposed resolution will have for Black families who want and deserve high-quality educational options for their children.”

In conclusion, the identity politics and social justice agenda of the NEJM opinion piece authors clearly seeks to promulgate, via a highly influential medical journal, a false narrative that depicts the United States as a racist, villainous society. In order to do so, they willfully ignore the inconvenient truths which give lie to their thesis. For its part, by giving space to Hardeman et al.’s vilification of America less than a month before the presidential election, the NEJM has clearly exceeded its mandate. It ought to be embarrassed.

Black Church Leaders Have A Message For Hillary On Religious Liberty,"A group of prominent African-American church leaders delivered a letter to Hillary Clinton on Monday calling on her to show them the same respect she shows “wealthy white donors.”

The letter, which is signed by 26 pastors and religious leaders, including Jacqueline Rivers of the Seymour Institute for Black Church and Policy Studies in Boston, states they’re concerned a Clinton presidency would mean their religious liberties would be under attack. In the letter, these leaders criticized Clinton for surrounding herself with individuals who are so hostile to religion.

“Key players on your staff have sought to subvert Catholic teaching on sexuality by planting externally funded groups in the church to advance a politically correct agenda,” the letter states, referring to an e-mail from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta calling on Catholics to overthrow the church’s “middle ages dictatorship.”

“What would you do as president to guarantee that religious freedoms are balanced against civil rights rather than being trumped by them?” they asked Clinton.

The structural failures which stalk inner-city communities and promote nihilism and violence among our young men are a challenge to the courage and faith of the black church. As the primary institution of our neighborhoods, the church has the resources to minister to these young men both materially and spiritually, to give them hope in the future and a path to a new life. The work of the black church in our poor communities is of the utmost importance and the importance of our freedom to operate in accordance with our faith cannot be overstated.

These leaders are also concerned about the impact abortion, unemployment, and police killings of unarmed black men have on their community and they want to know what Hillary Clinton plans to do about these.

The letter urges Clinton to meet and discuss issues facing the black community within her first 100 days in office if she wins the election.

"Black Americans Rightly Worry Euthanasia Will Target The Vulnerable, Like Them","The Washington DC City Council plans to vote today on legalizing assisted suicide, after postponing the vote in October when the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition urged people to voice their opposition. EPC says the council delayed because they didn’t have the votes to pass the bill.

Even if they pass it, it faces an uphill battle. It would need to be passed two more times, and then Mayor Muriel Bowser must sign it into law. Yet her health director has openly opposed it, saying it violates her Hippocratic Oath. And the bill has come under increasing scrutiny.

Some worry the bill is nothing more than a way to euthanize poor black citizens of Washington DC, a fear outlined in the Washington Post. While several states have legalized assisted suicide, the black population is smaller in those states, and black Americans are much more likely to oppose assisted suicide, much to the consternation of activist organization Compassion and Choices.

“They are afraid that somebody is going to take advantage of them the way they have been taken advantage of in the past,” said Omega Silva. Silva is a black physician who works for Compassion and Choices, which is trying to get the DC legislation passed. But while Compassion and Choices has been trying to reach out to residents of DC’s black neighborhoods, they haven’t been making much impact. At an outreach event last month, for example, only three people showed up.

These Concerns Are Legit

Leona Redmond, a community activist fighting the legislation, fears that poor, elderly black citizens will be targeted for assisted suicide. She notes politicians are more concerned with cutting health-care costs than they are with providing quality end-of-life care. “Because of Jim Crow laws . . . we didn’t have the opportunity to have the same jobs, to have the same insurance, the same retirement benefits,” Redmond said. “It’s really aimed at old black people. It really is.”

According to the Washington Post, only one black person has chosen to undergo assisted suicide in Oregon, one of the first states to legalize it. But the precedent set there, and other states around the country, have taught us that citizens like Redmond are right to be concerned.

Earlier this year, for example, California legalized assisted suicide. California resident Stephanie Packer, a wife and mother to four children, is fighting terminal cancer. Originally, her insurance company agreed to pay for another chemotherapy treatment. Just one week after the assisted suicide legislation was passed, however, Packer received a letter: now, they would not cover her chemotherapy, but they would pay for her assisted suicide, which would cost the insurance company mere dollars.

“It was like someone had just hit me in the gut,” Packer said. “As soon as this law was passed, patients fighting for a longer life end up getting denied treatment, because this will always be the cheapest option… it’s hard to financially fight.”

Packer’s story is told in the documentary “Compassion and Choice DENIED” from The Center for Bioethics and Culture Network. It’s available free of charge:

Pushing Sick People to Kill Themselves

Packer, who leads support groups for people suffering from terminal or chronic illnesses, says she’s already seen a difference since assisted suicide was legalized. Rather than talking about the things they love in their life, or encouraging each other, people became more depressed, she said. She believes part of that is because marketing for assisted suicide devalues the lives of people living with terminal illnesses, while romanticizing suicide.

“It makes terminally ill patients feel ‘less than,’ that they are not worthy of that fight, that they’re not worth it,” Packer argued. But as long as assisted suicide is the cheaper option, then insurance companies and the government will push for it, instead of going for the more expensive, and more difficult, solution. “We can start to fix our broken health-care system, and people will start to live instead of feeling like they have to choose to die,” she said.

Sadly, Packer is hardly alone. In states where assisted suicide is legal, it is all too common for insurance companies to deny life-saving treatment while offering to pay instead for lethal drugs. Aspects of the DC bill are deeply problematic, and can lead to exactly these kind of issues. It specifies the doctor as the one who chooses if the patient is eligible for assisted suicide, rather than the patient. The bill does not require a psychological exam before approving the assisted suicide, meaning that someone suffering from depression or mental illness will not be ruled out.

Most disturbingly, the bill encourages coercing people who are already vulnerable. The heir to the patient’s estate, someone who would financially benefit from the patient’s death, is not only allowed to witness the request for assisted suicide but also allowed to pick up the fatal prescription.

It’s bad enough that someone suffering from a terminal illness could already feel like a burden to his or her loved ones; imagine how much more difficult it would be to fight suicidal feelings when you have a family member who is literally watching you sign your own death warrant and picking up the drugs to make sure you go through with it. Add in the coercion patients face in other states when they are denied payment for treatment of their disease, but assisted suicide is covered, and you have a recipe for disaster.

Compassion Isn’t This Sinister

The assisted suicide lobby has a lot invested in seeing legalization in all 50 states, so has romanticized its cause. Instead of calling it what it is—suicide—it’s referred to as “death with dignity.” Evidently, fighting for your life is undignified. It’s a massive insult to those who do choose to fight for their lives, who choose not to kill themselves.

Maggie Karner, a woman who had to glioblastoma multiforme, the same deadly kind of brain cancer that afflicted widely publicized assisted suicide patient Brittany Maynard, spoke fiercely against assisted suicide and the effect it could have on patients fighting terminal illnesses.

“I get strength and comfort from the knowledge that nobody is going to give up on me — medically, psychologically or holistically. Right now, I have the firm support of the state and my fellow citizens in my desire to live — no matter the cost or burden,” Karner said. “If that were to change, the tiny knowledge that I might be straining my family, friends, doctors or community resources unnecessarily would be a heavy burden. The constant ‘option’ for suicide would wear at my resolve and I fear, become an unspoken ‘duty’ for me and others.”

Karner ultimately succumbed to her disease, with the bravery and dignity assisted suicide advocates would steal from her.

Such laws are promoted as a compassionate way to help people who are dying, but the reality is far more sinister. The company promoting it so heavily, Compassion and Choices, is not some benign organization that just wants the terminally ill to be able to peacefully die by doctor-prescribed medication.

Formerly known as “the Hemlock Society,” Compassion and Choices doesn’t only want the terminally ill to be able to kill themselves. They also want people who are mentally ill, elderly, or disabled to be eligible for assisted suicide. They have published a booklet pushing “VSED”: voluntary stop eating and drinking, for “people who are not seriously ill, but are simply ‘done.’”

It is vital that the DC Council does not allow this bill to pass, and even more importantly, we must stop with this idea that assisted suicide is a dignified way to die. Someone who is terminally ill, disabled, bedridden, elderly, poor, or mentally ill still has a life of value, dignity, and intrinsic worth. That’s what we should be telling people who seek out assisted suicide.

Instead, groups like Compassion and Choices exist like vultures, eager to take money from people when they are at their absolute lowest and most vulnerable, feeding into their darkest thoughts and fears and confirming the suicidal thoughts running through their minds. Assisted suicide may be easier than improving how the health-care system handles end-of-life care, but that doesn’t make it the right thing to do.

‘House Of Privilege’ Dramas Teach College Students Crippling Lies,"The University of North Carolina at Greensboro has invited students to tour the “House of Privilege,” in which students go from room to room, exploring “different types of privilege” and discovering “resources to help dismantle systems of privilege in our community.”

Using a “museum approach” with actors playing the roles of oppressed and privileged people, they display different forms of inequality, “highlighting the construct of privilege and providing Windows of Opportunity; the resources that can be used to start disassembling privilege in multiple forms” (emphasis added).

If that doesn’t give you the creeps, I don’t know what will. No longer are social justice warriors concerned about highlighting the needs of the poor in our communities and finding ways to meet those needs (usually through wealth redistribution), they are focusing on “dismantling systems of privilege.”

Making Everyone Equal Requires Oppressive Force

This evolution of the social justice agenda was inevitable, of course. The Great Society with its socialistic effort to redistribute wealth in order to bring about economic equality was doomed to fail because, as Margaret Thatcher said, “The problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.” No matter how much you redistribute, it’s never enough. Economic equality in a free and just society is a myth.

There will always be oppressed groups and individuals as long as people are free to be, speak, act, and even dream.

Now, with the social justice agenda extending beyond economic interests and aiming for absolute equality in all areas of human existence, the effort is even more hopeless. If you define inequality as “oppression” and “privilege” as anything that is contrary to, more successful than, or just different from a particular “oppressed group,” then there is no real path to equality without force. In other words, we would have to sacrifice liberty on the altar of equality.

That’s because this “oppression” supposedly created by privilege isn’t real oppression. It’s just differences between individuals and groups based on a variety of factors, none of which involve sanctioned cruel and unjust treatment by a more powerful group. If oppression is so broadly defined to include inequalities of outcome and natural disparities, which are part and parcel of a free society, then there will always be oppressed groups and individuals as long as people are free to be, speak, act, and even dream.

The originators of the House of Privilege, however, believe equality can be achieved by dismantling “oppressive systems.” In their campaign, students go into different rooms where actors present scenarios of different kinds of privilege. Those who benefit from them, of course, are “oppressors.”

See the Oppression Inherent in the System!

What are these oppressive systems, you ask? Who are these nasty oppressors holding so many in bondage? Here are just a few of the scenarios, because if you really think about it, they can be legion.

Food privilege: One family eats McDonalds, while another feasts on steaks.

Religious privilege: Everyone knows Christmas songs, but no one knows the Diwali songs.

Gender privilege: A man is a CEO, while a woman is a secretary.

Able-bodied privilege: One person is forced to live in a wheelchair because of a handicap, while another gets to walk around because he’s able-bodied.

Racial privilege: A black family lives in poverty with gunshots outside the window, while a white family lives in peace and quiet in the suburbs.

Sexual orientation privilege: A straight couple enjoys housewarming gifts after getting married, while the gay couple is ignored. Or a pretty straight girl is crowned homecoming queen, while the transsexual boy who thinks he’s a girl isn’t even allowed on the court.

Language privilege: English-speaking people read road signs with ease, while Spanish-speaking people are left confused and disoriented.

Here’s a video from one college reporting on how this is presented in a House of Privilege:

This program is an extension of another called Tunnel of Oppression, in which students are exposed to various forms of discrimination and oppression while walking through different theaters. Here’s a video from Southern Illinois University showing this program and its effect on students. If it reminds you of brainwashing tactics, you’ve got it just about right.

Because Everyone Doesn’t Have All Good Things, Nobody Should?

The root problem with the House of Privilege and Tunnel of Oppression is that while activities like this sometimes identify real struggles and difficulties in society, they typically offer no real solutions. That’s because their definition of oppression and privilege are built on Marxist paradigms that have no legitimacy in a free republic like America.

For there to be oppression, someone must be the victim and someone else must be the oppressor. In all of the scenarios of “privilege” listed above, who are the oppressors? What are the “systems of privilege” that are oppressing these underprivileged groups and individuals? Are rich people oppressing poor people? Are white families in suburbia oppressing black families living in the city? Are Christians who celebrate Christmas oppressing Hindus who celebrate Diwali?

How will dissembling the white family bring opportunity to the black family?

Let me put it this way: Will it really help the black family in a violent neighborhood where jobs are scarce to dismantle the livelihood, homes, and jobs of white families in suburbia? How will dissembling the white family bring opportunity to the black family?

How will dismantling the religious system of Christianity bring equality to the religious system of Hinduism? Remember, the goal of the House of Privilege is not simply to bring awareness about minority groups and their struggles. It’s to “dismantle systems of privilege.” It’s inherently destructive. Think about what that means. It means breaking apart not only economic systems (capitalism), but disrupting and dismantling relationships and organic associations.

In America and on college campuses engaging in this kind of propaganda (and that’s what it is), the privileged groups are clear: men, whites, the able-bodied, capitalists, Christians, English-speakers, and heterosexuals. These are the “systems” that need to be destroyed and rebuilt in the image of another. If you are part of any of these “systems,” then you’re an oppressor who should feel guilty about your oppression, and, therefore, give up your privilege (i.e., your property, achievements, recognition, even rights).

Men need to give way to the demands of women. White neighborhoods must reflect qualities of black neighborhoods. English must be removed as the dominant language and another must come alongside or take its place. Christians must embrace pluralism. Capitalism must be replaced with socialism and ultimately communism. Heterosexual families must recognize the equality of homosexual couples even though they are fundamentally and biologically different due to the latter’s inability to produce children.

As you can see, the goal of the SJW House of Privilege is not really equality, it’s power. It doesn’t value liberty, it rejects it. It doesn’t celebrate differences, it undermines them. It doesn’t respect individuality, it exploits it. It doesn’t expand human nature, it reduces it. It tears apart human relationships and human nature and seeks to put them together again according to its own impulses and subjective values.

Making Everyone the Same Ends Excellence

At what point will human beings be equal in this scheme? Because human beings, societies, and groups are different in every way, we would have to reduce them down to the most basic commonality to achieve true “equality.” Ultimately, because each individual is different from the next, for them to be “equal” they must become isolated entities stripped of their differences and grouped together in a hive for mere functionality.

Are you an oppressor because you don’t suffer from a handicap or some sort of illness? No.

Is that what Americans want? Are you an oppressor because you’re a man and you’re physically stronger than a woman, making you unique and equipped to perform certain roles a woman can’t possibly perform? Are you an oppressor because you want to engage with other men without women around? No. That’s nature.

Are you an oppressor because you’re white and live in a safe environment compared to where some black people live? Are you privileged because you’re white and you were raised in a two-parent home? Are you privileged because you worked your way through school and now have a job or because your parents worked hard and put you through school, and you now have employment while some black people might not? No. That’s personal responsibility.

Are you an oppressor because you’re a married heterosexual couple and now have children together, a joining that is recognized by the state because of the public interest in the birth of that child? Are you privileged because you’re an actual mother married to your child’s father, not an artificial construct that robs the child of one parent or the other? No. That’s biology.

Are you an oppressor because you don’t suffer from a handicap or some sort of illness? No. That’s, again, nature.

Are you an oppressor because you built a business with your own two hands and through your own personal investments you are now making a profit from your hard work, enabling you to take vacations, buy a big house, and eat steak for dinner? No. That’s, again, personal responsibility.

Freedom Results in Differences

What all of these add up to is individual liberty and the diversity that goes with it. People are different. They are born different. They make different choices in life, some productive, some not. They have differing abilities and histories. This diversity is going to result in different outcomes and situations in a free society. Every person’s journey is unique and valuable. People should be respected, not derided, for their differences. Those who have more are not privileged, and they’re certainly not oppressive. They are simply living their life as free individuals.

The only path to unity in that scheme is for a powerful individual or group to reduce everyone to the lowest common denominator and control their lives.

Those who suffer in America are not oppressed. Black people aren’t oppressed by whites. Women aren’t oppressed by men. Spanish-speakers aren’t oppressed by English-speakers. Disabled people aren’t oppressed by able-bodied people. Poor people aren’t oppressed by rich people. Do these groups always treat one another with kindness and respect? No—and that goes both ways. But that is not oppression. That’s bad behavior.

America is not a House of Privilege. Our communities are not divided into the oppressed and the privileged—not yet, anyway. America is a House of Unity—e pluribus unum. Out of the many, one. Everyone comes together, different religions, ethnicities, and abilities because we share a common commitment to individual liberty and equality before the law (not equality of outcome)—or at least we used to.

SJWs’ goal is the opposite. They see America as “the many,” then pit one group against another, dividing each into the oppressed and the oppressors. The only path to unity in that scheme is for a powerful individual or group to reduce everyone to the lowest common denominator and control their lives.

This is ultimately dehumanizing, as it requires ripping away the individuality and freedom of each person until each becomes an unremarkable unit among the many—the one coexisting but not connecting with others, as all “systems” of human relationships are dismantled and “houses of privilege” with their diverse rooms are rebuilt into a collective, unified hive ruled by the most powerful. The result is not liberty, but tyranny.

America is not a land fraught with privilege and oppression. It is a country of freedom and responsibility. There will be those who struggle for whatever reason, and it is the duty of a moral and charitable people to help those in need. The goal of Americans should be to build one another up as free individuals who are valued because they are objectively valuable, made in the image of God. Our goal should not be to tear one another down (a.k.a. “dismantle”) in the name of equality, but to honor and respect one another in the name of liberty and charity.

"If You’re Looking For Dark Satire, ‘Black Mirror’ Has You Haunted","Critics are fond of the phrase “five minutes in the future” (it used to be 20; things have sped up) to describe creator and chief writer Charlie Brooker’s dark near-future anthology series “Black Mirror,” series three of which dropped on Netflix last month.

It’s not quite science fiction. No alien invasions or apocalypses necessary: In “Black Mirror” we’ve built our own prisons of social media, of screen-saturated soft authoritarianism, still struggling to harness the amazing technological appendages we’ve grafted onto our all-too-human selves. The show asks: As we spend our days staring into those black mirrors, just what is looking back?

Satire is hard to do without coming off as lecturing or smug. But Brooker’s background in dark comedy lets him dodge those twin dilemmas (he was the mastermind behind the underappreciated zombie drama “Dead Set”). But for those pleasantly creeped out by the first two series, series three may feel a touch dour and predictable.

Dark Pleasures of the Future

Extrapolating to the near-future may be the toughest trick for fictional world-builders. Evoking the past involves research and costume design. For the far-flung future, one can make up whatever customs and creatures you like.

But tweaking what the world may look like a few years out is a more subtle affair, and Brooker’s worlds, next door to our own, are chillingly convincing. We can see them from here: A system that records everything you do, see, or hear and never forgets. A “block” function for real life. A TV personality’s surprisingly strong run for office (Wait, what?).

After two series comprising seven episodes, “Black Mirror” migrated from the United Kingdom’s Channel 4 to Netflix, and with the move comes an expanded running time and more diverse locations. British television tends to be parsimonious, so it would be petulant to complain about these supersized American helpings. Still, “Black Mirror” probably goes down better in bite-size portions; anthologies aren’t particularly built for binge-watching.

The first episode back in 2011, the quickly notorious “The National Anthem,” featured the kidnapping of a member of the British royal family, Princess Susannah, her life hinging on one unspeakable condition: The prime minister must have sex with a pig, live on national television. Hard to top that premise, and give Brooker points for bravery for not, um, chickening out. There’s nothing quite that shocking in the new batch, but there are dark pleasures in all of them.

Let’s Go Episode by Episode

I’ll loosely rank the six episodes of the new series in descending order of merit, though your mileage may vary.

“Nosedive” may be the most affecting. Think Uber uber alles: social media as life and death, where interactions with your fellow humans are instantly rated on a 1 to 5 scale, with social and career penalties for those who drop too far. It follows Lucie Pound’s “nosedive” into hell while getting to the wedding of her more highly rated childhood friend—Pound’s ticket to elite status.

The journey devolves into a series of “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” fiascoes that strip away Pound’s social veneer and social rank. The climactic wedding scene featuring Pound (played perfectly by Bryce Dallas Howard) delivering her bridesmaid speech is a masterstroke of cringe-making catharsis. This episode feels the closest to the satire of the first two series.

“San Junipero” opens at an unbearably 1987 nightclub, featuring the most unspeakable clothes and most disposable pop of the era. Impossibly clichéd until you suspect that may be the point, it becomes an unlikely lesbian romance that eclipses time and space, and perhaps death and reality itself. It escapes the hopeless claustrophobic feel of the other stories, allowing for humanity and hope. A possible ominous sign: Critics and viewers consider “San Junipero” a series favorite, while also calling it a change of pace.

“Shut Up and Dance” has no dancing or humor of any kind. It’s the dankest, darkest, most intense entry, and may disturb you the longest. We follow the desperate exploits of two strangers, unwillingly thrown together, racing against time to commit a horrible act before an unseen social media blackmailer unleashes their darkest secrets, virally stolen from their devices.

“Hated in the Nation,” the last and longest episode, has a conventional crime-thriller pacing. It’s set in London amid an investigation into a deadly “unpopularity contest” where social media pariahs aren’t just murdered metaphorically. When you hear about mechanized bees, you don’t need spoilers to figure out the angle, but getting there is still pretty intense.

“Men Against Fire” (another odd title) follows a platoon of futuristic soldiers tasked with wiping out subhuman creatures—“roaches,” in military parlance—when one soldier’s eyepiece technology begins to malfunction in sinister ways (half the episodes involve eye tech). One can guess the general thrust, but it still delivers a good new twist on the dehumanization of war, risking preachiness but achieving surprising poignancy.

“Playtest” is a total immersion “haunted house” videogame test that goes—you guessed it—awry. There’s some novelty, and the setting is suitably jumpy, quiet, and creepy, although the ending renders much of what’s transpired pointless.

“Black Mirror’s” premise is so thrilling one wishes the individual stories were a little more adventurous: A scintillatingly queasy-making format that never quite produces undeniably classic TV (although the pig one may qualify). Perhaps the world is moving so swiftly underneath us that even satire set “five minutes in the future” can’t help but fall a few minutes behind.

Still, if the sweet, huggable sincerity of that other Netflix offering “Stranger Things” pushed you away, the dark embrace of “Black Mirror” may be just the box of dark chocolate you crave.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/11/youre-looking-dark-satire-black-mirror-haunted/,2016-11-11
"If Trump Voters Are Racists, Why Do His Protestors Demand Segregation?","Throughout 2016, Americans were told that Donald Trump’s supporters were a bunch of mouth-breathing losers who were mindlessly following an orange-faced xenophobe. It was impossible for Trump to win because the only reason people might vote for him was to Make America Racist Again, so Hillary Clinton would totally win in a landslide, or so we were told.

Then Election Day came, Trump won by a significant electoral margin, and the media melted down. Everyone was shocked — shocked! — by the billionaire’s win because they hadn’t even attempted to understand the forces that compelled 60 million Americans to cast a vote in his favor.

As Federalist editor Mollie Hemingway pointed out on Sunday, this would be a good time for some humility and self-reflection among the media. Instead, many are now doubling down and insisting that Trump’s support can be attributed to nothing more than a “whitelash.” Others go even further and say his supporters don’t deserve to be listened to because they voted for someone icky.

One such example is a piece by Jamelle Bouie, who made an intellectually lazy case for why all of Trump’s supporters are a bunch of racist knuckle-draggers in a piece entitled “There’s No Such Thing As A Good Trump Voter.” He writes:

Donald Trump ran a campaign of racist demagoguery against Muslim Americans, Hispanic immigrants, and black protesters. He indulged the worst instincts of the American psyche and winked to the stream of white nationalists and anti-Semites who backed his bid for the White House. Millions of Americans voted for this campaign, thus elevating white nationalism and white reaction to the Oval Office. [. . . ] To face those facts and then demand empathy for the people who made them a reality—who backed racist demagoguery, whatever their reasons—is to declare Trump’s victims less worthy of attention than his enablers. To insist Trump’s backers are good people is to treat their inner lives with more weight than the actual lives on the line under a Trump administration. At best, it’s myopic and solipsistic. At worst, it’s morally grotesque.

I’m not going to spend much time attacking the premise of his article — that Trump voters should be put into a corner and ignored because they are all bad. As Federalist publisher Ben Domenech pointed out last week, this kind of talk is what caused the media to end up with egg on their face on election night. Their decision to double down on the “America is racist” narrative will only drive a wedge between media elites and citizens who have legitimate concerns about the direction of this country, rendering their predictions and reporting ultimately useless.

I want to draw attention to something I observed while reading Bouie’s piece. I recently wrote about a group of students at the University of Michigan who are joining nationwide campus walk-outs in protest against Trump’s electoral victory by demanding separate campus facilities for students of color. The group hosting the campus-wide class walkout at the University of Michigan describes themselves as “a group of students who organize to target inequities on our campus,” according to their Facebook page, which displays Black Panthers imagery.

Here’s what they have to say about Trump (emphasis added):

Trump is a product of white supremacy. White supremacy is responsible. . . We reject this white supremacist, this rapist, this xenophobic, Islamophobic, classist, misogynistic, queerphobic, and racist system to have authority over our lives. Trump is a symbol for larger structures of oppression that gave birth to him.

I see little, if any, rhetorical difference between what these student protestors are saying and what Bouie is espousing, which can be summed up as: Trump and his supporters are icky racists.

The purpose of the walk-out and subsequent march is to draw attention to the students’ list of demands, which includes separate facilities for black students to keep them safe from all the white, racist Trump supporters. They’re also calling for special security forces to protect only African-American students, because the Trump-endorsing police can’t be trusted.

“The University of Michigan must provide funding and paid staffing positions for a Black space on campus specifically designed as a recreational and safe space for Black people at the University,” their list states. “Resources for protecting Black students cannot be channeled to University police. The police, as a union, has endorsed Trump. Placing us in the police’s care is an act of anti-Black violence.”

So this is where we are now: campus protestors are demanding black students be segregated from white students to protect them from the Trump supporters who lie in their midst. And liberal media elites, who share more blame for Trump’s path to the White House than they would like to admit, are saying that all of his supporters are irredeemable, racist pieces of trash who deserve to be ignored.

If one thing drove Trump supporters to the polls, it’s that they were ignored and slandered by pundits like Bouie. What’s more, the protests and cry-ins taking place on campuses across the country in response to Trump’s victory suggest that Trump’s supporters will continue to be ignored by the next generation of diploma-holding elites.

The divisions between black and white, haves and have-nots, will continue to get worse if we choose to plug our ears and shout at the 60 million “deplorables” who voted for the president-elect. Media types and social justice warriors must be willing to eat a little humble pie, and stop demanding they be separated from the rest of America, or risk becoming even more out-of-touch and irrelevant than they already are.

U-M Protesters Demand Separate But Equal Space For Black Students,"In response to Donald Trump’s electoral victory, students at the University of Michigan are planning a campus-wide class walkout Wednesday afternoon. They’re demanding segregated campus space for students of African-American descent.

The event is hosted by Students 4 Justice at The University of Michigan, a group of students “who organize to target inequities on our campus,” according to their Facebook page, which features Black Panthers imagery.

“Trump is a product of white supremacy,” their Facebook page outlining the message of the protest states. “White supremacy is responsible. . . The University must place the safety of its students first and foremost. Most of a University’s population now have their lives at risk. The University must protect us with every power it has available.”

To keep students safe, the group is demanding the university provide separate but equal facility spaces on campus for black students.

The University of Michigan must provide funding and paid staffing positions for a Black space on campus specifically designed as a recreational and safe space for Black people at the University. The University must offer more academic support services for Black students. Resources for protecting Black students cannot be channeled to University police. The police, as a union, has endorsed Trump. Placing us in the police’s care is an act of anti-Black violence.

The idea of segregating black students isn’t anything new. Until 1954, states were allowed to pass laws establishing separate educational facilities for black and white students as long as they were “equal.” The Supreme Court determined in a unanimous ruling that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,” and required states to integrate public schools — a huge victory for the civil rights movement.

University of Michigan students aren’t the only college protestors demanding separate campus facilities for African American students. At the University of California-Berkeley, students slapped eviction notices on a campus store last month and demanded the building be re-purposed for students of color and people who label themselves LGBTQIIA+.

I’m A Black Voter. Here’s Why I Pulled The Lever For Trump,"I am one of the black men who voted for Donald Trump. Apparently we represent 13 percent of the black male vote. I actually find the number refreshing. It shows we are not a complete monolith in thought. We fall squarely out of the mainstream media’s idea of a Trump supporter mostly because it makes little sense to construct us as racist (although I’m not saying we can’t be).

The blog Verysmartbrothas took it upon themselves to categorize us. The gist of the article says a black man would vote for Trump “because some niggas is stupid.” These “stupid” niggas have had their brains fried by whiteness, the article says. A glance at the comments will show further offensive descriptions, including a hypothetical older black man who is wedded to misogyny and “keeping women in their place.”

Because I am neither stupid nor old, I feel as though the voice of a real black man who voted for Trump should be heard.

Stop Politicizing Black People

My stance on the role politics plays in the everyday life of black Americans was so aptly described by Walter Williams just this week. That role is very little, and politicizing black people is mostly fool’s gold. The issues that plague our community, as Williams pointed out, have not been assuaged by years of Democratic rule in predominantly black cities.

It effectively suppresses any opposing view from minorities so the loudest race hustlers can operate with little scrutiny.

Black people often hold high political offices in these cities, like mayor or police chief. Some will point to this as all the evidence necessary to conclude that politics is not enough for us. If the overarching perspective is that black people are not in control of their own destiny, it suggests that anything short of black people holding 100 percent of high political offices is not enough.

Even then we still have to accept that a few will inevitably be infected by whiteness. This ludicrous notion, often used to brand people as race traitors, turns being white into an ideology that might take over someone like the enemy from invasion of the body snatchers. It effectively suppresses any opposing view from minorities so the loudest race hustlers can operate with little scrutiny from what would be their greatest adversaries.

Let’s Ask Ourselves the Hard Questions

Turning whiteness into a Marvel villain is not a battle that can be won. Black Americans’ collective problems are really individual problems, and until that is understood, there can be no moving forward. Like any other group in America, black Americans are in control of their own destiny.

The school district in which I went to high school has had an all-black school board for many years, but that has done little to improve the performance of the predominantly black student body. Blacks elected or volunteering to act in our interest can no longer be given a pass. The pain of facing reality by looking in the mirror might be too great a burden for many black people to bear, but for those who do, it can be a way to finally allow old wounds to heal.

Shelby Steele has written what I consider the most eloquent arguments in favor of reframing the black-white race issue in order to address what is actually going on today. Before insisting racism is an institutional problem instead of an individual problem, one should consider his own experiences.

This requires asking tough questions like “How much racism have I faced personally? Have I experienced debilitating physical or emotional harm as a result of the actions of someone of another race? Were that person’s actions really guided by racism? Am I doing everything I possibly can to ensure that my own personal goals are met?” When facing themselves this way, everyday black people often express the capacity to move forward and hope for the best.

We Need to Hold Our Leaders Accountable

The real issue lies with the so-called black leadership, like the NAACP that condemns rather than welcomes charter schools despite charters’ positive effects on many black children. This preaches a divisive message that further obscures how politics might actually help black communities.

The most egregious offense these anachronistic leaders commit is poisoning younger minds.

The most egregious offense these anachronistic leaders commit is poisoning younger minds. These leaders ensure their continued survival by recruiting younger blacks into their ranks. The very individuals that might have the capacity to actually influence politics in a manner that might be to our collective benefit are given the tribal Kool-Aid to drink long before their brains are even fully developed.

Recent generations of black Americans have faced much less manifest racism and even far less discrimination than those of the past. Unlike them, though, we have been indoctrinated into identity politics. It is no coincidence that many Black Panther members were college-educated and that radicalizing individuals’ black identity still happens on college campuses. The contemporary term for this is “woke.”

The Woke Gospel

There are two types of black people: those who are woke and those who are not. This awakening does not have to occur in college; all college-educated black folks are not woke. Becoming woke now includes accepting a hodgepodge of contemporary theories like privilege theory and radical feminism.

A failure to adopt these views can leave a black person on the outside looking in.

This co-opting is a result of the mishmash that is identity politics. The proverbial grab bag that comprises the oppression gospel preached at contemporary colleges and universities makes being “woke” a standard for all students. I praise students and faculty of all backgrounds who push back against this message. Being told by an individual that you’re being racist or sexist can be a wake-up call. Being told by your institution of higher learning that you’re racist and sexist due to coincidences of birth is downright deplorable. It is also the greatest threat to the type of free thinking a higher education is supposed to foster.

It is a great irony that a mark of black authenticity is so deeply associated with liberal ideas and theories formed at elite higher ed institutions, often by people who are not even themselves black. These notions have now permeated the mainstream, and a failure to adopt these views can leave a black person on the outside looking in.

A View from the Outside

A white person who is not woke will simply be branded a racist and perhaps a misogynist, since the two so easily go hand-in-hand. But a black person doing it is a cardinal sin. I happen to have become woke in reverse. I attended a predominantly black high school and college. In spite of a few glaring issues, some related to racial homogeneity and others not so much, I received a fine education.

My recent conversion came only when I finally attended a predominantly white institution. In graduate school, the so-called wokeness I had been subject to finally faced real scrutiny. The scrutiny did not come from racism or the mass of white people that surrounded me. It instead was my first experience being in an environment with overt leftist political leanings.

This can often be avoided in a predominantly black educational environment because a great benefit of racial homogeneity is allowing for students to pursue educational goals unimpeded by identity politics. Politicization feels truly optional in a racially homogenous setting, but at a big, racially diverse university, it feels like an imperative.

In the process of negotiating a real relationship with politics, I happened upon Thomas Sowell. Like him and a few other black conservatives, I started out as a Marxist socialist. To be honest, I had been woke as long as I could remember. I had to eat a big piece of humble pie and accept that I had also been wrong. On the surface, I voted for Bernie Sanders in June and then Trump in November. Underneath all that was finally a real reconciliation of myself.

Why I Voted for Trump

There wasn’t a whole lot to like about Trump as a candidate, but there was less to like about Hillary Clinton. Whether or not the great panderer has hot sauce in her bag is of no concern to me. Whether she compromised the security of our country is important to me. My father and brother have considerable high-level military experience and both agreed anyone else would probably be serving jail time right now for committing the same offenses.

m

Despite this, I made it a point to try and drown out the nonsense and vote based on the issues. The most pertinent issue for me was Clinton potentially appointing an activist judge to the Supreme Court, of which the ramifications would most likely be felt long after she is gone. The next was if she would continue President Obama’s legacy of increasing the role the federal government plays in just about every aspect of American life, from how we’re educated to how we make our cars move. I did not want to be complicit in electing a woman I thought would run roughshod over Americans’ constitutional rights (although I did think she would win).

Maybe we members of the 13 percent think Trump will be more open to governing the type of America we want to live in once he’s actually in office. His actions as president-elect have been quite comforting. It seems that expecting he would put people around him like Gen. James Mattis to make up for his shortcomings was a good bet.

The recent first 100 days email Trump’s camp sent out asking his supporters to rank the importance of certain issues is also quite reassuring. The ones that stuck out to me were No. 3, about appointing a strong constitutionalist to the Supreme Court, No. 23, about bringing an end to Common Core, and No. 24, about bolstering school choice and using education dollars to empower parents.

I voted for Trump because once I drowned out the media circus my personal inclinations led me to believe the best-case scenario for his presidency was that he just might facilitate a government that would provide the path of least resistance to prosperity for not only black Americans but for all Americans.

Dear Journalists: Read More Than Wikipedia Before Declaring Trump’s Election Was A Black Swan Event,"In the wake of the election, Politico Magazine ran a story calling Donald Trump the “Black Swan President,” suggesting Trump’s election was the first we’ve seen Nassim Taleb’s concept of low probability, high-impact events in U.S. politics.

His colorful response to their request for his contribution to their story should have been the first sign of trouble for this piece, which seems limited to a very “Wikipedia” understanding of Taleb’s work. Trump’s election was no Black Swan event. The error here lies in the misunderstanding of Black Swan probability.

The Nature of Black Swans

The essence of Taleb’s theory is that the single observation of a black swan would undo a long-standing belief that all swans are white. In hindsight, it made sense that swans could be black, but biases prevented conventional wisdom from this possibility.

Black Swans satisfy three conditions, according to Taleb’s preface:

The event is an outlier—it is outside the realm of regular expectations, and nothing of the past can point to its possibility.

It carries an extreme impact.

Human nature causes us to rationalize it in hindsight, making it seem as if it was predictable.

At this point, Trump may seem to have been an outlier, whose election is an extreme event to some, and there is no shortage of articles explaining in hindsight why he won.

While the “extreme impact” is effectively unknown (he hasn’t even taken office) and debatable, the root error is in the nature of outliers and probability. Had Politico’s authors read all the way to at least Table 1 in Taleb’s book, they would have read the differentiation between Mediocristan and Extremistan.

Mediocristan is where things tend to be more predictable, bland, and normal. Probabilities fit Gaussian bell curves (think political polls).

Extremistan, on the other hand, is Black Swan territory, where events with incalculable probabilities render Gaussian bell curves inapplicable.

By the simple understanding that Black Swans belong to Extremistan, where bell curves completely fail, we can empirically show that Trump was no Black Swan.

The Gaussian 2016 Outcome

Political polling is inseparable from Gaussian bell curves. Polls are always reported on with a margin of error (MOE), which is the same thing as the standard deviations (or sigmas) that you learned in statistics.



[Chart source: Wikipedia]

Bell curves are centered around a mean value, around which 68 percent of the data is within one sigma (or margin of error); 95 percent is within two sigma; 99.7 percent is within three sigma. While Black Swans aren’t Gaussian by nature, it isn’t uncommon to see them expressed as five or six sigma events.

The RealClearPolitics average of national polls (four-way ballot) lists ten polls in its final 2016 summary in the race for the White House. The final results were within the margin of error of nine out of ten polls. The only poll (Gravis) that wasn’t within one MOE still allowed for undecided voters to decide the race.

The outcome was a one sigma event—a predictable, Gaussian outcome, not a Black Swan event.

‘The Scandal of Prediction’

A true Black Swan outcome in the election might look like an Electoral College blowout by Bill Murray. It would have stunned pundits, since he wasn’t even on the ballot. In hindsight, we would rationalize it. Who wouldn’t want Bill Murray? Surely someone somewhere will have claimed to have a model that predicted it.

The 2016 election outcome was a Black Swan only in the minds of the ethically challenged media. Stop blaming pollsters and hysterically acting as if we’re now living in Extremistan.

Fire “data-driven journalists,” big data modelers, and anyone who ever said that Trump only had 28.6 percent chance of winning. Their “epistemic arrogance,” as Taleb would say, has polluted political journalism.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/11/dear-journalists-read-wikipedia-declaring-trumps-election-black-swan-event/,2016-12-11
The Progressive Echo Chamber Explained In One Roundtable,"When The New Republic decided to publish a roundtable considering President Obama’s legacy, it was no surprise to see the conversation dominated by Obama’s race, Hillary Clinton’s gender, and the disparate (and therefore necessarily oppressive) race and gender of many of their Republican opponents.

After Donald Trump’s surprise win, most progressives are not willing to engage in a discussion of what, if anything, went wrong within their movement. Obama and Clinton are not to be critiqued for their positions, decisions, or policies. They are blameless—oppressed and condemned merely for their race and gender. Or so many would claim.

Many, but not all. Andrew Sullivan—formerly of the well-known blog “The Dish”—often spoke with clarity and reason in the midst of the New Republic roundtable’s echo chamber.

I’ve excerpted some portions of the conversation, because I think they are deeply indicative of how identity politics has seeped into most every argument of the left. But the excerpts also reveal how some reasoned voices, like Sullivan’s, could rise above the fray and help us achieve some measure of bipartisan understanding. If we are to advance and find cohesion, we’re going to need more of the latter—not the former.

Obama Was Blameless Over His Two Terms

First, TNR’s Eric Bates asked participants the following question: “How much responsibility do you think that [Obama] himself bears for creating the conditions that allowed Trump to get elected?”

NELL PAINTER: I don’t think it has anything to do with him personally, except that he’s a black man. The election of Trump was a gut-level response to what many Americans interpreted as an insult eight years ago, and have been seething against ever since. The only way you can see Trump as somehow Obama’s fault is Obama’s very being. It’s ontological. ANNETTE GORDON-REED: I agree with Nell. There’s nothing he could’ve done in this climate other than be somebody else. We know the record of obstruction by Republicans, the lack of cooperation. Some Democrats suggested that Obama was giving things away before they were even asked for, to try and be accommodating. But there was no chance for bipartisanship—it was obstruction from day one.

Alrighty, then. This theme continued further on in the conversation, after John B. Judis complained that Obama didn’t fight Wall Street enough:

PAINTER: We’re also forgetting the cultural context of all this: that Obama was operating as a black man among a whole bunch of white guys. They were middle Americans whose gut sense was distrust—not being comfortable with him, not wanting to go along with him. There was a lot of static going on. He had to prove that he wasn’t a communist. That’s part of the reason, I’m guessing, that he didn’t move further left against the banks and kept on the side, really, of the Republican financial establishment. … GORDON-REED: He didn’t have to go very far to be too left for some people. For the first black president, there were all kinds of psychic things going on that just don’t apply for a ‘regular’ person. He couldn’t have gone too far left and won. PAINTER: This is the only place I’m sort of separating myself from John. Because you, John, are thinking of this context without the racial dynamics that played a big part in narrowing his room to maneuver.

And then in comes Sullivan with the rebuttal:

SULLIVAN: He won more white voters in 2012 than Hillary Clinton just did, OK? He was always popular with white people in the Midwest. This whole racial thing is just so myopic. GORDON-REED: No, it’s not myopic. We’re talking about his responses to things. We’re talking about why an individual maneuvers in a particular way. If you are an African American person and you are in this setting, you can’t maneuver like a white person. Sure, there are white people who like him—that’s not the question. The question is, why did he act in a particular way? SULLIVAN: What should he have done otherwise and didn’t because he’s black? … They keep saying that because he’s black he couldn’t move left. PAINTER: Andrew, that is so gross, in the sense of using such a big club. You’re not hearing what we’re saying in terms of context, psychology, and culture. It’s not a toggle switch of racism, or ‘because he’s black.’ It’s because of the fine-grained nature of our society. What he could accomplish changed month by month, week by week, congressman by congressman, senator by senator. What I’m trying to say is that there’s more going into this than just the policy and the politics.

I’m not entirely convinced that “because he’s black” isn’t being used as a “big club” in the above instances. But let’s move on.

Hillary Clinton Lost Because She Was an ‘Older Woman’

When Sullivan suggested that Hillary Clinton might, in fact, be “a dreadful candidate, and someone almost no one can imagine being president of the United States,” the floodgates opened:

SULLIVAN: She’s a terribly unpopular person. Horrible: no inspiration, no political skills, complete mediocrity. So that’s the mistake—allowing the Clintons to keep control of the party and then allowing this mediocrity to be his successor. PAINTER: [Gesturing to the other women around the table] Can we just say: We entirely disagree with that. JAFFE: Well, I don’t know. I think Hillary Clinton was a lousy candidate. GORDON-REED: I don’t think she was a lousy candidate. But for a candidate to lose to someone who’s never been in the military, who’s never held public office—he’s not like any candidate who’s ever run before. So there were other forces at play here, most notably her gender. PAINTER: She’s an older woman. GORDON-REED. That’s right. It’s clear that many people have a hard time paying attention to older women as anything other than mothers or grandmothers. SULLIVAN: She’s just a bad candidate and a terrible politician whom large numbers of people despised. You can see it in the polls: She represented everything that people hate about Washington. PAINTER: Yeah, because she’s an older woman.

I’m not entirely sure how being an “older woman” equates with representing “everything that people hate about Washington.” Jeb Bush, an older white male, suffered a colossal loss in the primaries because he, as an establishment candidate, “represented everything that people hate about Washington.” This, despite having the correctly oppressive gender and race.

Additionally, many conservatives would protest that they have had no trouble “paying attention to older women as anything other than mothers or grandmothers” throughout history. (See Abigail Adams, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, Margaret Thatcher, Condoleezza Rice, Faith Whittlesey, and many others.)

Identity Politics Aren’t Divisive and Frustrating

When discussing “Obama’s biggest political failure,” many roundtable participants came up empty—or proffered clandestine compliments, such as stating that Obama’s biggest failure was “Overestimating the ability to work across the aisle. Coming in and thinking that he could work with Republicans.” Gee, what a vice.

Yet Sullivan, though he also calls himself an “Obamaphile,” was willing to lay some faults at the feet of the president. Beyond faulting him for choosing Hillary Clinton as his successor and thus jeopardizing his legacy, Sullivan proffered the following:

SULLIVAN: [Obama’s] other failure is not doing enough to confront the identity politics of the left. Because the left’s obsession with race and gender and all the other Marxist notions helped create the white identity politics that is now going to run this country. [Laughter and shouting] GORDON-REED: Marxist? Marxist identity politics? SULLIVAN: That’s what has allowed white identity politics to emerge and to win. And insofar as the left is going to respond to Trump’s election by intensifying that, it’s going to empower the forces of Trump even further. Obama didn’t stand up firmly and solidly enough when the left was taken over by this madness.

The Tea Party Movement Was about Racism

The conversation surrounding identity politics did not stop there. Debate continued further on:

JAFFE: Keep in mind that the Tea Party came first. It wasn’t Black Lives Matter. The Tea Party was ready to be angry at Obama on day one, explicitly because he was a black president. It’s just chronologically backwards to say that thousands and thousands of Americans who finally got fed up with racial injustice and took part in protest movements were somehow responsible for polarizing the conversation or rejecting common ground.

For some reason, I thought the Tea Party movement was about reining in government spending and decentralization of the federal government. Or something like that. Excuse my ignorance.

SULLIVAN: But this is all a slow disintegration of an American identity, which is not racial. JAFFE: Has there ever been an American identity that was not racial? SULLIVAN: Yes. There can be understood to be something that transcends race, as a citizen with no race. PAINTER: Maybe if you’re really rich.

Indeed, only the rich have received the ability to express thoughtful, reasoned ideas apart from their gender or race. (Setting aside those Americans throughout history—such as Phillis Wheatley, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and Alexander Hamilton among them—who rose from impoverished, oppressive backgrounds and accomplished incredible things that spoke to our collective humanity and worth.)

What Should American Identity Look Like, Going Forward?

Setting aside sarcasm, for those of us who believe a government “by the people, for the people” should not perish from the earth, it is important to ask: what does the term “people” signify? Is America necessarily made up of various, opposing, tribalistic identity groups? Or can we become a diverse yet respecting citizenry, one that seeks to unite around the pursuit of truth and the common good—not around the similarity or dissimilarity of one’s race, gender, or sexuality?

After their upsetting November 8 loss, Damon Linker noted that liberals have embraced a “historical dogmatism [and] certainty in progressive triumph, that inspires them to insult, denigrate, mock, and denounce millions of Americans who stand on other sides of our nation’s political and cultural divides.” Linker warned that liberals must “relearn how to talk to people like this…”

But even more fundamentally, liberals must first be willing to embrace the notion that maybe, just maybe, conservatives are not all just racist, xenophobic bigots. Until they do this, the conversation will stay stuck at “laughter and shouting.”

Black Santa Has A Message For Every American About Racial Prejudices,"With Christmas almost upon us, here’s a story that made me smile. Larry Jefferson, who recently made headlines as the Mall of America’s first-ever black Santa, says he had a great time in my home state of Minnesota. According to “Santa Larry,” Minnesotans were welcoming and excited to see him, with many driving considerable distances to join in the cheer. He was booked with appointments throughout his entire visit, and he only heard from one racist crank.

That’s great to hear, but not the impression you would get from the multiple stories documenting the “racist freak-out” over Santa Larry’s visit. I was feeling pretty bad about my home state until I read the stories, and realized that the only place racists were congregating was on Twitter, and possibly in online comment threads. Then again, even the com-box problem may have been exaggerated. Reports that the Star Tribune’s comment thread was shut down (Gasp! Horror!) seem to have been mistaken.

Basically, it appears that somebody was nasty on the Internet. This is a national story? To that I say: “Bah! Humbug!”

Stop Crying Wolf

I’m not here to tell you that racial prejudice isn’t a problem in America. I think it is a problem, of sorts. It’s just tough to get a grip on the real issues when we’re pouring our energy into arguing about fake ones. A bogus “Black Santa” controversy is exactly the sort of thing liberals like to invent. It’s also the sort of thing conservatives expect them to invent. And so we go on preaching to our echo chambers.

Ben Shapiro recently gave an interview in which he advised the liberal press to stop “turning everything up to 11.” He meant that liberals should be careful about turning everything into a crisis. Keep things in proportion. Realize that a few hundred people at an alt-right conference is a blip, not the return of a Reconstruction-era KKK. People won’t start listening until you stop crying wolf.

On the whole, that’s pretty good advice. For conservatives, though, I offer a few corollaries. First, don’t assume that prejudice is a non-problem just because the liberal press cries wolf a lot. Second, don’t imagine that “11-level” prejudice is the only kind that should bother us.

Don’t Fixate on the Antics

A common conservative take on racism is that it’s terrible and extremely offensive, but only really a problem for a small and marginalized group of people. Condemn white supremacists all you want, but recognize that they are an extreme aberration, and that we probably shouldn’t worry too much.

This is almost exactly backwards. We should worry, but not primarily about the sort of racists who do the Sieg Heil salute to Richard Spencer. Yes, that is offensive. It’s also the sort of juvenile antic you expect from a teenager desperate for attention. The Sieg Heil salute? To Richard Spencer? How very cliché. That kind of joker is obviously just gunning for headlines.

The truth is, there aren’t really so very many people like that. Consider, for instance, this listing of “racist incidents since Donald Trump was elected president,” which Slate ran a week after the election to underscore the point that America is now crawling with energized bigots. To my mind it made exactly the opposite point. Having scoured the land for racism anecdotes, their top five include three harrowing tales of graffiti and two about middle or high school students shouting offensive things. What is the world coming to?

When liberals turn graffiti and com boxes into national stories, conservatives breathe a sigh of relief. This is just an issue of graffiti and rude online comments! Don’t lose sleep!

Do Think About the Attitudes

It’s good that most Americans don’t want to be viewed as racists. That’s not necessarily the whole story, however. Out-and-out bigotry is not the only objectionable, racially toned attitude that should concern us.

Here’s one way of making this point. Over this past year, I’ve listened to any number of appeals from white voters who clearly believe that they, specifically as whites of a certain class and education level, have been scorned and neglected by America’s elites. They believe that copious efforts have been made to extend opportunities to black children, Hispanic children, gay and lesbian children, and so forth, while they were denied at least in part because they are white. They feel that white kids should get more of a chance to dream.

Now imagine if I were to respond, “You’re obviously paranoid. How could liberals be prejudiced against whites? They love Jon Stewart.”

That would be awfully insensitive, not to mention obtuse. Of course anti-whiteness wasn’t the only issue behind Trumpite resentment. It could still very reasonably factor into the mix. Even for those who reject certain elements of that narrative (like the suggestion that minority children are in general over-privileged), it’s still important to consider that real and pervasive anti-white prejudices might exist and be specially burdensome for people who also fit a few other “white” stereotypes.

Liberals like Stewart have amply proven that they aren’t that sort of white guy, so they escape the stigma. But should you have to be an effete, over-educated liberal to be both respected and white?

Defeasible Prejudice Is Still Prejudice

The insensitivity of the “but Jon Stewart” argument was, to my mind, mirrored in the oft-repeated claim that Trumpism couldn’t possibly have racial overtones, because look at the 2012 election! Many Trump voters seem to have supported Obama four years ago. How could such people possibly be racist?

It does seem unlikely that recent Obama voters would be diehard Aryan-superiority fanatics. Is that the only kind of negative, racially tinged attitude that should worry us, though? People frequently hold scornful or dismissive attitudes towards demographics or groups of people that are defeasible in individual cases. White men are over-privileged jerks, but Stewart has proven he’s the good kind. Conservative Christians are mostly a menace, but we’ll let Chris Pratt slide. You didn’t finish college? You must be a moron. Unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg, in which case we’ll give you a pass.

Now, think about Barack Obama, and the prejudices some Americans might have about black men. Wouldn’t it be fairly obvious, especially to the already prejudiced, that he didn’t fit the stereotype? Some people might have given Obama a pass, not because they were free of discriminatory ideas about blacks, but because they saw him as a proven outlier.

Soft prejudices like these are certainly less toxic than a full-blown “Master Race” narrative. It’s hard to be totally free of them, because there isn’t always a bright line between harmful prejudice, and the sort of rough-and-ready judgments that we make on a day to day basis, just as socially functional citizens. It doesn’t follow, though, that such prejudices are benign, especially when combined with other class prejudices, and even more when incorporated into polarized political narratives. That’s exactly the sort of fusion that we seem to be seeing in America today.

A Simple ‘Bias Detector’

Here’s a trick I’ve developed for ascertaining where a particular group fits into a political narrative. Ask yourself: Do people see personal affiliation with this group as something that conveys insight or as something that conveys bias? When people are sympathetic to a group, they tend to regard insiders as having special insight. When they aren’t, they tend to presume that insider judgments from that group are too biased to be trustworthy.

Immoderate credulity and unyielding insensitivity can both be barriers to appreciating the truth.

I noticed this a few years ago when I started doing research on policing and the justice system. Liberals, I found, would frequently ask how much contact I’d had with social activists, re-entry workers, or residents in high-crime neighborhoods. They regarded those as insight-yielding contacts. On the other hand, if I mentioned things I had heard from cops or prosecutors, they were dismissive. Cops are prone to wagon-circling; prosecutors are drunk on power. They’re biased.

With conservatives, it’s exactly the opposite. They ask how many ride-alongs I’ve done, and whether I have relatives or friends in law enforcement. They regard prosecutors as the obvious go-to source for understanding the legal questions. On the other hand, if I mention things I learned from re-entry workers or legal academics, I am warned not to be too credulous. Those bleeding-hearts have all been indoctrinated by the Left. Apply plenty of salt.

The truth is that personal experience can yield both insight and bias. When we strongly presume one over the other, that usually says something about our own sensitivities and biases. Immoderate credulity and unyielding insensitivity can both be barriers to appreciating the truth.

Now ask yourself. Are you the sort of person who took to the Internet on Wednesday, November 9, to beg your friends to immerse themselves in the real-world experiences of blacks, Hispanics, women, and gays? Or are you more the sort of person who dismissed multiple people’s opinions this last season on the grounds that “they’ve probably never met a Trump voter”? That might be a good place to start in assessing your own sympathies and non-sympathies.

A Touch of Compassion

As I was reading about the Black Santa “controversy”, my son peeked over my shoulder and said, joyfully, “It’s Santa!” I was touched. Not yet initiated into the dreariness of America’s racial politics, he only saw the jolly.

It would be nice in some ways if we could all be so innocent. Realistically though, maturity requires a more nuanced appreciation of different groups and sub-cultures and the political ramifications of demography. We can’t really just be color blind all the time.

What we can do is aspire to the good humor of Santa Larry, who declined the opportunity to be a race martyr, and chose instead to enjoy the children and celebrate the spirit of the season. I couldn’t be happier that this happened and was a moving experience for people, and I especially appreciate his kind remarks about Minnesotans after HuffPo and others had unfairly maligned us. Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Jefferson!

In the same spirit, perhaps the rest of us could likewise look for opportunities to be a bit more magnanimous, for Christmas and in the year to come.

Dear MTV: Telling White Guys What To Do Just Provokes Racism,"As we slouch away from 2016, a year roundly regarded as one of the worst in recent memory, the folks at MTV News have snuck in at the last moment to make it just a little bit worse. In a video segment called “2017 Resolutions for White Guys,” the one-time music network doubles down on the identity politics parade of horribles that helped create the division and discontent of the current American body politic.

I’ve written before about how progressive targeting of white men for special attacks that would never be launched at anyone else is backfiring badly. I tried to present a nuanced argument about why we should expect a backlash (or whitelash, if you prefer) to this anti-white rhetoric. Now I’d like to put it more bluntly. Just stop it. It’s not working, it’s making things worse, and it’s not clear, beyond click revenue, why this dead horse is still being beaten.

Before examining what the creators of this snarky but unfunny list of the white man’s ills think they are achieving, let’s look at the segment itself, point by point.

Resolved: White Guys Suck

The first resolution is to “Try to recognize that America was never great for anyone who wasn’t a white guy.” Let’s forget about the experiences of millions of non-white immigrants who found freedom and opportunity in the United States. They don’t count. Those who were fleeing repressive and deadly regimes in Africa, Central America, and Asia should probably have just stayed where they were.

I mean sure, they escaped killing fields and death squads, but they wound up in a place where their native foods are regularly appropriated and even their styles of dress are sometimes used in Halloween costumes. If we really want to curb illegal immigration, we should make it clear what an awful place America is, and explain why no person of color or woman should want to come here. The takeaway is that America sucks, and it sucks because of white guys.

Next up, we all should agree that “Black Lives Matter isn’t the opposite of All Lives Matter and that Blue Lives Matter isn’t a thing.” I actually have some sympathy for this one, and have argued that we need to think and act specifically in regard to the unique challenges that face black Americans.

But when someone says, “Hey, don’t all lives matter?” The useful response is to say, “Of course, but we are looking at something specific here.” Instead the usual response is “Shut up, you racist!” Furthermore, when the Black Lives Matter movement comes out with proposals like abolishing the police, they make it hard for any reasonable person to take them seriously.

Speaking of police, 2016 has seen at least 64 police officers shot and killed in the line of duty. While not a record, it well above the average for the past 10 years. In some instances these officers were targeted simply for being police. If you don’t like the phrase Blue Lives Matter, don’t use it. But don’t mock what is a serious, tragic problem in our country.

Third: “Stop bragging about being woke.” This resolution might be the best tip-off to whom this segment is aimed at. That’s because there is not a single white guy in the world who uses the word “woke” without laughing who isn’t already a progressive.

I know white guys like this, mostly in the theater world. These are white guys who support the Jubilee 2020 effort to ban plays by straight, white men from the nation’s stages in 2020. They happily agree to forgo opportunities for themselves, gladly saying they want to listen more and talk less.

I think this stuff is foolish nonsense, but they don’t. They are what are known as “allies.” For their trouble, they are mocked by MTV. This is because no matter the level of their progressive piety, they can never truly be absolved of the sin of being white guys.

Another resolution: “Learn what mansplaining is and stop doing it.” I am man. I enjoy explaining things. I choose not to treat women like precious snowflakes that fall apart in the face of the raw power of my masculine skills of exposition. Most women I know are tough enough to take it and give it back.

The next one is just for judges. It urges them not to prioritize Ivy League rapists over the women they raped. Hear, hear. But let’s save a little room to condemn the white guys who run Rolling Stone for publishing lies about rapes that never happened.

Number six isn’t so much a resolution as it is a statement. We are told that Beyoncé is black so of course she cares about black issues. On the other hand we (we being white guys) can have Kanye West. We know that Kanye does not care about black issues because he met with Donald Trump. So, I guess MTV is saying we decide who is and isn’t black not based on skin color but on having the right political views. At least this explains how Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas got left out of the Smithsonian’s African American Museum.

The final resolution is to understand that people with black friends should not say they have black friends, and that you can have black friends and still be racist. This reminded me another recent video from The New York Times called “The Life Changing Magic of Hanging Out.” The Times video argues that friendships that cross racial lines do, in fact, reduce the effects of implicit bias. So I think the message here is that it’s good to have black friends, but you shouldn’t ever mention them and yes, you still suck.

Cut Out the Political Masturbation, Ya’ll

On its face this MTV video would seem to be directed at white guys like me, or even worse, white guys who voted for Trump. But as we see from resolution three, this isn’t really the case. Nobody who made this video actually expects some guy in his American Eagle sweatshirt and University of Virginia baseball cap to say “Ooooooohhh, now I get it!” So who is being targeted here? And why?

The answer is pretty clearly other progressives. This video’s reinforcement of the progressive bubble serves a few purposes. The first is just money. MTV brass knows this stuff gets clicks, and gets guys like to me to write about it, causing more clicks. On a slow day you can always order up another hot take on how awful white dudes are and expect a nice little click bounce.

But this doesn’t explain why the creators of the video, who presumably think they are doing some kind of good, continue to choose this approach. It also doesn’t explain why progressives who are not in the employ of MTV choose to pass it around. One friend has suggested to me that this is very much like a public prayer or profession of faith. It is not evangelical, it does not really try to bring new people into the fold, but rather is affirmative. It is a way of ensuring that those already on your side keep the faith and are not tempted by other ideas.

Being an Ass Provokes a Dangerous Response

This is ultimately what makes every iteration of “white guys are terrible” so dangerous. Not only does it calcify progressives’ holier-than thou attitudes, it pours gasoline on the fire of real racism in our society.

A fellow writer, who urged me to expand on my work regarding the effects of anti-white rhetoric, directed me to a Twitter account recently. I won’t link it, because it is horrible, but it has 260,000 followers and when it isn’t tweeting out alt-right manifestos and memes about white genocide, it is tweeting out videos like MTV’s resolutions for white guys.

Racists take this stuff and throw it in the face of a young white guy who doesn’t think our society is a big rock candy mountain made for his enjoyment. Too often that young white guy’s reaction is, “Yeah, screw these people.”

Can conservatives and white people in general do a better job dealing with race? Yes, and I’ve written as much. But videos like this one mocking and lecturing white men make that project much more difficult. So just stop. The creators of this video can’t possibly believe they are swaying anyone to their side. They need to wake up and realize that they are swaying people to the other side. And that is terrible for all of us.

Law Prof Explains Why Trump Had No Choice But To Fire Acting AG,"After Acting Attorney General Sally Yates announced that she had ordered the U.S. Department of Justice not to enforce President Donald Trump’s recent executive order limiting immigration from terrorist safe havens, Trump immediately fired Yates and announced her temporary replacement. Yates took over the top Justice job following Loretta Lynch’s exit and pending Senate confirmation of Jeff Sessions, whose nomination is still pending in the Senate.

Josh Blackman, a law professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, explained on Twitter on Monday evening that Trump has clear authority to fire political appointees like Yates. Blackman further noted that if Yates truly felt the law was unconstitutional or legally unenforceable, she had an obligation to resign her position rather than simply refuse to do her job.

“Duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed belongs to POTUS alone,” Blackman explained. “If appointee gets in the way, removal is the only option.”

“The notion that an official could simply refuse to follow President’s order, rather than resign, is itself contrary to [separation] of powers,” he continued. “The President’s oath to support & defend the Constitution matters. If his appointees (or worse, holdovers) disagree, they should resign.”

Yates was a holdover from the Obama administration. Trump announced that she would be replaced by U.S. Attorney Dana Boente pending Senate confirmation of Sessions.

You can read Blackman’s full explanation from Twitter below.

Sage Steele Is Right To Confront Black Americans’ Stubborn Leftism,"ESPN reporter and anchor Sage Steele has been taking heat for objecting to the recent actions of rioters and protesters. Here’s her response to opponents of President Trump’s immigration order, who in their histrionic outrage disabled sections of Los Angeles International Airport recently:



In November Steele took NFL player Mike Evans to task for refusing to show respect during our national anthem that honors all Americans — black, white, and everything else — who have sacrificed for us.

Hey @MikeEvans13_ look up definition of the word DEMOCRACY & remember this pic while kneeling/exercising your right to protest #perspective pic.twitter.com/kGruy3wEDe — Sage Steele (@sagesteele) November 14, 2016

In a subsequent Facebook post, Steele called out black intolerance of black non-conformists, especially on political and social issues, and correctly noted that the prevalence of racism among black people is something the Left gives black people a free pass for, instead of calling them out on it the same way they would a white person. This glaring inconsistency should be unacceptable to left-wing thinkers of any race who are internally consistent in their beliefs. Like Steele, having been called “coon” and “Uncle Tom” by some black people for being on the conservative side of the spectrum, I identify with her desire to have real diversity, including political, in the black community.

Steele’s Got a Tough Crowd

Yet as much as I agree with what Steele is saying, I’m almost certain her message will not convince most black people. Yes, it will energize white conservatives who (rightfully) will be glad to see a black person speaking out against left-wing ideology, specifically the strong strain of anti-Americanism that runs through it. That has value in and of itself.

Yet the inability of her message to gain broad traction among black people, as evidenced by its hostile reception, speaks to the difficulty black conservatives have in bringing the black mainstream, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, over to our side. Indeed, according to CNN exit polling, black Republican Sen. Tim Scott received a paltry 8 percent of the black vote during his recent victory in South Carolina, and presidential candidate Ben Carson’s approval rating among black people was 20 percent or less during the GOP primaries.

The GOP faces the difficult scenario that due to 90 percent of black people faithfully and automatically voting Democratic every election, the Democratic Party can sit by idly and gather black votes by default without any effort to actually improve the lives of black people. Now if the Republican Party did the same, they’d be accused of “not working to get the black vote.”

On the other hand, if the GOP does indeed attempt to get the black vote, they’ll be accused of “just doing it for politics” and not being sincere. This clever Democratic messaging has put the GOP in a bind no matter what they do when it comes to reaching black voters, with the black community reacting with skepticism and mistrust either way.

Crying ‘Racist’ Is Wrong But Effective

Also, because black people’s painful past experiences with racism have unfortunately made black people hypersensitive to any and all alleged claims of racism, whether real or imagined, the Democratic Party can simply repeat the mantra that “Republicans are racist” to galvanize black people against the GOP. There will always be one racist idiot they can point to and proclaim, “See, Republicans are racist!” especially with far-left academia constantly inventing new types of racism and new ways to find it.

This is enough to keep most black people in the D column while absolving the Democratic Party of actually doing anything to improve the lives of black people. This is why cleverly positioning racism as the number one threat to black people, and constantly finding new ways to paint society as racist, has been a genius political strategy by the Left.

In fact, even though 30 percent of black people self-identify as conservative according to recent Gallup polling, 90 percent of them still vote Democrat, unwilling to break ranks and vote for the Republican Party that more closely matches their conservative values, largely for the aforementioned reasons. It appears that even economic growth, more jobs, and shared values are unable to get black people to change their party allegiance.

Is It Possible to Break Through?

So, what do we make of all this? As a black conservative and Republican, all this leaves me in the awkward position of agreeing with Steele’s message, but also recognizing that it will not be effective in reaching black people, who have been conditioned to see any kind of conservative message as covertly or overtly racist, and to treat any black person delivering that message as an arrogant traitor who has forgotten her roots.

What’s the solution? Maybe the black vote is so monolithically and stubbornly Democratic that the GOP should forgo spending resources on it and instead focus like a laser on ramping up white turnout to win elections. On the other hand maybe the GOP should go all in, working with Kanye West or other major black culture influencers, setting up shop in black communities, or running ads in black media venues highlighting Democratic Party failures and asking black people for a chance.

I’ve gone back and forth on this question and won’t claim to have the answer. But at the very least, voices like Steele’s should continue to speak out, no matter how hostile the reception. In doing so, she may be giving budding black conservatives the encouragement and strength to stand up and break rank.

This Black Abolitionist Fought In The Revolutionary War With George Washington,"Primus Hall was a black man native to Boston, born into bondage in the year 1756, the son of the famous Prince Hall. Although he was born a slave, Primus attained his official freedom in his teenage years.

A property owner, abolitionist, renowned veteran, and promoter of education for blacks, Primus was always busy promoting “truth and good.” One man said of Primus that “[he was] a man of good repute and well known in this City and Country – whose Character for Truth and Veracity is second to none either here or elsewhere.” Others also noted him as a man “distinguished [for his] propriety of demeanor, gentlemanly manners, and ubounded kindness.”

As a baby he was given to a man named Ezra Trask. Primus said of himself that “he never was literally considered a Slave; especially after he was given to Trask, and that Trask always repelled that appellation [name or title], when applied to Primus, with indignation – but considered him merely as an apprentice… and in no respects different from a white person under like circumstances.”

Over his lifetime Primus would become a man of many trades. Before he entered into the war, he worked as a shoemaker, soap-boiler, and a delivery truck driver.

When the American Revolution started in 1776, at the age of 19 he enlisted in the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment as an infantryman. He would first see war at the Siege of Boston. Primus was a part of the Battle of Bunker Hill, where many men performed acts of heroism. At this fight about twice as many British were slain than Americans. The colonists had to retreat only because they ran out of ammo. While the British won by technicality, they considered it a hollow victory after counting how many of their soldiers died. After that battle the colonists continued to press against their opponents until the British, who had seized all of Boston, evacuated the city.

After this victory his regiment fought at the Battle of Harlem Heights. This battle was led by Commander-in-Chief George Washington. Here 1,800 American soldiers fought against 5,000 British soldiers, and won. A little over a month later, Hall’s regiment was a part of the Battle of White Plains.

His next fight would be the famed Battle of Trenton, where Washington crossed the Delaware with more than 2,000 soldiers. The opposing British army at Trenton was composed almost entirely of Hessian mercenaries. Hessians were German soldiers, “trained from adolescence and continued their training well through adulthood until they were deemed unfit or too old to serve.” In Germany, Hessian soldiers were drilled every single day. Needless to say, they were some of the most renowned fighters in the world.

Despite this, the colonist army (who were almost all commoners) proceeded to attack. They were rewarded with a landslide victory. They captured almost the entire Hessian force, almost 1,000 soldiers. Primus captured two runaway Hessian soldiers himself after chasing the fleeing soldiers down in the cold for more than half a mile. More than 100 other Hessians were either killed or wounded in the fight. While a handful of Americans were wounded, none died from combat.

A little over a week later, still led by Washington, the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment went to war alongside the British army at the Battle of Princeton—where they were victorious. Primus re-enlisted at the battle of Saratoga, and was present for the surrender of General Burgoyne.

One of Hall’s brothers in combat would write about this battle: “We had a hard fight. [we] took the British Artillery, but lost our Captain… I was near him [Primus] when Captain Flint was shot through the body… Primus was discharged at the same time with myself…. and [he] was much esteemed by the Officers & men, as a brave & faithful Soldier in the service of his Country.”

After the battle, Washington himself signed Hall’s honorable discharge. After the Revolutionary War, he again served his country building fortifications for Castle Island at Boston Harbor during the war of 1812.

When he was not at war or at one of his trades, Primus was an active abolitionist. From 1788 on, he sent several signed petitions to state legislators on issues regarding slavery. He was one of the leaders of the abolitionist movement in Boston, regularly gathering with others to come up with ways to end slavery and the slave trade. When the British slave trade was ended in 1832, he invited all the abolitionists in Boston to his house to celebrate.

Hall was also an active leader in the African American community. He was always engaged in his father’s masonic lodge, also known as “Prince Hall Freemasonry.” He started a school for African-American children in his own home. There he taught up to 60 African-American children. At one point Hall had two Harvard University students teaching there as well. He always advocated for better education for African-American children, especially for their access to college.

He attempted to make his school a public institution in 1800. When his attempt failed, he moved the school out of his house into the famous African Meeting house, also known as “First African Baptist Church” or “First Independent Baptist Church.” The ministers there continued to fund the school until 1835, when they established the Abiel Smith School across the street from the church.

The school was named after a white philanthropist whose will donated money to the city of Boston specifically to educate black children. It would come to “educate a great number of the black children of Boston.” One of those children would become the famous African-American historian William C. Nell, author of the book “The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution”.

Primus was always very popular with young people, and was often found “recounting scenes of the revolutionary war, especially the capture of General Burgoyne, and the surrender of Cornwallis, at both of which he was present… for about two years was in the military family of General Washington, of whom he spoke with that fervor of attachment which was common to all who were personally acquainted with that great man.”

He passed away in the year 1842 after living to his mid-80s, and the city mourned his death. He was one of the most well-respected men of Boston, among soldiers and commoners alike. His footprint can still be felt on our nation through his work with abolitionism and the role he played in helping lay the foundations for educating black children in America.

"Yes, Frederick Douglass Was An American Patriot","Besides February being Black History Month, on February 14 we commemorate the birthday of perhaps the greatest of all black Americans, Frederick Douglass, founding father of the long black freedom struggle in the United States. So President Trump noticed Douglass in a recent BHM event, and the Washington Post published a commemorative article authored by Henry Louis Gates Jr. and John Stauffer, two well-known and highly accomplished Harvard University professors.

Contributing to a Post series dedicated to challenging prevailing myths, the authors set out to dispel a few prevailing or emerging myths about the great agitator. Those purported myths are of uneven importance, but in at least two instances, the political stakes are high. In pressing their claims, the authors themselves are guilty of mythologizing.

The attempted exposure of “Myth No. 3: Douglass, a Republican, would fit in with today’s GOP,” seems a relatively transparent attempt to claim Douglass on behalf of today’s Democratic Party and the progressive left that dominates it. That claim begs for a rebuttal, but the rebuttal must await another occasion. More important than Douglass’s partisanship is the question of his patriotism.

Questioning Douglass’s Patriotism

“Myth No. 1” in the authors’ lineup is “Frederick Douglass was an American patriot.” Crafting their words carefully, Gates and Stauffer claim it is not so: “Douglass never defined himself as an American patriot.” They provide what might seem the conclusive evidence of Douglass’s own words: “I have no love for America … I have no patriotism. I have no country.”

That evidence is anything but conclusive. The story of Douglass’s American patriotism is complicated and inspiring, and it deserves a much fuller and fairer telling than it receives in the Post article.

Patriotism, Douglass believed, is not the highest of human virtues, but it is a normal component of a morally excellent life. As a general rule, he maintained, one “who cares nothing for the character and credit of his country, will care about as little for his own character and credit.” The sentiment of patriotism “is pure, natural, and noble.”

To say that patriotism is natural is not to say it is indestructible. Douglass worried that despite their generally exemplary record of loyalty and service amid the most trying circumstances, black Americans’ patriotism was gravely endangered by continued subjection to injustice, much of it publicly sanctioned. His confessions that he harbored no patriotism, as quoted by Gates and Stauffer, came of his own experience in slavery. His patriotism, he remarked, had been “whipt out of me long since by the lash of the American soul-drivers.”

Douglass said those things, however, in the late 1840s—still in the early phase of his career, when his thinking was influenced by the radical abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, whose antinomian zeal in some respects skirted anti-Americanism. Garrison rejected the Constitution as a pro-slavery “covenant with death,” publicly burned a copy of it at a July 4 gathering, and called for non-slaveholding states to sever their association with slaveholders by seceding from the federal union.

Given the circumstances of his youth, it is unremarkable that Douglass would first embrace a teaching such as Garrison’s. What is truly remarkable—and strikingly unremarked by our authors in the Post article—is that within a few years, by conscientious study and reflection, Douglass acquired a strong and proud American patriotism that he would retain for the rest of his life.

Frederick Douglass Loved America and Its Founders

Douglass loved America. He loved it for its principles and for its promise. In an 1852 speech on the meaning of July Fourth, a speech now widely regarded as the greatest of all abolitionist speeches, he extolled the American Founders for their courage and wisdom: “They were brave men. They were great men too…. They seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defense. Mark them!”

Douglass loved America foremost for its founding principles. He told a New York audience on July 4, 1862, “No people ever entered upon the pathway of nations, with higher and grander ideas of justice, liberty and humanity than ourselves.” The Declaration was for Douglass “that glorious document which can never be referred to too often,” whose “sublime and glorious truths” represent nothing less than “the eternal laws of the moral universe.” Likewise, and in stark contrast to Garrison, he extolled the Constitution as “a glorious liberty document.”

It should go without saying that Douglass was always acutely mindful of the disparity between American principles and American practice in race relations. Even so, he embraced the country for its promise along with its principles. At one of the bleakest moments of what seemed to many the bleakest of all decades for the antislavery cause, the 1850s, Douglass declared that he knew of “no soil better adapted to the growth of reform than American soil.”

With the enactment of the Reconstruction Amendments, Douglass found still stronger grounds for allegiance and hopefulness. Where else in the world, he demanded of an audience of black New Englanders in 1872, “is there a citizenship so desirable, so exalted, endowed with more sublime attributes than the citizenship of the United States? Nowhere.”

Black and White Americans Share a ‘Common Destiny’

As evidence for their claim that Douglass lacked patriotism, Gates and Stauffer also note his expression of interest in emigration to Haiti in 1860. They fail to divulge that this interest appears as a singular and momentary expression of frustration, properly understood in the context of his career-long opposition to all proposals for the expatriation or emigration of black Americans.

Against white colonizationists and black emigrationists, Douglass insisted that blacks and whites in this country share a “common destiny” as Americans, and acceptance of that destiny on the part of blacks should be—and was—much more than a submission to inescapable necessity. In 1851, seeking to combat the alienating effect of the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Law, he declared, “we are anchored to the land of our birth, by the very strongest ties of affection and honor.”

In one of his last great speeches, “Lessons of the Hour” (1894), Douglass provided his deepest explanation of the moral importance of patriotism as he iterated once more his opposition to emigration. “Every man who thinks at all,” he observed, “must know that home is the fountain head, the inspiration, the foundation and main support, not only of all social virtue but of all motives to human progress, and that no people can prosper, or amount to much, unless they have a home, or the hope of a home.”

To have a home, in Douglass’s enlarged, Burkean understanding, is to have a relation to past and future, to causes larger than the self and its momentary gratifications. It is to have a heritage to honor and a legacy to build and bequeath. Home supplies the foundation and motivation upon which human beings improve themselves, their society, even their civilization. And “to have a home,” Douglass emphasized, one “must have a country.”

To cultivate the sentiment of American patriotism was for black Americans in particular a moral imperative, Douglass believed, not least because it was a dictate of interest. Patriotism would assist them both in gaining citizenship and in making the most advantageous use of it. It constituted for them a crucial condition of social and political advancement.

Profoundly patriotic himself, Douglass was no less profoundly committed to spreading and deepening an enlightened patriotism in the minds and hearts of all Americans. He stood in determined opposition to all who would corrode that sentiment, whether by government-sanctioned injustice or seductive and alienating appeals to sentiments of racial identity and racial nationalism.

It seems sadly telling of the present condition of the American academy, and perhaps also of our national politics, that two of the academy’s brightest stars—I say without a trace of irony about two scholars of genuinely outstanding ability and accomplishment—would think that they do honor to Frederick Douglass, on the occasion of his birthday, by cleansing him of the taint of American patriotism. To correct the record is a political no less than an intellectual imperative.

Everything DeVos Said About Historically Black Colleges Was Correct,"It’s been rough for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in her first few weeks on the job. In her first week she had to be hustled away by security after protesters blocked her from visiting a public middle school then pursued her down an alley, and was lambasted on Twitter by DC’s former schools chancellor. The head of the nation’s largest teachers union took to the press rather than a return phone call to attack DeVos’s attempts at cross-aisle outreach.

Then DeVos fought against President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a failed attempt to retain President Obama’s lawless rewrite of Title IX that forced the nation’s public schools to open private facilities to all students regardless of biology or plumbing.

In advance of Trump’s state of the union Tuesday, DeVos met with leaders of historically black higher education institutions (HBCUs). Afterward, she released a conventional PR statement:

A key priority for this administration is to help develop opportunities for communities that are often the most underserved. Rather than focus solely on funding, we must be willing to make the tangible, structural reforms that will allow students to reach their full potential. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have done this since their founding. They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education. They saw that the system wasn’t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish.

This basic stuff deeply offended some folks. Politico published a typical heavy-breathing piece about how “Some experts on historically black institutions panned the statement as ignorant, while others said she was inadvertently praising segregation.” The Politico writeup linked renowned black history expert Sen. Claire McCaskill:

Totally nuts. DeVos pretending that establishment of historically black colleges was about choice not racism. https://t.co/gROpItxRx4 — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) February 28, 2017

The Leadership Conference, a coalition of about 200 organizations that are predominantly liberal (like the ACLU, AFL-CIO, Children’s Defense Fund, Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, GLSEN, Human Rights Campaign, NAACP, National Center for Transgender Equality, etc.) released a huffy response from president Wade Henderson:

HBCUs were created in response to a racist system of segregation that saw the education of black people as a threat to white supremacy – a belief central to slavery — and that refused to allow black people to participate in the education system available only to white people. HBCUs continue to play an important role in our education system. There is no shortage of academic literature on this subject, including the seminal work, Education of Blacks in the South: 1860-1935, by noted historian James Anderson. I would advise Secretary DeVos to check the facts, study the history, and refrain from suggesting that Jim Crow was about choice for anybody besides segregationist politicians.

Henderson wasn’t the only one who seethed at DeVos’s praise for black Americans’ constructive, self-liberating response to injustice. Alexandra Petri at the Washington Post wrote the following unhinged response (emphasis original): “Does [DeVos] mean choice in the sense that, if these institutions had not been pioneers during the era of racial segregation, black students would have had the choice to go to school or go nowhere? Does she not know what the word ‘choice’ means?”

Oh, she goes further.

If this is the kind of school choice that DeVos is hoping to bring nationwide, we are up a worse creek than previously thought. By this broad definition, ‘tangible, structural reforms that will allow students to reach their full potential’ sound like they could include ‘restoring segregation to the land.’ After all, it was segregation that created this wonderful pioneering set of school choices in the first place. … Internment was just a lovely way of providing more housing options to people. Before, U.S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent did not have the option of moving to a cool gated community with a watchtower and barbed wire fences, but, afterwards, they did. Similarly, with the Indian Removal Act, President Andrew Jackson created a whole range of options for many communities. Instead of the option of staying in the place where they lived, they had the option of — moving! With help from the U.S. Cavalry. This was clearly the essence of Jim Crow laws: giving people a greater range of options. Without Jim Crow laws, there would only have been one set of water fountains for everyone…With Betsy DeVos in charge, soon you may have the wonderful option of not sending your child to any school at all.

What the flying petunias, lady. It shows terribly bad faith to dogwhistle a woman’s support for institutions that met needs of minority Americans into an implied agenda of turning American schools into Japanese internment camps and Indian reservations. It’s even more ridiculous given that DeVos is a woman who in 2006 threw her heavy political weight against a proposal to eliminate racial preferences in college admissions and government hiring. Say “choice” and some people hear “ethnic cleansing,” I guess. Has postmodernism really brought us to this already?

What Does Choice Mean, Really

At a surface level this manufactured spat is about the meanings of a few basic words. Politico quoted an HBCU president, Austin Lane, whose response encapsulated the disconnect: “HBCUs were created for African-Americans because they had no choice and were unable to attend schools due to segregation laws.” His is the polite version of the argument (such as it is) Petri advanced: moving from no choice to one choice is not really a choice.

Logically, that’s false. There’s a true difference between, say, being banned from all grocery stores to being banned from all but one grocery store. You’ve moved from no choice to one choice (or another choice if you take growing your own food or bartering into account, which people can and did do for education as well). It’s limited, but it’s distinct from nothing. By the way, this argument is a backhanded slap against HBCUs and their K-12 counterparts. It essentially says “They were better than nothing, but not much.”

Also, in context this critique doesn’t even apply: since the inception of higher education people have always traveled for it. If there is more than one HBCU — in fact there are 107, several established before the Civil War, in addition to non-HBCU colleges like my alma mater, Hillsdale, that never practiced racial discrimination — then you instantly have plural options. Not none or one but many. We’ve moved from no choice to many choices, thanks to entirely voluntary efforts and despite government-mandated segregation. Which is precisely DeVos’s point.

Second, there is a real distinction between forced action and inaction. There is not a choice equivalency between the federal government forcing any group of people to live in a certain area and people voluntarily creating institutions for educating children and neighbors who elect to attend.

To make Petri’s analogy work it would make more sense to compare internment to compulsory school attendance laws. FDR forced Japanese Americans to live in certain camps; state governments force children (with some loopholes) to attend specific public schools. Obviously there’s a major degree difference between forcing school attendance and forcing internment, but I’m just talking about the fact that forced action is, definitionally, not voluntary action. It’s the opposite. If you’re forced, it’s not a choice. If it’s a choice, it’s not forced. Capiche?

The Root of this Kerfuffle Is Power

But this all is far less about word choice than the education establishment’s resistance to the ideas DeVos embodies, which threatens their control over education and politics, on several fronts. What really offends them is not that DeVos said historically black institutions offer options to children who would otherwise have fewer, but that the Trump administration’s outreach to African-American families threatens Democrats’ undeserved political monopoly on the black vote and its massive take from teachers unions, which in many states teachers must join to be allowed a public-school job.

As I’ve written before, the leadership of self-described black advocacy organizations, including Black Lives Matter, is woefully out of step with the desires of the constituents they claim: “In a 2015 poll conducted by the Black Alliance for Educational Options in Alabama, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Tennessee, majorities of black Americans supported charters, typically by approximately two-thirds.”

In a nationally representative 2016 poll, 74 percent of black Americans supported charter schools; only 25 percent said a public school is their first choice for their child, if they could choose among public, private, charter, or homeschooling. Sixty-one percent support school vouchers, and 63 percent supported tax-credit scholarships (a form of voucher funded entirely privately rather than using government money). Forty-nine percent, a plurality, think public education is “on the wrong track.”

School-choice policies threaten Democrats’ political monopoly because their political coalition depends on union money and organizing. And unions (nowadays) hate vouchers. (Expect that to change if vouchers become more widespread, however. To survive unions will switch to capturing vouchers to serve their interests, as they already have with charter schools.) But obviously a lot of black people don’t. That’s not a new thing, either.

Alright, Let’s Everyone Get Educated

It’s less clear DeVos is “woefully undereducated” about HBCUs than that self-proclaimed black leaders are hiding their own community’s history to maintain an easier grip on political power. Black and progressive Americans have long supported school-choice policies such as vouchers specifically because the public schools many racial minorities are required to attend are cesspools of violent ignorance, and have remained so for decades despite a parade of cynical politicans — of all races — making careers and moolah by exploiting kids’ misery.

For example, longtime civil rights activist Howard Fuller, a child of sharecroppers who attended Malcolm X speeches and later founded Malcolm X Liberation University, was a key figure in passing one of the first modern school choice programs in America, Milwaukee’s vouchers. He also helped found the Black Alliance for Educational Options, which supports DeVos’s choice stance. Back when his most recent book came out in 2014, he told me in an interview why:

I use the term parent choice. It’s not an issue of schools choosing, it’s an issue of parents choosing. I don’t think you ought to have an America where those of us with money have the opportunity to choose the best environment for their children. If you have money in America, you have choice. Because if schools don’t work for your children, you’re going to move, you’re going to get those kids into another private school, you’re going to get tutoring, or all three. Low-income and working-class parents don’t have the opportunity to do it. For me it’s a social justice issue, not about free markets — trying to ensure that those families that have the least among us have some opportunity to choose the best environment for their children.

Other progressives and black Americans have supported school vouchers for decades, not that Democrats want you to know that. That would require them to do some explaining to minority voters they currently rake in easily.

Read through RedefinED’s blog series on this. The latest post explains President Jimmy Carter’s support for vouchers, which evaporated, along with his party’s, when he had to lean on the National Education Association to eke out his presidential win. Ever since, Democrat politicians have opposed vouchers despite the desire for it among many of their constituents, simply because unions understand and fight for their interests better than many voters do.

Trump and DeVos could change that. That’s what their detractors on the Left are really scared of.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/02/everything-betsy-devos-said-about-historically-black-colleges-was-correct/,2017-03-02
The Conflict Between Racism And Law And Order Is All About Big Government,"The need for order in society divides both the left and the right. Libertarian versus conservative, progressive versus anarchist, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can fully describe themselves as the party of order. Even among those who agree on the value of order, there is disagreement. For the right, those interested in order are primarily interested in the old older, informal controls enforced by societal pressure, and respect for tradition. On the left, both factions are (or were) forward-looking, the only difference being which method would best propel us to the glorious future, radical freedom or radical bureaucracy.

Chris Hayes’s new book, “A Colony in a Nation,” is above all a book about order and how the people’s desire for it contributes to unequal treatment of different groups of Americans, typically on account of race. The book begins with a discussion of the disorder of the past several years, especially events in Ferguson and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015, on which Hayes reported extensively for his show on MSNBC, All In with Chris Hayes.

He tells the tale with which Americans became familiar during those crises through the reporting of Hayes and others: a community, mostly black, alienated against their local government, spurred to near-revolution by the death of a young black man at the hands of police. Ferguson and Baltimore differed: the first is a suburb run by white Republicans; the second is a city run by black Democrats. Urban mismanagement is bipartisan, and trouble between police and a populace can occur no matter which party runs the government.

People’s reaction to the events showed the divides on right and left. Some were appalled at the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray, but recoiled at the violence that followed. Others reserved judgment on the police officers’ actions, but found the quasi-militarized force that took to the streets to restore order as overkill. Hayes is good at showing this division of opinion, whether within communities or within individuals. The latter is the more difficult task. Most of us are not fully for liberty or fully for order. There are times to be for one or the other, and there are times where we think that both can co-exist.

Hipster Elegy

Hayes also explores his own thoughts on the matter, and the book at times resembles a memoir as much as a current events work. His writing is effective here, as he turns the journalistic lens on his own life and his own interactions with disorder in American cities. Hayes writes of commuting from his childhood home in Norwood in the Northwest Bronx through poor, black neighborhoods in the South Bronx and Harlem to his magnet school on the more affluent Upper East Side of Manhattan, the emotional responses it provoked, and the experience of growing up in a city divided by race and class.

Commuting through a dangerous city at the height of the national crime wave would be enough to make anyone nervous, and his recounting of an incident in which he was the victim of a street crime rings true to anyone who has experienced the same—which could include most city-dwellers in those days. Hayes spins that feeling of fear out to a national scale, using it to explain the emotional state that led most of America to embrace the tough-on-crime measures of the era. Although reluctant to credit any one policy with the reduction in crime that occurred throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he does admit that it was a more dangerous time at the beginning of that period than at the end. Any honest observer would be hard-pressed to deny it, and Hayes cites the telltale statistics of murders in New York: from a record 2,245 in 1991 to just 352 in 2015. Other crime similarly decreased.

Hayes also discusses the general seediness of New York in those days—his word, and an accurate one. While he prefaces the section by saying that “this phenomenon was quite distinct from the massive spike in crime,” he says that the same feelings of insecurity and distrust are inspired by seediness as by criminality. It is a distinction that is rather too fine to be believed. Many of the seedy elements of the public scene he describes are also crimes: aggressive panhandling, public intoxication, and the like. They are crimes not simply because they disturb decent people’s sense of order, although that certainly figures into it. The acts are also dangerous (or at least lead to danger) in a way that the public has judged, rightly, should not be tolerated.

A scene of Hayes visiting a police training center is a useful counterpoint to the prevailing narrative on the left of cops who are indifferent to the community they serve. At the Morris County sheriff’s office, the author went through training scenarios that made him quickly realize how easy it is for a cop to find himself in a dangerous situation, and how fast fear for one’s life can cause that situation to escalate. As things in the mock-up soon go sideways, Hayes looks at the situation with equanimity. “We’re only one scene in,” he writes, “and already the self-righteous liberal pundit has drawn his weapon on an unarmed man holding a cinder block.” The author’s self-awareness, here and elsewhere in the book, sets it apart from some other writers’ punditry that rapidly descends into unreadable screeds.

Muddled History

Other discussions are more off the mark. Several times, Hayes mentions redlining, the practice by which banks limited their mortgage lending the residents of white, non-immigrant neighborhoods. The odious practice, first encouraged by the Franklin Roosevelt administration through the newly created Federal Home Loan Bank Board, limited the ability of blacks and certain whites to borrow against their homes, cutting off what would become a major source of credit for more favored groups. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 banned the practice, which at least took the government out of it even if it did not stop furtive, private discrimination.

How redlining could be responsible for Ferguson’s troubles is unclear. When it was outlawed, Ferguson was still 98.55 percent white, according to the 1970 census. Similarly, what Hayes calls Richard Nixon’s “highly effective racialized Southern Strategy” is interesting as an historical matter (and the degree to Nixon “racialized” anything is still a matter of scholarly debate) but it, too, predates Ferguson’s integration, let alone any conflict between the black and white populations there.

Redlining may have set the scene for the segregated neighborhoods of New York, but the changes that occurred in Ferguson’s demographics came much later. Everything in history is connected, but at a certain point the connections grow too tenuous. Redlining is widely condemned, and justly, but it is not the source of all ills. For someone so reluctant to name any cause of the decline in crime, he is very sure of the causes of society’s other ills.

Slighting Nixon is especially odd, given that the title of the book springs from a 1968 speech by Nixon. The “New Nixon” who campaigned for president that year captured America’s anxiety about crime, but also spoke thoughtfully about the need not to criminalize an entire class or race—exactly the sort of sentiment Hayes seemingly wishes to espouse. In criticizing his predecessor’s Great Society welfare state, Nixon also wove a plea for unity into his remarks, calling for all Americans to “build bridges to human dignity across that gulf that separates black America from white America. Black Americans, no more than white Americans, they do not want more government programs which perpetuate dependency. They don’t want to be a colony in a nation.”

Government: The Problem and the Solution

Hayes correctly identifies the need for city financing as driving the escalation of police interactions with the populace. In Ferguson, especially, the city government takes in a disproportionate share of its funding through fines imposed by for all manner of minor violations. The impulse is understandable: Which is likely to be more popular means of financing government, a new tax or fines on criminals? Fines sound great when they are imposed on bad people; they are less popular when it turns out that the “bad” people are nearly everyone. But it is hard to see more government as the solution here. If the problem is that the need for income turns a city into a police state, perhaps less government, requiring less funding and leading to fewer interactions with police would benefit the people more.

The author embraces Nixon’s phrase, but rejects the idea behind it. For him, the colonization of America’s black neighborhoods is the product not of government programs but of the entire history of racism in the United States. But disentangling the two is more difficult than that. Redlining was racist; it was also big government. The same is true of segregation and any number of other government programs. So, in fact, is actual colonialism. Where Hayes’s analysis falls short is not in identifying the problem, but in the solutions at which he hints. For problems caused largely by government, perhaps more government is not the solution.

Hayes has a fluid writing style, and his prose is enjoyable to read. While his solutions are typical of the left and not fully fleshed out, the problems he identifies are real and well-described here. “A Colony in a Nation” is not ground-breaking, but it is a serviceable synopsis of the civil disturbances of the past several years and the conditions that led to them. What cities like Ferguson and Baltimore await is a solution that is better than just more of the same.

College Activists: Searching For Truth Makes You A Racist,"Do you believe there’s an objective truth? Well, you’re a white supremacist then, at least according to a small number of black Pomona College students.

In a letter that strings together words the students no doubt learned in their Blank-Studies classes in what almost appears to be social justice Mad Libs (the word “marginalized” appears seven times in the one-page document), the students claim inviting a speaker critical of Black Lives Matter and supportive of police amounts to oppression.

Further, the three authors of the letter—freshmen Dray Denson, Avery Jonas, and sophomore Shanaya Stephenson—explain that “the Truth” is a concept rooted in racism.

“The idea that there is a single truth–’the Truth’–is a construct of the Euro-West that is deeply rooted in the Enlightenment, which was a movement that also described Black and Brown people as both subhuman and impervious to pain,” the students wrote. “This construction is a myth and white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, capitalism, and the United States of America are all of its progeny. The idea that the truth is an entity for which we must search, in matters that endanger our abilities to exist in open spaces, is an attempt to silence oppressed peoples” (emphasis added).

Notice the list of social justice buzzwords: white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, and capitalism. I’m surprised they didn’t include authoritarianism and Donald Trump.

The letter is a response to an email sent by Pomona College president David Oxtoby, who on April 7 criticized those who protested the Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald. Mac Donald was invited to speak by the Rose Institute for State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College, Pomona’s sister school, about her book, “The War on Cops.” Some students called her a “notorious white supremacist fascist,” and proceeded to chant “Black Lives Matter” while banging on the windows of the building where Mac Donald was scheduled to speak.

Disagreeing With Me Makes You a White Supremacist

Oxtoby wrote in his email to students that Pomona opposes “preventing others from engaging with an invited speaker.” He further stated that Pomona’s “mission is founded upon the discovery of truth, the collaborative development of knowledge and the betterment of society.”

Denson, Jonas and Stephenson took offense to Oxtoby’s defense of the truth.

“The idea that the search for this truth involves entertaining Heather Mac Donald’s hate speech is illogical,” the students wrote. “If engaged, Heather Mac Donald would not be debating on mere difference of opinion, but the right of Black people to exist. Heather Mac Donald is a fascist, a white supremacist, a warhawk, a transphobe, a queerphobe, a classist, and ignorant of interlocking systems of domination that produce the lethal conditions under which oppressed peoples are forced to live.”

Where do they get the idea that Mac Donald doesn’t think black people have the right to exist? Defending good cops and criticizing the bad tactics of a politically correct group (that not all black people have decided to join) doesn’t mean she believes black people don’t have a right to exist. Also, again notice the string of social-justice-warrior buzzwords to describe Mac Donald.

Mac Donald wasn’t the only target of the students’ ire. They also wanted the school to “take action” against the Claremont Independent, a right-leaning campus publication. The three students, along with nearly a dozen others, signed their names to the letter, then said if the Independent publishes those names and they “receive threats and hate mail,” then Pomona should “take legal action against members of the Claremont Independent involved with the editing and publication process as well as disciplinary action, such as expulsion on the grounds of endangering the wellbeing of others.”

Get that? They signed their names, but if they receive any backlash for their actions they want other students expelled and sued. How progressive.

Mac Donald Responds: ‘A Major Embarassment’

In a statement to The Federalist, Mac Donald called the letter “a major embarrassment to the Pomona and Claremont faculty.” She cited instances of poor writing and grammar, but lambasted the content as well.

“The students appear to argue that the ideal of free speech is based on a mystifying and oppressive concept of unitary truth, and that such a concept solidifies white supremacy … [yet] They are fully confident that they possess the truth about me and about their oppressed plight at Pomona and Claremont,” Mac Donald said.

Mac Donald also defended her work, saying the students have misread it.

“My entire argument about the necessity of proactive policing is based on the value of black lives,” she said. “I have decried the loss of black life to drive-by shootings and other forms of street violence. I have argued that the fact that blacks die of homicide at six times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined is a civil rights abomination. And I have tried to give voice to the thousands of law-abiding residents of high-crime areas who are desperate for more police protection so that they can enjoy the same freedom from fear as people in more wealthy areas take for granted.”

Do What We Want Or Else We’ll Say You’re Racists

The students have also demanded that Oxtoby respond to them by Tuesday at 4:07 p.m. and send a revised email by Thursday, “apologizing for the previous patronizing statement, enforcing that Pomona College does not tolerate hate speech and speech that projects violence onto the bodies of its marginalized students and oppressed peoples, especially Black students who straddle the intersection of marginalized identities, and explaining the steps the institution will take and the resources it will allocate to protect the aforementioned students.”

So. Many. Buzzwords.

The social justice warrior problem on college campuses appears to be escalating. The protests are becoming more violent, and the demands are becoming more absurd. Just last week, the editorial staff of the Wellesley College student newspaper wrote: “If people are given the resources to learn and either continue to speak hate speech or refuse to adapt their beliefs, then hostility may be warranted.”

The phrase “hate speech” has lost all meaning on campuses, as it now refers simply to speech liberal students don’t agree with. They claim it is bigoted, dangerous, and “violent,” making it acceptable—in their minds—to respond with physical violence.

I’d honestly believe this letter was a hoax, like that ridiculous article on the Huffington Post demanding we take away all white men’s voting rights, which was taken down because the author was fake—except you can actually find these students in the campus directory.

Music Legend Ella Fitzgerald Proves Cultural Appropriation Complaints Are Vapid,"As The New York Times rages against Asian Salad (to be fair, the French dressing sounds inauthentic), we can measure the cultural appropriation crowd’s looniness by remembering the greatest cultural appropriator of them all: Ella Fitzgerald. Amid the Fitzgerald centennial celebrations, including a current exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, few commentators note that she revived her career by consciously “whitening” her vocal style in her nine Songbook albums.

Starting in 1956, she laid down the canon for the great (and mostly white) popular song composers and lyricists of the previous generation. Ella and her contemporaries would have been shocked that a new twenty-first-century blood-and-soil elite would try to dictate who could sing (and wear and eat) what. As the civil rights movement gathered force, that’s what she was musically trying to destroy. Cultural appropriation is the essence of American music and American culture.

Let’s Slide Through Ella Fitzgerald’s Musical Development

Fitzgerald started recording with the Chick Webb band in 1935, in her late teens. The band was mostly based at Harlem’s Savoy Ballroom, and the recordings reveal a singer with a Southern black accent. (Fitzgerald’s mother, Temperance, had joined the Great Migration, moving from Virginia to Yonkers soon after Fitzgerald’s birth.) She often uses a broad tone with affinities to those of blues singers, as in “Mr. Paganini (If You Can’t Sing It, You’ll have to Swing It).”

She sang lots of novelties, sometimes with double entendres about drugs (“Wacky Dust”) or sex (“The Muffin Man”) that made black and white fans feel authentic and in-the-know. Despite the girlish innocence of her nursery rhyme hit, “A-Tisket, A-Tasket,” for example, that lost “brown and yellow basket” may not have referred to wicker. As a child, the destitute Fitzgerald had worked as a lookout at a brothel.

Fitzgerald’s purity of tone, harmonic approach, and acrobatic vocal style were modelled on the white New Orleans singer Connee Boswell—herself influenced by black singers. Like other swing-era musicians, Fitzgerald also mixed genres. See “Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen” during the late 1930s vogue for Yiddish songs, and the “Cow Cow Boogie” about a singing cowboy “raised on locoweed” who had “a knockout Western accent with a Harlem touch.”

With Webb’s death in 1939, Fitzgerald began fronting his band. As the war years approached, popular music took on a lusher, more sentimental tone. Trumpeter Harry James’ band had the era’s signature sound. Fitzgerald, in turn, cultivated a more straightforward style and reduced her accent. By the mid-1940s, she would meet even Harry Reid’s demanding Obama test: “a ‘light-skinned’ African American ‘with no Negro dialect, unless [s]he wanted to have one’”—and she didn’t want to have one.

Straddling the Divide Between Sweet and Hot

Fitzgerald was breaching the divide between “sweet” music, which was supposedly purely white European-style, sung right over the melody and supported by lush harmonies, and “hot” music, which was supposedly purely African-American, with syncopated rhythms and improvised vocal and instrumental lines. She was joined as a cultural appropriator by Nat “King” Cole, who also lost his African-American accent as he transitioned from pianist to vocalist in the late 1940s, emulating Bing Crosby’s smooth style.

While some white bands were exclusively sweet (Guy Lombardo) and many black bands primarily hot, boundaries were always permeable. As far back as the 1910s, African-American bandleader James Reese Europe was musical director for the sensational white dance team of Vernon and Irene Castle, while Jewish singer Sophie Tucker growled raunchy (and influential) blues.

In the 1920s, the leading African-American female vocalist, Ethel Waters, switched between sweet phrasing in standard diction (including rolled r’s), and hot vocals with an African-American accent. In “Don’t Blame Me,” she used both in the same song. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers’ first dance duet, the Brazilian-themed Carioca in “Flying Down to Rio” (1933), is backed by a “sweet” arrangement. After an African-American vocalist’s interlude, the pair then perform a “hot” duet.

The Times Change, and So Did the Music

As the big band era faded during the World War II draft, Fitzgerald became a solo act, engaging in her next act of cultural appropriation. Bebop’s originators were primarily African-American, but their harmonic structure drew from early twentieth century European chromaticism, and their even strings of eighth notes were influenced by Bach. Ella embraced the new music, scatting through a reworked version of the 1920s Gershwin tune “Oh Lady Be Good” (and recycling it for decades), to the point where she later claimed that by the 1950s, she couldn’t find work because she was only singing bebop.

Fitzgerald exaggerated: throughout her 260-side run for Decca from 1935-1955, this busy professional worked in a range of ballad, swing, and Broadway idioms (though rarely the blues). After the Caribbean migration to the Northeast, and well before Harry Belafonte’s arrival, she culturally appropriated calypso in “Stone Cold Dead in the Market,” picking up a dead-on accent in her then-home of Queens.

But Ella faced a crossroads by the mid-1950s, as her Decca contract ended. Bebop had never been a huge commercial success, and big band swing was far in the past. Fitzgerald, pushing 40, had little appeal for young rhythm and blues or rock ‘n roll audiences. After producing a career retrospective Songbook record series for Fred Astaire in 1952, her manager, Norman Granz, envisioned Fitzgerald’s boldest act of cultural appropriation. He would produce a canonical Great American Songbook from the work of the major American pop composers from 1925-1945. She would employ her pure, girlish tone to sing them in a straightforward, uninflected, on-the-beat style, often at excruciatingly slow tempos, over plush Populuxe swing arrangements.

To take one example from the vast series, Cole Porter’s ballad of prostitution, “Love for Sale,” sounds like it was done under the influence of Fentanyl rather than Wacky Dust. Most “sweet” singers of the 1930s had never done anything this radical, although Bing Crosby, distancing from his early cultural appropriation of Louis Armstrong, came close. Granz repositioned Fitzgerald as the black Kate Smith, girlish, sexless, and overweight (the singer struggled with diabetes in later life), and a tribune for listeners horrified by slender, sexual, harmonically primitive rock ‘n rollers.

Without Cultural Appropriation, There’d Be No Ella Fitzgerald

Discussing Fitzgerald’s musical strategy, Benny Carter, who had discovered her at the Apollo Theater in 1934, told me, “And it worked!” Fitzgerald developed a new audience for her LPs and appearances in concert halls and on TV variety shows. Ella continued to reprise old hits and licks from all the way back to Chick Webb days. On hearing Fitzgerald in concert, one singer friend was horrified to discover how little was improvised.

Even in a successful series of jazz albums with Louis Armstrong, Fitzgerald struggled to navigate her identities. For years, I thought her performance on their Porgy and Bess album was clueless. In fact, she gamely deployed her “white” style to somehow depict a stereotypical, oversexed black George Gershwin/DuBose Heyward character, while simultaneously supporting Armstrong’s highly improvised “black” vocal line. It’s amazing she didn’t get whiplash.

Ella was guarded about her personal life, which helped burnish her black Kate Smith image, but she was no innocent girl. Long after her death, a glimpse of the real person appeared in “Twelve Nights in Hollywood” (2009), the excellent, unexpurgated version of a 1961 album. “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered” is the work of a woman who’s been around the block—Fitzgerald had been divorced twice by then, with reports of a secret third marriage—unlike the bland Songbook version. In this live album, recorded in front of an entertainment industry audience at the Crescendo club, the singer is sardonic, chatty with friends, annoyed at people talking over the music, and recklessly (and cheerfully) improvisatory.

With rock’s triumph in the 1960s, Fitzgerald’s days as a huge pop star came to a close, but she continued to work regularly in large halls like Radio City, where I heard her around 1987. Jazz fans formed a larger segment of her remaining fanbase. She employed a more improvisatory style, particularly in her late-career albums with guitarist Joe Pass, and selectively reincorporated a “black,” bluesy, rougher sound into her singing.

Cultural appropriation was no taboo for Ella Fitzgerald—she built her career on it. If the social justice warriors want to police it, they’ll need Hillary’s digital goons to BleachBit every Ella Fitzgerald .mp4—not to mention the rest of American music—off the face of the earth.

Black Graduates Do Themselves No Favors By Booing Betsy DeVos,"The graduates at the historically black Bethune-Cookman University were presented with a unique opportunity to hear a speech from our sitting secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. Students drowned out DeVos while she talked about being solution-oriented instead of drumming up conflict with folks with whom one disagrees. That a college administrator had to address a group of recent graduates as if they were raucous high schoolers illustrates how infantilized American college students have become.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is booed as she gives a commencement address at a historically black university https://t.co/5C76ScpIeB pic.twitter.com/WqHKu9MuVt — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 11, 2017

After the protesting students, who the school administration numbers at approximately 20, 13 of whom were escorted out of the ceremony, met public criticism for their behavior, more than 200 black university professors signed a public letter supporting their actions.

“The world watched you protest the speaker you never should have had,” the letter says. “We cheered as we saw so many of you refuse to acquiesce in the face of threats and calls for complicity. Your actions fit within a long tradition of Black people fighting back against those who attack our institutions and our very lives with their anti-Black policies and anglo-normative practices. Betsy DeVos’ commitment to dismantling public education and her egregious framing of historically Black colleges and universities as ‘pioneers’ in school choice are just two examples of why she should never have been invited to speak at an event celebrating Black excellence.”

Wrong. It does not matter what your opinion is of Betsy DeVos, booing her during a speech is disrespectful. There has always been a trickle-down from predominantly white colleges to historically black colleges. The worse of these has been a blatant contempt for people who represent contrasting viewpoints.

Of course no one will ever actually know where other people stand on any given issue if only a select few are allowed to voice their perspectives. Being intellectually lazy has become the standard, and too many people are comfortable allowing their favorite news filters to determine what they believe.

School Choice Benefits People Like Me

An earlier benign statement from DeVos praising historically black colleges and universities as an example of the power of school choice received several anecdotal responses. Here is mine in support of HBCUs as contemporary vehicles for choice in higher education.

As an 18-year-old graduating from a predominantly black high school in suburban Illinois, I had a few choices for college: Play football at a small college, take a modest academic scholarship to attend The University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign, or accept a more substantial academic scholarship to attend Morehouse College. I chose the latter because my father, my mentor, and I agreed that I would get a fine education for a good price at a school with an environment I would feel comfortable in.

While of course the same will not be true for all black Americans and indeed some of my most successful former classmates are U of I graduates, I wouldn’t trade my experience at the small, all-male HBCU for anything. As a proud HBCU graduate, I hate to see students graduating from a college like mine fall into the same rut I’ve seen at the predominantly white university I attend for graduate school.

Denying people the right to present their ideas is antithetical to academic rigor. At least the administrators at Bethune-Cookman showed a little spine compared to their larger university counterparts. We should praise HBCUs like Talladega College for taking an unpopular stancein accepting an invitation to perform at President Trump’s inauguration, even if we disagree.

True Growth Comes from Challenging Yourself

There is value in knowing the other side of an argument. It allows for true thinking. One must challenge his or her idiosyncratic presuppositions at all cost. The real battle of intellectualism occurs within the arena of one’s own mind. It is the only way to discern what one actually believes. This is how people become truly useful.

Of course most of us would rather just rehash and repeat what we have heard our favorite pundits say. Instead, I recommend people find an argument, then read a book and listen to a person speak in favor of that argument. Next, read a book and listen to a person speak in opposition to that argument. If a person does this a few hundred times, chances are that person might actually be capable of thinking. It is possible to come away from this process with unchanged feelings, but any arguments will be stronger thanks to a better understanding of the topic.

I read The New Yorker and The New York Times exclusively for ten years. I didn’t stop reading those periodicals; I just added National Review and Townhall to my daily reading list. People are easier to control when they are incapable of thinking for themselves. Establishing original ideas is an arduous undertaking but ideas forged by fire are the only things capable of shining light through the darkness.

Black Radicalism Is Not Monolithic

The black radical tradition in America has a rich and interesting history. It contains noble figures like Bayard Rustin and a few not so noble figures. It is partially rooted in Marxist doctrine and more contemporary perspectives in post-modernism. Like any other belief system, it has as many derivations as it has believers.

Rustin, for example, was an ardent supporter of liberty, and his brand of radicalism doesn’t quite resemble the silence-your-opposition type that pervades college campuses today. The value a collectivist black identity has for any particular end, such as economic advancement for black Americans, is up for debate.

You will find many different arguments concerning what role radical blackness may play in contemporary America. Protesting has a certain value in a free society, but not all protests are created equal. Those designed to limit the free expression of ideas by silencing keep those participating in the protest willfully ignorant.

It doesn’t matter if the campus is covered in ivy if the buildings are on fire. While those at the so-called “elite” colleges are fashioning themselves to be useless, it is up to us less-privileged citizens to reorient the culture of the country. Those who wish to carry on the black radical tradition should do so knowing it requires a high degree of effort. Don’t adopt the lazy belief that silencing opposing viewpoints is any way to carry on a useful intellectual tradition.

People should save booing for entertainment. It’s best to face opportunities to learn something with open ears and shut mouths.

"No, Willie Parker, Jesus Would Not Kill Babies In The Womb","In a recent New York Times article, Dr. Willie Parker says he believes “that as an abortion provider, [he is] doing God’s work.” It’s his Christian faith, the author contends, that drives him to abort babies. His “Life’s Work” (as his new book is ironically titled) is to end life for every preborn child that comes before him.

With the release of his book he is quickly becoming a hero and would-be martyr of abortionists, as they conveniently neglect the facts to make their case. As a self-identifying Christian, African-American, and feminist, he’s the perfect candidate to be the face of abortion advocacy.

Christianity’s Objections to Abortion Are Unyielding

Parker’s self-identifying as a Christian is a dream come true for abortionists. Anything they can do to imply Jesus was sympathetic to their cause builds hope that they can tip the scales in their favor. Hence the inclusion of this laughable line: “remember that conservative Christianity’s ferocious opposition to abortion is relatively new in historical terms.”

Remember, this is The New York Times, not The Onion, neglecting the scores of information highlighting the opposite case. One of the earliest Christian documents, The Didache, explicitly prohibits abortion. But overlook that fact because it’s inconvenient.

Historic Christianity has a long tradition of opposing abortion. The first Christians in Rome were also known to rescue abandoned children and take upon themselves the burden of raising them. That one could claim to represent Jesus, who came to offer abundant life, by helping “desperate women” to snuff out the life in their wombs is doublespeak right from the pages of “1984.” Jesus’ own mother, Mary, would’ve been a prime candidate for abortion as a “desperate” and unmarried woman who had faced ridicule for her pregnancy. Instead, the Bible calls her womb “blessed.”

The author correctly, but misleadingly, mentions the Bible’s silence on the issue. While the Bible doesn’t mention abortion by name, even a first-year seminary student would be quick to point out that some of the central claims of Christianity are not taught explicitly in Scripture, but rather made by inference. Chief of these is the orthodox belief in the Trinity, a word never used in the Bible but taught overwhelmingly by implication. We can add abortion to this list.

The Jewish people, some of whom later became the first Christians, were to avoid partaking in the practices of the surrounding peoples, who sacrificed their children to appease their gods. Christians have long held that to abort one’s child as an act of worship to the gods of convenience is not permitted by the God of the Bible. But abortion advocates will attempt to play the “he’s a Christian” card by spinning opposition from Christians to imply Parker is persecuted within his own faith tradition.

So, Do Black Lives Matter?

The second thing abortion elites love about Parker is his skin color. Any opposition he faces from white pro-lifers not associated with Christianity can be easily dismissed as bigotry. Sweep under the rug for a minute that even black celebrities are accusing abortion providers in black communities of genocide. While Planned Parenthood’s media arm proclaims support of black lives, its other arm is reaching for a pair of forceps to end life for hundreds of black babies each day.

In the shortest chapter of his book, Parker dismisses any notion that aborting black babies is a conflict of interest. His argument is that white pro-lifers are seeking to impoverish black women by forcing them to raise kids they can’t afford. He has convinced himself that he is helping his fellow African-Americans by freeing them from the responsibilities of parenting.

In the tradition of the black slave owners in the Confederate South, Parker makes his money by breaking the backs (or spines and what-have-you) of others, many of whom share his skin color. He can’t admit that his work (some have called it his “ministry”) hurts his own people or it’d affect his bottom line. Abortion advocates want us all to simply accept that black lives only matter once they’ve had the privilege of being born. This brings us to the final contradiction of Parker’s platform.

Fighting For Women, Or Against Them?

Parker considers himself a feminist. He believes he is bettering the future for females. Don’t think too long about the number of female lives he’s ended before they’ve begun. This is nothing new to the insane logic of abortion advocacy. If they can successfully shift our attention off the rights of the life inside the womb to the perceived “rights” the pregnant woman has over her inhabited womb, they’ve succeeded.

If we value the lives of women, we must value the lives of all women, whether they have been born or not. That is where Parker’s feminism, and the majority of what is called feminism today, makes a glaring omission. Their interest is simply in women having the right to sex without consequence.

The New York Times article concludes with a strong appeal to our emotions. Shouldn’t a 12-year-old-girl whose father raped her be permitted to abort her child? Those who advocate for life do so for all people, including those who are raped (who often regret aborting) and the children that are conceived as a result of such rape.

Unplanned pregnancy has affected my own family. No doubt it’d make our lives more convenient to have one less mouth to feed and one less diaper to change. But we believe our lives are just one among many and we don’t have the right to infringe upon the lives of others, even if we’re responsible for bringing them into the world.

Parker’s public persona is a farce. He parades the myth that he has a moral responsibility to “help women” while he strips them of their own responsibility to the children they’ve conceived. Christianity places value upon the lives of black women, so much so that it envisions a world in which their lives aren’t ended in the womb. But maybe we’re the ones who are deceiving pregnant women? Perhaps we’re the ones getting rich by volunteering with crisis pregnancy centers and giving away free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and diapers.

Oh, that’s right, it’s Parker’s bank account that grows every time a woman “chooses” abortion. The unsung heroes whose faith drives them to volunteer in crisis pregnancy centers make costly sacrifices to love their neighbors, even when those little neighbors’ own parents aren’t sure if they want to commit to parenthood. But go ahead, Willie, tell yourself you’re loving your neighbors by making sure their hopes for the future die along with the children in their wombs.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/05/18/no-willie-parker-jesus-not-kill-babies-womb/,2017-05-18
Why The Supreme Court’s Liberals Flipflopped On Gerrymandering,"Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that two of North Carolina’s congressional districts are unconstitutionally constructed based on race. In doing so, the court further clouded an already opaque line of case law and made it even more difficult for states to comply with the Voting Rights Act. It also inadvertently called parts of the VRA into question in a way that could reshape the congressional delegations from the South in a manner the court likely did not intend.

The ruling in Cooper v. Harris is the culmination of two decades of litigation. The history of that district is important in understanding the twisting strands of jurisprudence and shifting theories of democratic representation that led us to this point. A look at that history will show how the Supreme Court’s liberal justices abandoned their principles in pursuit of a purely political win for Democrats.

Racial Gerrymandering and the Voting Rights Act

North Carolina’s congressional delegation gained a twelfth House seat after the 1990 census, which coincided with some new VRA interpretations from the U.S. Department of Justice. The VRA was originally read to bar states from using their voting laws—including the drawing of district lines—to dilute the votes of minority groups. By the 1990s, the DOJ had come to believe that the best way to uphold this provision was to require that states with significant minority populations maximize the number of districts with majority-minority populations.

In North Carolina in 1991, this meant making two majority-black districts instead of the one the Democratic state legislature had proposed. Earlier court rulings also required that all districts be equal in population, and because the black population of North Carolina was not all in one place, this ensured the legislature would do some creative line-drawing. The result was this map, with the 12th district there in pink:

It’s not a pretty picture, and in the 1993 Supreme Court case that resulted, Shaw v. Reno, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor called the lines a “bizarre shape.” The case forced the Supreme Court to confront for the first time the contradictory aims of not diluting the black vote while also not gerrymandering people on the basis of race. At that point, Republicans were among those challenging the district lines.

It’s not easy to square the circle. Distributing black North Carolinians equally across all districts would, given the racial polarization of voting then prevalent, have likely resulted in districts sending 12 white representatives to Congress. On the other hand, cramming most into two serpentine districts destroyed the idea that each congressman represents a discrete geographic community. The lines of the 12th district, like those of the 1st (the brown inkblot in the eastern part of the map) were not contiguous with any one region, but built to capture the members of one race and separate them from the other, elevating race over all other factors. As Justice O’Connor put it,

A reapportionment plan that includes in one district individuals who belong to the same race, but who are otherwise widely separated by geographical and political boundaries, and who may have little in common with one another but the color of their skin, bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.

The court held that, under the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, race-based redistricting must be held to a standard of strict scrutiny—it would only be allowed if it were in pursuit of a compelling government interest, narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, and the least restrictive means to achieve it. They sent the matter back to the lower court to sort it out, and after another Supreme Court case, Shaw v. Hunt, the Supreme Court held that although the state’s purpose was to obey the DOJ requirement, the remedy the state chose was not narrowly tailored.

Essentially, the Shaw cases allow and even encourage states to create majority-minority districts, but they can’t go crazy with it. The court was clearly unsettled by the “highly irregular and geographically non compact” district, but had difficulty articulating a standard for how weird-looking was too weird-looking. As with Justice Potter Stewart’s famous definition of pornography, on racial gerrymandering the court knew it when they saw it.

In 1997, the state redrew the lines to be similar, but less stretched out and meandering:

The districts were less ugly, but intended to achieve the same result. The 1997 map was meant for the 1998 election, but further litigation in district court found it still to violate the Equal Protection Clause. The legislature scrambled to draw an even more compact set of districts in time for the 1998 election while the district court decision was on appeal. This was the result:

Are the Lines Political or Racial?

Although this reduced the 12th district down to 47 percent black, the incumbent Democrat, Mel Watt, was still re-elected with 55 percent of the vote (down from 71 percent in 1996). The case reached the Supreme Court the next year in Hunt v. Cromartie.

With the lessons of the Shaw cases in mind, the legislature claimed that the lines they drew in 1997 were not race-based but party-based. Their goals were protecting incumbents, which was constitutionally permissible, and not racial, which might not be. The high court sent the case back to the district court, which did not buy the legislature’s story and held that the gerrymander was race-based and unconstitutional.

In 2001, the Supreme Court heard the appeal from that decision in the case of Easley v. Cromartie. This time, by a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court sided with the legislature. The opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that because the categories of black voters and Democratic voters so heavily overlapped, it was difficult to say what the legislature’s motives were and, absent more evidence, they would assume the permissible motive of incumbent protection.

Of course, by that time the 2000 census had been compiled and new districts were needed in any case, but the ruling in the Cromartie cases would still influence the state legislature’s next attempt. In 2001 the legislature, still controlled by Democrats, drew a map that helped incumbents and divided the state’s congressional delegation almost evenly, producing six Democrats and seven Republicans (the state had gained a thirteenth seat in reapportionment that year). The result looked a lot like the 1997 map but, as it was done for avowedly partisan purposes, the Supreme Court did not get involved.

The Shaw and Cromartie cases produced a strange, intent-based way of looking at redistricting. Race-based line-drawing was forbidden, unless it was strictly necessary to comply with the VRA’s goals of ensuring minority representation and remedying past discrimination. Party-based line-drawing, on the other hand, was mostly allowed and examined far less rigorously. Redistricting cases involving race became exercises in divining legislative intent as much as looking at maps. Such a tricky and uncertain process often leads to the judge substituting his or her perception for the legislature’s intent.

It’s Different When Republicans Do It

The results under the 2001 map held steady as Democrats held between six and eight of the 13 seats throughout the decade. In 2010, a new census called for new districts, but this time Republicans controlled the state legislature for the first time in a century. Their increasing dominance in the South combined with new technology in redistricting led to a 2011 map that was more convoluted than any that came before:

The aim was the same—political gerrymandering—and that purpose still overlapped heavily with racial gerrymandering. But this time the players were different. The new lines produced a 9-4 Republican delegation, which increased to 10-3 after the 2014 midterms. Now Republicans were demanding that the map be upheld and their professed intent be taken at face value, while Democrats now called the map a racist disgrace and demanded that the courts alter it. The parties’ flip-flop was so routine that it went largely unremarked upon, but it does show both sides aimed for political power first, and constitutional theory second.

In the 2011 map, Republicans increased the black population of the 12th district from 43.8 percent to 50.7 percent. In their telling, this was to ensure continued compliance with the VRA while maximizing Republican advantage in the surrounding districts. Now that Republicans had bought into their former theory, however, Democrats abandoned it, saying the new lines were primarily race-based, with political considerations a smokescreen for an impermissible purpose. The district court and appeals court opinions focused on this and found against the legislature, ordering new districts to be created for the 2016 elections.

Are Liberals Abandoning the Voting Rights Act?

The Supreme Court appeal in that case, Cooper v. Harris, came down this week. It played out partly along the lines of intent, with one side believing the legislature’s professed purpose and the other doubting it. In Cooper, though, an additional wrinkle emerged. The majority opinion, written by Justice Elena Kagan, questioned the need for the 12th district to be majority-black at all.

The Constitution does not typically allow for dividing people on the basis of race. As discussed in the Shaw opinions and elsewhere, it is only allowed in congressional districting because of the history of black disenfranchisement, and even then is only permitted under certain strict conditions. One of these conditions is that the region’s white majority “must vote sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.”

Justice Thomas is the modern-day intellectual descendant of Justice John Marshall Harlan, who famously wrote in 1896 that ‘our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.’

That was certainly the case at the time that the VRA was passed in 1965, when despite a sizable black population North Carolina had not elected a black representative since 1898. But according to Kagan and four other justices, by 2017 “electoral history provided no evidence that … could demonstrate … effective white bloc-voting.”

That’s quite a shift for the court’s four liberal justices. Four years ago, in Shelby County v. Holder, Kagan joined three other liberals on the court in dissenting from a ruling premised on that very proposition. In that case, five conservative justices struck down one section of the VRA because “the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.” The liberals, led by the redoubtable Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined in a fiery dissent stating that in 2013 the VRA “surely has not eliminated all vestiges of discrimination against the exercise of the franchise by minority citizens.” By 2017, apparently it had.

The mirror image of the flip-flop is seen on the conservatives’ dissent in Cooper, but their reasoning is more plausible, being at least based on the court’s precedents. Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the three dissenters in Cooper (Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the decision). One of his primary complaints is that the liberals ignored the precedent of the Cromartie cases, in which the political gerrymander was permissible where a racial one was not.

To Alito, the case deals with a political gerrymander, making the presence or absence of white racial-bloc voting irrelevant—they’re different issues requiring different analyses. The Kagan group, on the other hand, sees this as a race case but twists the logic 180 degrees from their ruling in a similar race case in Shelby County.

The only consistent justice in all of this is Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas joined the conservatives in striking down VRA preclearance in Shelby County and joined the liberals in ignoring VRA anti-dilution rules in Cooper. That is unsurprising; Thomas has always been the most logically consistent justice on the Supreme Court. His position has always been that race-based districting is suspect, no matter what the VRA says.

Thomas is the modern-day intellectual descendant of Justice John Marshall Harlan, who famously wrote in 1896 that “our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.” Other justices accept this ideal only when it suits their purposes. In 2013, the liberals believed racism in voting patterns to be so widespread that it required a federal bureaucracy to ensure minority voting rights. In 2017, they proclaimed race-based voting patterns to have ended. The switch is so results-based as to defy any other explanation.

We should hope for higher principles from our highest court. On redistricting, at least, Justice Thomas is the only up to the job.

Being Saved By A Gay Woman Doesn't Delegitimize Scalise's Politics,"“Once he gets out of the hospital, Rep. Steve Scalise ought to change his position on gay marriage and a host of other issues.” Thus saith George Takei, MSNBC’s Joy Reid, and a number of other liberal voices who are demanding that the Majority Whip see the error of his conservative ways after his attempted assassination was thwarted by Special Agent Gay Black Woman.

Gay Black Woman is not, as you might guess, the special agent’s given name. It’s Crystal Griner. But considering Scalise’s politics, Griner’s name and bravery had to play second fiddle to her sex, sexuality, and race. It was just too deliciously ironic, you see, that a Republican now owes his life to someone composed of such non-Republican identities.

For those of us with a higher-than-Alanis standard of irony, however, this raises the question, “um, wait, why is that ironic?” Had Scalise ever said, “I oppose same-sex marriage because those who engage in homosexual relationships are incapable of bravery,” then, sure, the irony would be clear. Had this been the logic behind Scalise’s pro-traditional-marriage views, the first thing he should do when he gets out of the hospital is acknowledge that Officer Black Gay Woman’s bravery proved the goodness of gay marriage.

How Intersectionality Drives Us Farther Apart

But Scalise never argued that homosexual unions shouldn’t be considered marriage because gay sex renders people incapable of valor or selflessness. Nor has he ever suggested that gay marriage should be illegal because gay people don’t deserve to have their lives protected. Like most conservatives, he’s argued that, because homosexual unions are incapable of procreation, they’re incapable of being what marriage is. And Crystal Griner’s courage, commendable as it is, neither contradicts nor even addresses Scalise’s argument. So expecting her courage to change his position is just as illogical as expecting Pope Francis to convert to Lutheranism simply because a German mechanic fixed the papal golf cart.

Why, then, are all these voices on the left conflating Griner’s courage with her gayness? Why do people believe that Scalise’s supposed anti-gay bigotry should be destroyed by Griner’s bravery? The answer, it seems, is intersectionality, a mindset that has spread like wildfire through many leftist circles in recent years.

If you’re not familiar with intersectionality, think of it as Identity Politics 3.0. The first version of Identity Politics told us that there are two classes— the privileged oppressors (rich, white, straight, etc.) and the disadvantaged oppressed (poor, black, gay, etc.). Identity Politics 2.0 then told us that your self-chosen identity is part of your humanity.

Those who engage in homosexual acts, for example, are not “men who have sex with other men.” They are “gay men.” Their gayness is part of their very being, and because of this, to oppose same-sex relations is to oppose them as human beings. Now, intersectionality—Identity Politics 3.0—tells us that these various identities are all interconnected and overlapping, forming an elaborate series of identity tunnels that effectively unionize the oppressed against their oppressors.

This is why, for example, the Values and Principles of the Women’s March declare, “we believe Gender Justice is Racial Justice is Economic Justice.” In other words, “the struggles of women are connected to the struggles of minorities, which are connected to the struggles of the poor. So if you rich white ladies don’t check your privilege by supporting the political agendas of minority women and poor women, we’ll toss you across the picket line with the oppressors where you belong and strip you of your feminist credentials.”

The Left Won’t Allow Republicans To Be The Victims

But as the shooting in Alexandria makes clear, intersectionality doesn’t simply insist on the connection of various identities. It also insists on the transfer of good works from one identity to another, a kind of moral Marxism that seeks the redistribution of virtue. Crystal Griner is Special Agent Gay Black Woman. Her various identities cannot be separated from each other, which means that the goodness produced by Griner the Police Officer can be attributed to Griner the Lesbian.

With a trick like that in your back pocket, why bother even engaging Scalise’s argument? If you want to prove the goodness of your political agenda, just hit the intersectionality button and you’ll teleport straight from the line of scrimmage right into the end zone!

To see this trick in action, consider how Rev. Dr. William Barber’s master class on how to prevent Republicans from being victims, even after they were targeted for assassination. In response to Paul Ryan’s statement “an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,” Barber said, “This can’t just be a moral ethic that you apply to congress. That’s why the real question is ‘will one or two days of changes in personality mean a fundamental change in public policy?’… A black man from my alma mater saved their lives. Will they go back to work and restore the voting rights act and stop systemic racism against black people that’s happening through voter suppression and racialized redistricting? … A lesbian black woman saved them. Will they go back to work and promote laws that no longer attack the rights of the LGBT community?”

In other words, “the oppressed did something good, which proves that the policies supported by the oppressed are good, so Republicans better get on board if they want me to stop considering them oppressors.”

Intersectionality Can Only, Ultimately, Result In Violence

Of course, if a conservative Christian saved George Takei from a psycho, knife-wielding Star Trek fan, the actor and LBGT activist would most certainly not be expected to reconsider his support of Obergefell v. Hodges. By design, intersectionality never works in a conservative’s favor. Because privileged identities are oppressive by nature, and because all identities are connected, any good produced by those with privilege is always tainted with the oppressiveness flowing through the tunnels. This is why, for example, when white Christians adopt non-white children, they aren’t consumed with holy desires, but with a white savior complex.

It’s also why privileged, conservative politicians can’t offer up anything but corrupted fruit. Mitt Romney, by virtue of being a white male, was a sexist. And even his binders full of women, his attempt to actively include women in his cabinet, was evidence of his misogyny. By virtue of being a white male, John McCain was a racist, which is why his career-long praise of John Lewis didn’t stop John Lewis himself from comparing McCain to George Wallace. Because they are Republicans, everything Republicans do is tainted with oppression. They have no good works. And the only way they can change that, as Dr. Barber noted, is by becoming Democrats.

The great problem with intersectionality, however, is not merely that it puts conservative politicians at a competitive disadvantage, but that it puts them at risk for violence. Political violence has always been rare in the United States, due in large part to the design of the American government, imperfectly as that design has been executed at times. When you can’t be thrown in jail for airing a minority opinion, when you can’t be fined for having the “wrong” religion, when you have the right to defend yourself from mob violence, violent revolution against the mob isn’t necessary. When your political adversaries don’t have the power to oppress you, you have the luxury of trying to convince them instead of having to kill them.

Intersectionality Is a Dangerous Path

But intersectionality insists that your political adversaries do have the power to oppress you because our white-male-designed government is—surprise, surprise—an oppressive system. And because the privileged are oppressors by nature, they will use that system to oppress you. And because you can’t convince these reprobates not to oppress you, you have only one option left to protect yourself: violence. Granted, the vast majority of those who embrace intersectionality have enough of a moral foundation to avoid this. Most of them won’t take this doctrine to its logical end. But those looking to sanctify their bloodlust just might. In fact, it appears the shooter in Alexandria already did.

What I find saddest about the Alexandria shooting is the perpetrator’s hatred. What I find saddest about the coverage of that shooting is that so many people don’t view Scalise and Griner any differently than the shooter did (or at least would have, had he known who Griner was). “Rep. Homophobe McBigotFace Gunned Down by Vigilante Hero in Defense of Blacks, Gays, Women and Oppressed People Everywhere” is clearly the headline that Alexandria’s shooter was writing in his murderous mind. “Rep. Homophobe McBigot Faced Saved by Officer Black Gay Woman,” the essential headline from many on the left, is not all that different.

Perhaps when Scalise and Griner have healed from their wounds, they’ll sit down and have a conversation about gay marriage. If they do, I’m sure they’ll view each other as friends who disagree rather than as enemies in class warfare. I’m sure that, instead of calling each “the straight white male” and “the gay black woman,” they’ll call each other by name. We ought to do the same.

"One Year After Philando Castile’s Death, 4 Black Leaders Remember","In a season when Americans celebrate our freedoms, questions surrounding the fate of one man’s life and liberties remain unresolved. A beloved son and local school cafeteria worker, 32 year-old Philando Castile was fatally shot in small-town St. Anthony, Minnesota on July 6, 2016—one year ago this week.

During a traffic stop, with Castile’s girlfriend and her daughter in the vehicle, police officer Jeronimo Yanez shot the young black man five times at point-blank range. Dash-cam video footage released on June 20 led to renewed outcry across the political spectrum including in National Review, “The Daily Show,” and The Federalist.

Following a week of deliberation that hinged on the officer’s testimony, a jury of 12 Minnesota citizens found Yanez not guilty of two criminal charges: felony manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm. Yanez was soon released from the police force. Ten days later, on June 26, the City of St. Anthony reached a $3 million settlement with the Castile family to resolve any civil claims.

“The death of Philando Castile is a tragedy for his family and for our community,” read the joint statement by the city and Castile family. “No amount of money could ever replace Philando… The family will continue to deal with their loss through the important work of the Philando Castile Relief Foundation.”

In such a flashpoint of racial tensions, we can learn much by listening well to wise leaders in the black community. Now, black voices from across America offer their views on this tragedy, and what we can learn as we share in the family’s grief.

When a Four Year-Old Tries to Comfort Her Mom

A speaker and writer based in Connecticut, Christina Marie Bennett believes the best lens to see this story through is the eyes of a child.

“Finding out Officer Yanez was acquitted from all charges regarding Philando Castile was tragically perplexing,” she states. “I felt genuinely confused as to how any jury could come to that verdict. Later, when I saw the video of Diamond Reynolds’ 4 year-old daughter comforting her as she was handcuffed in the police car, I was brokenhearted.”

In the viral video, the young girl assures her mom: “I can keep you safe.”

“I assumed that footage of a precious girl in pain would move even the hardest heart. I was wrong. Some people were so caught up in who was right or wrong that they couldn’t connect with the cries of a child. I don’t know what we can learn from an injustice like this, but I know how we can respond. Coming together in empathy and compassion is not an option—it’s something we must do,” Bennett implores.

“We argue about #BlackLivesMatter, #PoliceLivesMatter, and #AllLivesMatter, but beyond the social media fights lies a needed truth. We are all human and we should all be able to look at the footage of that sweet girl asking for a safer world and weep. Along with our tears of grief, we must act by works of justice to make that child’s request a reality.”

Philando Castile Shows Our Justice System is Broken

For Nicola Menzie, pursuing justice in the Castile case and others like it has become all-consuming. Her career as a religion reporter in New York City landed her stories on the Religion News Service and The Christian Post. Yet she noticed that coverage about communities of color, particularly in the Christian press, often lacked depth and authenticity.

This past January, she launched Faithfully Magazine “for people who aspire to do good, obey God, and stay woke.” Menzie and her team have written extensively on Castile’s story.

“Evangelical Christians should not entertain excuses as to why compliant, non-threatening civilians ‘deserve’ to die in encounters with inept police officers. If a jury’s refusal to hold a cop accountable for taking a man’s life and endangering an unarmed woman and child does not alarm you, then you are fast asleep,” states Menzie.“It is a travesty Philando Castile’s life was taken in such a way; a travesty his mother is expected to console herself with money; and a travesty a child is forever scarred by witnessing a cop shoot a man to death.”

She concludes: “I grieve this miscarriage of justice and pray we act to change a broken system.”

When ‘No Comment’ Says Much More

One published author, a mother of three sons, felt she could only address the situation indirectly. Requesting to remain anonymous, she sent on an excerpt of a message to her prayer partners.

“There is a risk whenever anyone speaks in less-than-glowing terms about a split-second decision a law enforcement officer makes. It’s even riskier for a person of color to do so. The truth is, I am afraid. In this day and age, actual persecution on American soil is more likely than it has been for decades for people who look like my kids and me. Surely the fear and intimidation I’m experiencing hinders the cause of Christ,” she confesses.

“Though I would never write anything harsh, because of my color I’d better be extra careful. After all, it’s no exaggeration that I could be shot, in my car, buckled in, with my kid there, totally complying with the officer’s request, with two different video clips of the encounter, no alcohol, no police record… and still the officer who shot me would be found ‘not guilty.’ This makes people like me want to shut up and stay out of it as much as humanly possible.”

“I know I should write a response,” the author concludes to her small circle of praying friends. “But this climate has made me afraid to, which comes straight from the pit of hell. Will you pray for me? Encourage me?”

We Cannot Lose Hope, Says One Black Pastor

Will Ford, an author and teacher who co-leads a church in the Dallas area, sees a big picture view of race relations. He begins, “I agree with David French, the Harvard-trained lawyer, veteran, and leading thinker who stated that the Yanez/Castile verdict was a great ‘miscarriage of justice.’ Yet we have to be careful how we handle this as pastors and leaders.”

“This tragedy can drive a bigger wedge between us,” Ford cautions. “We struggle with many questions: was Castile reaching for his gun or for his wallet? With the way the law is written, if Yanez feels he’s being threatened does he have the right to shoot? All those things come into play. But we can’t see inside that vehicle. And we can get consumed with this case in a way that’s going to bring more division.”

“One Scripture passage has become my playbook for all this,” says Ford. “It’s Second Timothy chapter two, which says in part: ‘The Lord’s bondservant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition…’ As a Christian, I embrace being a bondservant of God—not a bondservant of either the conservatives or the liberals. We are going to be held accountable, that we respond differently than the world.”

“Our nation has actually come farther on racial issues than we ever have before. We cannot let this one case be a defining moment that says, This is how all police are or This is how black lives will always be devalued. We have to keep the dialogue going. We have to be the ones who contend for healing,” he says with hope.

“We also contend for justice, dealing with the bigger issues—because systemically, it’s a complex situation when you look at how class and race tensions play into these incidents. My prayer is that God would use this crucible that we’re all in right now to bring us closer together, that we’d become more united rather than divided.”

College Reinstates Professor Who Said White People Should 'F***ing Die',"Four days after James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on a group of Republican congressmen at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, Trinity Professor Johnny Eric Williams sided with anonymous blogger “Son of Baldwin,” who proposed that black emergency personnel should let wounded white people die rather than lend assistance. Baldwin posted his opinions under the hashtag, #LetThemFuckingDie.

Professor Williams linked Son of Baldwin’s statement, adopted the hashtag as his own, and posted some additional denunciations of white Americans for “their destructive mythology of whiteness and their white supremacy system.” Referring to all “self-identified ‘whites,’” he wrote, “The time is now to confront these inhuman assholes and end this now.”

When Campus Reform broke the story on June 20, it rapidly spread through the media. Trinity College put Professor Williams on leave, beginning June 26.

But after Trinity Dean and Vice President Tom Cresswell reviewed Williams’ statements, he returned with a 31-page report that found his Facebook posts were “extramural utterances” protected by Trinity College’s policy of academic freedom. Trinity College President Joanne Berger-Sweeney endorsed Dean Cresswell’s findings, and added that she doesn’t “condone the hashtag” which “offend[s] me personally” and “contradicts our fundamental institutional values.” Nevertheless, Williams has been reinstated in good standing.

Trinity reached the decision because, like many other colleges, it has failed to draw meaningful lines between valid and invalid claims on academic freedom. That failure plunges colleges ever deeper into the mire of ethnic chauvinism, categorical hatreds, anti-intellectual diatribe, mind-deadening vulgarity, and psychopathology. Worse, we are getting used to this mire and finding it harder to defend essential distinctions. If we are at the point where #LetThemFuckingDie is upheld as a wholesome exercise in “extra-mural” academic speech, we are in serious trouble.

Trinity’s dilemma is in large part a matter of a double standard, created to coddle black radicals on campus. The prevailing view among colleges and universities is that robust declarations of racial resentment by African-American professors or students should be considered within the bounds of academic freedom. This allowance is a one-way street. Similarly abusive language from a white or Asian professor would almost certainly be met with severe sanctions.

Angry Politics Have Trumped Scholarship

Trinity’s decision is but one incident of many in which college officials granted a pass to “hate speech” by radical professors. In 2015, Boston University Professor Saida Grundy received a slap on the wrist after tweeting: “Why is America so reluctant to identify white college males as a population problem?” Earlier this year, Texas A&M Professor Tommy Curry quietly skirted dismissal after an interview emerged in which he said “look, in order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people may have to die.” Students too get a pass.

Gordon Barnes, editor-in-chief of The Advocate, the CUNY graduate student newspaper, published an editorial in fall 2014 “In Support of Violence.” Barnes declared, “The time for peace has passed; indeed it never existed in this country.” He specifically called for violence against the police: “Violence directed towards state representatives is not only warranted, it is necessary.” CUNY apparently thought nothing amiss in Barnes’ extra-mural utterances. To the contrary, in 2017 the CUNY Graduate Center featured Barnes for a “Ph.D. Snapshot” to advertise its history program.

Remarks by a faculty member or a graduate student advocating violence against racial groups might well be reasonable grounds for strong sanctions, including possible dismissal. But this hasn’t happened because colleges and universities have appointed so many faculty members who present themselves as authentic voices of black rage. It is plainly difficult to call someone to account for doing exactly what he was hired to do. Rage-filled black professors are not going to lose their positions for expressing rage.

This situation grew out of decades in which colleges went out of their way to appoint black faculty members who held separatist views and who affected angry attitudes as a badge of authenticity. The initial impetus for such appointments came from liberal white professors who argued that recruiting in this vein would help the colleges retain black students, many of whom couldn’t seem to come to grips with the traditional curriculum and the mostly white faculty that taught it.

We saw this reflected in the Faculty Minutes of Bowdoin College, when we were researching the study that became “What Does Bowdoin Teach?” Faced with the skepticism of his colleagues, Professor Daniel Levine pushed for the immediate creation of Afro-American Studies in 1969. Bowdoin had no one qualified to teach the program. Levin responded by insisting, over and over, “It must be so!” He got his way. Bowdoin dived head first into creating a program grounded in angry politics, rather than scholarship.

How 1960s Policies Shaped Our Environment

These days, many people charitably attribute the frustrations of blacks on campus to inequities in society at large. Those inequities exist, but the campus rage has much more to do with late 1960s decisions by colleges such as Bowdoin to structure black experience in college in a way that guaranteed perpetual maladjustment and resentment. Hire professors of resentment studies who favor black segregation, and you will get more resentment and more desire for segregation. Insist that many black students be admitted at a lower standard of performance than other students, and you will get students primed for the resentment narrative. When these students rebel, high on the list of their demands is the appointment of still more professors of resentment studies. There is now a plain career track for people like Johnny Eric Williams, who specialize in their own rage.

Many black students have a sophisticated understanding of how their colleges are manipulating them. One of Wesleyan’s first black students has since described his admission to Wesleyan as an “experiment.” But it is an experiment that has been institutionalized, and black students can recognize it without understanding how to escape it.

Black students respond to their peculiar situation by seeking refuge in ethnic enclaves in which mutual feelings of oppression are affirmed and reinforced, and where impatience festers until a catalyst for racial grievance inspires student protests. An early instance of this pattern emerged in February 1969, when a group of black Wesleyan students broke into and occupied Fisk Hall after school officials refused to cancel classes in observance of services commemorating Malcolm X. The students refused to vacate the building until administrators conceded to demands for increased academic support (remedial services), an exclusively black residence hall and cultural center, and a black studies department headed by tenured black professors. The Wesleyan protest preceded by two months the more widely reported armed protest at Cornell University.

The 1969 protest at Wesleyan wrung concessions from the administration, but it also set a precedent. In 1990, Sudhama Ranganathan acted in accordance with this script when he hurled two Molotov cocktails through President William M. Chace’s office window, according to the New York Times, in retaliation for Wesleyan’s “failure to promote the rights of minorities.” (Ranganathan, who was the nephew of a Wesleyan professor, pled guilty and received probation.)

This dynamic persists in varying degrees at most, if not all, elite colleges today even as more and more diversity dollars are devoted to programs and services exclusive to students of color. And it’s how reputable schools like Trinity College and Texas A&M end up with a Johnny Eric Williams or Tommy Curry. “More black professors” is a dog whistle for recruitment of humanities and social science professors who reinforce students’ identitarian impulses.

Concession is a convenient option for white administrators ignorant of or unwilling to address mismatching’s harmful effects on students and university culture.

Colleges Have A Responsibility To Their Students

Because Trinity is a private university, it could draw up rules that prohibited such speech as outside the zone of academic freedom. Most Americans would probably agree that Williams crossed some kind of line in making his death wish (“#LetThemFuckingDie”) and compounded it by denying the humanity of other people (“inhuman assholes”). The First Amendment might protect Williams’ right to say such things, but academic freedom does not, and the college has a duty to its students to provide instructional faculty who possess enough self-control to tell the difference.

Trinity College may find some comfort in knowing that it is only one college among a great many to have made the kind of compromise that led to its Johnny Eric Williams moment. Trinity President Berger-Sweeney did her best in playing a bad hand when she distinguished between defending Williams’ “right to express his opinions” and her distaste for some of those opinions.

If colleges are to be more than platforms from which people can shout their disordered fury, more than stages for the perpetual reenactment of racial and other grievances, we should be working now to draw some lines. A man like Johnny Eric Williams should not be a professor at a college that claims the public trust. He has, however, fairly won his fight, given the rules we accepted in higher education. That simply means it is time to change the rules.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/02/trinity-college-reinstates-professor-said-white-people-fing-die/,2017-08-02
Teen Vogue: White People Aren't Allowed To Post GIFs Of Black People,"In a column published by Teen Vogue on Wednesday, a writer argues that if you are white and share a GIF of a black person, you are racist. Lauren Michele Jackson calls the act of sharing a reaction GIF of a black person “digital blackface.”

“Digital blackface does not describe intent, but an act — the act of inhabiting a black persona,” she writes. “Employing digital technology to co-opt a perceived cache or black cool, too, involves playacting blackness in a minstrel-like tradition.”

The “minstrel-like” tradition she’s referring to stems particularly from vaudeville days, when mostly white actors but sometimes also black actors would paint themselves in makeup to resemble an African-American and often portray such characters in an exaggerated or ridiculous manner. In the early nineteenth century particularly, blackface was a common theater trope, but gradually disappeared as Americans’ racial attitudes shifted and the portrayal became seen as an uncharitable caricature.

She continues:

Ultimately, black people and black images are thus relied upon to perform a huge amount of emotional labor online on behalf of nonblack users. We are your sass, your nonchalance, your fury, your delight, your annoyance, your happy dance, your diva, your shade, your ‘yaas’ moments. The weight of reaction GIFing, period, rests on our shoulders. Intertwine this proliferation of our images with the other ones we’re as likely to see — death, looped over and over — and the Internet becomes an exhausting experience. If you find yourself always reaching for a black face to release your inner sass monster, maybe consider going the extra country mile and pick this nice Taylor Swift GIF instead.

Oooookay, being looped in a GIF is not “exhausting,” as it literally requires zero effort. The argument that white people don’t have to react as hard because they can just conscript black people into doing the work for them via GIFs is completely untethered to reality. Remember, GIFs are computer pixels.

Accusing someone of making fun of African-Americans by donning blackface is a serious thing indeed, which is why throwing that term around casually is problematic. When people share a GIF of a black person, they are not painting themselves with blackface makeup to perpetuate a stereotype or bar people entry from theater or even public life. Often they are not even stereotyping, given that posting GIFs is by nature an expression of shared humanity.

Sharing a GIF of someone made up in blackface is one thing, but sharing a GIF of a black person is not the same at all. And to say that white people should stick to sharing images only of white people is at the very least tribalistic and separatist.

Serena Williams Swings But Misses With Black Women’s Equal Pay Day,"Serena Williams is an indomitable force on and off the tennis court. She’s forging pathways for girls and women from hard upbringings to chase after prosperous futures. If only she were not also using her platform to perpetuate a false narrative and victim mentality by celebrating Black Women’s Equal Pay Day.

In Fortune this week, Williams calls out what she refers to as the “long neglected” fact that black women earn 63 cents for every dollar that a white man makes, which is even greater than the alleged pay gap for all women of 79 cents. Despite her tremendous success, Williams sees herself as similar to the other 24 million black women who are struggling against discrimination.

Williams discusses her triumphs in the face of adversity and discrimination starting with childhood due to her race and sex. Any discrimination she may have faced in the sports world, professional world, and her community is despicable. There’s no better revenge than international success.

No One Needs to Stay a Victim

Williams’s success may not be the norm, but she’s not the outlier either. Black women in America are not a homogenous group sharing the same experiences, shouldering the same burdens, and destined to the same fate. As a black woman, I challenge the idea that every black woman in America is cheated by 37 cents on the dollar in her paycheck each week simply because of her skin tone.

These pay gaps set women up to think of themselves as victims—powerless to change their outcomes. We are constantly told that women earn about 80 percent of what men make and that it’s driven by sex discrimination. Now, we learn that the pay gap for black women is even wider.

However, these calculated gaps rest on an inaccurate manipulation of data. The oft-cited Department of Labor statistic that women earn only 79 cents of what men make compares the average salaries of all men and women with full-time jobs. When controlling for factors such as hours worked by men and women, age, occupation, job title, education, and seniority, the difference in pay shrinks to a few cents. The pay gap also ignores the nuances of industries where some women earn more than men such as therapists, social workers, and teachers’ aides.

Women taking time out of the workforce to have a family plays a massive role in their earnings as well as opportunities for career advancement.

We Are the Product of Our Choices

The black women’s pay gap is as absurd as the women’s pay gap. Black women are the backbones of their families and communities. They lead more than half (54 percent) of black families with children under 18, serving as breadwinners and primary caretakers. Nearly two out of three black women are in the workforce, giving them the highest labor force participation rate among women. As with all women, the choices they make in selecting careers and throughout their careers affect their earnings potential.

Black women are drawn to jobs and careers in health care, human services, and education because they offer the chance to care for the educational, physical, and emotional needs of their families and communities. According to a 2016 Georgetown study, 20 percent of degree holders in human services and community organizing and 19 percent in social work were black, earning a median salary of about $40,000. Just 7 percent of blacks have STEM-related bachelor’s degrees, and they command a median annual salary of $84,000. Black women are overrepresented in jobs such as nursing, home health aides, and personal and home care aides. Although critical, these are not high-paying positions.

Black women are also resourceful and adept at creating opportunities for themselves. They comprise the fastest-growing demographic of small business owners in the nation, growing by 126 percent from 1997 to 2015. Those businesses are concentrated in personal care services such as hair and nail salons as well as health care and social assistance, which may provide stability and growth potential as the American population continues to age but are not higher-revenue sectors.

How to Actually Help Black Women

If we want to boost disposable income for black women, lowering their personal income tax and business tax rates is a great place to start. Scaling back costly and time-consuming occupational licenses, which make it difficult for black women to secure jobs and start businesses, is another area for policy reform.

We don’t need far-reaching legislation that aims to rectify perceived wrongs. Where discrimination exists, it should be exposed and prosecuted. Sex- and race-based discrimination are not necessarily behind the pay gap for black women, but rather the honorable career choices that they make to help others including their families.

Serena Williams hit the ball out of the court with her record numbers of tennis titles and will no doubt bring a winning attitude to the tech and fashion sectors. However, her focus on the black female pay gap is a missed ball that I hope others won’t pick up and run with.

‘Detroit’ Makes Us Face The Truth That Racists Come In Every Color,"Contains spoilers.

“Race relations” are interpersonal relationships that carry all the baggage of everyone involved. This important and divisive topic cannot be discussed in term such as, “Oh he’s black so he’s going to believe this and behave that way,” or “She’s white, so this must be the case.” Traditionally, we call such statements what they are: overgeneralizations and stereotypes.

Sadly, it seems modern public discourse has devolved into this mindset as of late, especially when discussing the relationships between law enforcement and African-Americans. Not so with writer Mark Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow in their recent film “Detroit.” Instead of portraying the Detroit race riots of 1967 as the racist, predominantly white police force against the victimized black community of that era, Boal and Bigelow endeavor to take a more honest approach.

The movie centers on the seizure of the Algiers Hotel and annex by a handful of Detroit police and National Guard troops during the riots. The small brigade of officers and troops begins taking what they perceive to be sniper fire from the nearby hotel. In reality, one of the young black men who lives in the annex is playing an ill-fated prank.

“Carl Cooper” (Jason Mitchell) has a “starter pistol”—a very loud, fake gun used to begin track races. Carl likes to play jokes with his starter pistol. Out of frustration with the police presence, he takes the pistol and fires off several rounds, well in earshot of the officers and troops. Already on edge from riots’ intensity, the police and troops return fire with real bullets and seize the building. Upon entering the foyer of the annex, Officer Krauss (Will Poulter) encounters Carl, immediately guns him down, and plants a knife next to his body to give the illusion that Krauss had been attacked.

And so the grisly night begins.

The Collateral Damage of Two Fools

It begins because one frustrated individual decided to deal with his frustration stupidly. It begins because one racist cop happened to be on the scene. It’s not a “black and white” thing. It’s two individuals who have chosen to hate each other coming face to face. Everyone within their immediate vicinity will reap the whirlwind of their hatred.

What ensues is a night of beatings and torture. It results in a police officer who has never discharged his firearm before killing another man in cold blood. The stupidity of one man and psychotic racism of another show us the fear and hopelessness of all involved.

Already, Boal and Bigelow highlight none of this ever begins as a “black versus white” thing. To be sure, it will turn into that, but it starts with two individuals deciding to hate each other because each fears the other’s skin color. The film does well to demonstrate that, without these two individuals, the outcome would have been very different. However, the movie also finds culpable all who fall prey to the storm of hate these two initiate.

The local African-American reaction to this situation is destroying their own businesses and homes. A striking scene portrays several black men throwing rocks at white firefighters who are attempting to control fires rioters have set. The fear of the largely white police force is certainly evident in how they respond to and interact with individual blacks. The black men respond by hating all things “white.”

Bitterness Helps Nobody

Perhaps one of the most telling sub-plots of the film is that, after all is said and done, “Larry Reed” (Algee Smith), forgoes fame and fortune in the Motown record scene and settles for poverty and obscurity, despite having unparalleled vocal talent, because “White people listen to this music.” Because of his ordeal at the Algiers hotel that fateful night, he chooses to hold hate for all whites, even if that means he must suffer. He refuses to be a part of anything that will give one once of pleasure to any white person. Reed forgoes all of his dreams because two men—one black and one white—decided to be stupid one day.

We see again that this whole conflict is highly personal and individual. The truth is very, very complicated. That’s because we are all complex individuals who cannot be easily categorized and defined by something as irrelevant as our skin color.

Now, amid much darkness in this film, there is light. First, the movie gives us white heroes. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Aside from Krauss and his blindly loyal minions, each white person in the film is earnestly trying to solve the problem as best he knows how. Besides Krauss, Boal and Bigelow portray every other white person as trying to help. Sadly, sometimes this is people simply turning a blind eye, but at least choosing not to participate in the problem. Many times it is people who are white trying to actively love and serve their neighbors in their community.

We also have the genuine hero of the docudrama, Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega). Melvin is a part-time armed security guard. In one particularly moving scene, Dismukes is shown serving coffee to the white National Guard soldiers posted near to him in an act of peace and unity. Throughout the ordeal at the Algiers, Melvin constantly tries to minimize suffering and loss of life. He does not do this out of cowardice or capitulation to the racist Krauss, but out of a heart of courage. Again, here is another individual the filmmakers depict as defying the stereotype and the status quo.

Have We Learned From This Past?

Despite these glimmers of light, the film as in real life ends as it did—with three racist cops evading justice and all the bitterness and polarization that ensues. It was a very dark time in our recent history. It gives us pause to consider how much we have progressed since 1967. Are we just as racist and divided and barbaric as we were in Detroit, given recent events like Ferguson, Charlottesville, and Baltimore? Or have we made progress?

The biggest challenge the movie brings to us is the charge against our identity politics. “Well he’s white, so…” or “She’s black, so…” No. “He” is an individual. So is “she.” Just like us. That is what the film wants us to know. It wants us to know that individuals, not “identity groups,” do what’s right and, in the case of Detroit circa 1967, do what’s wrong.

That terrible year in what was then the nation’s fifth-largest city, two men participated in tearing that once wonderful community to shreds. Those two men and individuals like them destroyed a city that year, and it has never recovered. It wasn’t “white cops” who did it. It wasn’t “black thugs.” It was complicated and complex individuals who did that in concert.

“Detroit’s” makers imply that if you’re tempted to blame “those dirty blacks” or the “cracker cops,” both perceptions are wrong and evil. If we get right down to it, one man’s hatred and racism caused the Algiers incident, and that was Phillip Krauss. Did others fall prey to mob mentality? Yes, they did. But one man, not an entire class of men, did evil that night.

Check Yourself Before We Wreck Ourselves

This film caused me to ask myself, “Do I hold grudges and hatred for a group because that group is really completely evil, or is there something else going on there?” Certainly groups like the National Socialist Party or the Klu Klux Klan deserve absolute opposition, but how often do I have a single encounter with a person of a particular group then judge the entire group based on that one person’s actions? It gives a man cause to reevaluate his prejudices, to be sure.

I took in this film with my lovely wife, Jennifer. As we exited the theater, I looked at her and she was visibly exhausted. I asked, “You okay, babe?”

“Yeah,” she answered, but then continued, “It’s just that nobody won.”

It’s just that nobody won.

“Detroit” shows us that nobody wins when we fall prey to mob mentality and identity politics; when we judge an entire group based on the actions of just a few. Krauss was, no question, the epitome of evil. Carl was stupid and angry. Larry was unforgiving. Officer Roberts (Austin Hébert) was a coward—then a courageous hero.

The matter is complicated. It is as complex as each of us is, and it is never as simple as “us” versus “them.” When we reduce it to “us” versus “them” instead of “Krauss” and “Carl” and “Larry,” nobody wins. Perhaps we could begin again and at least start with our fellow man as we meet each person face to face, forgiving the past and looking toward a better future. This is what “Detroit” would teach us.

"No, George Clooney, 1950s Race Riots Were Nothing Like Charlottesville","George Clooney says his new film about racial division in the 1950s mirrors racial strife today, but the two are hardly alike, and Clooney’s reckless rhetoric and politically charged production will only agitate conflict—which might be the actor’s ultimate goal.

“Suburbicon,” which Clooney describes as an angry movie for an angry nation, is the true story of a black family that faced months of harassment and violence when they moved into an all-white neighborhood in Levittown, Pennsylvania. Clooney says he came up with idea for the film while watching Trump’s campaign speeches “about building fences and scapegoating minorities.”

“I started looking around at other times in our history when we’ve unfortunately fallen back to these things,” he said. “And I found this story that happened in Levittown, Pennsylvania. The idea of juxtaposing these two was to say, you’re looking in the wrong direction if you’re blaming this African-American family for all your woes. Some of us are able to speak to the idea of white men feeling that they’re losing their privilege and blaming it all on minorities. And of course, it has nothing to do with that.

“When you talk about ‘Making America Great Again,’” he continued. “America being great everyone assumed was the Eisenhower ‘50s, and it was great if you were a white, straight male, but other than that it probably wasn’t so great. It’s fun to lift up that curtain and look underneath that thin veneer and see some of the real problems that this country has yet to completely come to terms with.”

More Comparisons Between the 1950s and Charlottesville

Lynda Myers, whose parents were the ones who moved into the idyllic northern neighborhood and faced violence as a result, said, “I thought that race relations had improved quite a bit until, unfortunately, President Trump became president. People felt they could now say out loud what they really felt and not hide it. Now they feel open and free to do what they want to do and hate the way they want to hate. It’s almost like there was a bandage on it, and now it’s been ripped off.”

Stephen Galloway wrote in “The Real-Life Racial Battle That Inspired George Clooney’s ‘Suburbicon’” that the parallels between the 1950s riots surrounding the Myers’ family and the recent protests in Virginia are “haunting.” The film “could not be better timed, coming soon after the Aug. 12 events of Charlottesville and the uproar following President Donald Trump’s apparent defense of the white supremacists who had demonstrated there.”

Matt Damon, who stars in the film, agrees, saying, “We couldn’t have predicted obviously when we were filming these race riots that we would have something like Charlottesville. It does speak to the fact that these issues have not and are not going away until there’s an honest reckoning in our country.”

Clooney says he once thought “segregation was going away,” but it hasn’t. “We still have a lot of work to do from our original sin of slavery and racism.”

Reaction to the film has been one of anger as viewers compare the 1950s riots to those today, but Clooney said this is the point. “It is an angry film,” he said. “If you go to our country, depending on which side of the aisle you sit on, it’s probably the angriest I’ve ever seen the country, and I lived through the Watergate period of time. There’s a dark cloud hanging over our country right now.”

“People are angry,” he continued. “A lot of us are angry, angry at ourselves, angry at the way the country is going, and angry at the way the world is going. This seems to reflect that. I don’t think that that’s a bad thing. I think that’s a fair thing to do. We didn’t want this to just be this polemic that’s a civics lesson. We wanted it to be funny. We wanted it to be mean. But it certainly got angry and it got angrier as we were shooting.”

‘Make America Great Again’ Is Not About Race

Clooney is right: there is a lot of anger, but he fails to understand the root of it—at least on the Right—and thus is fueling it. He thinks Trump rallies, Trump policies, and the impulse behind “Make America Great Again” are all rooted in white privilege and racism. He couldn’t be more wrong.

People like Clooney mistakenly fixate on a minority of racists who don’t reflect Trump’s base of support. They ignore the wide swath of Americans who are concerned about our nation’s strength on the global stage, the encroachment of socialism, the silencing of free speech by political correctness, the bludgeon of white guilt that has been repeatedly used to advance big-government policies, and the deaf and dumb career politicians who refuse to respect American citizens of all creeds and colors—their needs, interests, hopes, and dreams.

“Make America Great Again,” for these people, has nothing to do with whitey in the 1950s and everything to do with our current national crises that are rooted in aberrant political ideologies, not racism. There is a severe danger in superimposing the past on the present for political opportunism, especially when there aren’t real parallels. Racial unrest in the past is nothing like the conflicts we’re seeing today. They’re not the same in form or substance.

The 1950s Were Nothing Like Charlottesville

America’s history of racial violence is bloody and rooted in hatred. Lynchings in the South, violent mobs dragging innocent blacks from their homes, hangings, murders, burnings. Post-World War I, race riots in northern urban areas increased as blacks migrated from the South. Displacement of whites by blacks in housing and employment heightened tensions and violence ensued.

The summer of 1919 was called “The Red Summer” as 26 race riots swept across the country—Chicago, Washington, Charleston, Omaha, to name a few. Hundreds of blacks were killed, and thousands were wounded and left to struggle in the streets as their homes were burned and destroyed.

In Atlanta in 1906, white mobs reacted violently to the media-fueled perception that black crime was rampant. They murdered blacks and looted their businesses and homes. After four days of rioting, ten blacks were dead and hundreds injured.

In 1921, when a white girl in Tulsa accused a young black man of attempted rape in a public elevator, he was dragged off to prison. A group of armed black men showed up to protect him, and violence broke out between whites and blacks. A mob of thousands attacked black neighborhoods with bombings, machine gun fire, and brutal fighting. The National Guard was called in to control the situation. In the end, 50 whites and nearly 200 blacks were dead. Millions of dollars worth of property was destroyed.

In 1943, as the black population increased in Detroit, rioting broke out when whites and blacks clashed in a recreational area. Whites traveled by car to black neighborhoods, shooting and throwing homemade bombs. Federal troops were called in, but not before 25 blacks and 9 whites were killed.

There are many others, but this gives us some real perspective. Charlottesville was a small group of wannabe neo-Nazis who were protesting the removal of a Confederate statue. They were exercising their free speech rights when violent anarcho-communists who oppose capitalism and democracy showed up and attacked them. A single individual reacted to the violence with more violence, driving his car into the crowd and killing a young woman.

The protest in Virginia was between two politically motivated, mostly white groups who have been vying for power for decades on the domestic and global stage. It wasn’t a mob of whites beating up blacks because they don’t like them moving into in their neighborhoods or taking their jobs.

Stop Smearing Basic Conservative Policies as Race-Related

As bad as Charlottesville was, it was nothing like the race riots between whites and blacks that have plagued our country in the past. Trump campaign rallies where voters cheered upholding our immigration laws for the sake of safety, peaceful assimilation, and economic solvency can’t even be remotely compared to the hateful rhetoric that led to death and mayhem on the streets of America’s cities in the first half of the twentieth century.

Clooney’s effort to characterize political conflicts today as the same as those blacks endured in the past is foolish because it creates a false impression of danger.

White mobs are not invading black neighborhoods, bombing their houses, looting their businesses, murdering their children, and destroying their property. If any group is doing this today, it is black-on-blacks in urban areas, black protesters like those in Ferguson reacting to a false report of a police killing that had no racial component, or anti-Trump protesters like those in San Jose who attacked innocent white people at a political rally.

Clooney’s effort to characterize political conflicts today as the same as those blacks endured in the past is foolish because it creates a false impression of danger. It stokes anger over imaginary injustices and incites conflict between groups that are living together in relative peace across the nation. It also makes a mockery of the real suffering blacks endured during a turbulent time in our history.

To say “segregation” is still a problem and that the violent racism of the past is alive and well is to create a false narrative that plays on the fears of the gullible. It is irresponsible at best and demonic at worst. Clooney says a dark cloud is hanging over our nation. He’s right, but it’s not the cloud he thinks it is. It’s a cloud created by people like him who are agitating natural tensions and stoking anger to create cultural chaos and cause political disruption.

His rhetoric and propaganda should not be indulged or legitimized. It needs to be called out for what it is—a threat to the stability of our nation and to the peace of civil society.

Dear Martina Big: Chemicals Can’t Turn You Into A Black Woman,"Editor’s note: The surgeries depicted in a video clip below include huge distortions to the woman’s breasts.

In an interview on “The Maury Show” last week, a German woman who was born white said she now identifies as a black woman after receiving chemical injections to darken her skin.

Martina Big—who speaks with a thick European accent and claims to be 28 years old—sported a kinky weave, dark skin, and an impressive history of body modifications and plastic surgeries, including lip and breast implants, a nose job, and lipo procedures.

Maury opened the show by showing a picture of Big as a teenager: a smiling blonde running a hand through her hair. He then showed pictures of Big’s journey to change her body, including her ostensible “transition” to another race.

“Martina, do you think you’re a black person?” Maury asked.

“Yes,” Big said, to loud audience booing. “But 80 percent. I have to learn a lot.”

Maury’s response drew applause, “Everyone who is a person of color is going to say it’s not just skin-deep.”

Throughout the interview, the audience’s reactions said it all. Big’s statements drew raised eyebrows, dropped jaws, wide eyes, and shocked facial expressions, accompanied by “ohhhh” and “boos” from the predominantly African-American audience.

At the end of the interview, Maury asked, “Do you think that you are offending people who were born black?”

Big protested her innocence: “I don’t want to attack them. I know some feel attacked, but it’s not my intention to attack anybody.”

Intentionally or not, Big’s decision isn’t just offensive and ridiculously insulting to African-Americans—and anyone possessing common sense—her decision is a fundamental attack on reality itself.

First Of All, This Isn’t New

People have always wondered about “the other.” What does it feel like to step into another’s shoes (or skin)? People have tried “going undercover” as another race as far back as the 1940s.

In 1961, John Howard Griffin, a white journalist, became a national celebrity after he published his book, “Black Like Me,” recounting his experience with segregation and racism. Prior to that, journalist Ray Sprigle published his book “In the Land of Jim Crow” in 1949 after he disguised himself as a black man and traveled to the South for a month.

Griffin and Sprigle’s experiments to understand and illuminate the experience of black people through a clearly unsustainable social experiment was one thing. They understood that they were trying to pull off an external farce. But the outrageous proposition that someone can become a different race with the assistance of surgery and chemicals is another.

Unless you live under a rock, you have likely heard of Rachel Dolezal, a woman who made headlines after her white parents revealed she was masquerading as an African-American woman. Dolezal acted as president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Washington state from 2014 until she resigned in 2015 due to the scandal. Dolezal stated that “I acknowledge that I was biologically born white to white parents, but I identify as black.”

So what’s going on here? First, both Dolezal and Big reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of the inherency of race. After claiming to be “80 percent” black, Big also explained, “I got three injections… to change my skin color. And now I am the proud owner of black skin.”

No matter how diverse your background, “80 percent black” is simply not a thing. It should also be obvious that one cannot be the “proud owner” of race the way you might be the “proud owner” of a designer handbag or a Mercedes-Benz. Whether you bleach, dye, or tan your skin, it is impossible to acquire the innate experience of another race, not matter how many thousands of dollars you shell out to surgeons.

The Logical Conclusion of an Illogical Worldview

The Root’s Yesha Callahan pointed out the absurdities of Big’s claim to have “transitioned” from a white woman to a black one. But curiously, Callahan ended her writeup of the daytime talk show ordeal with the assertion that “transitioning” from one race to another is nothing like “transitioning” from one sex to another.

“But, of course … there will be those nimrods who want to compare putting on makeup and having surgeries to try to become a black woman to being a transgender person,” Callahan wrote. “Before you even start banging on your keyboards trying to be witty and contrary, don’t embarrass yourself.”

While people may be quick to disavow any connection between the transgender movement and Big’s “race transition,” the same arguments are being applied. Women like Dolezal and Big are simply the logical conclusion of a worldview that insists people can be anything they want, regardless of nature. If people are constantly told everything is relative and that inherent qualities are social constructs, it does not take long for people to believe it, and for this belief to manifest in the most bizarre ways.

If there is no spiritual reality or physical reality we must adhere to, it makes sense to equate altered physical appearance with fundamental change. But if something like race is more than a chemically altered skin tone, then we can only point out that the emperor has no clothes.

I don’t want to vilify Big, or anyone else who suffers from the delusion that he can “change his race.” Someone who turns to chemical injections in a sad, desperate attempt to change reality itself must be a very confused person. But the trouble is, where does this end? People may be shocked at this latest attempt to spite reality. But how long will it be before people claim that the right to change your race is simply the next civil rights issue? A worldview that supports gender fluidity cannot long defend the narrow-minded and antiquated idea that we must stick with the race we were born into without falling into hypocrisy.

In light of this, Maury Povich’s remarks at the end of his bizarre interview almost seem prophetic.

“It sounds like, in your experience that you keep trying to find something,” he said. “I’m sure there’s going to be something else that you’re going to try to find, in the future. Good luck to you!”

Ta-Nehisi Coates Has Decided To Call All Politics He Doesn’t Like Racism,"Trying to understand President Donald Trump is a difficult task. Is he a pathological narcissist, both psychologically and intellectually unfit for office? Is he an international con artist, masterfully evading every penny of due taxes while simultaneously covering up naughty collusions with neo-czarist regimes? Is he a school yard bully in a septuagenarian’s body? A connoisseur of petty insults and epithets? An illiterate buffoon? A sexist? A racist? A homophobe?!

To the Left, Donald Trump is all these things—just not all at the same time. When he fired FBI Director James Comey, Trump was flagrantly concealing his Russia ties. When he suggested the Charlottesville counterprotesters included some “bad dudes,” he was ever so subtly dog-whistling his fellow Klansmen. He is either a bumbling fool, or a cunning villain. He is either a godless sinner or a hillbilly Christian fundamentalist. Each mainstream media headline Trump stars in includes the most situationally appropriate negative label. To common folk, the enigma that is Trump is made even more opaque when such contradictory explanations are presented.

If only the Left could agree on Trump’s quintessential essence. What is the common denominator that informs all his vile actions? What makes him tick? What is the most fundamental aspect that puts the Trump in Trump?

Ta-Nehisi Coates On Trump and His Country

In an Atlantic article published on September 7, we finally received the answer: Trump is white. No, not orange or beige. Not even slightly eggshell. Trump is nauseatingly pure white. He is so white that, contrary to popular belief, Trump is “the first white president.”

This surprising revelation is laid bare in an extract from Ta-Nehisi Coates’ coming book, “We Were Eight Years in Power.” As in many of Coates’ pieces, this essay gives us a haunting glimpse into the racial underpinnings of America’s history. From our nation’s colonial days to Civil War, from the Jim Crow era to the election of the 45th president, Coates paints a portrait of America overwhelmingly animated by the ideology of white supremacy. In Coates’ work, white nationalism, white power, and white privilege all coalesce into the “bloody heirloom” that Trump brazenly used to propel himself into the Oval Office.

In a stunning work of narrative alchemy, Coates takes a sample of Trump’s controversial quotes and political directives and transforms them into beaming pearls of white supremacy. Trump’s (admittedly laughable) birtherism had not an inkling to do with Barak Obama’s globetrotting childhood, but rather was “a recasting of the old American precept that black people are not fit to be citizens of the country they built.” When Trump (inelegantly) proposed that illegal immigration included elements of criminality, he was actually posturing as “the defender of white maidenhood against Mexican rapists.”

Coates seems to suggest that any Trumpian gaffe is no more than a veiled racist invective. When Covfefe is finally de-coded, we will likely find that, in fact, it was the first chapter of “Mein Kampf” tightly compressed into seven characters.

Obama’s Legacy, In The Eyes Of Ta-Nehisi Coates

To be fair, Coates runs other politicians through his nifty implicit racism x-ray machine. He suggests that Bill Clinton’s “tough on crime” legacy was an excuse to incarcerate the black youth population. Neither does he forget to reference Hillary’s “Super Predator” speech. Presidential throwbacks the likes of Richard Nixon and Franklin D. Roosevelt are all implicated for their part in white identity politics.

Trump’s bigotry, however, is different from past racist executives because of one vital factor: he was elected after Barack Obama. Trump is the first white president because Trump is the first post-black president.

Coates endorses a claim made by historian Nell Irvin Painter that “race is an idea, not a fact,” and goes on to extrapolate that “essential to the construct of a white race is the idea of not being a n—–.” To exist, whiteness requires the prerequisite of blackness. To be white is inherently nothing but the act of not being black, a bleak interpretation of a violently whirling Yin and Yang.

That race is a construct not so much rooted in biology as informed by culture is by no means a ridiculous claim. There are very good reasons to support this understanding of race. However, what Coates goes on to deduce with this logic is rather sinister. In more colorful language than my own, Coates proceeds to reclassify the building blocks of Obama’s legacy as being themselves black: black health-care reform, black climate accords, and black justice reform. The Iran nuclear agreement was black. Obergefell vs. Hodges was also black, as was the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

So when and if Trump modifies, erases, or replaces any Obama endeavors, he is essentially warring against blackness. Coates sets up a scenario in which any opposition to an Obama policy is sheer racism.

Is The Left About Class Struggle, Or Identity Politics?

This is what Coates most masterfully does with his article. He recounts real historical examples of appalling racial inequality, and then he myopically examines policies and statements through the lens of race theory, finally concluding that any right-of-center policy is racist.

Intersectionality is rampant throughout Coates’ piece. Feminism, LGBT activism, and Islam all get a friendly wink. However, race reigns supreme throughout. The majority of his article has nothing to do with Trump, per se. Instead, much of the writing serves as a defense of identity politics, with Coates lambasting fellow leftists for reverting to class struggle at the expense of a race struggle narrative.

The fall of the blue wall in the Rust Belt, resulting in an electoral loss for Hillary, has been examined in several ways. Was it the result of the Democratic Party silencing its labor rhetoric to make room for a mixed bag of racial, gender, and sexual identitarian politics? Many on the left have flirted with, if not affirmed, this interpretation. But not Coates. His article indicts leftist heroes Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Nicholas Christof as trying to de-villainize white working Americans.

In Coates’ own words, we must grapple with the fact that “systemic bigotry is still central to our politics; that the country is susceptible to such bigotry; that the salt-of-the-earth Americans whom we lionize in our culture and politics are not so different from those same Americans who grin back at us in lynching photos…”

Anti-capitalism runs under the surface of his essay, but Coates believes the only valid Marxist approach is racial identity politics. The “Bloody Heirloom” of systemic racism must be identified, rooted out, and brought to justice wherever it can be found. And Coates knows how to find this “heirloom” around every corner and under every rock in the United States.

Coates Emphasizes Racial Struggle With Little Nuance

Ta-Nehisi Coates cannot be discredited as unlearned in his field of interest. Nor can he be dismissed as a poor writer. His readers are confronted with characters and events pertaining to the African American struggle that have been forgotten by the collective American consciousness. He introduces us to many more Emmet Tills, and recounts to us a dozen other Dred Scott court cases. Coates’ true folly comes not from his knowledge of history, but rather from his dogmatic belief of its driving force. To Coates, culture and politics are inextricable from race. Race struggle is the moon that pulls the tides of history.

Coates lives in a world primarily driven by race. And for the next four to eight years, the leader of his (not-so-free) world is Donald Trump. So those who voted Republican in 2016 were Klansmen, the President is their Grand Dragon Wizard, and every Trump-Pence 2020 yard sign will be a burning cross.

While others on the Left continue to diagnose Trump’s pathology inconsistently, at least we will all ways have the same answer from Ta-Nehisi Coates: “Trump is White.”",https://thefederalist.com/2017/09/26/ta-nehisi-coates-decided-call-politics-doesnt-like-racism/,2017-09-26
Why ‘Black-ish’s’ Fourth Season Debut Won’t Snag New Viewers,"ABC’s “Black-ish” returned for its fourth season on a new night, and debuted an episode that will undoubtedly become one of the most memorable TV premieres this fall. Call it a coincidence, perfect storm, whatever. Creator Kenya Barris riffed on the holiday Columbus Day to highlight a larger question to viewers about who should be credited for building the United States of America. Spoiler alert: it was the slaves.

Similar to most feel-good sitcoms, the episode begins at the elementary school of the twins Jack and Diane, this year the stars of the annual Columbus Day play. To avoid “an incident,” the school busses in minority students to serve as supporting characters. Throughout the course of the play, Dre (Anthony Anderson) envisions how he would tell the story of Columbus. By his standards, Christopher Columbus is the antithesis of an American hero. He’s an evil man who robbed established citizens of their land through imperialism.

It’s Always Time to Get Woke

If you’re a fan of the show like me, you probably know how the rest of the episode goes. In the scene that follows, Dre releases his angst on his co-workers at Stevens and Lido, an advertising firm where he is the quintessential “woke” employee. Instead of honoring Columbus, Dre prefers to celebrate Juneteenth, the summer holiday commemorating the release of slaves post-Reconstruction.

When his white colleagues all show similar confused expressions, Dre decides this is the perfect time to explain what Juneteenth means. Back in 1865, on June 19 Union soldiers arrived to Galveston, Texas with great news: the Civil War had just ended and all slaves were officially free. Keep in mind; this news came more than two years after Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which was ratified on January 1, 1863.

With the help of singer Aloe Blacc and The Roots, Dre spoofs your favorite childhood educational cartoon “School House Rock” song “I’m Just a Bill,” rewording it as, “I’m Just a Slave.” The twist is a pithy explanation of the African slave trade leading up to when slavery officially ended in the United States.

Throughout its run, “Black-ish” has capitalized on real-life controversial topics that have troubled our nation by portraying them with fictional storylines. Grandmother and resident critic of all things Ruby (Jenifer Lewis) perfectly describes the complication of selling Juneteenth as a national holiday: “People don’t want to celebrate something we barely want to admit happened.” She’s right. Slavery has long been an uncomfortable topic, so commemorating the demise of the buying, selling, and trading of human beings is pretty awkward.

Teachability Clashes with Agenda-Pushing

Any show that educates while providing a comedic element gets at least a one-episode watch from me. “Black-ish” does a great job of representing a middle-class, affluent minority family and their everyday crusade to remain true to their roots. Loyal viewers know what they’re going to get.

For unaware viewers who are looking to delve into a new show, starting with this episode of “Black-ish” won’t lead them to continue with episode two. You see, just as much as Juneteenth is important to recognize, so is Christopher Columbus. Promoting an iconic celebration in black history while condemning a significant figure in American history contradicts the teachable moment aim of the episode, even though recently it has been fun and trendy to hate Columbus.

People have long regarded television as an aim to escape reality and immerse themselves into the funny, fictional dilemmas of someone else’s life. I commonly find myself happy I can escape my own problems and for 22 minutes focus on the disastrous, yet relatable crisis that is Mindy Lahiri’s love life.

Without any previous understanding of the widely popular musical “Hamilton” the episode pays homage to, most viewers might find the episode flat, lacking that sharp and witty delivery “Black-ish” is praised for. Case in point, the other two musical numbers weren’t as engaging as “I’m Just a Slave,” and maybe that’s where I was left feeling confused with the episode’s overall approach to its subject matter.

Dre’s relationships with his co-workers (Deon Cole, Wanda Sykes, Jeff Meacham, Nelson Franklin, Peter Mackenzie) are part of what makes the show hilariously entertaining. I would have appreciated more of a “come to Jesus” moment where they acknowledge the need to celebrate a lesser-known holiday, rather than another musical number used a plot filler.

“Black-ish” unapologetically pushes viewers out of their comfort zone. While presenting a variety of harsh opinions meant to highlight a larger issue, the show often confuses the desired takeaway with preachy undertones. As the season continues, I’m certain it will tackle issues deeper than Juneteenth. Rather than imposing those ideas on the audience, they’re better off illustrating the plot with an invitation for the viewer to develop his or her individual conclusion.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/09/black-ishs-fourth-season-debut-wont-snag-new-viewers/,2017-10-09
"University Sides With Black Lives Matter, Shuts Down GOP Lawmaker","It’s no surprise that progressive groups like Black Lives Matter want to shut down free speech on college campuses—but they shouldn’t be getting help from school officials to do it.

In at least one recent case, they did. This week, the president of Texas Southern University intervened to shut down a Federalist Society event featuring Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain at the TSU law school. Dozens of Black Lives Matter protesters crashed the event, shouting, “When a racist comes to town, shut it down!” and other slogans meant to smear Cain, a member of the conservative Texas House Freedom Caucus. The protesters were eventually cleared from the room, but no sooner had they left than TSU President Austin Lane arrived on the scene, invited the protesters back in, and had Cain escorted from campus by police under the pretext that it was for his own safety.

The school’s official (and unconvincing) excuse was that the event was unsanctioned because the Federalist Society isn’t an registered student organization and “proper scheduling procedures were not followed.” Yet James Douglas, the interim dean of the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at TSU, told The Dallas Morning News that the law school’s branch of the Federalist Society, which had invited Cain to speak, went through all the proper procedures. “We have a process here in the law school, and they went through our process,” Douglas said. “The speaker had a First Amendment right to be heard by the students that invited him.”

What’s more, emails published by The Blaze show that university officials were in touch with the president of the TSU chapter of the Federalist Society, Daniel Caldwell, and that the group is indeed listed as a registered student organization. Cain released a statement saying, “The explanation given by the university is blatantly inconsistent with the administration’s approval of the event for months. Black Lives Matter was not protesting the paperwork not being filed properly, they wanted to silence speech they disagreed with, and the University allowed it.”

This isn’t the first time students affiliated with Black Lives Matter have silenced free speech on college campuses. Last week, a group of protesters crashed an event at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, rushing the stage and preventing the invited speaker from continuing. The irony is that the invited speaker was a representative from the American Civil Liberties Union who intended to speak on the subject, “Students and the First Amendment.”

The difference is, at TSU the university president was colluding with Black Lives Matter to silence free speech and forcibly shut down a duly sanctioned event. Nor is it the first time that TSU has caved to the heckler’s veto. Back in May, the school canceled a commencement speech by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn amid outrage over the Republican senator’s support for the Trump administration.

Not that the suppression of free speech by university officials should come as a surprise. The entire anti-free speech movement on college campuses was inculcated and encouraged by left-wing university professors and administrators who hate the idea of the First Amendment and have worked to ensure that dissenting—which is to say, conservative—opinions are excluded or silenced on campus.

This time, the veil slipped, and TSU’s president was caught on camera openly inviting Black Lives Matter to shout down an invited guest speaker. Maybe now that it’s out in the open, we can drop the pretense that college administrators like TSU’s Lane are in any way interested in the free exchange of ideas on their campuses, or in maintaining even the appearance of intellectual diversity—the only kind that should really matter on a college campus.

They prefer instead for their schools to become hermetically sealed bastions of progressive politics. No wonder they don’t want conservatives to speak. Without the distraction of debating actual ideas, they can get down to what they consider to be their real job: indoctrinating students and teaching them above all how to be political activists.

Be Generous To Dad Who Worries About His Kids Befriending White Kids,"When The New York Times decided to run an opinion article from a black law professor asking whether his children can be friends with white children, the response was swift and predictable. It was outrage. Some called it textbook racism. Some even compared the professor, Ekow Yankah, to white nationalist Richard Spencer. Likewise, the Times had scorn heaped upon it for running the article.

My own reaction was somewhat different. Yes, the piece is provocative and clickbaity. No, I am not comfortable with any parent advising his children to be wary of other children on the basis of their race. But after several years of writing from a conservative, white perspective on race, I noticed something else that confirmed a familiar pattern.

Very few detractors took the time or effort to look at this piece in a nuanced way, to see if, even though they vehemently disagree with the conclusion, they can learn something from how the conclusion was reached. That was the spirit in which I read the article and I was rewarded for it. In fact, something lurking in my own work about race jumped out at me in this paragraph:

Let me assure you that my heartbreak dwarfs my anger. I grew up in a classic Midwestern college town. With all its American faults, it was a diverse and happy-childhood kind of place, slightly dull in the way that parents wish for their children. If race showed in class lines, school cliques and being pulled over more often, our little Americana lacked the deep racial tension and mistrust that seem so hard to escape now.

When I read that, I knew even before I googled him that this man was my age. I knew he was describing the ’80s and ’90s of my childhood and teen years that our pop culture is so nostalgic about these days. I knew that I share his heartbreak at the brutality of today’s racial tensions, which we thought we had left in the dark past of police dogs and firehoses.

Put simply, Generation X didn’t see this coming. This is not the tone we read in Ta-Nehisi Coates or Jamelle Bouie, who came of age in a much different time. For the millennial black intelligentsia, today’s racial situation is no surprise. It is the inevitable result of an unbroken, sinister white supremacy that has always haunted America.

But it isn’t unbroken. For a time the fever of racial disharmony did break, or at least cool down. Those of us, like Yankah, who grew up in that time have seen that promise of greater equality and integration evaporate under the new heat.

When I considered what could make this heartbroken black man take, what to my view, is an illiberal, maybe even bigoted, viewpoint regarding his kids’ friends and their safety, some scenarios popped into my mind. I imagined his black kid as a teen, hanging out with white friends, getting into trouble with police, and receiving worse treatment from the criminal justice system. This doesn’t strike me as an irrational fear.

I imagined his black kids being assured they weren’t like other blacks; they were middle-class, well-educated, but perhaps still fetishized when the white kids listened to and talked about hip hop. That didn’t strike me as irrational.

I imagined his black kids being told they only got into a good school because of set-aside programs. There are more examples. The point is that today’s moment is so racially charged, unlike the early ’90s of our high school years, that it is hard to imagine that being black is not front and center to the experience of today’s young black people.

Anger Is Easy. Forgiveness Is Hard

I have written thousands of words about how the Left, through misusing privilege theory and overusing identity politics, has made the current racial situation much worse. I have written thousands of words about how white people and specifically conservatives are too deaf to the legitimate concerns of America’s black population. Both of these things I firmly believe are true.

But if we are to move forward—or maybe it’s backwards—towards a time more like the ’90s when we could talk to each other, understand and love each other more freely, we need to make changes. Those of us of every race and political perspective must stop looking at everything written about race as an opportunity to call the other side the real racists. We must listen, respectfully, even when we feel attacked. We must find a way to be that thing so desperately missing today: dispassionate.

I felt a kinship to Yankah. I also felt a fear that if his son and mine were in the same class, they couldn’t have the kind of relationship I had with black friends growing up. I felt a little angry at him at the idea that he would warn his children about my white son. But then I realized many white parents have been warning their kids about black people for hundreds of years. In the classic reversal-of-privilege style, I now felt the angst and anger over the idea that my child could be held suspect because of the color of his skin.

Try Talking Before You Scream

The easiest and most useless way to react to dialogue about race that makes one uncomfortable is to throw stones, to cry racism, and to find the worst example of prose in an article and pretend it is a synecdoche for the whole thing. In this case, Yankah’s phrase, “I will teach my boys to have profound doubts that friendship with white people is possible,” is the idea being tarred and feathered. But let’s break it down. He isn’t saying they can’t be friends. He’s saying he has doubts about it. In today’s climate, how can he not?

I disagree with much in Yankah’s article. But I have never been black in a society that has a tradition of horrible racism. I would never teach my son he couldn’t be a friend with anyone based on his race. I also wonder how Asians, Latinos, and others fit into his framework. But as a fellow Gen Xer, who shared his experience in either a more enlightened or naïve time, I have no interest in tearing him and his ideas down.

I’d rather talk to him, understand that his concerns are mirrored by millions of black Americans, and listen to them. Will I wind up agreeing? Probably not. But that’s okay. Respect is not built upon agreement. It is built on trust that the other person is speaking in good faith.

I believe this article is written in good faith. I feel enlightened for having read it. I also feel more committed to working to ensure that his children and mine reach their 40s having regained the ground on racial harmony we have so sadly lost.

Shrill Critiques Of ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ Prove It Should Stay In Schools,"Sometimes the movie really is better than the book. As a high school English teacher, I’m not supposed to say that. But I have recommended to a few shocked casual acquaintances that they forego reading “To Kill A Mockingbird” and watch the film, which is superior not just for Gregory Peck’s iconic performance, but also for the streamlined narrative. Where the novel meanders, the film stays the course.

But a recent critique of the book by novelist Alice Randall has converted me into a full-throttled defender of Harper Lee’s coming of age tale. Randall, it seems, is not interested in telling the truth about the novel or the reasons we should read literature. Her feeble attempt to warn us of the negative messages waiting to marginalize our multicultural student body reveals the novel’s true depth of meaning and convinces me of its rightful place in our curriculum.

Randall’s editorial comes in response to a Mississippi school district’s decision to remove the novel from its curriculum due to the novel’s uncomfortable language. To her credit, Randall rejects the notion that any book should be banned simply because it makes someone uncomfortable. But she then offers her own reasons for removing the book from school curriculum. She argues the novel is “often read by children in wildly different — and sometimes profoundly damaging — ways.”

This Book Doesn’t Say What You Think It Says

Randall never offers any evidence of students ever sharing her proposed wild misinterpretations, and I imagine she never will. I have to wonder if she has ever read the novel or met a teenager. The novel, for those who have yet to read it, tells the story of a young girl, Scout, whose innocent childhood fascination with her spooky neighbor comes to an end when her father, Atticus Finch, defends an innocent black man accused of rape by the Ewells, an unsavory white family esteemed above the impoverished blacks simply because of their skin color. The ensuing outrage and controversy over the trial consumes the Finch family and their small Southern town.

After reading this novel, who would ever conclude that it teaches “should you be raped … people will have reason to doubt you like the book says everyone should have doubted Mayella Ewell.” Randall proposes an “impoverished, white eighth-grade girl” asked to read the novel might come to this conclusion. To be sure, the townspeople in Maycomb don’t believe Mayella, but they don’t believe her precisely because they shouldn’t: She lied. If Mayella had in fact been raped we would have an entirely different novel to consider. Surely Randall isn’t suggesting we teach our young to believe lies and disbelieve truth.

But Randall insists that “the text encourages boys and girls to believe women lie about being raped.” For those who don’t spend much time with teenagers, it is easy to forget the shaky reasoning abilities appropriate to their psychological development. But it would take a truly exceptional child to deduce that all women lie about rape from the premise that one woman lied about rape in a book he once read in school. It wouldn’t be necessary to introduce David Hume’s problem of induction for blooming young minds to avoid this misinterpretation. Common sense will suffice.

Calpurnia Is Far More to the Finches Than ‘Help’

If we’re not convinced that the novel will damage the impoverished white girls in our classrooms, we should remove it for the sake of the black girls. Randall asks us to “think of Calpurnia, the older black maid…[S]he isn’t developed as a character as much as written as a set piece, suggesting the worst to young readers about the role of black women and black female intelligence.”

A responsible reader will see that while Calpurnia is indeed the “help,” she is also the respected mother figure to Scout. By no means is her intelligence demeaned. In fact, she teaches Scout how to write, which puts her leagues above her classmates her first day of school. Nor is Calpurnia a mere set piece. She is important to the novel for demonstrating that meaningful relationships are possible across racial and socioeconomic lines. This isn’t damaging to marginalized students as much as to certain political ideologies

Then perhaps we must consider black boys forced to read the novel. Randall suggests the novel might reinforce their “growing suspicion that [they] are unlikely to get a fair trial should [they] stand accused of something like Tom Robinson.” But perhaps there is reason to believe this. If our justice system is racially biased, should we shield our students from that fact, or inspire them to work towards improving our institutions? If it’s not, or at least not as bad as it was in the Jim Crow South, wouldn’t reading the novel also inspire them to continue the fight for justice and remind them of our past victories?

Randall also covers familiar territory when considering black students in general by observing that “the black child who has been verbally abused by being called a ‘n-gger’ in the schoolyard could be more hurt hearing that word taught in the classroom.” Undoubtedly, any teacher assigning the book must approach with sensitivity, and in my experience every teacher does. But no teacher “teaches” the word, as Randall suggests. “N-gger” is out there, and no one hears it for the first time in the classroom. Walking through the campus of any high school will verify this fact.

But when students encounter the word in “To Kill a Mockingbird” they see it spoken by characters who repulse them. A black student will see that those who use the word do so out of their own insecurity. They are bullies, and like all bullies they are pitiable and pathetic. Their baseness is made clear to the reader. Wouldn’t this empower our black students? The next time someone calls them a “n-gger” they’ll know that the word reveals something ugly only in the one saying it. It has no bearing on their own dignity and worth.

We Can Share Common Humanity Across Race and Money

Randall’s potential misinterpretations rest on an assumption she never justifies: that a reader will only identify with characters who share their racial and socio-economic background. “[T]he book cannot continue to be taught,” she argues, “as if every person in the classroom is white, upper middle class.”

Of course every person in (most) of our classrooms isn’t white, upper middle class, so of course we’re not all blindly teaching it as if they were. But even the white, upper class of the Jim Crow South is not the white, upper class of anywhere today. There is a distance between the characters in the novel and any contemporary reader, as there is a distance between characters in all novels and their readers. Responsible teachers provide the necessary context for entering into the world of the novels they teach.

So the disconnect is no argument for removing the text from the curriculum. If it were, we should also remove “The Diary of Anne Frank” if our male students can’t identify with a Jewish girl; and “Hamlet” if American girls can’t identify with a brooding Danish man-boy; and “Black Boy” if our non-black students can’t relate to the discrimination Richard Wright faced. According to Randall’s logic, any book stands in danger of marginalizing students. She would be surprised to know that an Indian student first told me the novel was banned in Mississippi. With no Indians in the novel, how could she possibly have remembered it?

But Randall insists that “Every student who reads Lee’s book does not identify with Atticus or with Scout.” Sadly, Randall seems to have forgotten the joy and importance of reading literature. In entering the world of characters different from ourselves, we learn that our shared humanity is stronger than our differences.

As a white American who grew up in a conservative Christian home, I identified with the Senegalese Muslim Sambo Diallo in Cheikh Hamidou Kane’s “Ambiguous Adventure.” I read this novel when, like Diallo, I attended a secular university and had to wrestle with my religious beliefs when confronted with secular, Enlightenment philosophy.

Like Diallo, I often didn’t feel at home in either my place of worship or in the halls of my university. Surprisingly, I did not identify with the white French administrators in the novel. Likewise, Malcolm X would be horrified to know that I identify with him when I read his autobiography and not the handful of “white devils” he uses as mere set pieces. Malcolm’s yearning to overcome his surroundings, his painful search for a transcendent truth, his ecstasy of worship and agony of apostasy—these are all elements of a full and captivating human life, not exclusive to the life of a black man. Despite his toxic political ideologies, I empathize with his human search for truth.

It is precisely the search for transcendent truth that unites us and shatters any boundaries our history, identity, or politics draw around us. So we return to Maycomb, Alabama, where a musty courtroom remains divided: whites in the jury and the plaintiff’s seat, blacks in the balcony and the defendant’s seat. In the face of racial animus and unfettered cynicism, Atticus Finch, the man from Attica, echoing those other men from Attica, exhorts us to live according to truth, not to our own interests or those of our tribe.

I cannot think of a more important and timely message for our students.

It’s Not Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Fault White Liberals Have Made Him Prophet,"Following a very public and personal attack on him by Harvard University professor Cornel West, Ta-Nehisi Coates has deleted his Twitter account, which had more than 1 million followers. West’s scorching screed, excoriating Coates as a “neoliberal” who fetishizes white supremacy, reads the way you’d expect from a man whose big plan since the 1960s has been to occupy the student government building.

But before digging into his hyperbolic word salad, it’s worth considering a tremor from Columbia University professor and black centrist John McWhorter earlier this month that preceded this earthquake in the black intelligentsia. I’ll quote his remarks at length:

I deal with a lot of intellectual whites, I work on a campus full of them. And it’s become a kind of shibboleth of being of that class that you are supposed to do your genuflection to Coates…I would definitely say at least once a week I have to deal with this. Some very earnest white person who is assuming that I think of that person’s writing as scripture, or frankly, as brilliantly reasoned. And I feel personally insulted, because to me, they are letting pass- I hate saying this about something or somebody, but I guess I have to, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow- They are letting pass as genius, something which they never would if it was not a black person doing it, and I think, is that how they’re judging me? Are they telling me that I’m so wonderful because they think that it’s a good thing because I’m brown? It makes me sick.

A few important points here feed directly into West’s criticism of Coates. First and foremost is the way in which mainly white intellectuals have cast Coates as the greatest thinker of his generation. More importantly, whites’ genuflection to Coates has become a way for them to signal that they get it, that they are racially cool.

West contends that Coates’ pessimistic and neoliberal view of America’s racial woes is too short on policy and collective action, and too full of Morrissey-esque gloom for gloom’s sake. It’s a gloom his white readership can share in and in so doing be let off the hook.

This is, at least in part, a fair criticism, but it badly misses the point of Coates’ work. Coates has never been a policy wonk or a political organizer. He’s not a Harvard Yard Marxist revolutionary like West. Coates is, more than anything else, a fine writer.

One need look no further than his seminal piece in favor of reparations to see that Coates is a storyteller, not an architect of public policy or collective action. In that article he is upfront that he has no specific system for reparations in mind. Rather, he writes in chilling detail about crimes the United States has committed against its black citizens.

It’s Not Coates’ Fault People Have Seized Upon Him

Coates is often compared to James Baldwin, and in many ways it is a fitting comparison. Both succeed is in laying bare not just what it means, but how it feels to be black in America. This is important, and worthy of adulation, if not the sainthood recently canonized upon Coates. He’s a good writer, and frankly, that should be enough.

Unlike West, who squarely blames Coates for self-promotion on the backs of suffering black folks, McWhorter takes a more generous view. He says of Coates, “I don’t think he’s done anything wrong, my indictment is against the people who are elevating him out of what can only be called bigotry.” This is important; Coates never asked to be nor claimed to be the source of America’s racial salvation.

In a recent appearance on “The Colbert Show,” Coates stunned his jovial, progressive host by refusing to say he had hope for the racial situation in America. One could almost feel the color drain from the faces of white liberals all over the country, muttering to themselves, “But Ta Nehisi, you’re our only hope.”

But he isn’t and he’s never been. This gets us to the real reasons West is attacking this prominent, relatively young black voice. The New Yorker’s Jelani Cobb has suggested there is an element of professional jealousy at work here, and that may be true. West has always seen himself as the rightful heir to the radical civil rights movement and surely resents losing that place. But it’s deeper than that. Like so much of the conversation about race in America, West is focused on the legacy of one man: Barack Obama.

West Hates Obama for Disproving Endemic Racism

West’s disdain for Obama is rooted in the fact that his election as president of the United States was absolutely anathema to the way West believed blacks would achieve political power. The very fact of a black president undermined West’s fundamental beliefs about the racist nature of American society. In response, West had little choice but to mock Obama as a neoliberal in blackface, a position that Coates, who might be described as the court scribe of the Obama administration, rejected.

One quote from West’s article stands out, as West attacks Coates for comparing Obama to Malcolm X as the only man alive who, in the words of Ossie Davis’ eulogy of X, can be described as “our living, black manhood” and “our own black shining prince.” West writes, “This gross misunderstanding of who Malcolm X was – the greatest prophetic voice against the American Empire – and who Barack Obama is – the first black head of the American Empire – speaks volumes about Coates’ neoliberal view of the world.”

This is precisely where West, the frustrated Ivy League revolutionary, misunderstands Coates. For West, the repository of black manhood must be a fellow traveller, an opponent of American power. But Coates is not first and foremost a political or ideological writer. Again, he is a storyteller. While West sees a young black boy’s heart swelling with pride at Obama’s power, poise, and intellect as a betrayal to his Marxist cause, Coates rightfully understands a deeper cultural and societal phenomenon at work, one that tells that child he is worthy of value and love.

Obama’s Failures Also Deserve Blame

What Coates views as a betrayal is not Obama’s refusal to govern like Che Guevara, but white America’s decision to replace him with Donald Trump. He is not alone in this. For many prominent black writers the election of Trump, who ran the closest thing to a white identity politics campaign that we have seen in a generation, has been jarring and dispiriting. No writer has captured better than Coates what a slap in face many black Americans felt when Trump took over Obama’s job.

Reading Coates over the past year, one feels a sense of despondency and anger, as if he has been awakened from a beautiful dream only to find himself back in a cold, ugly room with no coffee. Sitting across from him, staring with dagger eyes, is West, eager to say “I told you so.” I greatly admire Coates, and I’m pulling for him, that he can once again find the hope that Obama seemed to spark in him. But some of that is on Obama.

My own hope was that in his post-presidency Obama could become the voice we dearly need to navigate the deep and troubled waters of our racial past and present. In significant ways, President Trump makes that possibility difficult and less likely. The president’s racial rhetoric would make any overtures from Obama appear as attacks on Trump, in a way that would not be true under a president Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio.

Coates is not here to save us. That is work for men with higher ambitions than finding the word or sentence that is just so. Yes, he cashes the checks, but it’s not his fault that white liberals have anointed him as the voice of his generation. So long as he continues, as Baldwin did before him, to forge in the smithy of his soul the uncreated conscious of his race, that is enough.

Just as so many young black men will follow Obama’s star into policy and public service, many will find in Coates a worthy wordsmith to emulate long after West and his Marxist agenda are lost to the dustbin of history.

Uneasy Techno-Fear Gives Way To Existential Terror In 'Black Mirror',"This review contains some light spoilers.

Netflix has just dropped a 4th season of “Black Mirror,” the acclaimed near-future anthology series created by Charlie Brooker that taps into collective unease about the technology with which we have surrounded ourselves.

The locales in series 4 are as diverse as the genres, from space opera to crime scene investigation. If series 3’s focus on high-tech eye-tech and ubiquitous social media seemed a few minutes behind the times, series 4 taps into a timeless, primitive fear of being trapped in the very digital hells we’ve constructed — minds with no bodies, no agency. The queasy techno-fear unease of previous seasons often gives way to full-blown existential terror (or perhaps that’s my claustrophobia talking).

Criticism of “Black Mirror” as Luddite is unfounded: Every episode betrays an attraction to the crisp cleanness, the undeniable neatness of new tech. Still, a word to the wise: If you’re caught in a “Black Mirror” episode, don’t volunteer for any beta-testing, no matter what the free swag.

The underlying techno-theme of these six new episodes is digital consciousness, uploaded and exploited for amusement, profit, revenge, and (most frighteningly) obsolescence. After 2017, a world where we found out all too much about our fellow citizens, “Black Mirror” sends us into 2018 with the fear of existence as a solitary consciousness, utterly cut off.

“Black Mirror’s” song choices are, as usual, on point without being too on the nose. “Strict Machine” is heard in the background of a dance club in “Crocodile” (your guess is as good as mine; Brooker likes puzzling titles) and the “you’ll always be a part of me” line in the pop standard “Always Something There to Remind Me” takes on a sinister quality.

I’ve rated the six episodes comprising series 4 below, keeping in mind that any adequately mixed anthology will fail to please everyone each time out. Anthologies aren’t necessarily built for binge-watching, especially one so stylistically spread out, but if you do binge, Netflix’s suggested episode order works fine (and the last episode makes more sense if watched last).

Episode 1, Grade: A

The first one up, “USS Callister,” is the crème de la crème, an unqualified success, taking familiar-seeming parts (the technical genius and put-upon schlub who is a secret hero in his digital fantasy life) and scrambling them into something new and sinister. Not a minute is wasted, though it’s the longest episode in the fourth series. The episode launches is a play on “Star Trek,” and opens with Captain Daly playing the heroic leader of a loyal crew in a fantasy universe called “Space Fleet.” In real “Black Mirror” life, Robert Daly is chief technical officer of an immersive reality gaming company.

But his harmless sounding choose-your-own-adventure fantasy is all too real for those who cross him at work, including a new girl whose DNA-digital copy is forcibly recruited into Daly’s personal “Space Fleet” fantasy universe. What follows are some Inception-level tactics on the part of the digital crew to escape the tyranny of the “asshole god.”

To make an unforgivably retro-reference, this is the album equivalent of a “Side 1, Track 1” showstopper, the hit single of the season, both brilliant and accessible, whose appeal wears a deeper groove in your brain the more you ponder it.

Episode 2, Grade: B-

“USS Callister” is followed by “Arkangel,” a domestic family drama that has some powerful things to say about the unintended consequences of helicopter parenting, but is the closest thing to a dud in the series. Everyone can relate to the cold fear of a mother who misplaces her child at a playground, and maybe even empathize with her overreaction — putting a chip in her daughter’s brain, enabling her not only to trace the little girl, but also able to see everything the daughter sees.

But is the wholly innocent, untroubled childhood the mother wants to craft for her daughter compatible with personal development, or even personal safety? After a thoughtful start, “Arkangel” overdoses on unconvincing violent imagery, though the very last scene is a perfectly aimed dagger at the mother’s worst fears. At heart, it’s an after-school special with a gizmo.

Episode 3, Grade: B

“Crocodile” is set in a bleak Icelandic landscape and plays as a lower-octane CSI thriller, from the view of the villain. Mia is a successful architect whose environmental humanitarian gloss hides a ruthless genius for self-preservation. Then an accident on a beer-soaked avenue may indirectly implicate her in crimes past and present, via a thingamajig that can read memories straight from the brain.

The idea that the olfactory sense most effectively triggers memories is used to amusing effect here, as potential witnesses take a whiff from a beer bottle. It’s a light moment in an episode that could use less bleakness. The technology, mind-blowing in theory, comes off a bit too close to a mere survey of local surveillance footage to be enthralling.

Episode 4, Grade: A-

“Hang the DJ” is the most light-hearted of the bunch — relatively speaking. There are echoes of the series 3 standout “San Junipero” in the setup and the romance angle, though it lacks that episode’s ecstatic finale minutes that made Belinda Carlisle’s “Heaven is a Place on Earth” actually mean something. A couple meets cute at a hip lodge of sorts full of young couples forcibly paired up and frog-marched through dates where even the appetizers are pre-ordained.

So why does the ruthless dating machine seem compelled to keep them apart?

Episode 5, Grade: A

“Metalhead,” clocking in at a brisk 41 minutes, is a suitably sleek, black-and-white minimalist masterstroke that follows a trio in the aftermath of a sci-fi apocalypse on a supply run gone bad. Actress Maxine Peake plays the resourceful survivor with a weakness for scavenged soft peppermints. Circumstances pit her alone against a disconcertingly smart metal dog, one of many roaming the desolate land, that has a single obsession orbiting its metal circuitry — hunt and kill humans.

The why’s and how’s in this world are left to the imagination, which could be frustrating but registered as intriguing, and suited the minimalist feel of the episode.

Episode 6, Grade: B-

“Black Museum” is an anthology within an anthology, and the show at its most self-referential, with several mini-episodes playing within a frame story of a tourist visiting a museum off a desolate highway outside Las Vegas. The Black Museum is the now-lonesome home to various artifacts representing infamous techno-horrors, some from previous “Black Mirror” tales.

Rolo Haynes is our sleazy carny-maestro of ceremonies, as he takes a tourist through the displays. Corniness competes with revulsion in scenes involving a doctor aroused by his patients’ pain. An exhibit of a stuffed animal leads to a tale of a comatose wife who becomes a nagging shrew when her consciousness is welded into her grieving husband’s brainpan.

Unfortunately, this wider view of “Black Mirror’s” world (all the episodes seem to take place in a single universe) makes the scary scenarios less stomach-churning — locked safely in the past behind glass and relived as ghost stories. But not everything behind the glass in this episode stays locked away.

Series creator Charlie Brooker has sworn off getting ideas from current events, yet “Black Museum” serves as his version of a hot take on current events, with a shoehorned reference to “fake news” and scenes of protests over police brutality that give the episode a moralizing tone the more fleet-footed installments avoid tripping over.

“I’m suspicious of shows that have a message,” Brooker recently told Variety, although a couple episodes here flirt with heavy-handedness. If “Black Mirror” has a recurring flaw, it’s in the final reveals that surprise, yet sometimes deflate, what has come before by rendering it seemingly pointless. Yet even that flaw points to a “Black Mirror” narrative strength. Brooker never forgets the human factor behind those black mirrors, an essential humaneness which graces even “Metalhead,” among the more merciless of the new stories, with poignant hope.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/01/05/uneasy-fear-gives-way-to-existential-terror-in-black-mirror-season-4/,2018-01-05
Jordan Peele’s ‘Get Out’ Is A Racist Version Of ‘Stepford Wives’,"This article includes plot spoilers.

Jordan Peele’s critically praised box-office smash “Get Out” (2017) received multiple nominations for the Golden Globes, but came away empty-handed. The Oscars await, however, where “Get Out” has been chatted up for best picture, best actor, best director, and best film editing nominations. The nomination lists come out January 23.

The film attacks white bigotry in a horror tale best described as a racist version of the “Stepford Wives.” But for once the film’s villains aren’t alt-right racists or Confederate-flag-waving white supremacists. Instead it is a target usually given a free pass: “tolerant” white liberals.

A smug feature of modern liberalism is moral vanity, especially about minorities. Claiming to “care” more about the plight of African-Americans than “heartless” conservatives has constructed an escape hatch for when their big-government policies fail: at least their “hearts are in the right place.” Rather than addressing how big government holds minorities down, conservatives often play this rigged game by asserting that they also “care,” and that acquiescence to wealth redistribution and racial preferences proves it.

As a result, white liberals continue to own the moral high ground and are rarely accused of condescension or even racism toward minorities. This heroic portrayal of white liberals has transferred over into film. The prime example is Gregory Peck’s Atticus Finch, who, Mr. Smith-like, takes on the racist culture in his town by defending an innocent black man. Another is Julia Moore’s otherwise compliant Northern wife, who comes to life when racism rears its ugly head in her Northern community.

White racists on-screen are of the sweaty, Southern variety, such as Andy Griffith’s cornpone crooner in “A Face in the Crowd” (1957) or the white trash farmer who spits on Finch for being “a n-gger lover.”

Playing Against Cliché

Peele subverts this image, playing on viewers expecting the villains of his film to be “crackers.” A white girlfriend (a stellar Allison Williams) introduces Chris Williams (a superb Daniel Kaluuya) to her family, who fits the profile of white liberals: they are rich, “open-minded,” and assure Chris that they are Barack Obama voters. The father, a white-haired neurosurgeon (played by uber-liberal Bradley Whitford), and his wife, a deceptively caring psychiatrist/hypnotist (Katherine Keener), register liberal guilt to Chris over employing black “servants” as cooks and groundskeepers.

Their neighbors, all country-club whites equally “welcoming” toward Chris, don’t sport a Southern accent among them. Indeed, they recall the liberal upper-class Northern group in a guilt-ridden meeting between cash-rich actors like Paul Newman and contemptuous Black Panthers in the late 1960s that Tom Wolfe so successfully satirized.

Nevertheless they can’t get past Chris as an African-American, and condescendingly attempt to get some sort of “street cred” with him by assuring him they love Tiger Woods and cheering that “black is now fashionable.” They also subscribe to the stereotype that black men are skilled lovers.

The only clue that all might not be right is with Rose Armitage’s brother. Androgynous, obviously certifiable, and intimate with Chris in a manner that could be considered homosexual, the brother, played by Caleb Landry Jones, has washed-out look and watery eyes that fits the stereotype of inbred “white trash.”

The blacks Chris encounters—a muscular groundskeeper, a maid/cook, and the lover of a much older white woman—are less Uncle Toms (with no bows, scrapes, or pork-chop dialogue) and more like sell-outs who have transformed themselves in diction and manner into upper-class whites. They are all articulate and as ignorant of the black situation and fist-bumps as the whites.

An Eerie Atmosphere Full of Clues

Peele has that rare Hitchcockian ability to withhold just enough to keep viewers guessing but releasing enough information to keep them watching. The blacks Chris encounters show panic and sadness in momentary facial twitches. The most haunting example is when the older lady’s black lover drops his well-bred demeanor and screams to Chris to “get out.”

Like Roman Polanski, Peele creates an atmosphere of a sinister conspiracy encircling and ultimately trapping Chris. As with the best horror directors, Peele grounds the story in reality, and thus viewers will accept the racist version of the “Stepford Wives” that is the film’s pay-off.

Perhaps the biggest shock is in Rose, who quickly switches from caring progressive girlfriend to chilling colluder. Along with her father, who uses surgery to satisfy the need of older whites who want to feel physically supreme using black bodies; the mother, who uses hypnotism rather than anesthetics to make the black victims more compliant; and the brother, who represents the muscle of the group, Rose uses sex to keep a steady supply of black victims coming into the operating room.

What is amazing about the film are the motivations of the rapidly aging white clients. They subscribe to the notion that blacks are physically superior to whites. This desire to be physically robust does not cause the clients to recoil from the notion of “becoming black.”

Peele understandably feared his film would cause controversy and even potential danger for white and black audiences growing angry over the crimes and subtexts of the film. Peele worried a racial clash could occur, although he chose not to include at least one sympathetic white in the cast, as is typically done in movies with black villains to offset charges of racism. Regardless, the film has not realized these fears. White and black attendees are evenly split, and the biggest ticket sales have been in Georgia.

A comedian, Peele allows some funny moments into the film. The black police officers Chris’ friend Rod tries to enlist in investigating Chris’s disappearance drop their serious expressions and laugh out loud when they hear his fears that blacks are being hypnotized into sexual slavery. Overall, however, Peele uses an atmosphere of sinister conspiracy and finally outright horror to craft a film that is worthy to stand beside such classics as “Rosemary’s Baby” and “Stepford Wives.” In doing so, he shows that white liberals are not immune to racism.

‘Black Panther' Offers A Black Hero Who Lives In Freedom,"Everyone knows the production of “Black Panther” is tied up with black pride. Press enthusiasm about the movie knows it. The Black History Month release shows it. The release of a Black Panther album in advance of the film, curated by the proudest black musician in pop, Kendrick Lamar, proves it.

At first glance, the film appears to locate black pride in Africa. Indeed, the set and costume designs, as well as everything else from weaponry to language, aims to persuade you that the fictional setting of the nation of Wakanda is the fruit of a respectful education about Africa. This is cultural appropriation you can believe in.

But it’s as surely about America as you might expect from writer-director Ryan Coogler’s respect for Ta-Nehisi Coates’s writing of the comic Black Panther. And this is something to be grateful for. With no intent of any slight to any African country, the film’s priorities are domestic, not foreign. Americans need some cultural ways of talking about race that aren’t hysterically partisan. And it’s probably not against the intention of “Black Panther’s” creators to understand the story in relation to the struggle for civil rights of American blacks. After all, it’s a 1960s comic.

Thinking About Race Relations Through Fictional Heroes

To make sense of the story, you have to start from the central conflict between two black heroes, Black Panther and Erik Killmonger. One stands for a politics of moral discipline, the other for a politics of revenge. Both have claims to justice that lead them to violence, but one insists on helping the immiserated and the other on destroying the institutions that have heaped up such misery with such disdain for so long. Does this sound familiar?

Black Panther has also inherited the political responsibility of leading his people after his father was assassinated. Yes, America, this is a story about the legacy of black pride and the civil rights struggle after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. That death failed to answer the questions the man’s great political activity raised, and to resolve the conflicts among blacks and among whites and between them as to what equality would demand.

The generations since have not solved this problem, and perhaps this is why finding some stories that can discuss race in light of human nature is now needful. We have seen that outside of film, conversations about race are invariably full of acrimony and bitterness. Their abstraction from urgent questions and a particular political situation allows film to work out a moral logic that makes a happy end imaginable.

This is not to say that the story is a parable about MLK or his legacy, or some kind of roman a clef. The story stands on its own and benefits from writing that stems from story-telling rather than ideology. This starts with the most important element, the African setting.

Reformulating Classically American Questions of Morality

Wakanda is the only country in Africa that has avoided foreign occupation or even any entanglement beyond its borders. This disentangles the moral questions about race from necessity and circumstance. Inasmuch as the story is about the terms on which Wakanda will join the rest of the world and the typical modern conflicts of America, it allows for plot choices to be determined by character and morality.

So at the deepest level of a story about America, “Black Panther’s” success really comes down to reformulating typical American questions of morality. Heroism is understood as assuming responsibility when one is not compelled to. Its legitimacy depends on a plot that dramatizes the search for and arrival at a moral consensus, all by bringing the audience around to agreeing about the demands of justice and the dignity of carrying them out.

I wish there were more to say about this level of reflection, because it is the highest duty of poetry. But today’s stories typically lack in plot. Everyone knows that we want entertainment out of our settings and the inevitable action scenes, with spectacular fights and surprising artistic inventions. But everyone also knows we can only tolerate the good guys winning, so every punch has a moral meaning rather than anything to do with the art of war. The question is only about on what terms the good guys will win. The function of Hollywood, and Marvel above all, is essentially conservative—it conserves the status quo.

We do not ask movies to solve our problems, because we do not dare risk the shameless things comedies have to show to solve problems. We do not ask the movies to show us what is simply impossible to solve in our problems, because we dare not risk the heartbreak that is a necessary part of tragedy. We want a bit of both.

We want all the suffering of tragedy when running up against our limits, but with all the comfort of comedy—a plausible happy end, above all, and the hope for more of the same later. These are the conditions we impose on the story to make its moral problems and solutions believable.

Where Black Panther Is Going from Here

As for what we might get from Black Panther in the future, because he really does seem unique, that depends on another level of story-telling: where he fits in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. We know from “Captain America: Civil War” that Black Panther is a hero and therefore bound by a very rigid code. We see Black Panther’s heroism tested in this story, but only to be augmented. He has neither existential qualms nor does he cause existential threats, as Iron Man routinely does.

Black Panther grows up morally and intellectually as he understands that his political responsibility in Wakanda is to use greatness to help the needy and that not even his country’s former isolation can keep it blameless. Not even the proud morality of self-reliance is beyond causing harm and offense. Not even this perfect city is angelic. But he is not really involved in persuading his people, nor does he have to make serious sacrifices on their behalf. He’s too successful for that.

So, in line with the Marvel ways of story-telling, this isn’t intended to lead to a crisis of first principles that could end a people or a way of life, as it did for Krypton in “Man of steel” or threatened to do for Gotham in the “Dark Knight” trilogy. That’s not the tragic level we’re operating on. Black Panther is a ruler, but he does not have the suggestions about him of being a god, as Superman and Batman do.

The character’s dignity is strangely separated from any crisis whose magnitude would reveal it. He is better than his story. We just believe in him because we want morality to win and it’s getting harder to find suitable champions. Marvel has failed to produce even one in its first ten years of unstoppable success. Black Panther is the first.

Why someone like Black Panther might be needed and what he reveals about us will have to await sequels for that reason. Aside from all the new things Black Panther brings to Marvel—a combination of futurism and primitivism that’s supposed counterpoint the neurotic and ignorant hi-tech Iron Man who otherwise dominates Marvel—we really have no idea why the stern visage of Chadwick Boseman fits in a Marvel setting.

A Different Kind of Superhero

Marvel just turned the darkest end of the world story in any mythology, the Norse Ragnarok, into a bro comedy with a feel-good morality about how good immigrants are and that a country is a people, really, not a place. With Wakanda, we see the entirely opposite attitude. The place actually matters, and it has to be defended. Throughout the story, loyalty matters in a way it has not in any other Marvel story, so that everything exotic is here seen as highly moral, even intransigent. Perhaps, after all, there is room in Marvel for more than the witticisms we have seen so far.

The achievement of the story is to show a black hero act in the realm of freedom. Apart from American entanglements, Black Panther can be a symbol of a dignity entirely free from any past of slavery. He is nevertheless tied up with America, as we see in a flashback, so it’s even more important that so much hope looks to him for a view of full dignity, grown unstunted by injustice.

This story shows the powers that either create freedom or thrive in the element of freedom, depending on how Wakanda ends up being understood, will nevertheless be morally disciplined and fully humane, that is, fully awake to the truth of human nature as human equality. This is really what the story has to offer Americans. I don’t know whether it will come to audiences primarily as a surprise or as relief, but it is doing a public service in the only way culture can.

‘Black Panther’ Is Boring As Heck Until The Villain Shows Up,"Long ago, the last founding father Frederick Douglass said, “Everybody has asked the question, and they learned to ask it early of the abolitionists, ‘What shall we do with the negro?’ I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are worm-eaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! I am not for tying or fastening them on the tree in any way, except by nature’s plan, and if they will not stay there, let them fall. And if the negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs!”

The truest and hardest aspect of truly liberal society and life is the right to fail, the right to be weighed and measured upon your talents and effort. This is what Douglass was saying with infinitely more eloquence than I could ever muster. This was a right denied him while he was legally chattel.

He would’ve looked at the New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society with disdain, because these programs asked the question anew: What are we to do with black Americans? Douglass would have shouted “Nothing!” They are men and women fashioned in God’s image, belonging to the category of inherent dignity. Their welfare belongs to them and God alone, not to any government. Government is established to take away the shackles of elitist condescension.

But we have decided to ignore Douglass as much as we do the rest of the founding fathers. We have decided that some things and certain people need to be propped up. We have decided that the trapeze of life requires a safety net. This is deeply unfair. And this is what our contemporary cultural moment has done to the film “Black Panther.”

Validating a Film They Haven’t Even Seen

“At its Hollywood premiere, Black Panther received a rousing standing ovation. What’s impressive is that this ovation occurred before the movie was shown,” The Hollywood Reporter says. That is the opposite of impressive. It’s an award of sheer tokenism.

The truth about the film “Black Panther” is very similar to that of Barack Obama’s presidency: disappointing. The people at the Hollywood premiere may have gave an ovation at the beginning of their showing, but at the end of mine there was one awkward attempt at clapping. It didn’t last long. The solitary soul gave up after one halfhearted smack. My theater of choice is located in a very mixed racial area of southern California. The audiences I see films with are rainbow-colored.

As I walked out of the theater, I noticed that everyone was silent. There was no chatter. And it wasn’t a solemn silence. I had the sense that everyone felt let down. Normally, people are full of chatter after an Marvel film. The multiple codas are often confusing to non-comic-book fans, so there are a flurry of clarifications, mostly to wives from nerdy husbands.

The film has been receiving bombastic praise, being called everything from a “movement” to “majestic” and even that it “shows the real Africa.” As a cynical conservative, I knew it would be none of these things, least of all a movement.

But I am a massive Marvel Comics Universe fan. The Captain America trilogy in particular are some of my all-time favorite films, especially “Civil War.” T’Challa’s (Black Panther’s) story in that epic is easily one of my favorite parts. I cry every time I hear Black Panther say to Zemo: “Vengeance has consumed you. It’s consuming them (Tony and Steve). I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.”

So I was very much looking forward to seeing the next step of this character arc, in large part because Chadwick Boseman took a very small part and made it feel big in “Captain America: Civil War.” He is a fine actor able to evoke complex emotions with just his eyes.

But unfortunately screenwriters Ryan Coogler (the director) and Robert Joe Cole somehow managed to make the character seem smaller and weaker inside a film that was supposed to be all about the Black Panther. Boseman is still excellent in the role, but is hardly given anything to do until the villain finally shows up.

Major spoilers to follow.

More Than an Hour of No-Stakes Film

There are some very good things about this film. But first let’s slough through the bad. “Black Panther” suffers from several fatal flaws. The greatest sin a film can commit is to be boring. Most of this film is shockingly boring. The first hour and fifteen minutes is virtually tensionless. There are simply no stakes. It feels more like the stuffy and pointless courtliness of “The Phantom Menace” than an exciting superhero film. Even the irrepressible Andy Serkis’ scenery-chewing was joyless and, more importantly, threat-less.

All stories thrive on conflict, but none more so than superhero stories. This does not mean action. This means introducing a problem that our hero must try to solve. But for more than an hour in this film, it is completely unclear what exactly the problem is.

There is a ton of African fetishism. There are even multiple James Bond-esque gadget scenes, a brief MMA-style fight between T’Challa and a would-be usurper, and a car chase in south Korea. But none of this matters. It feels rote. It is completely unclear why we are watching this story. It is a case study of pretentious self-importance, a.k.a. bad writing. The filmmakers believe their subject matter is interesting as-is without any real story. The script should have gone through several additional drafts for the first act and a half.

The hashtag #whatblackpanthermeanstome has been a venue for many to express how happy they are for their minority children to see themselves represented in this movie. But children are not going to like this film. This was a particularly hard realization for me, because I work with minority students.

In principle I hate identity politics and the idea that anybody needs to be represented in order to feel valued, but it’s hard not to get excited about this sort of thing. It’s easier for all of us to relate to characters that look like us. So I’m dreading having to answer my students’ numerous questions about the film. I don’t want to disappoint them. But I’m not the one who will disappoint them. The filmmakers are.

Finally, the Conflict Shows Up

Now for the good. Erik Killmonger is almost certainly the best villain in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) thus far. Sadly, this is not saying much. The MCU, and Marvel Comics in general compared to DC Comics, has been notoriously plagued by weak villains.

Killmonger is a Wakandan of royal blood orphaned in an American ghetto who has decided to incarnate identity politics.

That being said, he is still a fantastic nemesis, thanks in no small part to actor Michael B. Jordan. His presence is constantly threatening, and it invigorated the entire film. When Boseman faces off with him in the royal throne room, it’s as if the film had been wearing handcuffs for an hour and a half and they finally came off. Every scene is better, every actor more convincing, every line more poignant. It’s almost worth the first half being so weak. Conflict is the essence of story, and Jordan’s Killmonger is a tornado of conflict.

The conflict Killmonger represents is very real and deeply relevant to contemporary culture, because Killmonger is an Afro-Nazi. He’s a black supremacist, a real Black Panther. In the X-Men films, villain Magneto is a Holocaust survivor who wants to racially cleanse humanity. Similarly, Killmonger is a Wakandan of royal blood orphaned in an American ghetto who has decided to incarnate identity politics.

He sees Wakanda’s excellence as a means to subjugate the white world. The word “colonialist” is consciously thrown around more than once. Killmonger has drunk deeply of Obama’s anti-colonial well and decided it’s time for vengeance upon the white world.

But T’Challa is more than up to the task. He will not be swayed by the politics of hate. He is a true hero—the same hero who gave up his right to vengeance against Zemo. First and foremost, he wants to do what is right by his nation. He is motivated by actual justice, not Marxist reversals of oppression. The climatic confrontation between these forces of good and complicated evil is well worth suffering through the first half.

Malcom X Boxes Martin Luther King Jr.

In many ways, the third act of this film is like watching Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. put on boxing gloves. The film’s first coda contains an eloquent rhetorical refutation of identity politics in favor of the politics of unity. Speaking to the United Nations, T’Challa says we must all come to see ourselves as one tribe, one family of brothers and sisters. We must learn to see what we have in common first, and not how we are different.

Unfortunately, the film is extremely uneven. I predict it will underperform by a shocking margin. Racism and alt-right activism will be blamed for this, but Disney does not have to look any further than the ecstatic champions in the media who attempted to prop it up, refusing to let this panther stand on its own legs. They have forgotten Douglass: “Let him fall if he cannot stand alone! If the negro cannot live by the line of eternal justice, so beautifully pictured to you in the illustration used by Mr. Phillips, the fault will not be yours, it will be his who made the negro, and established that line for his government.”

We desperately need to learn to let things be what they are, and nothing more. When we turn films and hashtags into fictional movements, we infantilize ourselves and our culture. Everything and everyone deserves the right to fail.

I give the first half a 4.5/10 and the second half an 8.5/10. It’s too uneven for a total score.

‘A Wrinkle in Time’ Is A Disastrous Adaptation Of L'Engle's Book,"Madeleine L’Engle’s classic young adult novel “A Wrinkle in Time” is the latest victim of diversity-deranged stunt casting in which no respect is paid to the race or sex of existing literary characters. But that’s only one reason why this frustrating fiasco is such an embarrassing failure. Director Ava DuVernay (“Selma”), who has no feel at all for the material, seems more interested in promoting colorblind multi-culturalism than producing an entertaining adaptation that is worthy of its much-beloved source.

Although movies featuring original characters whose physical attributes have been unspecified elsewhere are legitimate equal-opportunity roles for any actors, deviating from already established characters turns a project into either a sort of alternative-reality racelifted remake (the black-cast versions of “Annie” and “Steel Magnolias”), a re-imagined novelty (“The Wiz”), comic exploitation (“Blacula”) or a display of randomly colorblind inclusiveness (a black Human Torch in the most recent “Fantastic Four”). All of those swaps are distracting enough to seem like gimmicks, even if an appearance-miscast actor gives an otherwise adequate performance.

Teenage Meg Murry and her mother, both white like the rest of their family in the 1962 “A Wrinkle in Time” novel, are portrayed in this film version by black actresses Storm Reid and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Dad is played by Caucasian Chris Pine. Because Meg’s precocious younger brother Charles Wallace is played by Filipino-American Deric McCabe, this results in the absurdity of the character now being identified as adopted, presumably because it would be hard to believe he could be the product of Mbatha-Raw and Pine’s union. Twin brothers from the book are missing entirely from the movie, which may be a blessing, considering that political correctness probably would have dictated they be played by a Native American dwarf and a disabled transsexual.

The irony of making changes like these to a book in which Meg herself states that “like and equal are not the same thing at all” apparently was lost on those responsible. (Then again, the line does not appear in the movie, possibly because the filmmakers knew they had sabotaged said theme.) Also, it’s unfortunate that the film eliminates the novel’s references to Christianity that resulted in it being banned from some libraries. Inclusion apparently has its limits.

Changing Meg and her mom’s race may have been DuVernay’s attempt to promote the illusion of a universe in which such changes don’t and shouldn’t matter, but that aim is subverted by moments that take on unintended meanings in this new context. Meg’s white friend Calvin (Levi Miller) twice mentions that he likes her hair, which is a huge explosion of curls. Coming from a white boy to a black girl, the compliment has a different implication than if both teens were white. Similarly, when Meg is shown a vision of an idealized makeover of herself that she could become if she gives in to nefarious temptation (a scene not in the book), the fact that her doppelganger’s hair is unnaturally straight and flat comes off like a racist insult to the hair she was born with.

While “whitewashing” conversions of any character to Caucasian are routinely criticized (such as white Natalie Portman’s recent “Annihilation” portrayal of that novel’s half-Asian lead), changing any white character to black apparently is supposed to be regarded as a refreshing redress of historic racist wrongs. That kind of mindset makes it easy to see why the source of pure evil in “A Wrinkle in Time” never is referred to as The Black Thing or The Dark Thing, as it is in the book.

The basic plot sends Meg, Calvin and Charles Wallace on a quest to find her long-missing dad, with the help of three supernatural beings. But the screenplay (by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell) contains so many annoyingly unnecessary deviations from the novel that it almost could be mistaken for an unauthorized pastiche that attempts to alter just enough details to avoid a plagiarism suit.

A female character known as the Happy Medium in the book is now male (Zach Galifianakis). Calvin’s abusive mother is now an abusive father. Meg’s father has been missing for four years instead of two. A character transforms into a flying green leaf-creature instead of a winged white centaur. Instead of taking place in an imposingly grim office building, an encounter with the evil “man with red eyes” (Michael Peña, known here simply as Red) takes place on a sunny, umbrella-crowded beach.

The movie completely ignores L’Engle’s creepy description of the book’s main villain as an oversized, disembodied brain. Even the ending is altered — mild spoiler alert — by having Meg rely upon another character’s feelings toward her, instead of triumphing solely by expressing hers toward him.

Also new is the idea that Meg’s mother is given more credit than her father for the scientific theories that led to “tessering,” or instantaneous space-time travel. In the book, dad and a half-dozen cohorts are the ones who were working on that project, while mom only has doctor degrees in biology and bacteriology … which apparently didn’t make her enough of a credit-deserving superwoman for today’s #TimesUp audiences.

The book’s three supernatural “Mrs.” characters — Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, who transport Meg and company through space-time — are as multi-culti as the rest of the cast. Mrs. Who is Mindy Kaling, whose parents are from India. White Reese Witherspoon’s age and red tresses directly contradict the book’s description of Mrs. Whatsit’s “sparse quantity of grayish hair.” And Mrs. Which, a shimmer who takes the form of “a figure in a black robe and a black peaked hat, beady eyes, a beaked nose and long gray hair” clutching a broomstick in the book, is embodied here by Oprah Winfrey in disco glitter mascara and lipstick. Because of course.

It’s probably rude to criticize a 14-year-old for being lifelessly dull even when she tries acting defiantly spunky, but Reid is missing whatever charisma would have been required to make Meg appealing. Like everyone else here, she seems to be going through the motions without much involvement. Pine is saddled with what may be the movie’s most cringeworthy not-from-the-book dialog, however. At one point, he tells Meg, “I wanted to shake hands with the universe, when I should have been holding yours.”

A yellow brick backyard pathway and an otherworldly twister (neither from the book) presumably are attempts to evoke “The Wizard of Oz,” which is like slapping Ferrari decals on a 1971 Pinto. Also, forget about giving what should have been called “A Waste of Time” a pass because it might be good enough for kids. “A Wrinkle in Time” is so unconvincing, uninvolving and unlikeable that expecting even small children to enjoy it seems cruelly condescending.

What The Success Of ‘Black Panther’ Says About The American People,"After five weeks of being on top, Marvel’s latest blockbuster “Black Panther” has finally dropped to number two at the box office. Despite its reign finally coming to an end, it’s worth noting that no movie has been atop the box office for that long since “Avatar” in 2009. Considering “Black Panther’s” popularity, it may be worth asking: What’s so special about this movie that Americans just can’t seem to get enough of?

The two answers I’ve come across the most so far have been the following: Some cite the critical acclaim it’s received. They argue this superhero film is just better made than most. Others say it’s because of the almost all-black cast and the compelling social justice themes it espouses. When I went to see the movie for myself, I realized there might be another reason.

I, a conservative, went to see “Black Panther” while I was visiting my, much more liberal sister in Seattle. Honestly, I was reluctant to pay to see a movie made by some folks in Mars — sorry, Hollywood, called “Black Panther,” a name associated with the often-violent Black Power movement.

As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the movie and so did my sister. For the first time in over a year, my sister and I had found something political we both believed in. What it was that we agreed on wasn’t immediately clear because the issues discussed in “Black Panther” don’t take place in 2018 red America and blue America, but perhaps that’s how the film pulls off its magic.

At a time when our country feels more divided than any living American can recall, “Black Panther’s” success shines light on the values many American across the country still agree upon. These common understandings aren’t just about America. More importantly, they’re not about what it means to be black or white.

“Black Panther” focuses on the centuries-old question of what it means to be a human being. The most memorable example comes through the antagonist, Erik Killmonger, a former Navy Seal the audience is meant to sympathize with because of the injustices he faced growing up in the slums of Oakland.

On the verge of death, the protagonist and rightful king of Wakanda, T’Challa looks into Killmonger’s eyes, knowing full well that his own father’s abandonment of Killmonger as a child led to his later radicalization. He says to Killmonger, “We can still heal you.”

“Why, so you can lock me up?” Killmonger responds. “Nah. Just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships, ’cause they knew death was better than bondage.”

This powerful rhetoric seemed surprisingly poignant for a Marvel movie. It’s not original, but it does speak truth.

In 1863, two years into the Civil War, Frederick Douglass, a former slave and prominent abolitionist, stood before an audience full of black Americans and proclaimed: “Better to die free, than live slaves!”

Douglass didn’t come up with the expression either. In 1775, a year before the American Revolution, the Second Continental Congress described their own thirst for liberty, writing that they were “resolved to die freemen rather than live as slaves.”

The idea that freedom is worth dying for because it is a necessary condition for human happiness has been at the core of America since the founding. Hundreds of thousands of Americans, of all races, have died both on American soil and abroad with that same conviction.

While Killmonger’s words about wanting to die free may be interpreted as a line meant to invoke guilt, they shouldn’t. The beauty of his character rests in the fact that even though he was led astray, you can still understand his intentions, you can still relate to him as a human being.

In this sense, Killmonger explains the same truth that is espoused in the American Declaration of Independence: white or black, superhero or villain, friend or enemy, we’re all created equal in our humanness.

“Black Panther” engages a lot of important questions modern Americans don’t consider enough. It helps us better understand our history by rationalizing the divine right of Kings. It discusses when a people have a right to overthrow their government. It makes the distinction between dangerous full-scale revolution, and gradual change.

“The world’s going to start over,” Killmonger says when he steals the throne. “I’mma burn it all.”

It engages the question of how we should react when we encounter hardship. If we are suddenly given power over our oppressors, how do we respond? With hatred and violence? Or do we first try to make amends and do the hardest thing, forgive?

At the end of the film, T’Challa gives a press conference where he tells global leaders: “Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows. We cannot. We must not. We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.”

While some may think “Black Panther” conveys a divisive message about the empowerment of just the black race, this line certainly suggests otherwise. Aside from the film’s unifying message and powerful themes, Americans should see “Black Panther’s” unusual popularity as a reminder of all that we still can agree.

Conrad Black On Trump’s Place In The History Of Populism,"Lord Conrad Black discussed his compelling essay in “Vox Populi” with Federalist Senior Contributor and Senior Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research Ben Weingarten. What follows is a full transcript of their discussion, slightly modified for clarity.

You can also listen to their interview in its entirety below.

Ben Weingarten: “Populism” is a term that’s thrown around often pejoratively in American politics, and even world politics. How do you define it?

Lord Conrad Black: I guess you’re absolutely right. It is bandied about rather loosely. I would say that it is a feeling of alienation by a substantial part of the population that had, at one time, either legitimately aspired to or enjoyed a greater degree of direct attention from people in government and in the political apparatus generally. And it tends to be people who have been either shortchanged on the basis of what they had…they felt legitimate aspirations to expect, or shortchanged on the basis of what they actually received as a deferentially treated section of the polity, the public forum. And it is not revolutionary in character because rarely do such people want to throw out the institutions altogether, or the personnel who direct them. They just want a change in policy, and to the extent, that’s basically a change of personnel.

What you normally get is the arising of such a thing, and then when its presence becomes adequately impossible to ignore, one or other of the established political parties then takes up its cause, at least to some degree, in the hopes of adding its support to what it already has. And I believe this is normally called “fusionism”. Ronald Reagan would agree to that. He took over the Republican Party with a different message from what he represented, as a kind of Tweedledee-Tweedledum performance by those immediately preceding him. And he undoubtedly added a good many people, habitually Independents or from the Democratic side, to the big majorities he won.

And it is the way that, historically, in the United States and some other countries, there are quite sharp changes in public policy outside a transition back and forth between traditional parties, right and left. And I think it’s becoming quite manifest in a number of the leading democratic countries now basically because of the difficulties we’re having finding jobs for everyone in an era when technological advance creates unemployment more than employment, which doesn’t really have a precedent, and in an era when the potentialities of aggressive capitalism create these extraordinary disparities in income greater than we’ve seen before, certainly in the industrial era. And these are challenges to be assimilated by all these political cultures.

You’ve had them in the United States on such occasions as when William Jennings Bryan took over the Democratic Party, calling for bimetallism. And as I put in the essay you mentioned in Vox Populi, the Democratic Party in the five elections prior to him, from 1876 to 1892, won the popular vote or came, on one occasion, within a few thousand of winning it, even though they only won the election twice with Cleveland. But when Bryan took over with his bimetallist faction, their performance deteriorated; and the Republicans won quite easily for some time after that, including three occasions when Bryan himself was the candidate.

But it is a time-honored manner of making a political alliance with a force of considerable discontent that could otherwise become potentially revolutionary, or at least slightly insurrectionist, and bringing it back into the political process and giving it…where it has numbers that justified some sense of being listened to, and contributing to government. That does, in fact, appear to have happened in the last year in the United States. And it’s certainly happened in France.

Ben Weingarten: And I should add, it’s hard to imagine a time where the passions of the body politic would be aroused over a silver versus a gold standard, or all of the above. Hard to imagine that such a time existed in American history.

Lord Conrad Black: It is indeed. It was just one of these peculiar fads, like Prohibition. It became a truism that grew and grew. We had something like that in this country [Canada] at one time, and to a slight degree in the United States, on the theory that if you just had state-owned hydroelectricity, everyone would prosper. There is a weakness, I guess, in all of us, or at least in all nationalities among us, to attach ourselves, in large numbers, to a simplistic formula for a panacea. And of course, experience teaches that they don’t really work usually, but that doesn’t deprive them of their attraction.

Ben Weingarten: In terms of the ideological character of populism today — and I’m thinking here particularly of American populism, although it may extend beyond our borders as well — a question for you: To be a populist in America, do you believe one necessarily need be or ought to be in a sense anti-progressive, given that the elite class, in and of itself writ large, has been marinated in progressivism by dint of the schools the elites attend, the neighborhoods in which they live, and the generally monolithic progressive culture that pervades all of the institutions they inhabit?

Lord Conrad Black: I think that in the way you’re using the word “progressive,” the answer to your question is “yes” because there is this monochromatic uniform view that is politically correct, and populism is almost certain to be to some substantial extent reactive against that. Let us face it, as I’m sure a great many of your listeners would agree, it is an attitude that it is easy to become impatient with. It is so complacent, and frequently so erroneous. In general, of course, I would not, any more than I imagine you would, concede that all progress resides with the left. I would say that is demonstrably not the case.

Ben Weingarten: Yeah, I would say, actually, it’s regress that is dominated by the left. But that’s my editorializing.

Lord Conrad Black: Yeah. And I don’t disagree with it, but you’ve got a current usage question slightly at odds with a semantic question, I guess.

Ben Weingarten: Since you mentioned William Jennings Bryan and the history of populist movements in the U.S., what is it in your view that defines the distinction between President Trump’s populism and populist currents that have come before him in American politics?

Lord Conrad Black: Well, taking Bryan as the most prominent example of it, his ideas simply weren’t practical. He had some interesting elements of, as he would say, a progressive program. I’m no great enthusiast about income taxes, but he was a little ahead of his time in that area. He was somewhat ahead of his time in women’s rights too, including the right to vote. But the idea [of bimetallism] was nonsense. The idea that if you just brought silver, the second precious metal, in to back the currency, everyone would get richer — it was just foolishness. It was just gonna create inflation, that’s all, as you increase the money supply out of any proportion to productivity increases. Now, in fairness, the general subject of economics had not been so thoroughly studied at that time.

But in direct reference to the present Trump phenomenon, he composed a rather artistic combination of traditional conservative views, but sensible conservative views, that he could exploit a nostalgia for and an aspiration for, and added to them a couple of populist flourishes that consisted of a particular emphasis on a couple of points that were not in themselves radical or unheard of or frightening, but from him received greater emphasis, particularly questions of immigration and trade, and to some extent, the imposition of law enforcement.

And these were all ideas that were out there, but he hammered them very hard. He didn’t just take out of thin air a harebrained theory that had never been tried, like bimetallism. He just said, “Look here, we’ve allowed 11 or 12 million people to come into our country, most of them unskilled workers not easily assimilable into our society, including a good many undesirables that other countries in this hemisphere wished to be rid of themselves. And we haven’t even taken their names as they’ve entered. They just came in completely unannounced and unrecorded, and they’re a terrible weight to our social safety net and our education system and so on. This won’t do, countries must have borders.” Now it is so obvious it is hard to imagine that anyone needed to be told that, and I think historians of the United States of the future will be flabbergasted that the political class sat on their hands, both parties, the President’s and the Congress’s, for 20 years or more and allowed these millions of people to come in. It was a shocking lapse in political responsibility, and he finally made the political establishment pay for it.

Ben Weingarten: And you write in your essay of President Trump’s election, that it was only the third time in 100 years that, “The political center moved.” What do you mean by this?

Lord Conrad Black: The others that I was referring to were in 1932 with Franklin D. Roosevelt, and in 1980 with Ronald Reagan. And I believe those three elections are the only ones where there really was a clear demarcation between the outgoing administration and the incoming one, even if it only became altogether clear after the new one was installed.

In, let’s say, the ideological orientation of the administration, Roosevelt, obviously faced with a terrible economic crisis, had a far more government interventionist view of how to get out of that crisis than Herbert Hoover did. And I think they were both in approximately the same socioeconomic group themselves. Roosevelt had a more patrician heritage, but they were both high-income, well-educated men. So it wasn’t that they were at war between themselves in some Marxist class way, they just had a disagreement about how to deal with an unprecedented economic emergency.

In the case of Reagan, there was a strong foreign policy element to it as well, as he believed that the Kennedy, Johnson administrations, and to some degree the Nixon, Ford administrations, had been too accommodating of the Soviet Union. But domestically, he was an advocate of reduced tax and less intervention and smaller government, and to some degree, he was a bit of a confidence trickster, of a very benign and admirable kind. He didn’t really shrink the government very much. Even when he was in office five or six years, he was still running against Washington, the City of Washington and the people in it, and the public sector people, and yet he’d been the president for years. And he was very skillful at doing it. But he didn’t, in fact, seriously undertake a reduction of the role of government. He just changed… Essentially cut taxes, and increased the military capacities and ability to be more assertive politically of the United States very successfully.

In the case of President Trump, again, I think it’s not very difficult to see the change in policy all along the line that he’s conducted from the Obama administration, whether it’s environmental questions, treatment of most foreign policy areas, tax policy, various areas of regulation. It is a sharp change in traditional terms, it’s a change to the right; but not the radical right, just the same sort of right that Reagan talked about and to some degree acted upon.

Ben Weingarten: Yeah, and that Trump agenda, which loosely we can define as — and this is what the National Security Strategy released at the end of last year termed it — a “principled realism” abroad, and at home, an emphasis on sovereignty, the rule of law, and economic nationalism…in your view, does that agenda have staying power? In other words, is Trump’s populist agenda sort of a blip in history that has emerged due to a forceful and charismatic personality, or is there a broader political movement that has real legs?

Lord Conrad Black: Of course, it could go either way, and a lot depends on leadership and more specifically, on how it plays out over the next couple of years. But I believe that it does have legs, and I think it is, on balance, better policy. Let us face facts: The alternative, the policy that he has run against and substantially changed, has been a policy of essentially taking money from people who’ve earned it, and giving it to people who haven’t, with what a very large number consider to be an inadequate criterion of merit, but in a way that coincidentally happens to lead towards the offense of fewer voters than it pleases. That’s essentially what we’re dealing with here.

And if President Roosevelt, who founded the modern social safety network of the United States, had ever seen what it degenerated into, he would have been outraged. He said, “I’m not paying people…” He said that he wouldn’t pay people to be idle. He would if they simply couldn’t work, or we couldn’t find anything for them. But in general, he put people to work in conservation projects, and what would today be called “infrastructure projects.” And they were extremely successful at endowing the country with a great mileage of highways, and many national parks, and great projects like the Lincoln Tunnel and the Triborough Bridge and the TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] and so on. It was a temporary alternate form of work, and I think it’s been a mistake by American historians to fail to reduce that number of people in his workfare programs from their calculation of the unemployed.

As you know, in more recent times, we’ve had a shrinkage of the workforce, and huge numbers of people simply paid to be idle. And to some degree, it’s a necessity because it is difficult to find work for everyone at a time when most areas of productivity can be accomplished with far fewer people than in the 1930s. But I think what Trump is trying to do is go back to economic growth and fair trading so the U.S. doesn’t just import unemployment in its trade deals, and soak up the unemployed and underemployed that way, and make a more contented and purposeful workforce, and reduce the trade account deficit, and that sort of thing. So I think that is fundamentally a sound policy that will be at least partially successful, and therefore partially durable. I think it would be a terrible mistake and a very sad thing if his policies, economic policy failed. Now there’s no sign of that at this point, but we’re only a year into it now.

Ben Weingarten: Yeah. And you wrote an article towards the end of last year for National Review where you reflected a bit on the president’s first year, and you see a great divergence at its highest level between style and substance, reflected well in kind of the apoplexy and criticism of “The Resistance” on the one hand, and then the actual policies that were promulgated and executed during the year on the other. Reflect for us a little bit on the president’s first year in office as it relates to populism.

Lord Conrad Black: Well, look, I think he’s had the most successful first year since Eisenhower, who ended the Korean War in his first year. And this is disguised by these endless controversies, some of which are created by his deliberately goading his opponents because the tumult seems to amuse him personally. And he is a showman; and he believes, up to a point, that politics is entertainment. And he does make it entertaining — I think even most of his opponents would agree with that.

But the fact is, it’s been a year of considerable achievement. He’s drastically reduced the number of illegal entrants into the country. He’s got a much higher level of cooperation from the Chinese in dealing with North Korea. They have, with allies — but the U.S. playing a very important role in it — effectively smashed ISIS as we knew it. I’m not saying there are no people professing to be ISIS sympathizers around, but they don’t occupy any defined territory in Syria or Iraq as they did. And of course, the economic numbers have been extraordinarily good. And he’s got some of the NATO countries, including Canada, I’m happy to say, raising their defense budgets in accordance with their commitments, instead of just complacently sitting with an American military guarantee, and reducing the whole alliance to talking shop. And all of these things, I think, have worked out well.

And I personally think that he was right not to proceed with the Paris climate agreement, which essentially was based on very questionable scientific analysis, producing a conclusion that would cause the advanced economies, in a very apologetic manner, to enrich less developed countries, who are, in fact, frequently the greatest offenders in environmental matters. And it was just, at least in a large measure, a transfer of money from rich to poor countries in the manner of the long preferred, let’s say, Obama-level model of transferring internal resources from the middle class to people of lower incomes. The Obamas took pretty good care, as the Clintons did, of very wealthy people, who tended to take good care of them too, personally and otherwise.

But the fact is that…I have no standing to mind-read, but it appears that the Clinton camp had terrible problems accepting the fact that they’d lost the election. And as a result of that, given their preeminence in the media, largely because Trump identified the national media as one of the problems, part of the “swamp,” and one of the afflictions of the country and its political system, the Democrats have had no difficulty at all getting solidarity with most of the national media attacking Trump at every conceivable opportunity.

So we’ve had this procession of utterly absurd, preposterous attempts to undermine his presidency, that he had colluded in a treasonable manner with the Russians. Of course, it’s nonsense. There’s not a shred of evidence of it. He wouldn’t dream of such a thing. Or that he’s completely mentally incapacitated — he’s so unbalanced, and therefore, should be removed under the 25th Amendment. Again, this is nonsense. That would have applied at the end of President Wilson’s time after the strokes he had, or something like that, not at a situation like this…The Logan Act, which has never been successfully applied in 219 years, that he improperly conducted foreign policy before he was President, this is nonsense. Obstruction of justice from firing Comey, which he would have no difficulty establishing that Comey richly deserved to be fired after some of the things he did, and I don’t think even Democrats would dispute that now, all of this was just nonsense.

But in this atmosphere of the sort of denial that Trump had won, and therefore, a question about the legitimacy of him being in the White House at all, there’s been this recurrence of attempts to demonstrate that he is either morally or psychologically unqualified to be president. And so we’ve had this red herring of a confected threat to his legitimacy hanging over him, and that has been the chief reason why the atmosphere has been so contumelious. But in fact, his accomplishments as president have been very substantial, and precisely along the lines he promised. Obviously, some of the things he said in his campaign, as is the case with most candidates, successful and otherwise, were exaggerations on what he actually did in office. But in general, he has done what he said he would do, and that in itself is a refreshing change.

Ben Weingarten: The ultimate goal of the litany of charges against the President, as we all know, but which is left unsaid frequently, is to, as you said, undermine his legitimacy, and ultimately, from the Democratic perspective, to try to remove him from office — to create, kind of build the case, real or imagined, and then be able to apply high crimes and misdemeanors, and seek to impeach him. All of the signs look fairly ominous for what will happen at the very least in the House, in the midterm elections, for the Republican Party. What do you anticipate happening if Republicans do, in fact, lose the House?

Lord Conrad Black: Well, I agree. I think they’re trying to either remove him…First of all, sort of taint him and plant this generalized view that there’s something illegitimate about him, and therefore, he shouldn’t receive the respect normally offered to a [president]…Secondly, if they can’t push him out altogether, to distract him so much that he can’t perform properly, so they can then accuse him of being a do-nothing president and a mere controversialist, and have him as a sort of…immobilized president sitting in the White House, awaiting the end of his term.

On your specific question, if the Democrats got control of the House of Representatives, certainly there would be a much greater danger that they would try and put an impeachment bill through. I doubt that…On anything we can see at this point, there would be no really serious reason to do it, other than their own partisanship. And there are some sane people in that party and in their House of Representatives delegation. I think Trump would have to do something that the media could successfully represent as really seriously outrageous before they could get a positive vote. I don’t think they…unless Trump actually committed a crime, which he’s not going to do, has not done and will not do, but unless he did that, they would have less chance of actually getting a vote to remove him in the Senate, a two-thirds vote, than the Republicans had when they tried it with Clinton.

So I think the price we paid essentially for the terrible overreaction to Watergate, accompanied by the fact that Mr. Nixon didn’t handle the investigation properly — I don’t think there is any evidence even now that Nixon himself committed illegalities in Watergate, but some people in his entourage did — but the price we paid for that is the routinization of the criminalization of policy differences. “I don’t agree with this person. We’re imaginative and adaptive Americans. Let’s see if we can avoid this policy option we don’t like, and as a bonus, get rid of this President we don’t like ’cause he’s in the other party” — like accusing him of crimes, as if it was just a confidence vote in a parliamentary system like Britain or Canada. And that is not what the authors of the Constitution intended.

Mr. Nixon was a patriotic man who, in fact, was convinced himself that he did not commit crimes; and if he was judged fairly, would be judged not to have committed crimes. But as a patriot, since impeachment had not been mentioned in the presidential context for over a century, for a president, he just didn’t want to put the country to such a demeaning process. And Bill Clinton had no such reservations, but he did achieve something by showing that it wasn’t a process that would necessarily be very successful. They had not even got that far with Reagan and the Iran-Contra nonsense.

But what should happen at some point soon is both parties, and the powers that be politically in the country generally, should realize that impeachment of a president is something that should be regarded as an absolutely extreme measure, as it was intended to be, in the case of utterly profoundly unconstitutional conduct. It was really designed to prevent a domestic George III coming in. Not that he was that bad a king either, but…he wasn’t. He wasn’t that good either. And he was mad half the time, but he was not a madman…I mean, a mad despot, an autocrat, as he was accused of being. But again, that’s beside the point.

But if the United States — and Alan Dershowitz speaks very well about this, he’s a liberal Democrat who supported Clinton — if the U.S. is going to criminalize in an accelerated and unjust way, or purport to criminalize the conduct of people who are just doing what they said they would do when they ran for election, and then psychiatrize them too, and claim that they’re mentally unbalanced and so forth, you’re going to get chaos in the country. The whole system will break down.

What should happen as a result of all this talk is, have an all-party, nonpartisan resolution and agreement, not legislation, but just a state of mind that is agreed upon, that discussion of the impeachment or removal from office of a president should only be entertained in the event of high crimes and misdemeanors on which there’s real evidence, and not in a routine and frivolous and dangerously irresponsible way, which is what we’ve got now.

[Additionally] I don’t think the Democrats will win the House. I think what will happen is that the President will carefully assemble his healthcare reform that the Republican Party is pretty much agreed upon, and an immigration reform that it’s pretty much agreed upon, put those out very firmly to the voters, stand on his high economic growth and continuing excellent economic numbers, and order the release by the Justice Department, relatively close to the midterm elections, of everything to do with the collusion investigation, to reveal in its ghastly infirmity the absolute vacuity of that argument, the falsity, the malice and the defamatory destructiveness of the entire argument that he or anyone closely associated with him ever colluded with a foreign power to rig an American election. Just administer a bone-crushing defeat to the Democrats, and their echo chamber in the national media. And do it right…just coming into the midterm election campaign. And I think he will gain seats in both the House and the Senate.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/04/05/conrad-black-on-trumps-place-in-the-history-of-populism/,2018-04-05
Why Does The Left Get A Pass On Anti-Semitism?,"This week, an assemblywoman from Brooklyn — the New York City borough with approximately 2.7 million people, not some far-flung hamlet in flyover country — went on an near-hour-long rant in which she accused Jews of conspiring to gentrify her district and steal her home. In the midst of this outburst, Diane Richardson reportedly referred to one of her rivals as the “the Jewish senator from southern Brooklyn.”

This incident comes not long after a DC Council member named Trayon White Sr., a Democrat who represents the Eighth Ward of the capital of the free world in the twenty-first century, posted a video offering some of his thoughts on how “the Rothschilds” were controlling the climate to squeeze money out of the oppressed.

Both of these people have been treated as raving lunatics, which they might very well be. But a person could easily imagine the fate of any elected official in a large city had he or she aimed similar conspiracies at African-American neighbors. We would almost assuredly be plunged into a national conversation about the shameful bigotry that plagues our cities.

That’s not to argue that we should overreact to these incidents. Although certainly a serious concern, anti-Semitism is a relatively minor problem in American life. It is, however, getting difficult not to notice a trend among liberals of either ignoring, rationalizing, or brushing off anti-Semitism, which seems to be more commonplace on the Left than it has been in a long time.

But when identity politics and class warfare propel your movement, as it does the progressivism that’s becoming increasingly popular on the American Left, it’s almost inevitable that the Jews, who’ve tended to successfully navigate meritocracies, will become targets. This hate has traveled with socialists since Karl Marx first declared that “Money” was the god of the Jews.

The other, perhaps more pertinent, factor driving the kind of leftist anti-Semitism we see on campuses across America and now gradually in politics is anti-Zionism. That’s because it is not merely criticism of various Likud policies that girds this animosity, but a broad antipathy towards the very existence of the Jewish state — a position that almost always devolves into something uglier.

The most obvious example of this trend is the Left’s embrace of Women’s March co-founders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, both supporters of the anti-Semitic Nation of Islam (although Sarsour’s Jewish problem goes deeper). Mallory only recently attended a speech given by Louis Farrakhan and posed with a man who had that day opined on “Satanic Jews” and other pressing matters. Referring to Farrakhan as “GOAT” — the greatest of all time — Mallory will surely continue to widespread attention and adulation in mainstream publications.

Extremists and quacks have always attempted to tether themselves to mainstream political movements. What’s more concerning than the presence of Sarsour and Mallory is how liberals have either ignored anti-Semitism or gone out of their way to rationalize it.

“[Many] black people,” wrote The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer, in one of a number of articles working through this sudden “conundrum” of Jew-hating on the Left. “But many black people come into contact with the Nation of Islam as a force in impoverished black communities—not simply as a champion of the black poor or working class, but of the black underclass: black people, especially men, who have been written off or abandoned by white society.”

So, you see, “white society” is really at fault for Mallory’s turn towards anti-Semitism. Would anyone ever accept such reasoning for racism among the poor of Appalachia or the Jews of Brooklyn? At this point, you have to wonder what kind of relationship someone would have to enter to merit a full-throated denunciation from fellow liberals. I imagine nothing less than socializing with a conservative would do the trick.

At least Serwer concedes that the Nation of Islam is a consequential force in urban communities and offers a theory for its popularity. Most often, those who associate with anti-Semites are insulated and excused of any wrongdoing by the mere fact that Republicans are the ones bringing the charge.

For example, while it’s inconceivable that a person who spent a decade as a member of the Klan could find a place in politics today, despite its lack of influence, a member of the Nation of Islam can rise to become deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee without anyone in his party challenging his ascendency. Elizabeth Bruenig, a Washington Post columnist, recently praised Keith Ellison (she was far from alone) for “calling out the silly Farrakhan-related smear campaign against him for what it is: a totally cynical attempt to pit the black community against the Jewish community.”

Now, maybe it’s silly to point out that Ellison once appeared as a local Farrakhan spokesman in Minneapolis to defend a congregant who said “Jews are among the most racist white people I know,” or to mention that the left-wing magazine Mother Jones reported that Ellison had embraced that idea that “European white Jews are trying to oppress minorities all over the world” and talked about “Jewish slave traders” (there was never a denial from the congressman’s office), or even that the DNC’s deputy chairman only distanced himself from anti-Semites during his 2006 run for Congress, and then only when right-wing bloggers started pointing out his past.

But is it really silly to point out that one of the leading lights of the Democratic Party told a group in 2010, after breaking with Farrakhan, that Jews were running American foreign policy or that he and Farrakhan attended a dinner honoring Iranian President and Holocaust-denier Hassan Rouhani in 2013?

While smearing all conservatives as bigots has been an ongoing project, anti-Semitism whitewashing is relatively new for liberals. Although, of course, the two can work in tandem. When Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, was asked by Meghan McCain on “The View” about Mallory’s affection for Farrakhan, she replied, “You work with people all the time with whom you disagree. Goodness knows I met with the Koch brothers when we were working on criminal justice or Rupert Murdoch when we were working on immigration reform.”

Jarrett’s contention that the Koch brothers, whose consistent libertarian positions make it entirely predictable that they’d be concerned about criminal justice issues, are comparable to a man who described Hitler as “a very great man” is half a despicable smear and half a clumsy attempt to moderate the real extremism within her own ranks. Of course it’s inconvenient, perhaps even politically perilous, for Democrats like Jarrett to attack their own Resistance leaders. Perhaps they even have some ideological sympathy for the cause.

Moreover, acknowledging that both sides attract bigots undermines a critical narrative for Democrats. This is why places like the Anti-Defamation League spend an inordinate amount of time acting as if some fringe Nazis, most of whom probably live in vans down by the river, are a cohesive and dangerous movement while largely ignoring, or quickly moving past, leftist anti-Semitism.

It’s also why Richard Spencer and David Duke, people with few followers and zero political power, are given an inordinate amount of media attention while the fact that Congressional Black Caucus members, who both coordinated and met with the leader of the Nation of Islam, is given virtually no coverage at all. It’s why the deputy Washington editor of The New York Times, Jonathan Weisman, can write an entire fearmongering book purporting to examine Jewish life in “the Age of Trump” by stringing together a bunch of disparate incidents — some genuinely troubling, others imagined — to warn of the coming fascism, while meticulously ignoring the contagious strains of anti-Semitism that live, not on the periphery, but smack in the middle of the most celebrated activist movement in the country.

In Britain, there has been something of a reckoning for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has spent a lifetime associating and befriending Jew-haters, 9-11 Truthers, terrorist sympathizers, Holocaust deniers, and politicians who claim Jews perpetrate blood libel. In the United States, these kinds of associations with the far-left would have previously destroyed careers. Not anymore.

Kanye Unloads On Identity Politics As ‘Self-Victimization’ And ‘Slavery’,"The famously eccentric rapper who once dined with President Donald Trump is opening up more and more about his previously cryptic political beliefs. In a batch of tweets written Saturday and Sunday after a long hiatus from Twitter, Kanye West exclaimed his support for conservative black pundit Candace Owens as well as his distaste for the slave “mentality” the political left currently embraces.

It’s practically a given that whenever a high-profile public figure publishes any whiff of conservative opinion, the Left is certain to clamor for his head (similar to West’s Twitter profile picture). But West refused to cave in or apologize for his tweets:

The Washington Post’s reporter on identity politics, Eugene Scott, worries West might be trying to grant Owens’ worldview—which includes a firm rejection of Black Lives Matter and all forms of victimization politics—validation among black voters. But he then dismisses such a goal as a “fringe” ploy, refusing to even consider the idea that ordinary black people might find an anti-collectivist, pro-individual-excellence position even somewhat attractive. Of course, West and Owens disagree.

Whatever the goal of the tweetstorm, West, who grew up in a strongly left-leaning household and whose earlier political sentiments included insisting George W. Bush didn’t care about black people, appears to have evolved politically. His embrace of Trump in early 2017 made headline news. While the whole mainstream media jeered at him, he maintained that he would have voted for Trump in 2016, had he voted.

Later, however, he deleted all of his posts about Trump and tweeted criticism of Trump’s travel ban policies. Now, West has opened up a whole new can of worms with his embrace of several conservative ideas on race, including a strong belief that, to paraphrase Owens, victim mentalities, blaming “the system” for one’s own personal failures, are far inferior especially for black Americans than victor mentalities. That’s the belief that one can control one’s destiny through one’s own actions and choices.

At least on the facts, West and Owens deserve plaudits. Black Americans have made huge inroads into society since the end of the civil rights era. Yet, despite huge increases in education achievement, income, and middle-class attainability, including a 50 percent increase in the black middle class since 1940, and despite increased optimism from the average black person in America in life satisfaction, the toothless narrative that black people today are suffering at the hands of white supremacy remains omnipresent in academia and media. West and Owens are trying to show that the pontificating ivory-tower elites who peddle this narrative have no clothes.

What is also commendable in West’s case is that a man with an extremely wide and politically varied audience held fast to his convictions and refused to let the social-justice media complex batter him into submission. Life for conservative-leaning public figures is never easy, but life for racial minorities who dare defy being labeled as a victim, and who refuse to participate in the endless procession of pitchforks against “systematic white oppression,” is even harder.

Of course, West was always a bit eccentric and is a definite outsider in the music community. But he is a true individualist both in musical taste (as his 21 Grammys explain) and in political convictions. But don’t let me tell it to you. Leave it to Kanye to have the last word:

Why Now Is The Perfect Time To Refresh Yourself On Frederick Douglass,"This spring inaugurated a year-long national celebration commemorating the bicentennial of the birth of the iconic American Frederick Douglass. Born to an enslaved black woman on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Douglass escaped bondage and became a force for justice on the strength of his reasoned moral clarity and impassioned eloquence.

Two centuries later, elected officials and community leaders are coming together to celebrate his enduring relevance. By a rare unanimous vote, Congress established the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission to plan and carry out educational events to honor his life and legacy. A rising portrait artist has interpreted the iconic activist. And a major motion picture is in the works. Last week, The Heritage Foundation hosted scholars and activists who discussed the varied aspects of Frederick Douglass and what his ideas mean today.

A complex portrait emerged of one who loved his nation and agitated for change. As a newspaper editor, social reformer and adviser to President Lincoln, Douglass helped guide America through the turbulent Civil War. The conflict claimed more than 600,000 lives — nearly equal to the casualties of all other U.S. wars combined.

“The epic story of Frederick Douglass contains a lot of the arc of American history,” said Colin Hanna, executive producer of a forthcoming feature film about Douglass. “He is an heroic figure. Today, we hear that the ‘Black Panther’ movie represents the success of the first black superhero.”

“I would argue that America’s real first black superhero was Frederick Douglass.”

Feature Film to Celebrate His Life and Legacy

A longtime public policy advocate and veteran, Hanna founded Enduring Impact Productions two years ago to bring Douglass’ life story to the big screen.

“There is a tremendously receptive environment right now for people to become acquainted with Douglass,” said Hanna. “Most people know only a handful of fragments of his story. One of the best ways of educating a wide swath of Americans is through a theatrical release motion picture. So that’s what we’re doing.”

With contributions from several historical advisors, the team hired a Hollywood writer who had just completed a $50 million production. Similar to Douglass’ story, that film also addressed slavery during the Civil War era.

“Our principal screenwriter is Leonard Hartman, who wrote ‘The Free State of Jones’ starring Matthew McConaughey,” stated Hanna. “He has very specific, relevant experience. Leonard told me at one point, as he was researching the screenplay, he had 16 books by and about Frederick Douglass open on the floor of his office.”

After many drafts, a working screenplay was completed over the past month. They are now interviewing directors and actors, as well as raising an estimated $20 million to produce the film. “2019 is an ambitious release date, but we’ll never get it done if we don’t set ambitious targets,” noted Hanna. “It’s quite an undertaking.”

The Former Slave Whose Words Changed A Nation

An award-winning artist faced a similarly daunting task in interpreting Douglass. For years, artist Tom Matousek has come to know history by researching and painting portraits of important public figures. From Jackie Robinson to Winston Churchill to Saint Teresa of Avila, his unique style uses bold colors and geometric shapes to capture multifaceted personalities.

When the Douglass Leadership Institute asked him to paint their namesake, Matousek did not know at the time this would bring his work national attention. The artist recalled how the reformer inspires him, even from his early years.

“As a boy, Douglass was closed off from opportunity,” observed Matousek. “Then one door cracked open: the potential to read. He saw a sliver of light and thought, What’s in there? He opened that door, taking it upon himself to be all he could be.”

His wife Kris Matousek was involved in research for the portrait. She recounted a story from “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass” illustrating his point. “Douglass was creative and resourceful,” she said. “Even when barred from learning, he found ways to teach himself to read. Following the brutal treatment at the plantation, he worked as a house slave in Baltimore.”

Where Douglass was enslaved, many local white families had less to eat than he did. “Douglass would bring bread with him when he went to run errands,” continued Matousek. “Getting to know young white boys, he would challenge them: I’ll bet I can read better than you. He would bring bread and trade it for reading lessons. They helped each other and there was mutual respect.”

Douglass was a rare exception to the conditions black Americans faced in the 19th century. Escaping from slavery, the self-taught orator and writer boldly called his nation to account with fiery anti-slavery speeches in northern U.S. cities.

In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Law essentially legalized the kidnapping of any black man, woman or child. “There was no protection by law for them anywhere in the United States,” said Peter Myers of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire at the Heritage event. The author and lecturer often dispels popular myths about Douglass.

He quoted Frederick Douglass’ now-iconic Fourth of July oration delivered in 1852. “There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States at this very hour,” stated Douglass. “In glaring violation of justice … and in diabolical intent, this Fugitive Slave Law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation.”

However, Douglass diverged with popular anti-slavery ideology, including with that of his early mentor William Lloyd Garrison, who believed the Constitution to be pro-slavery. “The destruction of slavery, according to Garrison, required the destruction of America,” said Myers. “It’s surprising how quickly and thoroughly Douglass came to reject [this] position.”

In that same 1852 speech, Douglass skillfully evaded these views and expressed support for American principles. “Take the Constitution according to its plain reading, and I defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it,” he stated. “On the other hand, it will be found to contain principles and purposes entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.”

Yet scholars noted confusion about America’s founding charter persists today.

His Grievances with America — and Gratitude

“Douglass knew how to balance the politics of grievance with the politics of gratitude,” stated Dr. Diana Schaub of Loyola University Maryland at the event.

She summed up his political philosophy. “His shorthand formula for what is demanded of government is ‘a fair field and no favor,’” said Schaub. “It means the establishment of equality before the law, which in turn means race-based injustices would need to be dismantled.”

Then as now, some contend the American founders offered no firm foundation to recognize equality and human dignity. Critics point to the Three-Fifths Compromise as proof of a pro-slavery Constitution. Repealed following the Civil War, a misreading of this clause continues to influence many Americans.

“People think that this was some commentary on black humanity, and it has nothing to do with that,” said Myers following the event. “The three-fifths compromise was mainly about apportionment and taxation. How will this population of people, those enslaved and disfranchised, be counted?” Regional power in the federal government is derived largely from how Congress, the electoral college and direct taxes are apportioned to each state.

While many assume the three-fifths clause means that a black person was worth 60 percent of a white person, Myers shows the flaws of this understanding. “The slaveholding side argued they should be counted as whole persons,” he continues. “The opposite side said, No, if you’re going to treat them like property, then you can’t have representation for property. So the most anti-slavery side wanted them to be counted as zero persons.”

The three-fifths clause was struck down by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution ratified in 1868, followed by the right to voted explicitly granted to black Americans with the 15th Amendment in 1870. During this era, Douglass persisted as a national prophet of justice and equality.

“Real patriotism means holding America’s feet to the fire of its noble principles,” said Schaub. “For Douglass, a holiday never means a holiday from scathing criticism of American failings. He warned Americans against persecuting any variety of the human family.”

It begs the question: how might he address current contentions of discrimination?

What Douglass Would Say to Activists Today

Reverend Dean Nelson, chairman of the Douglass Leadership Institute, recalled his own journey starting out as a “radical student activist” at Howard University.

“I think of Frederick Douglass from an activist standpoint, because that is what I consider myself,” began Nelson. “It’s important for a generation of activists, especially young people, to take a look at who he actually became. We can start in one place, and end up somewhere else. There is an evolution of Douglass.”

Leading a team inspired by Douglass’ legacy, Nelson has seen many attempt to coopt the 19th century statesman. He carefully translated the iconic agitator to current events. “Douglass might affirm and to a degree encourage the modern Black Lives Matter movement,” he offered. “But [BLM does not] line up with his philosophy.”

“Frederick Douglass was a person of profound faith,” continued Nelson. “The Black Lives Matter movement today actually does not embrace an idea that we should forgive those who have done wrong to us.” He summed up their view as: The more wrong you have done, the more we should be antagonistic towards you.

Other panelists emphasized where Douglass called for reforms in his own time. “Douglass was emphatic there be no favors, no special categories created, no race-based privileges and no exemptions from a uniform standard,” stated Diana Schaub.

“He also recommended some carefully chosen forms of reparative justice, especially the provisioning of public education,” she said. Regarding literacy as the path to liberation, Douglass would not brush aside current disparities in education funding and achievement. A recent national Pew Research study found 75 percent of blacks say lower quality schools are a major reason their families face barriers to success.

Community and Elected Leaders Unite for National Effort

As a member of the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission, Nelson noted they plan to speak out on other current issues. “There is a desire to address human trafficking,” he said. “The idea is to create a new generation of abolitionists.”

Other appointed members of the Commission include historian David Anderson; Kay Coles James, president of The Heritage Foundation; Dr. Alveda King, pro-life activist and niece of Martin Luther King, Jr.; Ken Morris, Jr., president of the Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives and great-great-great grandson of Frederick Douglass; Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC); Star Parker, president of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education; and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC).

Details of the Commission’s planned nationwide activities are expected soon. It’s striking how ideologically diverse these leaders are — reflecting Douglass’ aversion to political polarization. While continually advocating for policy reforms, he saw the perils in viewing the other side of debates with hostility and personal animus.

“Douglass focused on unity and the ideals of America — while admitting, too often, the nation falls short or baldly contradicts those ideals,” said Colin Hanna, hard at work on the Douglass feature film. “The ideals were right, while their implementation in American society was wrong.”

“Rather than us being separated along lines such as ethnicity or party, this message can bring America together.”

The Contradiction At The Heart Of Achieving Racial Justice In America,"What happened to the dream of a post-racial America? From fights over confederate statues, to the Black Lives Matter movement, to the rise of the racist alt-right, to Donald Trump’s flirtations with racists, to the chumminess of many Democrats and left-wing activists with Louis Farrakhan, the vision of harmony seems to have vanished in a cloud of racially charged acrimony.

The Left tends to blame this on persistent structural racism and a backlash against the Obama presidency. The Right prefers to blame identity politics and political correctness for stoking division and anger. Both have some truth, and both are prone to overreach, but the problem may run deeper than either of these perspectives acknowledges. Can diversity, equality, and justice coexist with each other, especially in a nation where racial identities were created by slavery and segregation?

Anders Walker’s new book from Yale University Press, The Burning House: Jim Crow and the Making of Modern America, offers a provocative scholarly take on the problems of racial identity, diversity, and justice. Walker, a law professor at Saint Louis University, argues that the current emphasis on diversity is in large part derived from pluralist views that developed in the Jim Crow South. Deftly deploying extensive quotations, Walker explores these ideas as they were expressed by writers such as William Faulkner, James Baldwin, Flannery O’ Connor, and Supreme Court Justices Lewis Powell and Clarence Thomas. He claims they have shaped culture and jurisprudence regarding diversity in important but unappreciated ways.

These figures, white and black, recognized that slavery and Jim Crow had forged a distinct black culture and identity, which raised the question of whether racial integration would mean losing that cultural heritage. Was African-American culture worth preserving, at least in part? If so, could blacks improve their status and demand justice without losing their culture and identity in integration? How much did they even want to integrate their lives with those who were still legally oppressing them?

Omnipresent Violence

Some Southern whites raised pluralist points on behalf of segregation, claiming that the region’s divided culture actually reduced racial tensions and protected blacks by providing them their own sphere of life. They declared that Northern reformers should attend to their own problems, rather than trying to impose their cultural norms upon the South, and insisted that personal kindness and charity mitigated the harshness of legal segregation.

However, at best, the paternalistic gentlemen of the white South, such as Atticus Finch in Harper Lee’s classic To Kill a Mockingbird, were only sporadically able to restrain the savagery of the more virulent racists around them. Their claims to soften segregation were vitiated by their inability or unwillingness to effectively restrain and punish the depredations and injustices regularly committed against freed slaves and their descendants.

Try to ignore it as they might, the Jim Crow system required brutality, demanding “a level of deference from blacks that could not have been maintained without the omnipresent threat of violence.” The cultural pluralism of the South was not a free, organic development, but the result of repression. White Southern agrarians had fine words and ideas about localism, pluralism, and cultural diversity, but used them to try to perfume the stinking corpse of slavery that was segregation.

Meanwhile, while they loathed the oppression of segregation, there were nonetheless blacks who sounded some similar notes regarding assimilation into the dominant white culture. They wanted the boot (or, more accurately, the noose) of violent oppression off their necks, but they were reluctant to completely abandon the unique black identity and culture that developed in response to slavery and segregation.

For example, Walker notes that James Baldwin seemed conflicted in an interview he gave to Robert Warren (a writer examined in The Burning House). On one hand, “Baldwin seemed to argue for integration, or a world in which race ‘would count for nothing.’ On the other, he made a strong case for preserving a distinctly black perspective on America, its history, and its shortcomings.” Men and women like Baldwin were proud of African-American resilience and achievement, and resented the extent to which many ostensible white allies, including the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, portrayed black culture as pathological.

At the extremes this suspicion of assimilation led to black separatism, nationalism, hatred, and violence. But it need not, and the problem of reconciling inclusion into the opportunities of mainstream white America, without abandoning black culture and identity was (and is) persistent.

We are social and mimetic beings whose identities form in response to those around us. Cultural identities developed over generations are persistent, and the end of legal segregation could not create a racial year zero. America had created distinct racial cultures living side by side, and the identities they produced were at least as strong as those based on factors such as class and religion. Was this diversity, or aspects of it, worth preserving and promoting? Some thought so, even if they opposed the legal repression that had created it.

Diverse Views on ‘Diversity’

After exploring these themes, Walker argues that ideas of pluralism and diversity that originated with white Southern agrarians entered into law via Supreme Court Justice Powell, who saw diversity as “a bulwark against big government, a preservative of local particularity, and a guarantor of cultural innovation and growth.” This led Powell to repeatedly invoke “pluralism as a rationale for tolerating lingering inequality.”

Legal segregation had ended, and he believed that government should not exceed its constitutional limits (as he saw them) in attempting to rectify and recompense all of its wrongs. Heavy-handed attempts to ensure equality would likely fail, and the uniformity they sought would destroy the pluralism of American in the process.

This understanding of pluralism was, Walker claims, the basis for Powell’s ruling in the Bakke decision that it was unconstitutional to use racially discriminatory quota systems to try to compensate for past racial discrimination, but permissible for race to be considered as a factor for purposes of diversity in education. Government had to be limited in attempts to produce equality, but schools might reasonably desire a diverse student body as part of their educational mission, and therefore legitimately seek to include students of different backgrounds, income levels, races, and so on. This pluralist justification for taking race into account has been seized upon, and often mutated, by those wishing to use racial preferences to remedy racial injustice.

In contrast, Justice Clarence Thomas has been critical of Powell’s approach and its progeny. Walker explains that this is because Thomas believes that black students selected for diversity rather than grades will “find themselves behind academically yet also on display so that white students and white institutions could feel better about themselves.”

In contrast to this “diversity” that treats minority students as education enhancers for white students, Thomas has been a defender of institutional diversity, including historically black colleges. Pluralism, in his view, is more than a variety of skin tones at every school. Rather, it requires that single-sex colleges, historically black colleges, religious schools, etc. should all be free to fulfill what they see as their distinct missions.

Although this book might have benefited from more jurisprudential analysis, it is nonetheless a valuable contribution to our understanding of diversity, identity, and jurisprudence. For instance, the complications of identity and diversity Walker identifies may be seen in the difficulties of higher education, where diversity has been embraced as indispensable, but is beset by contradictions in practice.

The rationale given for diversity in education is that it provides an enriching variety of perspectives and experiences. However, this is usually applied only to select traits, such as racial, sexual, and gender identities, while neglecting others, such as political diversity. Indeed, this approach to diversity celebrates punishing nonconformist groups and institutions that are seen as exclusionary, such as Christian student groups that require conformity to traditional Christian standards of sexual behavior.

For all of their talk of multiculturalism and diversity, our elites, including education leaders, tend to have a poor understanding of perspectives other than their own. The result is a tendency toward a multihued monoculture, which is illustrated by the drearily similar ads for most universities. This shallow diversity is perhaps why those who take identity seriously have lately tended toward identity politics that flirt with racial essentialism, as seen in attempts to treat art, culture, and philosophy as if they were racial property.

Resolving the Contradictions

To conservative critics, such diversity appears partisan and power-hungry rather than pluralist, encouraging a superficial diversity of appearance and sexual appetites while enforcing intellectual conformity. Unfortunately, while there is merit to this critique, conservatives have struggled to provide an alternative narrative that recognizes the history and intricacies of race and identity in America.

There is a tendency to be ahistorical about racial identity, or to indulge white resentment, both of which can be seen in the automatic complaints some on the Right make about any acknowledgement of black identity or culture. Criticism of the inanities and excesses of identity politics (especially on campuses) is not enough. A successful conservative account of pluralism will need to be historically conscious and cognizant of the variety of forms diversity can take.

Can the complexities, contradictions, and resentments of American racial identity be resolved, or at least ameliorated? Walker suggests at least one possibility, writing that “[Ralph] Ellison recommended a change in the ‘basis of society’ that would incorporate black culture into American identity and highlight it. ‘In Negro culture,’ he concluded, ‘there is much of value for America as a whole.’”

Rather than being abandoned during integration, black identity and heritage would become part of the larger American identity and narrative. Imperfectly, this has happened, aided by an increasingly multiracial society. For all the sturm und drang about race, tens of millions of Americans are living as friends and family with those of another race.

Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. often presented the civil rights movement as seeking the fulfillment of America’s promise. His inclusion in the pantheon of American heroes is an acknowledgment that he was right. The African-American cultural heritage is inescapably part of Western, and specifically American, culture. To abandon it would be to abandon part of the American heritage.

Finally, beyond the scope of Walker’s book, and outside the realm of courts, legislatures, and other government efforts and institutions, men and women of every color can find a common identity as children of God. But despite the indispensable contributions of clergy and congregations to the civil rights movement, this promise is too little fulfilled in American churches. Recently, The New York Times reported that some black congregants are leaving majority-white evangelical churches, potentially reversing evangelical efforts toward racial reconciliation and integration.

For Christians, the divisions of the church are a reminder of the legacy of sin and our need for forgiveness. It is only grace that makes us whole. The vision of heaven in which members of every tribe, tongue and nation unite around God’s throne does not abolish pluralism, but provides a unity within it, confirming our identity as children of God and dear brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus.

"Ta-Nehisi Coates Writes An Incoherent, Divisive Attack On Kanye West","In The Atlantic, which is famous for being of “no party or clique,” Ta-Nehisi Coates has pronounced judgment on Kanye West’s recent pro-Donald Trump comments. Coates is not a fan of Kanye’s new embrace of Trump and “free thought,” whatever Yeezy means by that. And it was inevitable that the nation’s leading black intellectual would have to address the nation’s leading black musician for seeming to leave the progressive reservation.

In Coates’ attack on Kanye (or maybe it’s more a plea for him to return to his roots), one line stood out: “Kurt Cobain’s death was a great tragedy for his legions of fans, Tupac’s was a tragedy for an entire people.” Coates tries to establish this as a vital distinction.

First of all, I’m sure Coates knows black Americans better than I do, but was Tupac’s death really a tragedy for an “entire people”? Might there have been some black people not particularly invested in Tupac? I don’t know, and I stipulate Coates knows better, but it struck me as odd.

The second reason it raised my pique is much more important. One of the central themes of civil rights work for a hundred years has been that black people carry a burden of representation that white people do not, and that it’s not fair. Black people are a credit to their race, or they aren’t, while white people have not borne this burden of representation. They are just themselves.

By treating Tupac’s death as an event, unlike Cobain’s, that affected black people universally, Coates is suggesting that Kanye’s supposed betrayal of black people is particularly bad. Coates argues Kanye has a responsibility to carry the burden of representation. Kanye is not just Kanye. He is black Kanye in a way that Cobain was never white Cobain.

But why didn’t Cobain represent white people? Shouldn’t Cobain, the opioid-abusing suicide victim, have told white people something as important and universal to the white experience, its despair and loneliness, as Tupac’s violent death told black people about the black experience? Why is Kanye responsible for the entire black diaspora while Cobain is only responsible for guys in flannel? And who is making this distinction? Frankly, Coates is.

Whiteness Is a Weird Disease

Coates begins his article by talking about Michael Jackson, a figure he describes as at one time being a “Black God” who chose to become white. It’s the central theme of essay, and it’s strange and uncomfortable. Coates firmly believes Jackson was attempting to become more white, something Jackson denied, claiming he had a skin disease that made him lighter.

Whatever the truth may be, Coates lays out a litany of the weakness and awfulness of whiteness, as follows: “you could see the dying all over his face, the decaying, the thinning, that he was disappearing into something white, desiccating into something white, erasing himself, so that we would forget that he had once been Africa beautiful and Africa brown, and we would forget his pharaoh’s nose, forget his vast eyes.”

Desiccating into something white. Jeez. As someone who was born desiccated into something white without the option of being Africa beautiful (notwithstanding Rachel Dolezal’s attempt), this phrasing raises my eyebrows a little bit. It’s not so much because whiteness is being run down. That’s fine, and is perhaps the price of supposed hegemonic power. But it’s rather because it suggests Kanye is being invited into the club. Who is Coates to declare that Kanye is becoming white? All due respect, but isn’t that our call? Who made Coates the arbiter of whiteness?

This brings us back to Jackson. Was the master of the moonwalk ashamed of his dark skin, anxious to gain acceptance to white society, in fact trying to make himself white? He said no. Coates says yes. When David Bowie and Kiss transformed their physical appearances in furtherance of their art, there was no cultural uproar. This is just what rock stars do.

Not so for Jackson because, like Kanye, he was asked to shoulder the black burden, to be the emissary and representative. The problem is that Jackson felt just as connected to his fans in Japan as to his black fans in America. Was that a betrayal? In Coates’ mind, it was. For Jackson’s millions, maybe billions, of fans across the globe, not so much.

Coates Does Not Want Peace and Reconciliation

I admire Coates much as he admires Kevin Williamson. I think he writes well. I enjoy his turns of phrase even when I find them at odds with the project of a united and healthy nation. But what Coates has never made clear to me, and maybe he doesn’t want to, is what a racially just America looks like. His beautiful prose about being oppressed moves me in the same way the works of my oppressed Irish ancestors do. But what is the solution?

West’s facile acceptance of Trumpism, to whatever extent he really is supporting Trump, is a threat to the black intelligentsia. I’m not thrilled with ideas like “slavery was a choice,” but I’m white, so who am I to say. Maybe what Kanye is doing is showing how demarcated our lives and lines are. Maybe Kanye should pay more attention to black people. Maybe blackness isn’t something I should involve myself in. Maybe I should just listen to the Pogues, support Irish independence, and ignore black issues.

We can have that world, the segregated world Coates believes we need, to let black people have the space to self-realize. Fine. Take the space, take the time, take the million-dollar Bed Stuy brownstone. But nobody is going to tell Kanye what to do. He’s the great artist, the muse. Like Michael Jackson, he creates for everyone, not just black people and white people ready to wear the hair shirt of shame. Imagine what Coates could achieve if he took the same approach.

Black Support For Trump Is Rising Into The Danger Zone For Democrats,"The latest YouGov/Economist poll (May 6-8), one of a few that comprehensively breaks down support by ethnicity, has some frightening news for the Democratic Party.

While President Trump’s approval holds steady among registered voters at 41 percent, his support among blacks in this poll is striking. If it holds for 2020, it could be devastating for Democrats. Among African-Americans, 16 percent approve of Trump, 10 percent are not sure, and 75 percent disapprove.

While that sounds highly negative, these are high positives for a Republican politician among black Americans. Approval of 16 percent is 8 points higher than the 8 percent of black voter support Trump received on election day 2016, and 9 points higher than the black vote Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney received in 2012. The “Not Sure” at 10 percent is staggering, and the 75 percent “disapprove” rating is consistent with the low 70 percent aggregate found in any YouGov poll among this demographic.

The same poll, with their rounding, reported in January that Trump approval was at 10 percent among black Americans, 15 percent were not sure, and 74 percent disapproved, so the numbers are not only steady but improving in Trump’s favor.

This result may actually be underreporting Trump’s black support, as this records “all voters,” which consistently has lower figures for Trump in all categories, as opposed to registered voters. YouGov/Economist gives Trump a 40 percent “All voters” approval rating four points lower than their registered voters findings (RealClearPolitics favors the registered voters results across the polling companies it reports).

It’s Not Just One Poll, Either

Of course, one polling company’s report could be a fluke. Some firms use different methodology, and some don’t break down approval ratings by ethnicity, but the bigger picture is clear.

Marist’s March 19-21 approval for Trump among black Americans was 6 percent; 17 percent were unsure, and 77 percent disapproved. The Quinnipiac poll, which is consistently negative to Trump, on March 21 found black approval at 11 percent, “Don’t Know” at 4 percent, and disapproval at 84 percent. Taken in the aggregate, the three polls have Trump’s approval at 11 percent, at 12 percent for not sure or don’t know, and disapproval at 77 percent. Again, while the negatives are high, the positives are higher than is typical for Republicans, and if black Americans vote in accord with these approval ratings it would be easily enough to tip a tight election.

The threat to the Democratic Party is obvious based on these results and their upward trend for Trump. If Trump could win Pennsylvania despite a turnout for Hillary in Philadelphia that was only three points less than President Obama received in 2012 and “The best turnout without Obama on the ballot I’ve ever seen,” then any further bleeding of black support in that state could ensure Trump’s re-election, even if he lost Florida but kept his rust belt wins. If the current support level holds and turns into actual support (or anywhere near it), then Democrats are in profound trouble—possibly even for the midterms.

In Michigan and Wisconsin, Hillary underperformed Obama with blacks. Trump’s margin in Ohio was so high that any further slippage among blacks would lead to landslide territory.

What Accounts for This Apparent Trend?

What might be the reason for this apparent trend to Trump among black voters? Clearly the Van Jones election night “this is a whitelash” scaremongering rant has seen that apocalyptic vision evaporate. That Trump, a New York City social liberal, would somehow be a vehicle for the Klu Klux Klan and white supremacy was and is ludicrous, and the passage of time has confirmed this.

The Left giving up on this messaging is more facing a failed smear than any credit due for common decency. If blacks who voted for Trump see their support not eroded by such scaremongering, the 8 percent level might solidify into a new base, especially if black icons like Kanye West continue to courageously defy political stereotyping about African-Americans.

Given the 2016 results, that might be enough to ensure good numbers for Trump among African-Americans in his next bout at the polls, but there may be much worse news for Democrats. There are three key dates from the official black unemployment figures: in February 2010, the height of the financial crisis, black unemployment was 16.8 percent; in February 2016, it was 8.7 percent; and in February 2018 it was 6.9 percent. The last figure is the lowest since records were kept.

Certainly the lower trend began under the Obama administration, but the economy is far enough along in the Trump administration to ascribe the remarkable level of employment to Trump’s policies. This indisputable fact has led to this spin: “Yes, black unemployment is low, but blacks value more than just work opportunities.”

Due to economic considerations in 2016, and in the absence of overt racism from Trump’s administration, a chunk of black voters seems to have hesitatingly moved to Trump and his promise of jobs. Their “try it and see” or, as Trump put it, “What have you got to lose,” has been well rewarded so far.

If black support for Trump gets into double figures, the Democratic Party will have to look for different themes than Russia or Stormy Daniels and other such nonsense. Their failure to present an economic focus in 2016 contributed greatly to Hillary’s loss. To do so again, especially with black voters, could end in utter disaster.

More Details About This Trend

The complete selected monthly figures below from the YouGov/Economist poll over time confirm the aggregate support for Trump at around 14 percent, well above the 8 percent he garnered on election day. The combined “Favorable/Don’t Know” aggregate of 26 percent allows for further growth in his support among black voters.

Trump was at 17 percent favorability at the commencement of polling, which collapsed to 5 percent in the aftermath of the Charlottesville violence and Trump’s subsequent comments. As the memory has receded, nothing further of that sort happened, and job prospects are rising, polling shows blacks are once again moving to Trump. If you strip out the two “Charlottesville months,” the 16 percent approval looks more a bonfire than a beacon.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/11/black-support-trump-rising-danger-zone-democrats/,2018-05-11
6 Ways To Help Women When Abortion Is Finally Outlawed,"Western civilization is at a tipping point over the value of human life. Protesters in Ireland are screaming “Hoes need abortions” as citizens debate whether to repeal their Eighth Amendment that secures a right to life.

Meanwhile, Mississippi passed the United States’ toughest restriction on abortion, a ban of abortion past 15 weeks with minimal exceptions. A judge temporarily blocked it, since it violates court precedent protecting abortion before a baby’s viability outside the womb.

At the same time, a Republican Congress keeps failing to defund abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, possibly prompting President Trump’s reinstatement of a Reagan rule prohibiting federal funds for women’s centers located with abortion facilities.

The final end to abortion in America probably won’t come all at once. When Roe v. Wade is finally overturned, the matter will be left to the states. Some states will ban the practice, and more will follow suit. But many pro-lifers believe we will end state sponsorship of the death culture.

Regardless of how many states ban abortion or how long it takes, it’s important to address concerns about how women, especially women in desperate circumstances, can be supported when abortion is no longer a legal option.

1. Improve Reproductive Education

There’s no getting around it. Where legal abortion access is restricted, demand for illegal abortions increases. According to research by the Guttmacher Institute, the state with the highest number of searches related to DIY abortions was Mississippi, where only one legal abortion facility exists.

This is not a reason to keep abortion clinics open, however. It’s a pressing reason to educate women on the dangers of trying to kill their preborn babies themselves, or by the hands of unlicensed and unaccountable abortionists.

Reproductive education should include a thorough examination of the consequences of abortions, both DIY and “back-alley.” DIY abortions are extremely dangerous. They can kill you, put you in the hospital, or leave you infertile.

The World Health Organization estimates 22 million “unsafe” abortions happen annually across the world, leading 47,000 women to death and 5 million to disabilities over the past two decades. An “unsafe” abortion is “carried out either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.” WHO estimates that 20-30 percent of unsafe abortions cause infection of the reproductive tract, and one in four women who’ve undergone an unsafe abortion will develop temporary or lifelong disabilities.

Since back-alley abortionists operate outside the law, they don’t adhere to health codes. There are no consequences if the mother dies on the table, as long as practitioners aren’t caught by law enforcement.

Reading descriptions of the horrid conditions of abortionist Kermit Gosnell’s facility should give you an idea of the danger a woman would put herself in by entering a black market abortion mill. According to a grand jury report, “The medical practice by which he [Gosnell] carried out this business was a filthy fraud in which he overdosed his patients with dangerous drugs, spread venereal disease among them with infected instruments, perforated their wombs and bowels – and, on at least two occasions, caused their deaths.”

Gosnell’s clinic was licensed, and many reports were made to the Department of Health about his facility. Complaints about unsanitary, unsafe practices have been made against many other legal abortion facilities, and they often skirt consequences for years at the expense of their clients. If this is the status quo for legal clinics, imagine what black market operations will look like.

Again, because illegal abortions will be the only kind (save in cases where the mother’s safety is threatened), demand for illegal abortions will increase, and therefore the number of women back alley practitioners could prey upon. Gosnell was at a deeper level, but plenty of people are willing to exploit and kill for profit, both legally and illegally.

Women must be equipped with the truth if they and their babies are to stay safe: about what unsafe abortions can do to them, and to the lives within them. Both young women and men should be educated on babies’ development in the womb. When can heartbeats be detected? Do middle schoolers and high schoolers know it’s as early as six weeks? Do they know that tiny babies at this age already have eyelids? Do they know they’ve developed arms and legs in week 9, and teeth and nails at week 12?

Children deserve the truth. Early fetuses aren’t globs of undifferentiated cells or tumor-like masses. They’re unique human beings, with their own unique DNA. Abortion ends a human life. We don’t lie to our young people about the evils of slavery, and we shouldn’t lie to them about this.

It’s also important that young women hear from women who regret their abortions, and to hear how many women regret or felt they had negative outcomes from abortions. Fully half of women who volunteered survey data at a pregnancy resource clinic (out of 987 respondents) said they took prescription medications for mental health issues after their abortion. Nearly a third (32 percent) said there were absolutely no positive outcomes.

In The Federalist, A.D.P. Efferson highlighted one woman’s response: “None, there are no positives. My life is no better, it is much worse. I carry the pain of a child lost forever… I would rather have been a single mother of two and have my baby here.” Respondents also registered rates between 9-14 percent for depression, guilt, self-hatred, shame, addiction, and regret.

2. Encourage Adoption, Especially Cross-Racial

Adoption is the most widely used talking point on abortion, and for good reason. If a mother truly is not in a position to care for her child, and neither is her family, then adoption is her only answer.

While plenty of agencies connect prospective parents with mothers, we must prepare to address the race disparity in adoption. Black babies are “harder to place” than white babies. They make up 21 percent of all adoptions, 62 percent higher than the percentage of blacks in America (13.1 percent). The latest data reveals black women have 391 abortions per 1,000 live births and black abortions make up 36 percent of all U.S. abortions.

When abortion is finally outlawed on the state level, adoption agencies will see an increase in black babies up for adoption, since not all women will be able to afford to travel out of state for an abortion (and many more will be waitlisted due to restricted abortion supply, which will probably mean some women can’t get the procedure before the gestational cutoff age).

In Ohio, probably the most likely state to ban abortion outside states with “trigger laws,” which already outlaw abortion in the event Roe is overturned, black abortions make up 40 percent of total abortions, although black Americans are only 14.2 percent of the population. In Louisiana, which has a trigger law, they make up 60 percent of the state’s abortions, though blacks account for 32 percent of the population.

Many women who abort do so under the pretense that, for whatever reason, their babies wouldn’t be loved and deserve better than their mothers can offer. Those women need to trust that their babies will find good homes. Are enough prospective parents willing to adopt children of a different race?

The disparity in adoption fees between black babies and white babies indicate that’s not the case. If every baby is to be placed in a loving home, we need to encourage biracial families. Pop culture can have a strong influence in how people perceive biracial families (think “This is Us”), but if racially divisive politics and far-left ideas of segregation gain traction, we won’t be able to fulfill the goal of “every child a wanted child.”

3. Support Pregnancy Centers and Other Pro-Life Ministries

More than 4,000 pregnancy resource centers operate nationwide. We should expect demand for their services to explode post-Roe, so one practical way to help pregnant women in challenging situations is to donate or volunteer at one. Business owners can offer free advertising or partner with them for fundraising or supply drives. You can get also get involved through your congregation; churches frequently do fundraising for local PRCs.

Through Care-Net, one of the nation’s largest PRC networks, 948,780 ultrasound scans have been provided at no cost to the mothers, more than 1 million clients received parenting support and education, more than 1.5 million people received material resources, and 2.5 million no-cost pregnancy tests were administered. Do these services help women choose life? Care-Net claims it saved 71,497 preborn babies in 2016 alone, and the impact of PRC work will only increase in a post-Roe culture.

You can also support ministries dedicated to educating and persuading women. The Radiance Foundation produces high-quality messaging, and End Abortion Now has a record of turning women away from abortion by bringing them the gospel and the truth about abortion.

4. Support Fatherhood

Some partners cruelly pressure women into abortions. Such evil cannot go unpunished. Other fathers are left out of the decision entirely, though, perhaps because women have been inculcated with the idea that “reproductive rights” belong to them alone.

What if fathers were asked to step up as parents and providers, instead of being written off as unqualified sperm donors?

But what if fathers were asked to step up as parents and providers, instead of being written off as unqualified sperm donors? What if our culture demanded it? It’s hard to be a single mother at any income level, but abortion-seekers are disproportionately poor (half are below the federal poverty line). Is it any wonder half of women cite not wanting to be a single parent as a reason for their abortion?

Almost half of women who abort are living with a partner (45 percent). To be sure, many of those fathers aren’t up the task, but some are. Having a child to care for is the most sobering responsibility of adulthood. Its psychological impact cannot be fully realized until that child becomes a reality to the parent.

Millions of fathers have been robbed of this opportunity since Roe, and our welfare system has enabled this by disincentivizing marriage and fatherhood obligations. That system is perpetuating poverty and fatherlessness, putting more women at risk of choosing abortion.

Instead of affirming mothers’ unilateral decisions by default, we should encourage fathers’ involvement (including marriage), reforming welfare policy and offering more robust community support to fathers who want to get on the straight and narrow for their children’s sake. It’s only fair to the father, the woman with whom he’s created a child, and their child.

5. Criminal Consequences for Illegal Abortionists

Almost all prolifers and moderate pro-choicers agree virtue-signaling isn’t enough. It’s not enough to simply make abortion illegal: we want to see fewer abortions.

Advocates of legal abortion often argue that banning abortion doesn’t end abortion, it simply makes all abortions illegal, and therefore more dangerous. But their arguments fail to take deterrence into account. We cannot drastically reduce the abortion rate by only going after the supply (abortionists); we have to reduce demand.

That’s why education about preborn life is so important. Those facts have helped tremendously in reducing the abortion rate over the past 20 years, but not enough. Prosecuting women who willfully extinguish the human life within them is not only just, it’s necessary for deterrence. The consequences of illegal abortion must be painstakingly clear: risk lethal infection, infertility, or a very long prison sentence.

Tough as it is to swallow, harsh penalties for abortion are one of the best things we can institute for the welfare of women and the preborn. Not only does abortion produce death in every circumstance, but as previously stated, abortion yields negative mental, spiritual, and physical outcomes for women. We can’t skirt the fact that if we refuse to seek justice on behalf of the murdered, we don’t really value all human life.

6. Value Life and Celebrate It

A real culture of life is comprehensive and consistent: it values human life from womb to tomb, from the preborn to the dying and disabled. Utilitarianism and “quality of life” arguments are the same from abortion to assisted suicide: they deny the inherent dignity and sanctity of human life and the fact that it is not ours to take. If we concede on any one of these fronts, we lose the fight on the others.

The support and esteem of women who give birth to and raise children with special needs should therefore be of utmost concern, and the support of terminal relatives and their caretakers (family or others). To view a child or any relative as a “burden” lays on them a guilt they should not have to carry. It not only pressures parents to consider illegal abortion, but risks a policy backslide that would open the door once again to legalize the act.

To view a child or any relative as a ‘burden’ lays on them a guilt they should not have to carry.

Although comparatively minor, we must also oppose our culture’s fecundophobia. Caring for children is an awesome responsibility, and kids aren’t to be dreaded. We should embrace the value of big families and the prudence of starting childbearing in one’s twenties, what second-wave feminists consider critical career-building years.

Babies are a joy, so make a fuss over their entrance into the world. Throw elaborate baby showers. Gift a maternity photo shoot, a new baby shoot, or a cute maternity swimsuit or dress to a struggling mom. Take a pregnant mom out for ice cream or a pedicure. Invite friends with children into your home.

Provide ongoing support after the baby is born. Drop off some diapers or offer to drive to well-baby visits. Help moms connect with other mothers through church or organizations like MOPS, which even has a group for teen moms. Offer to watch kids so their parents can have an evening out (59 percent of women seeking abortion have already given birth).

A pro-family culture makes the hard times with children a little less hard, and it could make choosing death even more unthinkable.

Although one can’t draw a causal relationship between generous parental leave policies and lower abortion rates, we should also encourage baby-friendly and mother-friendly policies in the workplace, including paid maternity and paternity leave and flex-work or work-from-home options. Both parents need time to bond with their newborns and mothers need time for their bodies to heal.

All the little things add up to a culture that’s not only comfortable with children, but welcomes them gladly. A pro-family culture makes the hard times with children a little less hard, and it could make choosing death even more unthinkable.

We need pro-life education, vigorous prosecution and sentencing, and support for adoption, for fathers, and for prolife organizations. No matter what the courts rule, abortion bans will never survive the onslaught of pro-abortion advocacy if we don’t foster a culture that cherishes human life in all its forms and stages.

Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘Epiphanies’ And ‘Black Market’,"This is the fifteenth in a series of “Battlestar Galactica” recaps. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the franchise. Read the last piece, “Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘Resurrection Ship’ (Parts 1 And 2)” here.

Spoilers ahead.

Perhaps it was inevitable that the tightly-scripted Pegasus storyline would be followed by two of the weaker episodes of the series. In “Epiphanies,” the writers save Pres. Roslin. It’s easy to understand why: the show would be fundamentally different without her. But it is a sign the writers lacked the long-range vision the mini-series and Season One suggested.

“Black Market” is even weaker. The writers did not think through the economics upon which the plot is based; the introduction of child trafficking feels like a ham-fisted way of addressing the underlying script problems.

Nevertheless, the series is driven by its characters and we learn more about Roslin and Apollo via flashbacks. We also learn the cerebral Baltar is often reactive and emotional. He is driven by fear of the power he craves, as well as anger at Roslin’s opinion of him.

‘Epiphanies’

Roslin is rushed to the sick bay, entering the final stages of her cancer. She flashes back to the day she was diagnosed. After receiving the news, she dips her foot in a fountain in a Caprica City plaza. She also recalls something inconsequential to her at the time: Baltar kissing Six in this plaza. Most of the episode, however, is catching up in a more recent flashback.

Roslin meets with Cdr. Adama and Baltar to discuss Dr. Cottle’s discovery of abnormalities in the blood of Boomer’s unborn child by Helo. Although circumstances make Roslin more pro-life about humans, she orders the termination of Boomer’s pregnancy for security reasons.

Baltar (who believes the child is figuratively his) unsuccessfully lobbies Adama to push back against Roslin. Baltar’s mental Six warns he may need the nuclear warhead he obtained from Adama as leverage to save their child. Adama delivers the bad news to Helo.

Meanwhile, the crew discovers the Vipers’ ammunition has been sabotaged. Adama orders Apollo to investigate. Apollo and Starbuck find the saboteur in the fleet’s ammo facility; she is a member of a pacifist group named Demand Peace. Adama agrees to meet with Jahee (Paul Perri), a Demand Peace representative, then jails him. This contrasts with Roslin’s flashback to her decision to negotiate with a striking teacher’s union, despite incidents of violence. Searching the saboteur’s possessions, Apollo learns the fleet’s Tylium fuel refinery is another target. The refinery dock explodes before his Raptor reaches it.

Baltar, as Vice-President, receives a briefing from Billy in anticipation of Roslin’s death. Baltar feels the weight of his looming responsibilities and pockets the letter Roslin has written him (echoing a tradition of American presidents). The briefing is interrupted by a call for Baltar to visit Cloud Nine. He meets with the fugitive Six, who has become a Demand Peace leader. He tries to kiss her, but she knocks him down, saying she’s not ready for that after her abuse on Pegasus. She proposes that he turn on Adama; he replies he will not be responsible for destroying humanity.

Roslin’s flashback further reveals she was in a relationship with Pres. Adar, who is upset she brokered a deal with the teachers’ union, feeling it sets a bad precedent. He seeks her resignation; she refuses, telling him to prepare for a fight when she returns from the decommissioning of Galactica.

Helo gives Boomer the news about their child. She attacks the guards, but is sedated and taken to the sick bay. A confrontation between Adama and Helo is diffused by Baltar, who has discovered the abnormalities of the unborn child’s blood destroy cancer. Baltar administers a transfusion over Cottle’s objection. Roslin’s vital signs begin to improve rapidly.

Following her miraculous recovery, Roslin visits Jahee in the brig, promising him a fair hearing, but only upon a promise the sabotage ends. Otherwise, she will authorize Adama to hunt the pacifists. Baltar reads Roslin’s letter. He learns she does not view the man who saved her life as compassionate. Jahee meets with the fugitive Six, carrying the nuclear warhead he obtained from Baltar.

‘Black Market’

Following his near-death experience, Apollo pushes Dualla away and takes up with Shevon (Claudette Mink), a single mother and prostitute on Cloud Nine, who reminds him of “the one who got away” on Caprica. A rejuvenated Roslin meets with Adama, Baltar and Cdr. Fisk to announce a crackdown on the black market that has emerged as supplies have dwindled. Fisk is skeptical, but agrees to take the lead on the issue.

Shortly thereafter, Fisk is found dead, garotted in his quarters. Adama assigns the investigation to Apollo, who finds black market loot in Fisk’s quarters, from the cigars Baltar smokes to one of Ellen Tigh’s bracelets. Apollo is nearly garotted himself in Shevon’s quarters; Phelan (Bill Duke), a black marketeer, makes clear he knows who Apollo is and doesn’t care.

Roslin suggests Baltar resign as Vice-President (based partly on her memory of seeing him with Six on Caprica, though she does not mention it). The suggestion has the opposite effect on Baltar, who vows to remain in office.

When Apollo regains consciousness, Shevon and her daughter are missing and the man who tried to garotte him has a bullet in his skull. Tom Zarek appears and details Fisk’s operation for Apollo (while denying involvement). Zarek also notes that Phelan handed Fisk’s killer to Apollo to close the case. Undeterred, Apollo goes to Phelan’s ship, finding the black market extends to child trafficking, including Shevon’s daughter. Apollo confronts Phelan, who makes a case for the necessity and ubiquity of the black market, including the fact that he is Shevon’s pimp.

Apollo makes Phelan an offer to continue the black market, within limits excluding medicine and children. Phelan refuses, whereupon Apollo disarms one of Phelan’s goons and holds Phelan at gunpoint. Phelan believes Apollo is bluffing, but Apollo kills him and lays down the new terms to the goons.

Shevon rejects Apollo’s offer to come with him, explaining that she knows she can never be the woman he truly regrets losing. Apollo sells his deal to Roslin and Adama, who tells him later in private that he knew about Shevon. Apollo observes that Dualla has gone back to Billy.

How The Theory Of White Privilege Leads To Socialism,"In 1989, sociologist Peggy McIntosh penned a famous essay that propelled an ideological movement well beyond the ivory tower and into political discourse, pop culture commentary, and workplace seminars. It is now part of our modern lexicon.

“White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack” listed 50 examples of struggles white people don’t usually have, or perks of being the majority race, from being able to “see people of my race widely represented” in media to never being asked “to speak for all the people of my racial group.” These examples, according to McIntosh, are how “privilege” manifests.

Yet white privilege theory, even as McIntosh conceived of it nearly 30 years ago, is far from benign. The danger this essay poses is not in acknowledging that the 50 occurrences McIntosh mentions do happen and can frustrate the efforts of black Americans and lead to feelings of being in the “out-group,” but in the surrounding commentary. It lays the groundwork for how white privilege theory is supposed to change our thought processes and economic systems.

Acknowledging the 50 examples in themselves can help us be more charitable and sensitize us to the disadvantages blacks still often face, but that was only a small part of McIntosh’s goal. A closer look at the rest of the “knapsack” essay reveals a system of thought that, at best, runs counter to traditional Western ideas of individual justice and personal merit:

‘I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets that I can count on cashing in each day…’ ‘My schooling gave me no training in seeing myself as an oppressor, as an unfairly advantaged person.’ ‘The pressure to avoid [white privilege] is great, for in facing it I must give up the myth of meritocracy. If these things are true, this is not such a free country; one’s life is not what one makes it; many doors open for certain people through no virtues of their own.’ (emphasis mine)

McIntosh advocates for a “taxonomy of privilege” and sees many of her examples as indicative of “conferred dominance.” When she says she sees “unearned advantages” as a type of “oppression,” she’s employing the language of neo-Marxism.

What Is Neo-Marxism?

Briefly, neo-Marxism divides the world between oppressor and oppressed and identifies a system, or systems, by which the oppression takes place. In classical Marxism, the oppressed were the proletariat, the oppressors were the bourgeoisie, and the system of oppression was capitalism. The Marxist framework has been adapted to categorize and pit against each other various group identities, all toward the end of establishing socialism.

In gender, for instance, the oppressors are heterosexuals, the oppressed LGBTQ+, and the system of oppression is “heteronormativity.” In race, whites are oppressors, people of color the oppressed, and “white supremacy” is the system of oppression. In reading social justice literature, one quickly realizes “white supremacy” is the “conferred dominance” McIntosh refers to, which is sustained by a generally meritocratic system (capitalism).

As this celebration of Marx’s philosophy in the pages of The New York Times stated, “Racial and sexual oppression have been added to the dynamic of class exploitation. Social justice movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, owe something of an unspoken debt to Marx through their unapologetic targeting of the ‘eternal truths’ of our age. Such movements recognize, as did Marx, that the ideas that rule every society are those of its ruling class and that overturning those ideas is fundamental to true revolutionary progress.”

Neo-Marxists are asking for a fundamental shift in our frame of mind, and ultimately, society. McIntosh sees meritocracy as more than problematic. It’s actually a “myth,” because some “doors are open to certain people through no virtues of their own.”

The existence of “unearned” opportunities or wealth is seen as such a severe critique of our system it warrants a disbelief in an idea foundational to the American dream: that we can rise or fall based on our own hard work, talent, intelligence, or other individual merits. Put another way, McIntosh encourages us to reject the idea that outcome is primarily determined by individual inputs (like work ethic, cooperation, and intelligence) largely unaffiliated with race.

Capitalism Is Bad Because It’s About Merit

For some neo-Marxist thinkers, overthrowing capitalism is the only way to end racial oppression, as they see it. According to sociological theorist Edna Bonacich, “Capitalism is a system that breeds class oppression and national/racial conquest. The two forms of exploitation operate in tandem. They are part of the same system that creates inequality, impoverishment, and all the other host of social ills that result. I believe that you cannot attack racism without attacking capitalism, and you cannot attack capitalism without attacking racism. The two are Siamese twins, joined together from top to bottom.”

“We need to engage in struggle against [the government and capitalist class],” and push for changes to “deprive the ruling class of their power and privilege,” she declared.

Privilege theory has always been about destroying the idea of the meritocracy so socialism can be ushered in. Now, capitalism is not a perfect meritocracy—far from it. Privileges like growing up in a two-parent household, being able to attend a good school, or having social connections to access comfortable employment give some people advantages over others. Neo-Marxists perceive those advantages not just as inherently unfair, but as power used to oppress the less advantaged (disproportionately composed of minorities), and that means capitalism is incompatible with racial justice.

Discrimination and Privilege Are Now Inseparable

A critical step in promoting white privilege theory has been to change the definitions of discrimination and prejudice to fit neo-Marxist ideas about how resources are distributed, which promotes redistribution as a remedy for racial “oppression.” No longer is prejudice about individual negative behavior toward minorities, but passive participation in the “in-group” (in this case, the white majority).

In a write-up of an NPR interview with the creators of the Implicit Association Test, a highly popular although now-discredited attempt to probe hidden racism, sociologist Nancy DiTomaso told NPR, “Discrimination today is less about treating people from other groups badly, and more about giving preferential treatment to people who are part of our ‘in-groups.’” In essence, white people are “privileging” each other.

Mahzarin Banaji, co-creator of the IAT, said, “The insidious thing about favoritism is that it doesn’t feel icky in any way,” also noting that, “that kind of act of helping towards people with whom we have some shared group identity is really the modern way in which discrimination likely happens.”

“When we help someone from one of these in-groups, we don’t stop to ask: Whom are we not helping?” she explained. Banaji accepts the premise common to leftist strains of thought: the economy is a fixed pie and everyone gets a slice.

For instance, this Huffington Post article in defense of affirmative action reads, “Because wealth and property are finite and produced by labor — accumulation by some can only happen through disaccumulation of others.” According to this premise, by giving resources to one person, you are actually depriving someone else of those resources, instead of working cooperatively to create even more wealth that eventually positively affects many economic actors of a variety of races. Banaji says she isn’t recommending people “stop helping their friends,” but that we should distribute more of our resources to people outside our “in-group.”

The danger is in the erroneous belief that every time you help someone who looks like you, you are working against a person of color.

It is good and moral to give time, energy, and money toward helping the less fortunate. The danger is in the erroneous belief that every time you help someone who looks like you, you are working against a person of color.

The belief that helping your white friends and neighbors constitutes discrimination lays the groundwork for racial divisiveness and redistributive solutions based on the “fixed pie” model. Driving a wedge into that crack in logic is the emphasis WPT places on the “unearned advantages” of whites instead of the relative disadvantages of blacks.

This is not just potAYto-potAHto semantics. Instead of targeting policies and processes that put blacks at a disadvantage (i.e. individual bigotry, being excessively pulled over while driving, longer sentencing for black males) and gathering support for reforms that bring about more equality under the law, privilege theory is designed to instill whites with the idea that they didn’t earn what they have. While advocates for WPT often insist this isn’t about making whites “feel guilty,” the inevitable conclusion of a white person who accepts WPT is that they have gained what they have through an unfair system that “preferences” white people. They have what McIntosh calls “unearned power.”

As Bonacich put it, “we are caught up in the values of careerism and survival in the system,” and “in protecting ourselves, we become a part of the system of oppression, and thus accomplices to the crime.”

A properly convicted or “woke” white person will conclude he is guilty of participating in the unfair system, of playing on an unlevel playing field that other whites have distorted, not by deliberately excluding blacks, but by privileging other whites. Whether he walks around with his head hung low or vocally “confesses” his privilege is beside the point. Advocates of WPT have shifted the focus away from denouncing and disempowering racist behavior (as traditionally understood), to seeking to disempower whites as a class because as a group they are responsible for “oppressing” blacks.

If you sufficiently degrade the idea that our pseudo-capitalist generally rewards by merit (usually productivity), you degrade the idea that what we have is truly “earned.” The idea of unearned privilege therefore undermines support for the meritocracy.

This Undermines the Idea of Private Property

Ultimately, the idea of unearned privilege unwinds belief in private property, opening the door for Marxists to fashion policies that undermine property rights so resources can be redistributed. A belief in “unearned advantages,” leads to a disturbing question: if we cannot truly earn what we have because we’ve been given advantages, then does it really belong to us? Have we, in effect, taken out a mortgage for our success?

Eula Biss penned an essay for The New York Times arguing that white Americans have in fact taken out a “mortgage.” White guilt is white debt, she argues. We feel guilty because we haven’t paid it off.

We feel guilty not because we personally have behaved in a racist manner, but because we’ve indirectly benefited from this country’s history of very real oppression, though we have participated in none of it: slavery, Jim Crow laws, and racist housing policies chief among them. “I’m more compelled by a freedom that would allow me to deserve what I have. Call it liberation, maybe. If debt can be repaid incrementally, resulting eventually in ownership, perhaps so can guilt.”

President Obama reflected a similar sentiment during the 2012 campaign, though in the broader context of opposing tax cuts:

If you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something — there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.

His words reflect the Marxist ideology that you can’t take credit for what you own (Obama’s affiliations with Marxists throughout his career are well documented), because “somebody else made that happen.” White privilege theory is undergirded by the very same idea. WPT leads to white guilt, which leads to a belief that you don’t truly own what you have.

This is a dangerous road to take. We are already traveling down it via broader societal consensus on entitlements, which by definition entitle one American to another American’s money. Taxation is theft, but hardly anyone acknowledges this. Instead, there’s broad support for affluent citizens to “pay their fair share,” which indicates a belief that these citizens aren’t chiefly entitled to the fruits of their own labor, but someone else, someone poorer, has a greater claim to their wealth.

The more we redistribute, the more we come to think of someone else’s assets as being on loan from a larger pot of money meant to serve the collective. Undermining property rights through white privilege theory greases the hinges on the door to enforcing outcome equality via redistribution. This is not just a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. Privilege theory is already leading to more redistribution—not just of wealth, but of speech and opportunities like college admissions or job applications. Here are some examples of this.

Progressive Stacking

It should come as no surprise that white privilege and censorship, both gaining traction on college campuses, go hand in hand. Many advocates for WPT seek to redistribute speech through “progressive stacking.” Speaking slots are not assigned by who signs up to speak first. Rather, the “stack” is rearranged by “facilitators” so that “marginalized groups” are given better slots or more speaking time.

According to an Occupy Wall Street activist, “A progressive stack encourages women and traditionally marginalized groups to speak before men, especially white men…’Step up, step back’ was a common phrase of the first week, encouraging white men to acknowledge the privilege they have lived in their entire lives and to step back from continually speaking.” Last year, a University of Pennsylvania TA admitted she uses progressive stacking in her classroom.

The emphasis on white privilege in college campuses, together with animus toward pro-individual rights, pro-free market thinking, has even led student senators at the University of California at Berkeley to seriously suggest “reallocating all College Republicans funding to the Black Student Union,” on the basis that the College Republicans had violated “lead center rules during Free Speech week” last September (even though the event had been cancelled).

According to Campus Reform’s report, they did not cite any details about which rules they had violated. Such a blatant redistribution of funds based on race would not have occurred as a valid idea to these senators apart from the influence of privilege theory.

Affirmative Action

The idea of redistributing opportunities to remedy “systemic racism” reached the policy level decades ago in 1961, when President Kennedy started the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This was long before “white privilege” cascaded into the public consciousness, but it is justified as a remedy for it.

Although it is never billed as such, affirmative action is essentially a method of redistributing jobs or academic slots based on racial or gender quotas (in countries where it’s legal) or “targets” (meaning it is a goal to hire X many minorities, but not a “mandated outcome.”) While the Supreme Court has ruled against strict quotas in America, it has allowed universities to factor race into their admissions decisions.

To demonstrate how affirmative action artificially boosts minorities, thereby “redistributing” according to race, see this Princeton study, which attempted to quantify the weight given to race in college admissions.

Being African American instead of white is worth an average of 230 additional SAT points on a 1600-point scale, but recruited athletes reap an advantage equivalent to 200 SAT points. Other things equal, Hispanic applicants gain the equivalent of 185 points, which is only slightly more than the legacy advantage, which is worth 160 points. Coming from an Asian background, however, is comparable to the loss of 50 SAT points.

So while the authors noted that weights given to legacy students or athletes sometimes have a greater effect than weights for ethnicity, it is clear that with affirmative action, the individual scores of the applicant are secondary in importance to artificially equalized outcomes.

In cases where white candidates are more qualified on individual merits than minority candidates, yet minorities (apart from Asians) are given a “bump” because of race so they receive the position or admission instead of more qualified white candidates, this is a redistribution of opportunity. Opportunities are redistributed from white candidates to non-white candidates via a biased selection system.

Forty years ago, affirmative action was meant to “level the playing field” that had been tilted because of the racial injustices we had built into law. Today, it is about correcting for “white privilege” as much as “promoting diversity,” and it will only gain more traction as the theory gains more adherents.

Disparate Impact

The concept of “disparate impact” in government policy also serves to promote redistribution. I described the policy in an article in 2015:

Disparate impact is the idea that policies can have a disproportionate and adverse effect on minorities. For example, let’s say that a certain housing policy was not intended to cause racial disparities in types of housing and allows all people with equal qualifications an opportunity to live in a single family house. Despite its universal standards for applicants, if it nevertheless leads to white people aggregating in suburban neighborhoods made up of single family homes, and Hispanics and blacks aggregating in low income apartment housing, the theory goes that this ‘disparate impact’ can constitute racial discrimination.” The Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that disparate impact claims, which have been allowed under the Civil Rights Act, can now be brought under the Fair Housing Act. This means local governments are now liable for disparate impact claims, regardless of whether their policies were meant to discriminate against protected classes like race or age. The court affirmed HUD’s long-held interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, and effectively permits HUD to intervene in cases of “a facially neutral practice that has a discriminatory effect.

Essentially, plaintiffs can demand that housing be redistributed because non-equitable outcomes, although unintentional, can be legally viewed as “discriminatory.”

This is exactly what white privilege theory advocates asked for. The authors of a 2001 report titled “Persistence of White Privilege and Institutional Racism,” compiled by the Transnational Racial Justice Initiative, argues that the focus “on intention versus injury is clearly designed to protect white privilege and make challenges to this system prohibitive.” The report points to federal housing policy as a specific example of how white privilege creates “injustice.” It calls for exactly what the Supreme Court has recently ruled: that disparate effects should be treated as discrimination.

Plaintiffs can demand that housing be redistributed because non-equitable outcomes, although unintentional, can be legally viewed as ‘discriminatory.’

This idea is closely associated with Banaji’s sentiments that “discrimination” is about preferencing your in-group rather than showing bigotry toward blacks because of their race. It’s not about motive, it’s about effect. The tendency of people to aggregate themselves and their resources around people similar to them must be corrected by “redistributing” housing (and even people holding affordable housing vouchers) among communities of varying densities of whiteness or blackness.

This is a very serious ruling, considering how strongly we are biologically and culturally pulled toward communities of our own ethnicity. Babies show a facial recognition bias toward their own race (or the race they interact with the most), and this bias continues into adulthood, especially if their own race makes up the majority of the people they interact with.

It isn’t likely this tendency will diminish outside radically rearranging family structures (discouraging monoracial parents, for instance), the ethnic compositions of classrooms, and the larger local community. If removing the wiring for in-group preference is politically untenable, progressives are left with simple outcome redistribution to remedy the problem, which they now have the power to do via claims brought under the Fair Housing Act.

In short, it is a remedy by diktat, using the force of the federal bureaucracy to reshape local policy toward more equitable racial outcomes. In fact, one of the goals of the AFFH (Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing) rule is to make every grant-recipient community reflect the racial proportions of the larger region in which they are found. HUD has therefore treated candidates for affordable housing as “ethnic units” to be redistributed toward this goal of racial proportion, and the SCOTUS ruling validates this goal.

It Is Unfair to Blame Groups for Individual Choices

There is a kernel of truth to the idea of white privilege as it is often understood by less ideological, casual observers: that white people generally have an easier time getting on in the world than black people do. But white privilege theory as originally conceived was never confined to simply acknowledging that the average white person doesn’t face the same disadvantages as the average black person (if we can speak of “average” at all, given that every individual is unique) and encouraging cultural sensitivity and justice for victims of racism.

White privilege theory seeks equality of outcome, not merely the equal dispensation of individual justice.

It was always couched in neo-Marxism, identifying whites as oppressors and blacks as the oppressed, placing blame on the entire white “class,” regardless of its members’ individual behavior or circumstance, for perpetuating a system that produces disparate outcomes on the aggregate between whites and blacks. To acknowledge white privilege in the way McIntosh did, the way “social justice warriors” and left-leaning college professors do today, is to tacitly accept the oppressor/oppressed framework. To promote true white privilege theory is to advocate for the dismantling of the system of oppression: capitalism.

While hardly anyone outside self-professed socialists would acknowledge this is what is happening, we see the dismantling of meritocracy and individual rights all around us. White privilege theory seeks equality of outcome, not merely the equal dispensation of individual justice. That goal can only be reached by redistributionist policies that violate the principle of local governance, treat people as ethnic “units,” limit individuals’ opportunities based on race, suppress freedom of speech, and restrict the freedom to keep and control one’s own money.

Although forfeit of property is generally confined to money (via taxation) and we deem our other property “safe” from confiscation, the logical conclusion of white privilege theory is that we can never truly earn what we have, as long as we’ve been the beneficiaries of in-group preference, so our possessions do not really “belong” to us. Given other precedents by which government tells us what we can and cannot do with our property, this fundamental rejection of property rights, in the minds of enough bureaucrats and judges, would further imperil their justification under law.

To accept white privilege theory as the Left promotes it is to accelerate our journey down the road to socialism.

We would do well to acknowledge the disadvantages African Americans and other minorities face, and to work to mitigate those disadvantages. We should be less prone to leaning on stereotypes, for example, and more generous with our individual resources in helping the marginalized, particularly people who have been tangibly victimized. But to accept white privilege theory as the Left promotes it is to accelerate our journey down the road to socialism. As Walter E. Williams wrote, “Which way are we headed tiny steps at a time – toward greater liberty or toward more government control over our lives?”

Those who wave off the warnings of Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Haidt, and others who warn about the infiltration of Marxist thought in higher education may not fully grasp how dangerous this ideology is. Communism, its ideological spawn, has led to the deaths of nearly 100 million people in the last century. Collectivist ideologies nearly conquered the globe.

Instead of tacitly accepting the theories that trickle out of the universities, we should critically examine and compare them to the ideas that gave rise to the human flourishing of the West— individual liberty and natural rights—to see if they are compatible. In the case of white privilege theory, it clearly is not.

"Study Finds Marriage, Church Attendance Improve Black Men's Success","Marriage, church attendance, and military service helped black men be more successful in life, finds a new study. So do more “conventional” factors like education, work status, and minimal contact with law enforcement.

Scholars Ronald Mincy, Wendy Wang, and W. Bradford Wilcox studied what factors promote economic success for black men. The cohort study, which traced the lives black men born from 1957 to 1964, measured which income bracket the men were in by the time they were 50 years-old. The study was sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for Family Studies.

Its results are intuitive but still important. They include the following:

70 percent of married black men are in the middle class or higher, compared to only 20 percent of never-married black men or 44 percent of divorced black men.

52 percent of middle or upper-class black men attend religious services multiple times a month.

54 percent of black men with military experience entered the middle or upper income bracket.

Lastly, black men who had a “sense of agency,” the belief that they could control their success, were more likely to become middle or upper class.

The panelists started their presentation by saying that they did not want to diminish the presence of structural racism, especially regarding mass incarceration and police brutality. In fact, the study showed that law enforcement confrontations seriously hurt black men’s chances of rising to the middle or upper class. However, the authors said they wanted to push back on the “understandable racial pessimism” in America with hopeful statistics.

Wilcox cited the great increase of the percentage of black men who are middle class and the halving of the percentage of black men who are in poverty.

“Many African-Americans think that poverty and incarceration are endemic to black men. However, most black men will marry, work, and not be arrested,” said Wilcox.

The study spends a lot of time discussing the merits of church attendance, marriage, military service, and sense of agency as important factors to economic success. It states that it focuses on these factors partly because they receive less consideration today.

More than half of black men in the upper two-thirds of the income bracket have married once and attend religious services multiple times a month. These factors point to success largely because they encourage stability in work and education and reduce run-ins with law enforcement.

Church attendance instills a value system, the study notes. Marriage pushes men to provide for their family and work longer. Military service encourages hard work, duty, and perseverance. The military also has a strong culture of marriage because it does not offer benefits to cohabiting sex partners.

Mincey made suggestions for policy after reporting the findings of the study. He urged the government to improve early childhood education, reform the criminal justice system, and bring the U.S. military model to other institutions. He also pushed for the black church to reach out to young black men and for parents to stress marriage before having children.

After the researchers reported on their study, a different panel discussed the results. The panel included Bradley Hardy, a professor of economics at American University, Michelle Singletary, a financial columnist for the Washington Post, and Ian Rowe, the CEO of Public Prep, a public charter school. Singletary opened the panel by joking that one of her followers had tweeted at her, “I feel like this is a pretty obvious thing.”

She replied that this data reaffirms what those who work in American communities already know. As a volunteer in her church and in prisons, she has seen what happens when people lose these values. Singletary noted she applies these principles in her family by making sure her kids to go to church, even after they’ve left the house.

Rowe said that he looked for ways to bring value-driven parenting to Public Prep students who may not have that. Public Prep serves more than 2,000 kids in the south Bronx and lower east Manhattan in tuition-free, single-sex schools that stress college readiness. The schools operate on a lottery system; in one with 200 spots, more than 4,500 families applied.

He said that often educators shy away from talking about topics like abstinence before marriage and going to church, but said it’s “irresponsible” for them to withhold this information from young black men looking to rise. Hardy agreed with his panel members but argued that future success is also connected with family income. Because income affects factors like marriage and sense of agency, he says there should be some safety net for young black men who didn’t enjoy those benefits.

The panel also stressed promoting internship and networking opportunities for black men and argued for creating places where young black Americans can fail safely and thus build resilience.

After opening the panel to questions, a man asked how this data might help ease racial tensions in America. Rowe responded that the life choices that hurt black people are the same life choices that hurt white people. He mentioned the high rates of out-of-wedlock births among white women under the age of 22. By encouraging factors like education, marriage, work, and church attendance, he argued that Americans can find unity.

Singletary added that America needs to do away with an “us versus them” mentality. She said that many white Americans felt disenfranchised before the election and looked to the wrong guy to help them up. She argued that both black and white Americans should see their respective success as collective rather than mutually exclusive.

“When we lift everybody, we all rise,” she closed.

"No, Pro-Lifers Aren’t Racists Who Only Want To Save White Babies","Thursday morning, progressive Christian writer Rachel Held Evans wrote a Twitter thread about the possibility that Roe v. Wade may be overturned once Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is replaced. Rather than make some kind of cogent-but-wrong progressive argument, she leapt straight to some completely unjustifiable insinuations about pro-life people.

Basically, in her now-deleted thread, she claimed that pro-life people’s opposition to abortion is based on a belief that most saved babies would be white, and that if we knew that the saved babies would be black, we would probably be pro-choice. While the thread is gone, this screencap is illustrative:

Rhetorically, the tweets sounded even-keeled, but they represent a phantasmagorical world. Unfortunately, rather than rebut her position with facts, some on Twitter apparently responded to Evans with threats and insults, which is what led her to delete her thread. The antidote to this kind of mob responsive is to show, in plain and non-inflammatory terms, why Evans’ aspersions of pro-life people are wrong.

We Know We’re Saving Minority Babies: That’s the Point

First of all, pro-life conservatives are very well aware abortions target non-white people more heavily. Vox, hardly a right-wing propaganda site, recently ran an entire expose on “Abortion as black genocide.” The tagline is, “A new documentary examines how fears of ‘black genocide’ became part of mainstream anti-abortion activism.”

Even a left-leaning site recognizes that explicit anti-racism is a key part of mainstream pro-life activism! However ferociously a site like Vox may favor abortion, even they are bound to a basic standard of journalistic honesty, and by that standard everyone must recognize that many, maybe even most, pro-life activists consider their activism to be explicitly anti-racist, and working to undo a horrible racial crime.

Far from showcasing white babies, to see that pro-life advocates have a central concern for uniquely targeted or vulnerable families, including racial minorities, all you need to do is to go to the website of your local pregnancy center. The pregnancy center that my wife and I support, on their “impact” page, shows children of several races.

Pro-life advertising isn’t more or less focused on white babies than any other form of advertising is, and very well may be even more focused on minority kids, because we recognize that the perverse combination of racially concentrated poverty and legalized abortion combine to enable extermination of a huge number of African American, Native American, and Hispanic children.

The Pro-Choice Movement Originated in Racist Eugenics

Even more importantly, Evans is trying to flip the script on history. The origins of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, are not mysterious. Margaret Sanger, who was instrumental in founding the “Birth Control League,” explicitly argued for using abortion and birth control to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. There’s no serious historic debate that the rise of reproductive technologies in the early twentieth century was closely tied to efforts to exterminate or control “undesirable” populations.

Most abortion activists today do not advocate for exterminating specific racial groups, thankfully. Modern activists believe themselves to be protecting women’s rights, not continuing the legacy of racial inequality begun with slavery and continued through the medical racism of Tuskegee in the mid-twentieth-century and Planned Parenthood today.

Yet if either side were to be expected to be unpleasantly surprised by more black and Hispanic babies being born, it’s clear which side that would be: the pro-choice side. The movement began with eugenics. While it has shed that baggage as far as race is concerned, it nonetheless continues to militate against childbearing generally.

Furthermore, the eugenicist project continues unabated with regards to disabled people. Countries like Iceland and Denmark brag about eliminating Down Syndrome: what they mean is that they have murdered all of the disabled children before they were born. The job Adolf Hitler couldn’t complete with Aktion T4, the abortion doctors of the (overwhelmingly white) Nordic countries are well on their way to achieving.

Even in the United States, aborting disabled children is extremely common. This is just good-old-fashioned eugenics, and it’s unapologetic. So, again, for Evans to imply that it’s pro-life people who are tacitly in favor of the eugenic reduction or extermination of a people group is absurd. We celebrate kids with disabilities. We center them in our rhetoric and vigorously assert their worthiness to live and their dignity. On the contrary, it’s pro-choicers who run op-eds in major newspapers celebrating the selective murder of disabled children.

Racism Is Definitely Not a One-Party Deal

More broadly, Evans’ point that conservatives are terrified of a non-white population boom is not correct. Sure, some “conservatives” wet their pants over having Hispanic neighbors. This kind of racism is very real and very awful. Also, you may notice that racial segregation is no better in very blue cities than in other places: practically speaking, there are racists of all political stripes.

For example: Washington, DC is about 95 percent Democratic. I live in a two-bedroom apartment less than a block from a metro stop with three lines at it. There’s a bikeshare on my corner. We have ample parking all the time, and trendy restaurants within 10 blocks. Indeed, one of DC’s most bustling new areas, H Street, is about a 15-minute walk away, or a few minutes on a bike.

Yet my rent is less than $1,500 a month. People just four or five blocks away pay twice that. The reason is simple: across the street is a majority-black high school. When they learn where I live, many otherwise progressive people have asked me, “Do you have problems with the…. Students? You know, the…. youths? Any problems? How about, um, crime? Is the… crime, you know, bad?”

It’s this wonderful coded language where the person can make an extremely racist assumption that having a lot of black kids across the street is dangerous, but never actually say racist words. If this were just a few people, then we could write it off. But I live in a mid-sized building where every unit is this cheap, and the neighboring apartments are similar. These prices are low because, in 95 percent Democratic DC, demand is low for these units.

Demand is not low due to bad parking or bad transit or a long commute or bad housing conditions: demand is low because a very large number of cocktail party DC progressives will pay $500 extra per month to not have black high schoolers walking through their alleyway on the way to school. Real, hardcore racism, the kind that divides our neighborhoods and schools and segregates black people into neighborhoods with little opportunity, turns out to be alive and well in America’s most progressive cities.

Demographic Angst Is Not Necessarily Racism

More to the point, an appreciable share of conservatives have recently begun to identify as “pro-natal,” meaning we favor higher national birth rates. Some of us also have explicitly called for vastly higher immigration rates, especially from Sub-Saharan Africa. Pro-natal conservatives are very aware, in excruciating detail, that higher birth rates would hasten the non-whitening of America. Guess what? That’s fine!

Is there demographic angst among some conservatives? Yes. I abhor the laments about “other people’s babies,” etc. We should celebrate life, and we should celebrate the growth of the nation. But it’s key to keep in mind that while a hard core of racist opposition to demographic change can be found among people registered in both parties, much of conservative opposition to demographic change is indirect.

Demographic change is a proxy for concerns about other cultural changes driven by partisanship.

Conservatives tend to believe (erroneously) that immigrants commit more crimes. We tend to believe (sometimes correctly, but usually wrongly) that immigrants present high risks of terrorism. We tend to believe (wrongly) that immigrants suppress wages. We tend to believe (rightly) that immigrants and minorities are overwhelmingly more likely to vote Democratic, even if they don’t support the radical cultural changes the Democratic Party supports. In other words, demographic change is a proxy for concerns about other cultural changes driven by partisanship.

I think conservative anti-immigrant sentiments are mostly unfounded, so I favor more immigration, but the main driver of conservative concerns about immigration, I think, is not “concern that the neighbor’s dinner will be rice instead of burgers,” but rather, “concern that the Democratic Party is diluting native votes with an extremely culturally dissimilar group, which may enable the Democratic Party to impose cultural norms that Republicans abhor.”

I get why some progressives would still find this view offensive (some people love to be offended), but it’s a far cry from the overt racism Evans imputes to conservatives. Crucially, it explains conservative behavior more accurately. It explains why Mexican immigration is opposed, but Cuban immigration isn’t.

It explains why conservatives who on Monday loudly and crudely fear being replaced by “other people’s babies” on Tuesday argue passionately for those babies to be born. It explains the conservative fixation on “immigrant quality” and “merit.” The fear is not, for most of us, about race, it is about partisanship, and an awareness that however personally conservative many immigrants may be, the Democrats they elect will not be.

Online Harassment Is Wrong and Not Representative

Before I conclude, however, I should note why Evans deleted her thread: harassment. Attacking a person with threats and ill-speaking is never convincing. More to the point, it has become unfortunately common in some strands of the American right. Indeed, the alt-right in particular engages in an enormous amount of online harassment. The problem is, with such an inflated online presence, they make their own idiosyncratic positions seem normative for conservatives. One person tweeted to me, observing the same trend I have:

https://twitter.com/MyronGaines1337/status/1012341450019753987

Indeed, whenever I write about fertility, abortion, and minorities, it only takes a little while for a half-dozen trolls and their gazillion sock-puppet accounts to show up and start tweeting about how, really, we should want fewer minority babies. While these people are big on Twitter and make it a hostile and inhospitable place, few conservatives want to abort a baby for being black. Nobody who calls themselves pro-life wants that.

Further, the few real, offline people who are so concerned about “demographic change” that they will tolerate the murder of the unborn should and must be exorcised from conservatism, drawn out like the poison they are. When you hate someone so much that you would murder the innocent child in her womb rather than let the child possibly join the other political party, you have revealed yourself to be a pants-wetting political coward who, rather than play the game, smashes the board like a petty child. To any such alt-right weirdos reading this: grow up.

The Pro-Life Movement Is About Justice

Pro-life people believe the unborn are people too and thus deserve justice. Their right to life should be honored. All abortions are tragic; none individually more so than others.

Go to a pro-life conference: you’ll find a lot of minority moms and disabled survivors.

Beyond the individual tragedy of a murdered babe, there is an additional national tragedy and injustice when the scourge of abortion especially ravages racial or ethnic groups who also face centuries-old racial discrimination and segregation. Pro-life activists are well aware of this additional tragedy.

Indeed, the black pro-life activists who call abortion a “black genocide” are particularly aware of this double tragedy. White activists in the pro-life movement have, imperfectly of course, tried to step aside and make space for groups especially targeted by abortion to tell their stories. Go to a pro-life conference: you’ll find a lot of minority moms and disabled survivors.

The point Evans was struggling to make, of course, was not that pro-lifers are racist (I am unsure if she really believes that), but that pro-life people can’t just stop at birth: we should favor real financial support for parents and kids too. I agree. We cannot stop at birth. For starters, we must protect the lives of the elderly as well and oppose euthanasia.

Pro-Lifers Hold All Sorts of Views about Redistribution

But beyond that, we should indeed provide generous support to families. Conservative movements in Poland, Georgia (country, not state), and Hungary are taking huge strides to reduce child poverty and housing insecurity in their countries by providing generous per-child cash benefits to families.

American conservatives should do the same, and, notably, the recent tax reform substantially increased the child tax credit. Evans is absolutely correct that pro-life people should enact their beliefs, not just by ending abortion, but by embedding support for childbearing, marriage, and the family in law and fiscal policy.

Abortion rates have been steadily falling for over 20 years with virtually no correlation to changes in government spending.

But while pro-life people should do these things, there’s very little actual evidence that more financial support would reduce abortions. When progressives claim that “abortions will fall more if we increase welfare,” they’re speaking from faith, not evidence. Abortion rates have been steadily falling for over 20 years with virtually no correlation to changes in government spending.

Moreover, our abortion rates are much lower than in many countries where welfare is far more generous, or health care is socialized. Thus, while I think we should enact new policies, not as welfare but as universal benefits aimed to promote childbearing, marriage, and family, it should also be made clear that these policies won’t end abortion.

What will end abortion is, first, reversing Roe v. Wade. Then, because abortion is not interstate commerce or the like, each state will face a decision about whether to ban abortion (a federal abortion ban is probably neither constitutional nor desirable, as it would energize pro-abortion groups into much higher turnout).

Once Roe v. Wade is reversed, pro-life people will need to aggressively lobby their state governments and persuade their neighbors to protect life. Then, state by state, we will roll back the murderous campaign of abortion. Thanks to Kennedy’s retirement, this may all happen far sooner than most of us imagined a few years ago. Here’s hoping.

Lefty Gentrification Of DC Brings Negatives For Black Residents,"The poorest inhabitants of the District of Columbia have largely lost their confidence in their Democratic representatives, evidenced by a “historic plunge” in voting in the poorest and most violent neighborhoods of the nation’s capital, according to a 29 June analysis in The Washington Post. The troubled Eighth Ward witnessed fewer than 8 percent of registered voters in the district’s recent primary election on 19 June.

Sadly, this is only the latest in a long series of indicators suggesting the gentrification of some areas of the district, predominantly by young liberal elites, has largely failed to benefit the city’s historic black community. Moreover, some of the trends defining urban readjustment in Washington suggest the liberal technocratic elite are often indifferent to the needs of their black neighbors.

The Strange Paradox of the District

Politics in Washington DC is overwhelmingly one-sided. Since the city first had a mayor, in 1975, it has never had anything but Democrats holding the top position. Moreover, the last non-Democrat to lead the city (an independent) was in the early 1960s.

The city votes overwhelmingly for Democratic representatives at all levels of government. Much of this blue tendency can be explained by the large African-American composition of the city, which has been a bulwark of the Left for generations. Black voters, for example, formed the backbone constituency and cornerstone of coalitions of such leaders as notorious mayor Marion Barry Jr.

Although the influx of wealthier non-black residents has done nothing to dent the city’s image as a Democratic stronghold, it also hasn’t seemed to have any effect at bolstering declining voting rates in the neighborhoods that constitute the city’s black culture. The recent primary election was the “first time any ward’s turnout in a mayoral election dropped to single digits in nearly three decades of data available from the D.C. Board of Elections,” poll attendance less than half the rates seen elsewhere in the city.

Wealth flowing into the district is apparently having little effect on the indifference of largely African-American voters east of the Anacostia River. What’s going on here?

The Double-Edged Sword of Gentrification

There’s no doubt that gentrification brings significant benefits. Crime rates usually drop precipitously, communities become cleaner and more beautiful, and food and bar options improve dramatically. Yet, as one Coldwell Banker representative acknowledged, “some people do lose” when priced out of the neighborhoods in which they grew up.

Some DC residents have filed a lawsuit against the city for encouraging gentrification at the expense of poorer residents. The lawsuit alleges that the city’s policies discriminate on the basis of age, income, and race, favoring creatives and millennials at the expense of the city’s historically African-American, low-income residents. Such a policy would violate the DC Human Rights Act.

The Washington Post has done a laudable job reporting on the legion of ways that gentrification is hurting these black communities, a fascinating study in the contradictions inherent in politics on the Left. Bicycle commuters, for example, have pushed for more bike lanes, a liberal pro-green policy if ever there was one. However, more bike lanes in many parts of the city means less parking, a particular frustration for those who attend Sunday church.

As DC transplant and writer Addison del Mastro has observed, few of the young technocratic elites now populating the city attend church, instead preferring to indulge in Sunday brunch bacchanalias. When I related the story of the DC “bike lane controversy” to a coworker—a very successful, liberal graduate of the University of Chicago now living in the district—he had little sympathy for the city’s black churches. Indeed, he complained that their music was far too loud, and said he had issued noise complaints about one in his own neighborhood.

Many blacks whose families have a long history with the city meanwhile can no longer afford to live in the district, so now live in nearby Maryland counties. Many still have to commute into the city for work, which often requires hours on public transportation, oftentimes doing jobs for the technocratic elite that now populate their old haunts.

In a similar sad irony, the Post noted that few restaurants in the city offer food delivery to the poor, largely black Seventh and Eighth wards. Whatever the goods of gentrification, many are not making their way to those who would benefit the most.

We Need to Be Real Localists

Are the city’s influx of white, upper-middle-class technocrats indifferent to the plight of their poorer black neighbors? Their political opinions and voting records, which prioritize various financial redistribution programs, don’t suggest that. Nor do surveys that show millennials value volunteering more than their predecessors did (although that doesn’t necessarily correlate to more assistance to local communities).

Nor am I particularly interested in bashing the Left for some sort of hypocrisy regarding the poor. If those with any means are honest, we’ll acknowledge that we all fail the needy of our communities. Ultimately, I’m inclined to wager that the failure of the city’s far wealthier newer inhabitants to support and strengthen poorer communities has more to do with larger societal trends that foster isolation and indifference.

As Robert B. Putnam has noted in his game-changing research, more and more Americans are “bowling alone.” The many mediating institutions of American society, which bonded us to one another and strengthened community relations, are largely evaporating.

Church attendance is plummeting, certainly among millennials. Marriage and birth rates, which indicate “settling down” and investing in a community, are also in decline. The kinds of single technocrats who populate the city simply aren’t doing the kinds of things that foster deeper, more empathetic ties. We’re increasingly exchanging social media networks for the flesh-and-blood networks that once defined city life.

The broader societal trends of religious society are making us more insular and atomized, less aware of, or empathetic to, the needs of those who live only a few miles from us. This tendency reaffirms the implicit biases and racism even liberal Americans sometimes expose when talking about “dangerous” neighborhoods, as Lyman Stone has recently noted about his own experience in the DC area.

What will preserve and empower the kinds of neighborhoods suffering under the district’s ongoing gentrification explosion is not necessarily a shift in political power or a host of new top-down social programs. What is needed far more is a willingness to go to the kinds of places (e.g. the Seventh and Eighth wards) and do the kinds of activities such as church, synagogue, formal volunteering programs, sports leagues, and community associations that unite us to our neighbors, regardless of politics.

That brand of localism, which starts with us and how we spend our evenings and weekends, has the power not only to heal the wounds of our cities, but that of our nation writ large.

Festival Bans Musical For Allowing White Woman To Sing Slave Songs,"Over the past several decades, an important and much-needed effort has been made to expand the Western canon to reflect the contributions of non-white artists and writers. This brings a richer, deeper understanding of our cultural history to the fore and helps us to better understand our society. Last week a terrible step backwards away from these efforts was taken by the Montreal Jazz Festival, when it abruptly cancelled its production of the musical “SLAV,” in which slave songs from the nineteenth century played the central role.

Anyone paying slight attention to the art world in recent years will easily guess what the controversy was. White artists were singing songs that black American slaves originated. As the kids like to say, this was “cultural appropriation.” After a few dozen protesters shouted at attendees at an early performance of the work, the festival bowed to the pressure and cancelled the show.

The star of the show, Betty Bonafassi, who is best known for her work in the film “The Triplets of Belleville,” has a history of exploring the songs of slavery. In fact, the title, “SLAV” instead of “slave,” is a nod to her Serbian heritage and the centuries of slavery her people endured. This kind of cultural connection is essential to understanding how art and history intermingle, and how both can point the way to all our shared humanity.

The Language Of The Outlaw

In one of the most famous (and readable) sections of James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” a book at heart about cultural mixing, an Irish nationalist gives a speech in which he compares the Irish to the Israelite slaves in Egypt. He is arguing both for self-rule and for rejecting the English language in favor of Irish. The former wins, the latter loses. He imagines Moses as a boy being told how powerful Egypt was, how futile it would be for the Jews to defy it. Then he writes:

“But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition, he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.”

The language of the outlaw becomes the law. The songs of the oppressed become the anthems of equality. Not only were black slave songs also steeped in the stories of the Old Testament, they were also in many cases illegal. Many of the songs contained codes to help slaves escape, a grave crime at that time. Others helped to educate a group of people for whom education was forbidden.

The idea that all men are created equal is mentioned by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence, but it is enshrined in the blood and courage of black Americans who refused to be enslaved. Their songs played a powerful role in that fight, and as such are a profound and essential cultural legacy, not just for all Americans but also for all human beings.

We Need To Centralize Black Culture

The irony of the insistence that only black artists should perform artwork created by black people is that through this segregation black cultural achievement is decentralized and denied its deserved place in the common cultural canon. While artists of any kind are free to engage the work of Ludwig van Beethoven and Francis Poulenc, most artists are being told not to engage with slave songs or Chuck Berry.

This is folly. In its most literal sense, “canon” means a collection of sacred books or works, widely accepted as important and genuine. When a work enters the canon, not only is it immortalized (or the closest thing to it) it also becomes universal. The idea that black people have a proprietary right to the artistic contributions of people who lived more than a century ago has become almost unquestioned in the art world. But what a disservice that is to the creators of these works, which speak to us through time, and have earned the right to be a part of all of us.

Every culture is eventually subsumed by new ones, but the question is, how much influence does it have over the new ones? The contributions of black Americans, including their refusal to accept slavery, a central story of all Western culture, should play a central role in all Americans’ understanding of themselves. That can’t fully happen when those contributions are siloed behind cultural border walls.

It’s Time To Fight Back

Over the past few years in the academy, organizations like Heterodox Academy and outlets like Quillette have begun to fight back against a campus culture they find illiberal and stifling. It is time for the right-minded people in the arts to find ways to challenge norms that restrict the ability to engage in the cultural output of ethnic groups.

Tellingly, had this show had an all-black cast and crew, there would be no objection to its content. The 8,000 or so theater-goers who are now getting refunds would have experienced these powerful songs and their stories. There would have been reviews, perhaps recordings, and the knowledge and awareness of these vital songs would have been greatly expanded.

That spreading of the word is how the canon is established. Those who seek to deny artists the ability to do that important work based on the color of their skin are working at cross-purposes. On the one hand they rightfully want the contributions of black Americans to sit equally alongside the Old Testament and “Ulysses,” but on the other they are silencing attempts to do that very thing. It almost seems as if these protestors are profoundly more interested in what they have to say about today’s world than what the great black artists of the past had to say about theirs.

Artists and audiences need to explicitly reject these attempts to silence past voices, even if arts organizations fold under the pressure. They must pursue and support a truly diverse view of the arts in which every artist is not only free, but urged to take on the stories of any culture, to better understand them and bring them into the fold of the cultural canon.

How GOP Can Switch From Offending Minority Voters To Wooing Them,"Millennials are the most likely fully adult generation to be registered as independents, and the most likely to vote for Democrats. A great part of this is due to biases in education and media, but blame also rests on the shoulders of Republican candidates, who have spent decades underappreciating the implications that changing U.S. demographics have for the party.

After Mitt Romney’s 2012 loss, the Republican establishment released an autopsy stressing the importance of Republicans working to make inroads with the country’s growing demographics, but the Republican base instead doubled down on the aggressive rhetoric and hardline policy stances that the leadership said was alienating the party from young voters.

Ever since the conservative movement came to dominate Republican politics, politicians have been able to rest assured that they will be able to win elections with rural and suburban votes. This wouldn’t have been a problem if the party hadn’t simultaneously ignored other demographics, withdrawing almost unilaterally from the urban communities that now dictate so much of our political lives.

Those voters are now reaching out. We could be< in a time of change, as this video from Chicago and the surprise primary win of Republican John James in Michigan suggest. Here are some ideas for pushing things like this closer to a tipping point.

Let’s Face It: Most Republican Voters Are Pretty Old

With the absence of Republicans willing to put effort into changing hearts and minds, Democrats have been able to present a generation of young people a vision of the Republican Party that is neither accurate nor flattering. Overwhelming majorities of people who live in urban communities, and a budding majority of suburbanites, favor Democrats, and are openly hostile to even the prospect of supporting the Republican Party.

Democrats paint Republicans as either disdainful patricians or bigoted yokels. Regardless of the validity of this view, it is the prevailing perception among young people. The Republican Party is buoyed by members of the Silent and Baby Boomer generations, a clear problem given that even the youngest of the Boomers are well into their 50s and the oldest of the Silents are on the greater end of their 80s.

Republicans can no longer sit idly by with the voters they currently have. If the Republican Party has any future in this country, they must busy themselves with the hard work of actually convincing people of the superiority of their ideals.

Stop Dismissing This Problem with Insulting Responses

Often when this demographic problem is brought up, many on the Right dismiss youthful and minority hostility to the GOP as the outgrowth of brainwashing in school and a desire to retain government benefits. This of course disregards that majorities of none of these groups receive any government benefits.

Conservative commentators like Candace Owens, Dinesh D’Souza, and Charlie Kirk attempt to paint Democrats as the actual racists and urge black people to “escape the Democrat plantation.” The insulting nature of these appeals aside, this is as close to a campaign pitch that many prospective voters of color hear, and it is painfully tone deaf.

This implies people of color support Democrats not because they have legitimately been convinced of liberal ideals, but because they, as a collective, are too naive to determine when they are being manipulated. Insulting the intelligence and agency of the people you are trying to get to switch parties isn’t exactly a winning strategy.

Yes, urban voters are inculcated with liberal messaging their entire lives, especially if they live in Democratic machines like Chicago or New York, and often were educated in public schools and get their political information from mainstream media. But one of the reasons many buy into the messaging is that they are never presented with an alternative. If Republicans want to win in these areas, they must actively go and sell the merits of conservatism.

Get Out There and Make the Case

To convince more voters that conservatism at the very least doesn’t deserve their ire, Republicans have to start running in the often unchallenged local and state races. While Barack Obama was president, Republicans gained 12 governorships, but generally because of high Republican turnout rather than active attempts to change hearts and minds.

Yes, initially those who run against Democrats in these areas will lose, but by presenting an alternate perspective, many disillusioned voters will be able to find a home. In the last presidential election, 24 percent and 18 percent of people in Chicago and New York City, respectively, voted for Trump. Those are people who, if given the chance, might throw their support behind a local Republican candidate for alderman or the state legislature.

Another worthwhile effort would be going to high schools to talk with juniors and seniors before their political predispositions solidify. That is how you build a base. Tennessee was solidly Democratic up until after 2008, when Republicans made a concerted effort to challenge incumbents and bring the conservative message to new ears. Conservatives can’t complain about extremely liberal bastions if no effort is going to be put into reversing the trends.

Republicans’ Double Standards Look Horrible

Another great impediment to Republicans making inroads with minority groups is their perceived hypocrisy on government intervention and identity politics. Many on the Right have no problem giving taxpayer dollars and sympathetic rhetoric to the opioid crisis as it rips through white, rural communities, but often respond to drug abuse in minority areas with either listlessness or vindictive criminalizing that breaks apart families and uproots lives.

It is also not lost on minority voters that while the most powerful and influential Republicans staunchly support the corporate welfare of ethanol subsidies and steel tariffs, they scoff at the idea of similar government action in non-rural environments, allowing manufacturing jobs in places like Chicago to die without such clamor.

Such double standards appear to evidence racial undertones and alienate those who would otherwise be responsive to Republican positions.

This is not an argument for the Republican Party to bolster protectionism, but it is an acknowledgment that whatever the policy position, the standard needs to be perceived as being applied even handedly. Otherwise, such double standards appear to evidence racial undertones and alienate those who would otherwise be responsive to Republican positions on foreign policy and economics.

These difficulties extend to immigration as well, where Republican rhetoric can spur revulsion from minority voters. Starting a conversation about such a complex issue with “They’re not sending their best…. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people” is not an effective way to start a productive conversation or endear oneself to a population. It’s a way to appeal to the tribal impulses of rural voters at the expense of a largely non-white demographic.

This proves especially wrongheaded considering that Latino Americans are very open to voting for Republicans depending on their approach to immigration. Take California and Texas, the two largest states with two of the largest immigrant and Latino populations. In California, 63 percent of Latino voters are Democrats, compared to 16 percent who identify as Republicans. By contrast, in Texas, only 37 percent of Latino voters consider themselves to be Democrats, compared to 21 percent who are Republicans.

Look, Donald Trump’s Remarks Are Truly Offputting

The divergence can be traced back to 1994, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson of California vociferously supported Proposition 187, “a ballot initiative in 1994 that sought to deny state services to unlawful residents, including free schooling for some 300,000 children, and sought to order teachers and doctors to report pupils and patients who might lack legal status.” Regardless of whether the measure was racist, it did irreparable damage to Latino perceptions of Republicans in the state.

When they see the head of the party speaking and behaving the way that he does, it only confirms their suspicions.

This is the opposite of the approach taken by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who went out of his way all throughout his governorship and presidency to not only make Latinos feel welcome, but to actively recruit them. As a result, Republicans have a maintained a monopoly on statewide office in Texas since and will continue to dominate well into the future.

The Republican Party should not struggle with minority and women voters the way that it does, but often the party’s rhetoric alienates potential voters. According to polling, more than 80 percent of black people, 75 percent of Hispanics, and slightly less than 50 percent of white people think the president is racist. The same can be said of women who, regardless of political affiliation, disapprove of Trump more than their male counterparts do.

This disapproval stems directly from the president pretending not to know who David Duke was during the campaign, drawing moral equivalencies in the wake of the Charlottesville murder, making degrading offhand remarks about countries that are primarily occupied by people of color, and cruel treatment of asylum seekers at the border. Voters are told constantly that Republican are bigoted or insensitive to people with whom they differ, so when they see the head of the party speaking and behaving the way that he does, it only confirms their suspicions.

The ‘All Lives Matter’ Response Says You Don’t Care

Republicans also hurt themselves on criminal justice reform and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. There is much to object to from BLM, ranging from their actual policy positions to often vitriolic rhetoric, but the apathy with which Republicans are seen to regard its driving issues of over-incarceration and police brutality only solidify in the minds of black voters that the GOP is hostile to their prospective well-being.

No one who chants ‘Black Lives Matter’ is implying that black lives matter exclusively, especially, or supremely.

Consider the asinine typical response to people saying “black lives matter”: “All lives matter.” To use this slogan is to argue in bad faith and dismiss legitimate concerns from people of color about the abuse of power by enforcers of the law. No one who chants “Black Lives Matter” is implying that black lives matter exclusively, especially, or supremely. They are simply saying that black lives matter also, and the current judicial system does not behave accordingly.

Regardless of whether you agree, ignoring the context to scornfully respond with “All lives matter” sends the message that Republicans have no interest in a good-faith conversation to find solutions. Criminal justice reform and increased oversight of state run enforcement agencies like the police should be at the top of Republicans’ state legislative priorities. The GOP is often heard decrying government overreach that violates people’s freedoms and the unaccountable nature of government bureaucrats.

Yet on subjects such as the devastating effects of the War on Drugs on communities of color and the lack of accountability for local police officers when they do step out of line, Republicans routinely forfeit their built-in advantage. They open themselves up to accusations of apathy at the least and racism at worst.

All people should honor and respect the police, of course, but maintaining that the only way to do so is to shy away from legitimate criticism in statistically uncommon independent situations like shootings of unarmed black people creates a false dichotomy. It is not disrespectful of the police to hold them to high standards of conduct, especially considering that taxpayers fund their salaries and pensions. If anything, it is insulting to refuse to offer even legitimate critiques regarding the militarization of many police forces.

What Republicans Should Do Instead

If Republicans are to make inroads and counteract decades of damages, it must be done first at the local level and with the necessary adjustments in rhetoric. Joining local school boards, running for alderman (perhaps first as an independent), and contesting mayoral races that often comprise only liberals with identical politics working to outspend one another, are all vital to the longevity of the party in the face of a changing country.

Eliminating mandatory minimums and bail reform are issues that small government conservatives should passionately champion.

When campaigning in these areas, just like anywhere else, Republicans will have to tailor their message to win. When in urban areas, emphasis should be put on criminal justice reform, an issue where Democrats have a rhetorical monopoly, rather than the typical tough on crime message. Zealous over-prosecution of minor offenses have filled jails and prisons with decent people who will for the rest of their lives struggle as a result of their incarceration.

As an alternative, Republicans can move to the forefront of ending the issue by taking a more libertarian approach to drug usage and the government’s response. There are also opportunities to join Democrats, and endear the party to potential voters, in restructuring the justice system. Eliminating mandatory minimums and bail reform are issues that small government conservatives should passionately champion.

The same can be said for immigration reform, where the real obstacles are hostile rhetoric and a seemingly rigid lack of compassion. Rather than diminishing the reasons minorities tend to vote Democratic, showing constituents that there is clear ideological overlap is a much more effective means of swaying voters. This doesn’t require any ideological changes from conservatives, but is contingent upon Republicans going out of their way to highlight how these communities would benefit from having Republican officeholders.

"If There's A Racial Double Standard, It Should Be About Blacks Only","David Marcus recently criticized the New York Times for promoting a racial double standard when they decided to stand by Sarah Jeong despite her history of racist tweets. According to Marcus, the Times has “no problem denigrating white people in a way they would not any other group” because they have implicitly embraced “privilege theory and its hierarchies of oppression.” Marcus rightly worries that this double standard does more harm than good and “is a dangerous road to a dark place.”

While Marcus’s analysis is largely correct, there is an even bigger problem with Jeong, white privilege theory (WPT), and leftist racial discourse in general: It is profoundly, deeply unfair, and not just to white Americans. The Left’s inordinate focus on whites is especially unfair to African-Americans.

The crux of race in America isn’t that white people have “hidden advantages.” It’s that African-Americans have, and always have had, obvious disadvantages. Rather than white privilege, we should be focusing on black suffering. If there is a racial double standard, it shouldn’t be about whites at all. It should be about black people, and only black people.

African-Americans Have a Unique History in America

Especially as America has transformed into a multi-racial rather than bi-racial democracy, it doesn’t make sense to continually harp on white people. It makes even less sense to lump the African-American experience along with that of other minorities.

Take the term “people of color” (POC). It implies that we can view race relations as white people on one side and all racial minorities on the other. But that framing is nonsense. POC didn’t experience 250 years of slavery. Black people did. POC didn’t get lynched almost 4,000 times. Black people did. And POC did not put up with decades of Jim Crow and formal housing discrimination. Black people did.

WPT glosses over these horrors that were perpetrated only on African-Americans. But this glossing over, this equating of blacks with all POC, is inevitable if you fixate on white people.

Ultimately the problem with white privilege theory isn’t its focus on privilege or white people. It’s that it minimizes what African-Americans endured. Yes, it’s true that some people might be treated with “more respect and dignity based on skin color.” But as far as race is concerned, only African-Americans have been uniquely harmed by such disrespect.

The Obsession with Whites Sidelines Blacks

So rather than WPT, it would be better to adopt a black-centered framework when discussing race. In this framework, the Jeong controversy would not exist—not because white people aren’t sometimes privileged, or white supremacy didn’t exist, but because any racial discussion would be viewed entirely through the lens of blacks. In this world, it would be bizarre for anyone to be so obsessed with whites. The common liberal trope that “America is based on white supremacy” would disappear from our vocabulary, and instead become something like: “America was built on black slavery.”

While the difference between those phrases may seem small, the second does something that our current discourse tragically does not: place African-Americans at the center of our racial narrative and treat their journey with the solemn reverence it deserves. However many races there are in America today, black and non-black are still the only two racial categories that matter. Privilege theory and the Left’s approach to race gets it completely backwards.

To meaningfully engage with race, conservatives should thus do a couple things. In terms of our public rhetoric, we should acknowledge, as I’ve argued previously, that racial identity is a meaningful concept. But we should simultaneously insist that African-Americans are special, and strongly denounce anyone who suggests otherwise.

In policies, we should as much as possible treat all groups equally, something Marcus has also called for. But we should also be open to making exceptions on a case by case basis. Only two groups should qualify for exceptions: African-Americans and Native Americans. Although discussing Native Americans is beyond the scope of this essay, they too have suffered uniquely. All Americans should place the experiences of these two groups on a pedestal and never compare them to anything else.

All Immigrants Are Closer to Whites than to Blacks

Placing black Americans in a racial category by themselves and reducing the salience of “white” could also build national cohesion because it would be easier to highlight the commonalities among all immigrant groups. Muslim-Americans could appreciate that while they surely face bigotry and are “people of color,” they have much in common with the Irish and Italians. Minority immigrants must logically be compared to other immigrant groups, not African-Americans. In America’s racial hierarchy, all immigrants are much closer to whites than we are to blacks.

This approach may also help the Sarah Jeongs of the world see that whites do not automatically have privilege over non-whites: it is lunacy to assert that their race alone makes white Appalachians privileged over many second-generation Asian-Americans, whose parents were given visas because they were among the most talented doctors, engineers, and scientists in their countries of origin.

I have been called racial slurs many times since I moved to the United States. I was once even punched in the face because I am a “f-cking foreigner.” But as traumatizing as such incidents may be to non-black racial minorities, it is grotesque to compare them to what happened to black people. Black people had—and have—it much, much worse. A black-centric approach would continually remind us of this fact.

It would also help us to make sense of the overwhelming data that economic immobility afflicts African-Americans, and especially African-American men, over every other group. Given our history, why would we expect anything else? Even though others face hardship, black people stand alone in this regard.

In a 1967 interview, Martin Luther King Jr. was asked why black Americans couldn’t progress like other immigrants. King’s response, said at a time when blacks were effectively our only minority group, is still relevant today: “No other ethnic group has been a slave on American soil. That is one thing that other immigrant groups haven’t had to face.”

No other group—not Hispanics, Muslims, women, LGBT people, or anyone else—have faced what black Americans have. Race in America is not about whites or people of color. It’s about black people. White privilege theory trivializes this crucial fact.

How You Look Doesn’t Tell Us Your History

How did such a wrong-headed theory gain so much prominence? I suspect it’s because WPT is the only theory that could succeed in a multi-racial America. America never really wanted to view African-Americans as special. For a while we had no choice. But the second Hispanics and we Asians started coming over in significant numbers, WPT came along to save the day.

After all, here’s an academic theory that effectively says to black people: “Don’t view your experience as special. Sure you’re the only ones who were enslaved and lynched. And sure some minorities are significantly better off than the average American, much less black people. But you really should just lump yourself in with all people of color.”

We’ve accepted this fraudulent reasoning without realizing how ahistorical and morally bankrupt it is. Simply because they both generally happen to have darker skin than some other people, WPT has made it okay to analogize any brown-skinned immigrant, regardless of wealth or education, with an African-American whose ancestors experienced slavery and lynching.

How is okay to make that comparison? What kind of country will we be if we continue doing so? Sadly, the country we have always been.

Conservatives Should Welcome A Black James Bond,"Apparently the internet is in uproar (or at least a mild kerfuffle) over the possibility of a black actor playing Bond … James Bond. While many are enthusiastic about the idea, others, such as English media personality Katie Hopkins, hate it.

I don’t see what the fuss is about.

Occasionally recasting the lead is a franchise tradition. Fans debate who best exemplified James Bond, the man whose enduring essence is that he is an elegant, martini-loving, skirt-chasing, British spy with cool gadgets and a license to kill. White skin is not essential to that role, regardless of what Hopkins and her ilk believe.

Of course, some of the other ideas floated for “representation” would change the character in crucial, and therefore unacceptable, ways. Casting a female as “Jane Bond” would certainly alter the character in essential ways. And given how central “Bond girls” are to the character and to the franchise, the same applies to the idea of a gay James Bond. Likewise, although a pious Bond might be a better role model, he would be much less like James Bond.

Even with a license to kill, there are still rules. As Bond once put it, “My dear girl, there are some things that just aren’t done. Such as, drinking Dom Perignon ’53 above the temperature of 38 degrees Fahrenheit.” Ditto for making James Bond into an intersectional mascot. But a bloke with dark skin could still play an elegant, martini-loving, skirt-chasing, British spy with cool gadgets and a some notches on his Walther PPK. If Hollywood wants to create movies about female or gay or [insert identity category here] 00 agents, there is plenty of space for spin-offs.

The Bond franchise is not a period piece, forever stuck in the age of its origin. It has moved with the times, and so the possibility of the leading man having dark skin is simply the logical product of realistic casting. There are undoubtedly black Brits successfully working as agents in Her Majesty’s real secret service. In all likelihood, there were some back when Ian Fleming created James Bond, but they were unlikely to be written up as the main character of a spy thriller. That it is now culturally possible to imagine Bond as a black man is genuine progress (and it is possible — after all, the British royal family just welcomed a multiracial American).

Hopkins complaint that “Bond is a white guy” shows her inability to separate the essential from that which is not. Many of Bond’s physical attributes have changed between actors; given the racial realities of modern Britain, why should skin color be any different?

Thus, the primary qualification for any actor looking to replace Daniel Craig when he relinquishes the role is the ability to convincingly portray James Bond. Choosing to restrict the role to actors of one race would be a mistake — whether it was done to keep Bond white or to ensure a black James Bond. In either case, the casting would be driven by non-essential characteristics, at the possible cost of passing over a better actor.

However, if the casting is fair, then there will eventually be a nonwhite actor who earns the role of James Bond. It may not happen at the next opening for the role, but it will happen someday. And we should welcome this.

If the character of James Bond is successfully played by a good black actor, it would be a blow against both the identity-politics bean counters and the white supremacists. For both groups, race is essential to personal identity. And both are wrong.

This is not to say that race doesn’t matter. It does. For historical and sociological reasons (sometimes complicated, sometimes brutally simple), it matters, in James Bond’s Britain as well as in America. To pretend otherwise is ahistorical and therefore un-conservative. We know that the sins of the fathers echo down through many generations. And racism is a sin. The past (and too often, present) treatment of race as essential to defining a person, and its use as a justification for injustice, was wrong.

Because of this cultural legacy of wrongdoing, having the character of James Bond portrayed by a black actor would have meaning. It would provide a marker on our cultural movement away from racial essentialism and the oppression of people because of their race.

Which actor plays an iconic British superspy will be only a small part of the road to racial reconciliation, but it would have some value. If a black actor is cast in the role of James Bond, then the race-hustling identity politics types will briefly celebrate and then find something to complain about, white supremacist losers will whine online, and the rest of us can enjoy a (hopefully) good action flick. And then we can all move on, a little more confident that race is not essential to character or identity. The essence of James Bond is not identity politics, but shooting a villain with a spear gun, making a joke, and getting the girl.

MLK Would Be Pleased With Black Americans' Gains Under Trump,"Martin Luther King Jr. would be pleased that we are celebrating the 54th anniversary of his “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28. We can expect not only the usual adulation for the speech from the keepers of America’s conscience, but also the knee-jerk condemnation of President Trump, the cause of everything evil in this land — from fires in California and constipation in Florida to acid reflux at The New York Times.

If you think current accounts of what Donald Trump has done for black people — unemployment at the lowest level ever, except for small (disproportionately black) babies disfavored by the Democratic Party — are vicious, think what the history books, at least those written by left-wing zealots (which is most of them) will say. If the past is any guide, it will not be pretty.

Here, for example, is what The American Pageant (12th edition), widely used in U.S. high schools and especially in AP courses, has to say about President Dwight Eisenhower:

President Eisenhower was little inclined toward promoting integration. He shied away from employing his vast popularity and the prestige of his office to educate white Americans about the need for racial justice. His personal attitudes may have helped to restrain him. He had grown up in an all-white town and spent his career in a segregated army.

That is very misleading. Eisenhower was in fact positive and forceful in promoting integration. He started his presidency with supportive words, and followed them with action. In his first State of the Union message, Eisenhower said:

Our civil and social rights form a central part of the heritage we are striving to defend on all fronts and with all our strength. I believe with all my heart that our vigilant guarding of these rights is a sacred obligation binding upon every citizen. … A cardinal ideal in this heritage we cherish is the equality of rights of all citizens of every race and color and creed.

He followed this address with a pledge to end segregation in Washington, D.C., that was so heavily imposed by Woodrow Wilson — a Democrat, to whose virulent racism the textbook authors devote only three sentences. Ike ordered an end to segregation in schools run by the federal government in military posts. He further appointed Frederic Morrow as the first black person to serve on a president’s staff; Eisenhower also created the Civil Rights Division within the Justice Department.

Eisenhower’s policies impressed leaders in the black community with the president’s seriousness of purpose. The NAACP praised Ike’s “strong and constructive” leadership on race, and Rep. Adam Clayton Powell of New York, probably the leading black spokesman in America, endorsed Eisenhower for reelection in 1956. No wonder. Eisenhower’s Republican Party platform in 1956 proclaimed, “The Republican Party accepts the decision of the US Supreme Court that racial discrimination in publicly supported schools must be progressively eliminated.”

The Democrats in their 1956 platform stated, to the contrary: “We reject all proposals for the use of force to interfere with the orderly determination of these matters [of racial integration] by the courts.” The conflicting views of the two parties on racial integration resulted in the strongest black vote for a Republican presidential candidate, Eisenhower, in the preceding 85 years. He received almost 40 percent of the black vote, which helped him win reelection by a landslide. Ike was leading Americans where they wanted to go — but he was a Republican so the textbook authors don’t give him any credit.

The Education and Research Institute of Washington, D.C., (of which I am the chairman) has put online a critique of The American Pageant from which the comments above are taken. ERI’s goal is to give students a chance to learn real history — true American history, not the left-wing biased version.

MLK Jr. began his speech by saying, “I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.” But how does a speech “go down in history” if historians and textbook writers distort the truth? Which is what they are doing with the story of Trump.

Trump hasn’t a chance in the history books, as he has no chance in the daily news.

Even so, back at the ranch, black people have jobs, and more jobs than the left-wing Black Lives Matter-type politicians have been able to provide — ever! Martin Luther King Jr. would be pleased.

Does Privilege Theory Boost South Africa-Style Confiscation In The US?,"The South African parliament is considering an amendment to their constitution to allow for “expropriation without compensation” of private property for the purpose of “land reform.” Although apartheid ended in the early 1990s, most South African farmland is still owned by whites, and many in South Africa see land reform as a necessary remedy for past injustices committed by white colonists of Anglo and Dutch origin.

While many pundits have been quarreling over whether 74 farm murders last year constitute “white genocide” (the case is weak at best, given the lack of data), the actual policy debate in the country is deeply disturbing on its own, and shows, regardless of what you think about the farm murders, that racial Marxism threatens to bring an economic and human rights disaster upon South Africa.

There are obvious lessons to learn from what’s happening in South Africa and what happened with Zimbabwe’s land reform, as I shall discuss. But in exploring these events, we must ask an important question: Could a version of South Africa’s or Zimbabwe’s property confiscation ever happen in America?

It’s not far-fetched. Material reparations have long been on the agenda for black social justice activists, and the theory of “white privilege,” which insists that all white wealth and privilege is essentially ill-gotten because all whites participate in and benefit from the so-called “system of oppression” (i.e. capitalism), has been gaining traction in educational institutions over the past several years.

Given the steady erosion of our constitutional liberties at all levels of government, even under Republican leadership, the time to ponder such a morally and materially consequential a possibility as expropriation without compensation — something like a racial application of the power of eminent domain — is now.

Halfway to Forcible Racial Redistribution

Earlier this year I laid out the case for how white privilege theory serves as a door stopper for redistributionist policies, like disparate impact housing policies (distributing housing according to ethnicity), progressive stacking (speech redistribution), and affirmative action (opportunity redistribution). This is because white privilege theory is based on the neo-Marxist worldview. As I explained:

Neo-marxism divides the world between oppressor and oppressed and identifies a system, or systems, by which the oppression takes place. In classical Marxism, the oppressed were the proletariat, the oppressors were the bourgeoisie, and the system of oppression was capitalism. The Marxist framework has been adapted to categorize and pit against each other various group identities, all toward the end of establishing socialism.

Racial Marxism has an even deeper root in South Africa than here. Not long after throwing off the bonds of colonialism did many Africans seek to exchange them for the bonds of Marxism. In search of a new identity, they embraced Marxism and started communist and socialist parties and organizations (Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe belonging to them at one time). Theorist Edna Bonacich explains Marxism’s attraction to people who have suffered directly under racial oppression:

Capitalism is a system that breeds class oppression and national/racial conquest. The two forms of exploitation operate in tandem. They are part of the same system that creates inequality, impoverishment, and all the other host of social ills that result. I believe that you cannot attack racism without attacking capitalism, and you cannot attack capitalism without attacking racism. The two are Siamese twins, joined together from top to bottom.

If Bonacich had any example that “proved” this relationship, it would be South Africa. The Cape was originally settled by the Dutch East India Company, and the Boers and British had a long history of oppressing and enslaving colored residents — in the early years, to profit the company. It should come as no surprise that oppressed, resettled black Africans under apartheid, who heard a white government label them “superfluous to the labor market” and cast them aside like trash, would see capitalism as essentially, racially oppressive and embrace the socialist alternative.

Racial Marxism Undermines Private Property Rights

One of the central tenets of my argument that white privilege theory leads to socialism is the theory’s underlying premise that the wealth and status of white people is ill-gotten because it is generated from a “system of oppression.” Any white adherent to white privilege theory must ask the question: “If what I have is ill-gotten, does it really belong to me? Or do I owe some portion of that to the people I am oppressing?”

South Africans have a stronger claim to the reasonableness of this question than Americans do, given that apartheid ended just a quarter-century ago. By comparison, Americans are 50 years removed from Jim Crow laws and 150 years removed from the end of slavery. The history of apartheid is a bloody one, including hundreds of state-sponsored assassinations of dissidents, thousands more violent deaths, and mass removal of black people onto “reserves.”

From 1960 all the way to 1983, the government forcibly resettled hundreds of thousands of black people, requiring many to give up their land to whites then rent it from white landlords. Farm workers were forced into slums, unable to find jobs in “white-designated” towns. There is absolutely no question that black South Africans still feel the effects of apartheid. Such a history, like America’s bloody and shameful history of slavery, cannot simply be swept under the rug.

The Marxist solution to this injustice is forcible redistribution of property (the amendment would apply to all property, not just land) from those who benefited from the oppressive system (apartheid) to those who suffered under it. The social justice imperative overrides any right one thinks he has to private property. The very concept of private property, of ownership, stands in the way of redistributive social justice.

Now, land reform on a voluntary basis and incentivized by the government might be necessary, and no reasonable person doubts that if the supposed owner of a farm actually stole it from someone else, the property should be returned to its rightful owner. But that is not what this policy of expropriation without compensation constitutes.

South Africa’s proposed land reform is not meant to return property from thieves to its owners, it is designed to seize property from people often far removed from the thieves, by generations and the purchase and sale of the land in the time since (the farmers may mostly be of the Boer ethnicity, but that does not make them accomplices to the Boers’ past injustices), and hand this property not to the people who originally owned it, but to people who share a general characteristic with the original owners or inhabitants of the land: race.

Further eroding the idea that land seizure is just, value has been added to the land through development. It is one thing to “return” a 19th century farm, or a mid-twentieth-century farm, or an undeveloped plot of land; it is another to “return” a 21st-century farm complete with hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment and infrastructure in addition to the value of the crops themselves.

Of course, theft by government nowadays is always cloaked in the language of the greater good, of justice, peace, and the welfare of the people. According to President Cyril Ramaphosa, of the Marxist-leaning party African National Congress, “The intention of the proposed amendment is to promote redress, advance economic development, increase agricultural production and food security.”

Nelson Mandela’s grandson, Nkozi Mandela, said in a statement that the purpose of the proposed amendment is to “find a lasting and just solution and we will bring an end to land poverty just as we brought a peaceful end to apartheid.”

“We’re just trying to end poverty” and “we just want equality” are go-to lines for social justice warriors because obviously, they are noble goals. But make no mistake: The policies they employ toward these supposed ends are divisive and destructive. They will achieve neither equality nor an end to poverty, as they undermine the fundamental human rights necessary for human flourishing.

A Major Cause of Zimbabwe’s Collapse

How do we know land seizure is destructive? The Zimbabwean government already tried it. Under President Mugabe’s direction, the government seized more than 800 farms, nearly a quarter of the large-scale farms, comprising 40 percent of the export earnings. Large-scale farms were the country’s largest employment sector, employing 2 million people.

The evicted farmers were mostly white, and the minority of black farmers affected were mostly critics of Mugabe, according to The Guardian’s report from June 2000. Despite the British government’s willingness to participate in “well-managed” land reform, Mugabe rejected any conditions (such as legality) and fast-tracked the settlement of blacks onto the farms.

The consequences were disastrous. Over the next decade, agricultural output dropped by $12 billion and led to famine, riots, farm killings, flight of foreign capital, price controls (which further disincentivized output), a banking crisis, and hyperinflation, ultimately leading to complete economic collapse.

When black farm owners began hiring the expertise of white former farmers and even sharing profits with them to achieve success, Mugabe said, “We can’t have another war to liberate a country we have already liberated.” Even given the miserable outcome of farm confiscation, he seemed to view voluntary arrangements with whites as oppressive.

Compare Zimbabwe’s socialist nightmare to the success of Botswana, where the policies immediately after independence from Britain in 1965 “were far more free market and libertarian than those of any other leader in sub-Saharan Africa.” According to a Mercatus Center economics paper, Botswana enjoyed a growth rate of nearly 11 percent over the next decade. The average income in Botswana jumped from $372 to $1,032.

The government of Botswana bucked the trend of sub-saharan Africa post-colonialism by keeping much of British common law in place, including protection of property rights. The ruling party’s manifesto included the following provisions:

Safeguard the liberty of the individual by the maintenance of law and order, and guarantee every individual citizen the rights of man as defined in the Constitution. … Not allow any form of discrimination, whether political, social or economic, against any minority racial group in the country … Neither shall the laws of the country recognize any preferential considerations of a political, economic, or social nature for any tribal or racial … Treat all men as equal before the law.

“There were no statues of Marx or Lenin in Botswana,” wrote Beaulier. Eighty percent of the voters supported the Botswana Democratic Party. Instead of asking what government could give them, the people asked what they must do to develop their economy.

But a mere decade later, Botswana transitioned to “big government” policies like those found in Western countries, and economic growth slowed. The government growth stemmed from “the government’s decision to make promises to a number of different groups of people desiring government services,” leading to “a slow and steady erosion of civil liberties, a loss of individual responsibility, and the loss of a government committed to the promotion of sound economic policies.”

That’s an important lesson. South Africans are being promised radical change. Like the Zimbabwean leaders, they’ve promised “justice” through land reform. Now, the ruling parties in South Africa have to make good on those promises. If Zimbabwe’s collapse is any warning, though, the violation of property rights will be disastrous.

There Are Dangers for America Here, Too

Americans, too, should take heed. Proponents of social justice at all levels of government have told black Americans they are categorical victims and routinely make promises to rectify the injustices of past and present capitalist oppression: police reform, prison reform, welfare, affordable housing, et cetera. First they seek to divide us by race and ethnicity, fostering tension and even violence. Then, they seek to redistribute wealth as the primary method of redress.

As convictions intensify over white guilt and the continued “legacy of oppression,” should we not expect to hear open calls to redistribute directly along racial lines, not by far-left writers, but also politicians? Could courts identify racial reparations as a “public purpose” for which eminent domain can be used? Wouldn’t seizing historical plantations contribute, overall, to the “public welfare,” as Ramaphosa described the purpose of the proposed amendment to South Africa’s constitution?

Could the courts decide the 14th Amendment allows racial redistribution for the purpose of promoting equality? If the Supreme Court could find the right to abortion there, surely, given proper motivation, they could find an entitlement for historically oppressed groups to receive money and property from historically dominant groups.

All it takes is a few years — decades, maybe — of heightening racial tensions, the permeation of the Marxist worldview through our education system, and a strengthened entitlement mentality before the cultural environment is ripe for a more authentic Marxism. Don’t ever say, “It can’t happen here.”

Saying The Rock Can't Play A Hawaiian Because He Isn't One Is Stupid,"Actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is taking heat for getting cast as a 19th century Hawaiian king in the upcoming film, “The King,” because he’s not Hawaiian. Activists say Johnson is wrongly appropriating Hawaiian culture by accepting the role. “I’m opposed to The Rock being King Kamehameha in a film about my ancestors because he’s Samoan and not Hawaiian,” said indigenous Hawaiian activist Healani Sonoda-Pale.

The furor over Johnson’s casting has reignited an ongoing debate about the validity of cultural appropriation — whether people should be free to borrow from cultures that they aren’t born into. Liberals argue that white people shouldn’t be allowed to participate in all sorts of activities, ranging from belly dancing and yoga to wearing their hair in cornrows, because doing so is disrespectful to the minority cultures that gave birth to these traditions.

But a world in which these activists get their way would be worse for everyone. We shouldn’t try to create a world in which people are allowed to adopt only certain hobbies based on the color of their skin. This is especially true of actors such as Johnson, whose job is to portray people unlike them.

Johnson is not the only entertainer who’s inspired ire by refusing to stay in his racial and cultural lane. Singer-songwriter Bruno Mars has taken a lot of heat because he incorporates traditionally black genres, like funk and hip-hop, in his songs (Mars is Filipino, Puerto Rican, and Jewish). But Mars’ work has been praised by R&B musicians like Charlie Wilson, and Mars cites black rappers like Dr. Dre and P. Diddy as major inspirations. It’s obvious that his music is not designed to demean traditionally black art forms. On the contrary, it’s meant to celebrate them, while exposing new audiences to genres they might not have otherwise explored.

Who would benefit if cries of cultural appropriation made it so Mars never released a record? Not his producers and fellow artists. Not his listeners, who fork over their hard-earned money because they appreciate his work. And certainly not the black artists and traditions whom he praises and elevates in interviews.

Many artists also come from poor backgrounds. Iggy Azalea, a white rapper who also faces cultural appropriations criticisms, came to the United States at 16 to pursue her dream career in the rap industry, leaving her family and home behind in Australia. She didn’t have a silver spoon in her mouth; she worked as a maid while earning her GED. Azalea made it big in the rap game, but if she hadn’t, she might still be working odd jobs for low pay.

Poor people have few enough opportunities to make it rich, especially if their dream is to be an artist. If liberals get their way on cultural appropriation, we’d be limiting their opportunities even further––just because of the color of their skin.

Cultural appropriation witch hunts also prevent art from evolving. Mars added something new to the traditionally-black music genres that he fused together, in the same way that Elvis added something new to traditionally-black rhythm and blues music when he invented rock and roll. The more people who participate in an art form, the more it can adapt and evolve, to the benefit of both fans and future practitioners. That’s especially true when those artists come from different cultures and backgrounds, and can feed their disparate cultures into their art.

When social justice warriors cry foul over cultural appropriation, they become a mirror of the alt-right, although the alt-right’s views may be more destructive. When the alt-right tries to “keep minorities in their place,” they’re drawing on a deep history of bigotry and discrimination in the United States, from slavery to Jim Crow to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. We’ve seen the past they want us to return to, and it’s awful. Liberals who want to keep white people (or Asians, or whomever) “in their place” don’t have a long history of their ideas being acted out, and their intentions often seem much nobler.

But cultural appropriation witch hunts ultimately aim at the same world the alt-right yearns for: a world where people of different races don’t interact. Only black people should produce rap, only people of Arab descent should be allowed to belly dance. Would social justice warriors prefer a world where Mars and black rapper B.O.B. had never collaborated? Where Elvis had never riffed on rhythm and blues? Or a world where white women can’t take hairstyling advice from their black friends?

If Johnson’s starpower encourages more Americans to see “The King,” which tells the story of a Hawaiian king who united the Hawaiian islands, then these Americans will learn more about Hawaiian history and heritage. That’s not a bad thing. We should aim for more spaces where people of all races can come together to collaborate, not a world in which individuals are forced to stay in their racial and cultural lanes.

Social justice warriors often claim that cultural appropriation is tolerable if the appropriator approaches the culture with respect, and pays homage to their influence. But Mars does both. He says, “In my world, black music means everything. It’s what gives America its swag.” And he’s open about being deeply influenced by an array of black musicians. But that doesn’t seem to be enough to satisfy many critics.

Social justice warriors also mirror the alt-right in how much they care about race. Cultural appropriation witch hunts lock people into a small set of hobbies and careers based on their race. With enough witch hunts, your race becomes your destiny.

Notorious white supremacist Richard Spencer noted this in an interview with a New York Times magazine contributor. “This is the photographic negative of a white supremacist,” Spencer said, referring to the way social justice warriors care deeply about race.

When we fetishize race and claim that members of certain races should only be allowed to partake of certain activities, we encourage racial division. A truly cosmopolitan and pluralist worldview would deem your race as irrelevant to your future opportunities as your eye color. This is a future that both social justice warriors and the alt-right rail against, and we should reject both of their critiques of multiculturalism.

Identity Politics Justice Is How You Get Real And Metaphorical Lynchings,"How many of the #CancelKavanaugh and #BelieveSurvivors protesters are aware of the reason the NAACP was founded? There was a time in history that believing a survivor before examining all the evidence led to innocent deaths and destruction of communities. This is a good time to refresh our memories.

Leftists who have convicted Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault by mob rule have not convicted him based on evidence, but based on political ideology. Leftists are reopening the door to a dark and dangerous time in history by giving credence to accusations based on race or political ideology.

One-hundred and ten years ago, an event occurred in Springfield, Ill., that led to founding one of the most influential African-American organizations. It didn’t begin at a lunch counter, the back of a bus, or in a school. It happened because a white woman falsely accused a black man of rape. It was a deliberate accusation meant to destroy the black community.

Riots began when an angry mob of white vigilantes descended on the jail, where two black men were being held. Both men were accused of crimes because of the color of their skin. The mob gathered outside the jail with the intent of lynching the men, with no regard to due process. The sheriff created a ruse to move the men to a jail in Bloomington, Ill. to provide them some protection. When the mob learned they had been duped, their rage turned to the black community.

The mob grew to an estimated 5,000 white people. They went on a rampage, burning black-owned businesses and 40 black-owned homes. They attacked black residents as they walked on the streets. Bullets, bricks, and fire were used to try and force blacks from Springfield. Two black men were lynched and mutilated. One of the men owned a barbershop that had been burned earlier in the day. The other man was an 84-year old, retired shoemaker. He was dragged from his home and his throat slit. He was targeted because he married a white woman.

One white business was burned, because the owner had assisted the sheriff in creating a distraction to move the two black men to safety. The state militia was called in to put a stop to the riots and violence. An estimated 2,000 black residents were pushed out of the city during the two-day riot.

The horrific incident in Springfield, Ill., the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, was an alarming reminder of the fragility of black communities. Unfortunately, it was not the first or last of its kind to occur.

A couple of decades later, false rape charges were at the center of two landmark Supreme Court cases. A group of nine black teenage boys were riding a train looking for work. A fight broke out on the train, spurred by a group of white boys claiming the train was for whites only.

The white boys tried pelting the nine black boys off the train with rocks, but their attempts failed. The white boys got off the train and went to the Scottsboro, Ala., police claiming they had been attacked by the black boys. The police arrested the teenagers. When police questioned two white women aboard the train, they claimed the black boys had raped them.

When the case was taken to trial, it was rushed, the boys didn’t receive legal counsel, and physical evidence didn’t support the women’s accusation. Under the Jim Crow laws of the south, mobs commonly lynched black men accused of raping white women.

In the case of the Scottsboro nine, all the boys were found guilty. Some received life in prison, others were sentenced to death. The trials and verdicts were miscarriages of justice. The Scottsboro nine case led to Powell v. Alabama, in which the Supreme Court ruled the defendants had been denied the right to counsel, violating their right to due process under the 14th Amendment.

In the second case, Norris v. Alabama, the Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdicts on the grounds blacks had been deliberately excluded from the juries and therefore denied the right to a fair trial.

The race riots of 1908 in Springfield and the Scottsboro nine are examples of how false rape allegations lead to devastating effects on the falsely accused. Both cases used sexual assault as an excuse to intimidate and unjustly punish blacks, in an attempt to ethnically cleanse towns. Allegations were not based on fact, but prejudice. The cases demonstrate the dangers of mob mentality in seeking a perverse form of vigilante justice by disregarding the fundamental right of all Americans to due process.

The Kavanaugh case cannot be compared to the Springfield or Scottsboro cases in terms of the senseless carnage. The burning of homes and businesses and the murders of innocent men by racist mobs are unparalleled. Black communities in America, especially in the South, were living as third-class citizens denied equal rights with whites. However, bending or bowing to mobs who convict on the grounds of racism or political ideology is comparable.

Chants and hashtags from left-wing groups like “believe survivors” set a dangerous precedent. It’s reckless to base accusers’ credibility on political ideology and the equivalent of a political Jim Crow. Leftists and feminists have been quick to dismiss sexual assault claims against left-leaning men by attributing it to a “right-wing conspiracy,” and the women are smeared. The standard for believing victims of sexual assault by political figures is essentially determined by their stance on Roe v. Wade.

Political identity determines the burden of proof. Women on the political left are treated like white women were under Jim Crow. Their accusations seem to outweigh evidence in defense of the accused. It is being demonstrated daily by the left’s newest resistance trend, #believesurvivors.

Women on the right are treated like second-class citizens, whose credibility is contingent upon socioeconomic status or perceived mental stability. Hillary Clinton once referred to the onslaught of sexual assault allegations against President Clinton as “bimbo eruptions.” She was credited for creating the “nuts or sluts” strategy to smear accusers.

In addition, Ms. Clinton characterized one accuser, Gennifer Flowers, as “trailer trash” and “some failed cabaret singer, who doesn’t even have much of a resume to fall back on.” Are these the advancements of modern feminism, or the archaic standards of justice from a prejudiced society?

Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono prematurely convicted Kavanaugh of sexual assault, not based on evidence, but on his textualist views or, as she said, an “ideological agenda.” Hirono admitted, “I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases.”

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times outlining her justifications for opposing Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Among her top reasons, she wrote, “Judge Kavanaugh held highly ideological views” on “women’s reproductive rights.”

The left has deliberated, and Kavanaugh has been found guilty — not on the evidence, but on the ideology. They disqualified him from SCOTUS on a presumption of guilt. The official charge: sexual assault. The reason for conviction: his judicial “ideological views.” His guilt was lamented long before his nomination.

Mobs don’t stop at lynching or character assassinations. They’re out for vengeance. Sexual assault allegations were and are not their true driving force. In the case of Springfield, it was race. To that mob, blacks were guilty because of the color of their skin, and the prejudices of a racist community. In the Kavanaugh case, it is political ideology. Every Republican member who defends due process will share the same guilt and retribution. Truth isn’t always what it seems to be under this frame of reference.

Mobs aren’t civil; they aren’t interested in due process or civil discourse. They only seek to silence those they hate, and by any means necessary. Denying the right to due process because of any prejudice is an assault to the Constitution. When the presumption of guilt is based on race or political ideology, and endorsed by officials sworn to uphold the Constitution, liberty ceases to exist.

Black Trump Supporters Declare Independence From Democratic Party,"We live in a strange time, when black leaders and activists who work to bring independence, stability, and positive change to black communities across the country are labeled white supremacists.

This October, more than 300 young, black people will meet in Washington D.C. for the first-ever Young Black Leadership Summit (YBLS). This three-day event is sponsored by Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a right-wing youth activism group, and was orchestrated by the organization’s communications director, Candace Owens, and Brandon Tatum, the group’s urban engagement director.

The fact that it’s created by black activists––and advocating for the benefit of the black community––doesn’t seem to get in the way of slanderous voices on the left demonizing the event and its participants. In a hit piece published last week by Rollingout.com, this historic event was dismissed as an effort to “corral Black electoral support for the current presidency.” The article also derides Owens and guest speaker and former congressional candidate Stacey Dash as anti-black.

Ebony magazine ran a short article about the event as well. Although they were more balanced in their coverage, they still characterized the event as a political ploy designed to “drum up African-American support for the current administration.” While the event does take place in the weeks prior to the midterms, YBLS is not a campaign event.

Why Are Black Freethinkers Smeared By The Media?

It should come as no surprise that left-leaning Americans and publications feel all too comfortable smearing blacks who aren’t Democrats. We’ve seen the worst of the worst since the election of President Trump. But leftist myopia cannot change the fact that many people are working diligently to diminish the pathology of groupthink. Many people are also encouraging others to challenge long-held beliefs in an effort to launch their communities into a new period of growth and achievement.

“We stick together” is a common mantra of the left, particularly in the black community. No conscientious objectors go unpunished. Those deemed race traitors are horrifically ridiculed and name-called in a culture that demands complete and total orthodoxy. Group loyalty takes precedence over all else.

We have a recent example of this type of ridicule in the form of another freethinker, Kanye West, who was grossly attacked by leftist media outlets for meeting with Trump in the Oval Office and espousing the same views as many attending YBLS.

“People expect that if you’re black, you have to be Democrat,” West said, less than two minutes into his discussion with Trump. He went on to discuss how the welfare expansion incentivized the destruction of the black family, later touching on mental health issues, bringing manufacturing jobs into middle America, and sorely needed prison reform. Arguably, West’s most incendiary statements were concerning racism.

“The liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are a very proud, emotional people,” he said. “You think racism could control me? Oh, that don’t stop me. That’s an invisible wall.” That statement strikes at the core of the system used to control people’s behavior. Even West, a self-made billionaire, couldn’t contain the fallout.

The Media Can’t Handle Kanye West Speaking For Himself

Within hours of the meeting, CNN led the way in the attempted character assignation of West. Anchor Don Lemon, who is also black, had a panel discussion on his show, where guests commented that “Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don’t read,” shortly before West was called “the token negro of the Trump administration.” Nasty, racist, offensive snubs like this are all too common from the left when you’re deemed disloyal to their groupthink.

West is a symbol and has recently shown there is a new wave of people rising up and challenging established norms. We’re attacked because we are a threat. Writ large, the black vote going to the Democratic Party has been axiomatic. So, opposition from the left––even by other black people––is to be expected because a group of well-organized black conservatives is a threat to their system. The danger posed by groups who think freely is that they cannot be controlled, cannot be “corralled,” and do not subscribe to the notion that they are victims.

“I felt that it was necessary that we reach out to all the African American people from around the country, who are either conservative or open to conservative ideas, to come into a conference together to be informed, to be educated and to be inspired,” Tatum told me in a phone interview.

Unprecedented Interest in Summit

Interest in the summit was so great that TPUSA expanded the number of slots available from 300 to 400. While several locations were considered, the event was ultimately scheduled in Washington D.C., after the White House showed an interest in participating. Many within the Trump administration share a desire to improve outcomes for black Americans, and this event represents an opportunity to directly engage with people who will help drive favorable policy outcomes.

President Trump “believes in the black community,” Tatum said. “We were blessed enough to partner with the White House to do an event in the White House and also have the president speak. …We can get these young people and leaders from all over the country and give them the ability to hear the truth, good information, solid information from leaders like Stacey Dash, Ben Carson, Colion Noir.

“Our goal is for them to go back out to the communities where they live and be leaders there and hopefully be a driving factor in this revolution, which is black people waking up and realizing that what we’ve been doing all this time hasn’t been working. All of our cities that are crumbling are run by Democrats. We have to make a change, and I think these young people are going to be a driving force.”

Critics of the event believe that Trump and conservatives do not actually have the interests of the black community at heart. Those voices long for the days of Barack Obama, when they believe things were much better. However, the data tell a different story. When talk show host Tavis Smiley, who is black, was interviewed by Bloomberg Politics, he was asked if blacks were better off under the Obama administration.

“Black America has lost ground over the last decade,” he said. “Over these last 10 years––most of that on [Obama’s] watch––black America has lost ground in the major economic indicator categories.”

The Trump administration, by contrast, is willing to meet with leaders who have ideas and a commitment to making measurable gains in the black community. This is significant because by accepting ideas and meeting publicly with those who insist they aren’t there just for a photo op, there is a power shift and the administration is then subject to demonstrating results. Just as we saw with prison reform, the pressure intensifies for the administration to actually enact change or suffer the political consequences of inaction down the road.

A Seat at the Table

Cynicism and pessimism are in no short supply these days. But a sense of optimism is what is behind this event. We have a seat at the table, an opportunity to not only network with people from around the country, but to be heard directly by policymakers. It is an opportunity not to be squandered.

Naysayers criticizing from the cheap seats can speculate as to the motives of the president and the participants, but we are interested in forcing change. We are interested in accomplishing that which has long been promised, but never fulfilled––better schools and jobs, criminal justice reform, social programs that don’t displace fathers, less crime, and increased prosperity.

“I’m going to YBLS because I strongly believe it’s time for blacks to have a choice. We can’t just hide in some closet somewhere and ‘resist’ when there is not a Democrat in the White House,” Rob Smith, a self-described black, gay, Republican veteran and political commentator told me via email. “I’m proud to be a part of a new movement of visible and proud black conservatives and I think this is a historic moment that I do not want to miss.”

Like Smith, I am honored and humbled to be one of those attendees. The future of this country rests on those willing to shake off their mental shackles and pursue a vision of a bright future, not simply hide behind injustices of a dark past.

Cultural Appropriation’s National Holiday Is Called Halloween,"If cultural appropriation had a national holiday, it would be Halloween. That’s the day on the Western calendar when African-American tykes don the outfit of Black Panther, a superhero created for Marvel Comics by two Jews born in Manhattan to immigrant parents from Romania (Stan Lee) and Austria (Jack Kirby).

The names of both those comic-book creators are themselves appropriations (i.e., Americanizations): Lee was born Stanley Martin Lieber; Kirby was born Jacob Kurtzberg. But when you see an African-American child in a Black Panther outfit, it’s difficult to know who is appropriating what culture.

Is the young black child appropriating a Jewish creation? Or were Lee and Kirby appropriating African culture? The proper answer is: Who cares?

Is There Such a Thing as Alien Culture?

Black Panther is a great fictional creation whose current cultural status owes much to African Americans such as Ryan Coogler, who directed the recent film version of the story; Kenyan-Mexican actress Lupita Nyong’o, the film’s leading lady; Daniel Kaluuya, an English actor of Ugandan heritage who plays Black Panther’s best friend; and Andy Serkis, who plays a villain in the film and is a white English actor whose father was an Iraqi-born Armenian.

Try untangling all of that and determining just exactly what culture is responsible for the phenomenon known as Black Panther. Me, I don’t really care. I’m just glad it exists and has brought pleasure to millions.

This Halloween you may also see plenty of children—black, white, Asian-American, etc.—wearing Superman costumes. Superman also is the creation of two Jews: Jerry Siegel, born in Ohio to immigrants from Lithuania; and Joseph Shuster, born in Toronto to immigrants from the Netherlands.

Superman is neither a Jew, an American, nor even a Canadian (neither is he a bird or a plane). Superman is an alien from the planet Krypton and his birth name is Kal-El. If you come across a photograph of a Chinese child racing through a park in Shanghai while dressed up as Superman and you find yourself longing to cry: “Cultural appropriation!” first ask yourself: Whose culture is being appropriated?

The Pretend Concern Only Goes One Way

More than likely, no one would ever complain about a Chinese child appropriating American popular culture, because the illiberal lefties who worry about such things are able to see cultural appropriation only when it is the West appropriating from the East, or whites appropriating from blacks. That is odd, because there is a long history of Easterners imitating Western culture, and blacks embracing white culture.

You will occasionally hear an outcry that much of the rock and roll music made by the likes of Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin was appropriated from African-American blues and jazz musicians. No one screams “cultural appropriation” when Leontyne Price, an African American, performs the works of Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but when a white man performs the blues, accusations of inauthenticity will often ensue.

There is no question that Presley, The Stones, and Led Zeppelin were heavily influenced by black musicians. In an era when segregation was still very much the law of the land, Presley was willing and able to veer out of his lane and demonstrate an appreciation of and flair for the music of a culture despised by many white people. Should he be punished for that?

Cultural Appropriation Has Many Benefits

The Stones and Led Zeppelin have occasionally been accused of plagiarizing some of their music from black artists. Actual plagiarism, unlike the phony charge of “cultural appropriation,” can and should be pursued in a court of law. The fact that very few of these charges have prevailed in court suggests that the Stones and Zep are less plagiarists than homage-ists.

If Jimmy Page is a thief (and I don’t believe he is) he can’t be accused of targeting any particular racial demographic. The most famous charge of plagiarism ever brought against him was the accusation that he stole the Celtic-sounding opening riffs of “Stairway to Heaven” from an instrumental called “Taurus,” recorded by the (all-white) Los Angeles-based rock group Spirit. A jury found in favor of Page and his co-writer Robert Plant, although the case lingers in appeals court hell.

Baseball fans should be grateful that Sadaharu Oh never worried much about cultural appropriation. If he had, professional baseball’s all-time leading home run hitter might have taken up Kendo, Sumo wrestling, or some other sport of Asian origin (Oh was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Chinese father).

Instead, Oh took up a baseball bat and swatted 868 home runs over a 22-year career. That’s better than the numbers put up by Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755), and Babe Ruth (714), all of whom were born in the same country as baseball itself, the good ol’ USA. Sometimes it takes an outsider to bring a particular cultural product to perfection.

Who Cares If Some People Like Another Culture?

Junichiro Tanizaki’s 1925 novel “Naomi” is set in Japan between 1918 and 1926 and concerns itself primarily with Japanese characters. Nonetheless it is a paean to the West’s popular culture. The narrator, Joji, and his inamorata, Naomi, are united by their mutual love of the cinema, dance, music, food, clothing, furniture, and the lifestyles of Americans and Europeans. Nearly every page of the book emphasizes the narrator’s preference for the West over the East. Tanizaki himself felt this preference keenly.

Anthony H. Chambers, who translated the novel into English for Vintage International, notes in his introduction that Tanizaki longed to see the traditional womanhood of Japan transformed into the freer, more outgoing womanhood of the modern West. Chambers quotes Tanizaki expressing an affection for modern Japanese novels whose heroines “are not descended from the women of old Japan, who, according to the ideal, were to be gentle and demure.”

No, Tanizaki preferred modern Japanese fictional heroines because “somehow they are like characters in a Western novel. While in reality there may not have been many women like them in Japan at the time, society hoped for – dreamed of – the appearance, sooner or later, of the ‘awakened, self-aware’ woman. In greater or lesser degree, all of my contemporaries who aspired to literature had this dream in their youth. Yet dreams and reality rarely coincide. The elevation of Japanese women, encumbered by centuries of tradition, to the position of Western women would require many generations of spiritual and physical cultivation.”

If a white American man had written that, he’d have been run out of the Western canon by now. Tanazaki’s characters go to American movies, dance the foxtrot, eat American-style beefsteak, seek out American style housing, study English, and long to learn how to play the piano. And more power to them!

Think how much poorer Western culture would be without cultural crossovers such as Seiji Ozawa, born and raised in the East and one of the greatest classical music conductors of the 20th century. As for Yo-Yo Ma, an American musician born to Chinese parents in Paris—what lane is he supposed to stay in?

Is Appropriation Only ‘Racist’ When Westerners Do It?

Harajuku fashion is a youth-oriented style that grew up around the Harajuku Rail Station in Tokyo. Much, if not most, of it is inspired by Western culture. Google Harajuku fashion and you’ll find images of young Asian women wearing Mickey Mouse ears, Yankees baseball caps, flouncy Scarlett O’Hara dresses, Disney princess outfits, Catholic schoolgirl outfits, and other Western-style garb. Most of these photos look like they could have been taken at an American high-school Halloween gathering.

Of course, if Stefani had an all-white back-up troupe she’d probably be accused of excluding minorities.

For decades none of this was especially problematic or controversial. But in 2004, when American singer Gwen Stefani added to her act a group of backup dancers called Harajuku Girls, she was almost immediately lambasted for cultural appropriation and worse, by Korean-American comedian Margaret Cho and others.

Even ten years later, as Stefani was mounting a career comeback, Time ran an article headlined: “Before We Embrace Gwen Stefani’s Comeback, She Owes Us An Apology.” The author of the article, Eliana Dockterman, insisted that Stefani’s flirtation with Harajuku style “perpetuated some extremely racist stereotypes.”

Stefani called her performances with the Harajuku Girls “A ping-pong match between Eastern and Western.” But, said Dockterman, “Her obsession with the culture walks a very thin line between admiration and appropriation.” She accused Stefani of inciting “a common cultural practice of white female pop stars using other races as props.”

Of course, if Stefani had an all-white back-up troupe she’d probably be accused of excluding minorities. God alone knows what Dockterman must think of Christmas albums by singers such as Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand, both of whom are Jews!

What About Actual Racism by Non-Whites?

Curiously, culture warriors such as Dockterman and Cho never seem to have anything to say about Asians’ anti-American racism. Above, I mentioned Oh’s record of 868 career home runs. I didn’t mention that, for 38 years, he held the Nippon Professional Baseball record for most home runs in a single season (55). He held that record for so long only, however, because of outright racism from many people in Japanese professional baseball.

On several occasions during that 38-year period, American players in Japan had a chance to break Oh’s record. But whenever they got within a run or two of doing so, Japanese pitchers and managers conspired to prevent them from ever seeing a hittable pitch.

An unnamed Giants coach threatened a fine of $1,000 to any pitcher who threw a hittable ball to Bass. He was intentionally walked four times.

In 1985, American Randy Bass needed one home run in his final game to tie the record and two to break it. He was playing against the Yomiuri Giants, a team managed by none other than Oh himself. An unnamed Giants coach threatened a fine of $1,000 to any pitcher who threw a hittable ball to Bass. He was intentionally walked four times.

In his fifth at bat, he swung at an intentional ball and managed to poke it into the outfield for a base hit. But the record remained unbroken. In 2001, the same thing happened to American Karl Rhodes, who was playing for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes.

According to Wikipedia: “The Buffaloes played the Oh-managed Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks on a late weekend series in Fukuoka. Rhodes was intentionally walked during each at-bat. Hawks catcher Kenji Johjima could be seen grinning as he caught the intentional balls. Again, Oh denied any involvement and Hawks pitching coach Yoshiharu Wakana stated that the pitchers acted on his orders, saying, ‘I just didn’t want a foreign player to break Oh’s record.’ Rhodes completed the season with 55 home runs.”

In 2002 American Alex Cabrera had 55 home runs with plenty of games remaining in the season. At that point, according to Cabrera, “The last 20 at-bats of the season I think I only saw one strike. They didn’t want me to get the record. All records are for the Japanese.”

That kind of casual anti-American racism goes largely uncommented on by America’s social justice warriors. But in 2017, when Denver Post sportswriter Terry Frei tweeted that he was “very uncomfortable with a Japanese driver winning the Indianapolis 500 during Memorial Day weekend,” the SJWs attacked him mercilessly. Frei apologized quickly, but it wasn’t good enough. Within 24 hours he had been summarily fired from the Post.

Appropriate It Up, Folks!

On Halloween night, all across America, you can find the children of Chinese immigrants dressed up as Barbary pirates, African-American boys and girls dressed up as Spiderman, proper young Catholic girls dressed up as witches, teenaged girls dressed up as characters from “Mamma Mia” and “Riverdale,” and other kids dressed as Harley Quinn, Wednesday Adams, Shrek, Frankenstein, or Dracula.

Sadly, you probably won’t find many white kids dressed up as Black Panther or as Wakanda warriors. To do so would be to risk being accused of minstrelsy or performing in blackface. Black children can emulate and worship white heroes such as Superman and Batman. But white children who try to do the same with, say, Michael Jackson or Black Panther are increasingly likely to meet scorn.

In the 1950s it was white parents who fought to keep their children from embracing any product of black culture, be it the music, the dance styles, or the language. Now, sadly, it’s social justice warriors who are doing the job of those white segregationists of old.

"Kelly Was Fired For Mentioning Blackface. Kimmel, Fallon Performed In It","So Megyn Kelly is getting fired by NBC for questioning whether a blackface Halloween costume is necessarily racist, but Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon can actually perform in blackface and apparently no one cares.

The background, in case you don’t already know (lucky you), is that on Tuesday, Kelly made some pretty benign comments about blackface during a segment on the “costume police,” who now appear every Halloween to terrify and shame anyone who dresses in a costume someone deems offensive.

Responding to comment from one her panelists about racist costumes, Kelly said, “What is racist? Because you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface on Halloween. When I was a kid that was okay as long as you were dressing up like a character.”

She went on to note the controversy that apparently erupted last year when a white woman on “Real Housewives of New York” dressed as Diana Ross, including putting on bronzer to deepen her skin color. “People said that was racist and, I don’t know I felt like… who doesn’t love Diana Ross? She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day,” said Kelly. “I don’t know how that got racist on Halloween.”

For that, NBC has reportedly fired Kelly, who gave a tearful apology on Thursday to no avail. Some have said the network is using this as a pretext to get rid of Kelly’s unpopular show, despite also agreeing to pay out her $69 million contract.

Set all that aside for a minute and consider the staggering hypocrisy on display here. At the 2016 Golden Globes, Jimmy Fallon, who also has a show on NBC, did an impersonation of Chris Rock that didn’t go over very well, especially among the black actors and entertainers in the room.

It reminded the Internet of when Fallon donned blackface for the exact same Chris Rock impersonation in a “Saturday Night Live” sketch in 2000, and Vic Berger did a mashup for Super Deluxe for the benefit of future generations:

Or consider Jimmy Kimmel, who is fond of using his platform at ABC to lecture the American people on morality and politics. Back when Kimmel was doing “The Man Show,” he thought it would be funny to dress up in blackface and impersonate Karl Malone:

It’s kind of funny. So is Fallon’s Chris Rock impersonation. Donning blackface as part of playing a character or doing an impersonation is much different than doing it to mock or denigrate a race, which Kimmel and Fallon were obviously not doing.

But what they did is arguably much closer to the line than what Kelly said. And among those who easily take offense at this sort of thing, there’s no question that Kimmel and Fallon’s actual blackface performances are “worse” than Kelly’s mundane observations about Halloween costumes.

What should we conclude from the double standard on display here? Maybe that NBC is using Kelly’s gaffe as an excuse to cancel her unpopular show. But since there will be no calls to cancel Fallon’s and Kimmel’s shows, we can also conclude that the networks and many of the people who claim to be offended by this sort of thing aren’t serious, and aren’t really offended, and the next time they start howling about Halloween costumes, they should be ignored.

"If You Oppose Trump Due To Racism, You’ve Got Some Rethinking To Do","“If I support Trump, what could I say to the African-Americans in my church?” White evangelical pastor, Birmingham, Alabama.

Some white evangelical elites opposed President Trump to dissociate from racism. In so doing, they misled their erstwhile followers, abandoned the unborn, became the tool of one political party, and harmed African-Americans to boot. Unless they wise up, they’ll do more damage.

These mainly Reformed evangelical elites are my theological homeboys. I never tire of pointing my students to their books, blogs, ministries, and websites. Yet most of them, except Wayne Grudem, opted to virtue signal rather than offer good gospel guidance in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.

The prospect of revisiting, curtailing, or overturning Roe v. Wade alone justified a vote for Trump. Grudem set forth an array of additional reasons why a vote for Trump would be a good moral choice. None had a snowball’s chance of even appealing to, much less of convincing, these NeverTrumpers.

Opposition to Trump promised to feed, but not satisfy their hunger to dissociate from racism. This longing long preceded and shall long outlast Trump. Unlike NeverTrumpism itself, it can claim genuine gospel roots: the longing to do right by race in America.

I share this longing, so it’s my turn to virtue signal. From birth, growing up in Spartanburg, South Carolina, my father nurtured in me a reflexive recoil against even the slightest appearance of racism. Three black women contributed mightily to my raising and spiritual formation.

Between 1968 and 1974, my father, a Little League baseball coach, helped to integrate the city summer league teams. Black players were welcomed into my home. Our family was castigated as “N-word-lovers.” Our house and car were egged more than once. I watched tears flow freely down my father’s face after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis. My father was and remains my hero. And I dutifully voted Democrat.

So to the white reformed evangelical elites grieved over race, I am tempted to say, “I more, of the tribe of Benjamin, Pharisee of the Pharisees, circumcised the eighth day,” and all the rest. But neither the fact nor the depth of this grief guarantees a thing about either my diagnoses of or my prescription for the race challenges of our time.

I Listened, and Learned a Lot

But the posture the white grievers have taken on race does commend itself. J.D. Greear, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, sets it forth every chance he gets—the white men need to begin “with listening, not talking.” Well and good. Experience cannot guarantee wisdom (old fools exist!), but personal experience provides an opportunity for learning and wins a sympathetic hearing the inexperienced have not earned. And none of us white men have ever been black men. So listen first.

That’s what I did. Started listening about the year Greear was born. This was BT, before Thabiti—that’s Thabiti Anyabwile, the African-American pastor who adopted his current name after converting to Islam before converting to Christianity. He’s the designated chief teacher to the white men. So I listened to him, Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Jesse Jackson, Joseph Lowry, and others, and learned a lot.

What I didn’t realize then, and what the white NeverTrumpers show no signs of realizing now, is that majority, establishment black race teaching functions a bit like a Trojan horse. Its exterior promises help for whites to get race right, but inside a long and slow-cooked stew swirls with ready-made race diagnoses and prescriptions. Among the ingredients are identity politics, intersectionality, what John McWhorter calls “the cult of victimhood,” entitlement, white privilege, diversity, reparations, open borders, catastrophizing racism, and catastrophizing sensitivity violations.

The pot’s been cooking since the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Whatever seems to serve the electoral interests of the Democrat Party is thrown in. Whoever partakes of this Trojan horse’s insides, wittingly or not, becomes a tool of one political party.

They seem not to see it, but it was not Grudem nor the majority of evangelicals, the rank and file non-elite evangelical Trump voters, who put politics before all else in 2016—it was them. Remember? As two Baylor sociologists assured us, “You can’t be a Christian and vote for Trump.” They were drunk with the Trojan horse stew ladled out to elites far and wide.

President Trump Is Post-Racial, Not a Racist

The catastrophizing of race and of sensitivity violations are key. This rendered the rise of evangelical NeverTrumpism all but inevitable. Under such conditions, Trump’s rise constituted an emergency.

But that’s not because he is a racist or a white supremacist. Sen. Lindsey Graham nailed it: Trump is “absolutely not” racist, “he’s a street fighter.” He does not care what color you are. If you love him, he loves you, and the reverse. Trump is an equal opportunity insulter.

Trump presents more as post-racial or a-racial. The result is Guinness Book-level racial insensitivity. That’s more than enough to trip the race alarms set by the Democrat Party with help from the mainstream media, Hollywood, social platforms galore, Thabiti, and whoever imbibes that stew bubblin’ inside that horse.

Thabiti voted for Hilary in 2016 and assured us that Roe v. Wade was not sufficient to justify a vote for Trump. Abandoning the unborn this election cycle was admittedly unfortunate, even tragic, but with that race alarm pulled and the sirens screaming and all, well, it was an emergency. Evangelicals, according to Thabiti, “made a Faustian bargain for the mere price of a Supreme Court nominee.” Recall that Faust made a deal with the devil.

Once that devil Trump’s racially insensitive mouth is shouted down and Trump himself is shown the door, then and only then, but definitely then, at last, with the race alarm re-set, concern for murder-marked babies and the Supreme Court can recommence.

New Teachers and a New Listener

With due modesty and visible docility, the white men listened to the teacher and nodded. I’ve been there and done that, listening to Abernathy, Lowry, Jackson, and the rest. Then I ran into new teachers as black as the ones I already had. Unlike Thabiti, these teachers actually came of age under Jim Crow, particularly Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele.

The ideas of Thabiti and of my former teachers are not only wrong, they are harmful to American society, especially to blacks.

These new black teachers taught me that, at least on race, the ideas of Thabiti and of my former teachers are not only wrong, they are harmful to American society, especially to blacks. They also taught me that these pernicious ideas make whites, especially elite whites, feel better about themselves. So they lap it up.

Oh my! What’s a well-meaning, grieved-over-race, listening white man to do? If intersectionality shifts authority on race from the white men to Thabiti, where does that leave Thabiti in relation to these Jim Crow-experienced men now universally impugned as Uncle Toms by the majority of black Americans and Democrats?

Want a national conversation on race? Set Thabiti down in a little chat session with Sowell and Steele, with the cameras running. Now who needs to listen rather than talk?

As a white man I have nothing to tell Thabiti about race except that I agree with the black teachers who disagree with him. But to the white men I say this: you’re not doing near enough listening.

He will show you that you are mainly in this for yourselves, not blacks.

If you’re a thinker by instinct, let Sowell bury you over and over again with facts Thabiti either does not know or does not mention in public. If you’re a feeler like me, start with Steele. He’s the psychologist and physician of the soul here.

Want to be productively ashamed of yourself in a whole new way? Steele can make it happen. He’ll expose how self-serving is the Trojan horse-induced rhythmic oscillation between first feeding then temporarily assuaging the white guilt that only harms the blacks you ostensibly mean to help or at least wish to be seen to care about. He will show you that you are mainly in this for yourselves, not blacks.

Sowell and Steele expose the bitter fruit borne of white-guilt efforts to do right by race, all the patronizing, exploiting, and infantilizing of African-Americans while intermittently genuflecting before them for the cameras. Sound like fun learning ahead? It’s not.

Think you’re courageous prophets crying in the wilderness, standing firm with only each other and CNN to pat you on the head? Buckle up if you trade in Thabiti for Sowell and Steele. Drink this elixir and you’ll find yourself a deplorable skulking around with other deplorables and a couple of ostracized, brilliant, Jim Crow-tempered Uncle Toms.

Want to reach and retain more African-Americans in your majority-white churches, the quintessential Christian badge of dissociation from white racism? That might be a tough pull. But you’ll get race more right than you are now, and do less harm to everyone concerned.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/11/06/oppose-trump-racism-youve-got-rethinking/,2018-11-06
Marsha Blackburn Wins Hotly Contested Tennessee Senate Race,"Marsha Blackburn, a Republican congresswoman, was elected to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night. Blackburn defeated former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen in a hotly contested race that was viewed by many analysts to be a toss-up heading into election day. Fox News called the race for Blackburn at 9:04 p.m. Eastern time.

The race between Blackburn and Bredesen was neck and neck, with Bredesen even leading in multiple polls, up until the battle over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh took center stage. The September fight to confirm Kavanaugh significantly boosted Blackburn, who took her first lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average in early October.

Bredesen, a Democrat who served as the governor of Tennessee from 2003 through 2011, was pilloried by ads tying him to unpopular Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the House and Senate Democratic leaders, respectively. Blackburn, meanwhile, hitched her horse to President Donald Trump, who won the Volunteer State by 26 points in 2016.

Republican Bill Lee, a Republican farmer and businessman from Franklin, Tennessee, easily won the state’s governor race. Several networks called that race almost immediately after polls closed in Tennessee. By a significant margin, voters picked Lee to succeed Republican Bill Haslam as governor. A first-time candidate for political office, Lee bested two wealthy and experienced politicians in the GOP primary by running predominantly positive ads about himself rather than attacking his opponents, a strategy he continued into the general election.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/11/06/republican-marsha-blackburn-wins-u-s-senate-election-tennessee/,2018-11-06
"If His Hologram Tour Piques Your Interest, Watch This Roy Orbison Special","Have you heard that Roy Orbison is touring again? Not in the flesh, of course, but as a hologram. “In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert – The Hologram Tour” kicked off last spring in Europe and is currently in the middle of a two-month jaunt across North America.

According to the tour’s website, not only does “Orbison” sing 16 of his timeless, indelible cuts, he also “reacts” to the audience and “interacts” with the orchestra players who perform alongside him. It’s one of those events that’s billed as more than an event. It’s an “experience,” a chance to encounter the past and be a part of the future all in one sitting. Yes, there are more of these experiences on the way.

I’ll admit that I’m more intrigued than put off by the notion of resurrecting dead singers and musicians as holograms. In theory, anyway, I like what the technology has to offer and the possibilities it entails (and there’s the whole idea of concert-going as a form of secular worship, with holograms functioning as sacred iconography, but that’s a different essay for a different day). If you’re a fan of Orbison, here’s a way to experience the beauty of his voice and the magic of his songs in a live setting. I think that’s cool.

You may disagree, but perhaps hearing Orbison’s name in the news has sparked a desire to explore or revisit his music. If that’s the case, let me recommend a convenient way to both see and hear the brilliance of “The Big O”: watch “Black and White Night.”

If the title sounds familiar, it may be because you’ve seen it featured on one of those PBS telethons. Filmed at the since-demolished Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in 1987 and first broadcast on Cinemax the following year, “Black and White Night” is as straightforward as it is satisfying. It’s a concert movie that’s all about spotlighting the incomparable, pioneering talent that was Roy Orbison.

There’s no documentary or making-of element to it. It doesn’t show prima donnas butting heads or drugged-out special guests barely able to play their parts. It’s just a live show with a cocktails-and-cigarettes elegance. The only drama comes from Orbison’s brilliant body of songs — “Only the Lonely,” “Blue Bayou,” “In Dreams,” “Oh, Pretty Woman,” and more — which he performs with a “backup” band so loaded with talent and star-power that it feels like a traveling Rock and Roll Hall of Fame showcase.

That’s what immediately jumps out as the opening credits roll. You see the names of all these high-profile musicians who wanted to pay tribute to Orbison. It’s the kind of roster that’s usually assembled for an actual tribute concert, but in this case (as with “Hail! Hail! Rock ‘N’ Roll”) the main act was alive and took part in the show. Included in the band: Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, James Burton (and three other members of the TCB Band, which backed Elvis Presley from the late ‘60s to his death), T Bone Burnett, Jennifer Warnes, k.d. lang, and more.

It’s obvious throughout how honored everyone was to perform with Orbison. There’s so much warmth and affection in the air. Just watch Raitt, Warnes, and lang as they joyfully pour themselves into their vocal duties on songs like “Dream Baby” and “(All I Can Do is) Dream You.” Or watch Burnett as he gets rowdy on guitar during several songs. Or look at the huge, toothy grin that’s often plastered on the face of Tom Waits. From basically everyone onstage there emanates this mix of joy, gratitude, and a strong desire to honor Orbison with their talents.

Springsteen takes the cake in this department. He’s an open book the whole time, with his facial expressions and physical gestures conveying all of the night’s emotions. He goes from elation to reverence to an almost awestruck disbelief, like he can’t believe his good luck. Honestly, you’ve never seen the Boss quite like this. In the presence of one of his heroes, someone he said he wanted to sing like on “Born to Run,” he’s often reduced to a puddle of boyish glee.

One of my favorite moments comes during “Ooby Dooby” when the guys are trading off guitar solos and it’s Bruce’s turn. Just watch the way he looks over at Orbison and Burton while he’s playing. It’s almost like he’s searching for approval on their faces, like a young boy who wants nothing more than to please his dad. The same is true when he sings harmony with Orbison.

Springsteen has always taken his job as a musician and performer very seriously, but he did so especially that night. Even when he’s away from the action, the camera often captures him having a moment to himself, looking on at the proceedings in quiet, ruminative admiration. Never has the Boss been so happy to play second-fiddle. It might only be slightly hyperbolic to say that was the greatest night of his life.

At the center of it all is Orbison, of course, dressed in black, rocking his signature sunglasses, and hitting those impossible high notes. I think there’s something about watching Orbison perform rather than just hearing him sing that gives you a deeper appreciation for his artistry and why it works. To borrow from Springsteen (who may have lifted the phrase from someone else), Orbison’s specialty was the “romantic apocalypse”– that collision of innocence, love-drunk emotions, heartache, and potential doom.

But on paper, so many of his songs come off as overwrought, feverish, and sometimes just flat-out ridiculous. Very few singers could approach these songs and make them convincing. But the power of Orbison’s heavenly three-octave voice is such that he lends these melodramas real conviction, real emotion, a real beating heart. His voice is just so expressive and heartfelt.

Think of “In Dreams,” maybe Orbison’s finest song and certainly one of the best examples of his unorthodox approach to song structure. The song consists of seven distinct movements. There isn’t a chorus or a bridge or a repeated verse pattern to be found. It just flows and unspools, following the whims of Orbison’s voice.

But recall what the song’s opening lines are: “A candy-colored clown they call the Sandman/Tiptoes to my room every night/Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper/Go to sleep, everything is all right.” That is too silly for words. It has no business working. It should immediately take you out of the moment. But Orbison’s voice redeems it, and when you watch the performance of “In Dreams” on “Black and White Night,” I think Orbison’s presence plays a role in that too.

He cuts such a gentle, sad, and wounded figure. He’s so old-fashioned, so burger-and-shake. He’s the nerdy kid who either strikes out at the sock hop or can’t even muster the courage to go. All of that imbues the words of his songs with poetic truth.

Or on “The Comedians” (written by Elvis Costello), he literally sings about being abandoned by his girl on a Ferris wheel. Again, it’s achingly precious material, but just watch the “Black and White” performance. It’s mesmerizing. Orbison’s voice and his sad-sap presence combine to transform the lyric, giving it flesh-and-blood. The effect is only heightened by the movie’s gorgeous black-and-white photography and the regular close-up shots of Orbison’s face.

Yet I wouldn’t want to overemphasize the concert’s sad tunes and paint it too much as a funeral march. There was always balance in Orbison’s body of work, something that’s captured to a certain degree in J.D. Souther’s description of Orbison as “the world’s only operatic rockabilly singer.” There’s the desperation and the uplift, the soaring sadness and the high energy. For every downtrodden gem in the show like “Running Scared” (which has a twist ending, I should point out), “Crying,” and “It’s Over,” there’s a shot of life like “Uptown,” “Go Go Go (Down the Line),” and “Mean Woman Blues.”

Of course, the concert closes with “Oh, Pretty Woman,” which gets everyone onstage moving and brings most of the audience out of their seats (an audience that includes the likes of Billy Idol, Kris Kristofferson, Patrick Swayze, and David Lynch, who included “In Dreams” in his 1986 film, “Blue Velvet,” to memorable effect). That’s how it should be. Celebratory, joyful, full of life. Orbison deserved it all.

“Black and White Night” was filmed 14 months before Orbison died of cardiac arrest. It was a humbling triumph for him, one of several key moments in his late-career revival after he had struggled for two decades to make a hit record or be anything but an early-‘60s relic. That same year, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (and the Boss introduced him at the ceremony). The following year, he recorded two albums that both eventually became big hits: one with the Traveling Wilburys then his final solo record, “Mystery Girl.” He went on to become the first deceased musician since Elvis with two records in the U.S. Top Five at once.

Orbison left this world far too soon, but he went out on top, and that’s a rarity in show business. He took his final bow feeling affirmed as a professional. That’s one of the strongest impressions that “Black and White Night” leaves with you. Orbison wasn’t just gifted and influential. He was loved and cherished, and his admirers weren’t afraid to show it.

Stop Shaming White Women For Voting Republican,"White women who vote Republican are facing backlash and bullying because they’re not falling in line with the sisterhood as it wages war against the dreaded patriarchy.

Confounded by this lack of unity, Democratic women want to know what’s wrong with white women and what can be done about it. When the midterms showed a fraction of white women holding fast to their Republican loyalties, black women were offended by the betrayal.

A writer at The Daily Beast wrote an open letter asking, “Dear White Lady, what are you doing to us?” Slate doubled down, accusing white women of self-loathing and hypocrisy—“And, of course, a racist view of the world that privileges white supremacy over every other issue.”

Actress Jada Pinkett Smith said she’s “crushed” that white women don’t vote with their black sisters even though they, as women, should understand what it feels like to be oppressed. Smith admitted she has her own racism to overcome—she’s triggered by white women with blonde hair—but she tries to get past her “biases.” The implication here is that white women can’t get past theirs.

It’s Not Racist to Vote Republican

Calling white people who vote Republican racists is nothing new, but the focus has narrowed and the bullying has intensified as elections tighten. Democrats need all their identity groups to vote lockstep to overcome the “oppressors” who keep America from being the great progressive utopia they believe it can be. Those oppressors, of course, are straight white men.

White women are called a problem in this struggle because they’re not all complying. They have good reasons for this, but some Democrats are convinced racism is the real cause. To slap them back in line, some Democratic women are hurling shame on these divergent voters. By employing white guilt—the fear of being seen as a racist and of losing social standing and the presumption of decency because you’re labeled a racist—they hope to force white women back into their group niches. Once there and drenched with guilt, they are expected to dutifully conform to the anti-patriarchal groupthink that will save the country from its never-abating sins of racism and sexism.

“To understand the ‘white women story,’” Julie Kohler writes at The Nation, “we must first acknowledge that white supremacy remains the prevailing force in electoral politics.” This isn’t true. The real story we need to understand is that of intersectionality and how its political activism is influencing our elections.

Intersectionality is the idea that a person’s moral authority, his or her value and legitimacy in society, is determined by how oppressed he or she is. You are judged by your victim status. Straight white men (a.k.a. the patriarchy) are the oppressors and have no moral authority in determining America’s national identity or its future.

The most victimized, with the greatest value to society, are gay, black women, although the fight for the most victimized group shifts all the time. A transgender Muslim woman, for example, might surpass the gay, black woman in social standing. White women, however, have less legitimacy than black women, and on and on it goes.

The Hierarchy of Victims

Despite this hierarchy of victimization, intersectionality demands that all victimized groups form a coalition to fight the patriarchy and scrub America of its inequalities and cruelty. Any form of legitimacy given to the white man must cease for America to be redeemed. This makes one wonder if a straight white man will ever been nominated for president by this new Democratic Party.

Intersectionality teaches that because America was once a racist, sexist, and homophobic nation, it lost its moral authority by failing to apply its democratic principle of individual freedom to everyone in the nation immediately. Blacks suffered. Women suffered. Revolutionaries in the civil rights and women’s liberation movements rose up to heal those wounds and right those wrongs. They succeeded.

One would think our nation has grown and learned from its past sins, that we now have freedom and equality for all because the very foundation of Jeffersonian liberalism compelled change. But, according to intersectionality, that didn’t happen. Racism and sexism are ingrained in our institutions, in the very fabric of our nation, even in our DNA. The continued legitimacy and power of white men is cited as evidence of this ongoing racism.

Intersectionality and the Democrats who adhere to its dogma with a religious fervor recognize that two American identities are at war—the one held by progressives who see America as an oppressive nation that needs enlightened victims to take power away from the patriarchy to establish equality for all, and the other held by conservatives who see America as a land of individual liberty that has overcome its past sins of racism and sexism. These two political groups now share no common national identity; they seek no compromise with the other side. This is a war and, according to progressives devoted to intersectionality, white women are on the wrong side.

“Today the Left and the Right don’t work within a shared understanding of the national purpose; nor do they seek such an understanding,” Shelby Steele writes in “Shame: How America’s Past Sins Have Polarized Our Country.” “Rather, each seeks to win out over the other and to define the nation by its own terms.”

Is America Intrinsically Racist and Unfair?

Many on the left want to transform and re-imagine America because they think it is intrinsically unfair. To save America from itself, from its own racism, progressives must be in power. Until then — to them — America will remain a black spot in the world, stigmatized by its oppression of various marginalized groups.

This dark view of America is what causes some black women to be confused by the voting habits of majorities of white women. As Smith lamented, “Don’t they see they’re part of the oppressed groups?” This is one reason black women vote nearly 95 percent for Democratic candidates. The Democratic Party is painted as the party of intersectionality. It’s the party of transformation. It’s the party of salvation. It’s the last, great bastion of hope to save the country from the evil white man.

Such a view of America is, of course, a lie. White racism is not today the dominant cause for black Americans’ pervasive struggles. Women are not oppressed because they on average make different professional choices than men do on average, and therefore (sometimes) make less money. There is no legal discrimination in the United States that forces victimized groups to live in poverty, disappointment, or despair. As Steele writes:

Blacks have now risen to every level of American society, including the presidency. If you are black and you want to be a poet, or a doctor, or a corporate executive, or a movie star, there will surely be barriers to overcome, but white racism will be among the least of them. You will be far more likely to receive racial preferences than to suffer racial discrimination. Those who doubt this will always point to today’s long litany of racial disparities. Blacks are still behind virtually all other groups by the most important measures of social and economic well-being: educational achievement, home ownership, employment levels, academic test scores, marriage rates, household net worth, and so on. The fact that seven out of ten black women are single, along with the fact that 70 percent of first black marriages fail (47 percent for whites), means that black women are married at roughly half the rate of white women and divorced at twice the rate.

But, Steele continues, “Today’s racial disparities are due more to dysfunctions within the black community, and—I would argue—to liberal social policies that have encouraged us to trade more on our past victimization than to overcome the damage done by that victimization through dint of our own pride and will.” While individual racism and sexism can be found in America—as it can in every part of the globe—systemic and institutional racism, the kind that keeps people from being free to pursue their interests based simply on their race, simply doesn’t exist here today.

The reason many white women don’t vote for Democrats is they see the truth—that identity-based victimization is mostly a fabrication. Many such women don’t want government empowered to right some imaginary wrong. White women aren’t proving they’re racist or self-loathing when they vote Republican. Many are voting to conserve an America that has overcome its oppressive past and now values individual liberty for all. Many vote for platforms, agendas, and policies that support this view of the country and seek to retain that liberty, not sacrifice it to rectify nonexistent inequalities that result from discrimination.

We Won’t Be Shamed Into Voting For Democrats

The white women who rely on evidence, experience, history, and reason to determine truth instead of putting ideology before facts will not be shamed into voting with the intersectionality coalition of victims. The notion that they’re oppressed by the patriarchy just won’t fly with such voters. They know there’s no patriarchy holding them down. They know white men as a group aren’t oppressing black people as a group. They see the progressive agenda for what it is—a quest for power, not liberty—and they will fight for the American national identity of individual freedom that has made our nation great.

Life is full of inequities because that’s the nature of life. That’s what it means to live as individuals, each of us expressing ourselves in our own unique ways. When that happens, when individuals are free to live without government imposing obstacles through policies and regulations meant to equalize everyone, true diversity that goes beyond sex and skin color is the result. Some people will succeed. Others won’t. Some will be rich. Others will be poor. This is life. Progressives deny those realities.

Not all white women see the truth, however. Many vote for Democrats’ lies. One reason is devotion to abortion, but another, more subversive, one is white guilt. Women who value their social status over their own liberty from government power will cower to the shame imposed on them by the devotees of intersectionality.

Women are typically particularly sensitive to appearances. They want to be seen as nice, tolerant, accepting, caring, and, of course, not racist. That would be the worst. So many fall for this manipulation. They don’t want to be labeled as one of those people who can’t overcome America’s racist history. They don’t want the stain of racism on their pure image. They run from the horror of being stigmatized.

The white women most prone to this are wealthy suburban women who value status above all else; academics who can’t bear to be shunned from the in-group of intellectuals; young women who let emotionalism and devotion to the group override their rationality; religious women who are more concerned about appearing decent and socially acceptable than standing for the truth; and successful professional women who also care more about status than even their self-interests. To such women, social legitimacy, group acceptance, and moral authority can mean more to them than their own freedom.

My challenge to women of all colors, creeds, and sexual orientations is to put aside agendas for facts. Don’t let false shame, fear of stigmatization, or lies about the patriarchy determine your political choices. Vote as individuals, not as groups. Vote for liberty, not egalitarianism. Mostly, vote according to the truth, not ideological lies fashioned to strip you of your individuality and our nation of its diversity.

Your Gifts And Deals Guide To Imaginative Children's Toys,"I have five children and close experience with dozens more in educational settings, as a teacher, mother, and education reporter. Over the years I have developed strong opinions about raising children. These affect my choices about what to buy them for gifts. So I will declare my basic assumptions then follow with a children’s gift list that reflects it, focused on ages toddler through middle school. This is not a comprehensive list because I have Thanksgiving cooking to do, but more of a rundown of some gifts my children have loved and that coincide with black Friday deals this year to boot.

Children need and deserve to develop their ability to govern themselves. That is, in fact, the process of becoming an adult in a nutshell: Going from utter dependence to full independence. Parents’ job is to do what teachers call “scaffolding”: erecting a support structure that they gradually take away as the child grows. Parents should generally do nothing for their child that he can do for himself, and require children to contribute to the family to their full capacity at each age.

For example, my eight-year-old mows his own patch of our lawn. On Saturdays he cooks the family pancakes or waffles using a homemade mix. He is perfectly capable of these things and enjoys the responsibility. For his eighth birthday we gave him a set of walkie talkies (not a cell phone because it has too much baggage) and an ordered list of “achievements to unlock” to earn the ability to walk to more and more distant locations in our neighborhood, such as friends’ houses and parks. (Menards has a better black Friday deal on a walkie talkie set this year: $17 from 6 a.m. to noon in-store only.)

In gift-giving, my ideal is to give something meaningful and substantive. My style is “classic” — meaning I far prefer wood to plastic and get a thrill out of ignoring those manipulative gimme ads from today’s passing children’s TV show. Good gifts open worlds to children and facilitate their development as a person. They avoid compulsion to spend money without a good purpose and to serve the ends of retailers rather than my own. They are not fad-bound but of long-lasting value in personal growth.

Books are also go-to gifts for me, but that’s an entirely separate list due to the amount of possibilities.

Free and Open-Ended Play

Psychological research shows that free play is essential to developing executive function in the brain — essentially the capacity to manage yourself, to make decisions, and develop good judgment. This requires taking age-appropriate risks and the lack of constant adult supervision and interference. I find that adults are particularly helpful in getting things going — helping kids learn the rules of a new game or setting up the pieces the first time, for example — and after that do best to buck out and let the kids carry on.

To this end, outdoor games and gear are an excellent choice. One of the simplest and most versatile is a jump rope. From grade schoolers to gym rats, jump ropes are fun, inexpensive, portable, and allow for a variety of skill levels. I recommend including a workout book or video to get your giftee started.

Here’s one aimed at adults that would particularly attract older kids (late elementary through high school), especially boys. Here’s another aimed at crossfit, boxing, and MMA enthusiasts.

Those plastic jump ropes have less tangle but also hurt more, so if you’re buying for an early elementary child I recommend these soft ropes. Include one of these books to get them started.

This one could also be filed into hobbies, but a small but adult-quality shovel and pair of child-sized work gloves will also set children of all ages and both sexes at any mud hole, sand pile, stack of leaves, rock grouping, and mulch pit you may have or be kind enough to set up in your yard. Get them a galvanized bucket to boot, and they will be over the moon (and you will be happy you didn’t buy five plastic sand buckets in a row because those are crap and they break immediately).

We own these and they have endured lots of abuse as well as almost daily play. For this kind of thing I recommend not wasting your money on play sets made of plastic or kiddie toys. Get the real thing and it will last longer.

Klutz books are hard to beat for a creative and engaging combination of explanation and activity. Here are a few currently in print that I’d buy for my kids (click on the picture to buy on Amazon). I also buy the out of print ones. You can get them at Joanns.com with coupon code Rank349 for $3 flat shipping and a 35 percent discount that makes several cheaper than on Amazon currently (to find coupon codes that apply wherever you shop, I use the browser plugin Wikibuy — without signing up for an account, to reduce data surveillance).

Michaels also is offering a black Friday deal of buy one, get one 50 percent off on similar activity kits. If you stack that with their 30 percent off coupon (code THANKS118) while buying Thursday from 6 p.m. to midnight, you will get two items at about half off.

Constructing and Fighting

Imaginative play is also key to children developing executive function, as well as their empathy and their understanding of history and psychology. Rough and tumble play is particularly crucial for child development: it teaches them about boundaries, how to control their strength and bodies, and how to appropriately use their aggression.

For my three sons and the tumble of male compatriots that rolls constantly about our house, I’ve found that guns are the number-one played toy by far, perhaps tied at the top with Legos. Legos are obviously more appealing to both sexes. Little girls love the girly Lego sets.

Here’s where I check on the latest Lego deals going around the web. Almost never do Legos go on sale for more than 35-40 percent off, so that’s usually my buy price. If you’re buying Lego for little kids, seriously, don’t bother with the expensive sets. They can’t build them and half the pieces will be soon lost in your home’s air vents. Just get them a box, perhaps with a book of building ideas, and save the special sets for older kids who will guard them — late elementary age or so. I also like the Lego City sets for this age range, especially because I don’t like to buy my kids dual-branded stuff (e.g., Harry Potter Legos, movie-themed Legos, etc.).

This year Walmart is offering a black Friday deal of a large $20 Classic box. Also, pro tip from a Walmart manager: Do not venture into Walmart on black Friday. Buy online, starting Nov. 21 at 10 p.m. ET.

There are a great variety of toy guns. If your child is eight years or older and you have a place to take him or her shooting, you might consider a BB gun or the child’s first .22, but it’s beyond my knowledge base to recommend specific ones so we’ll stick to the toys here. Selection depends on whether you want to build up an arsenal of one kind for protracted wars or offer a variety pack for different kinds of play.

There are two basic kinds of toy weapons, and both are played differently: Ones that fire missiles, and ones that don’t. For the former, Nerf is the unrivaled king. It is very coveted by boys and usable for all ages from as soon as they can pull the trigger right up through adult. Teens often like to graduate to Airsoft and paintball games, but they still can and will pick up a Nerf gun for a little cross-age fun.

In my estimation, Kohls has the best black Friday multi-gun deals on Nerf this year, with a general buy one, get the second for 50 percent off promotion. I think this one is the best big gun at Kohls for the money, and these are the best low-cost pair for the money. Kohls’ black Friday deals are live online right now. But Walmart’s Nerf Dominator for $20 deal starting Wednesday morning is highly competitive for a big gun. I’m going with Kohls because I have to outfit three boys. If I were just buying one I’d go with Walmart’s Dominator as the best single-gun deal.

I also recommend stocking up on Nerf bullets (or “darts”). For best cost per dart, buy the huge pack for $10 per 200 on Amazon — the off-brand shoots just fine, so there’s no reason to pay double — but after we chopped up all 200 in our lawnmower, I recommend you release the bullets in groupings of about 20 and require the boys to pick up when they’re done. Unless you’re made of money and don’t mind blue foam bits all over your yard forever.

Walmart also has the best Nerf ammo prices if you want buy name-brand or need non-generic Nerf darts like Mega Bullets.

Sturdiguns may look basic but they are hugely popular among little boys in our house, from age toddler through middle elementary. I get the smaller-sized ones for the tots and the larger ones for the bigger kids. They are indeed sturdy. They are the first thing visiting boys pull out of our weapons cache with a huge grin on their faces.

The thing you have to watch out for here is boys thwacking each other, but I’ve found if you threaten to take away the toys completely the first time it happens they will shape right up. Bigger boys would probably be able to actually fight with them without clocking each other constantly, but my little boys aren’t.

If you’re still worried about the potential for bruises, check out this awesome array of foam battle gear from WhomBatz.

So I focused on war here because that’s basically what boys gravitate towards when they get together. But imaginative play obviously has many other possibilities. One of the most on-trend things I’ve seen recently is silk scarves. These can be almost anything, from a fort to a cape to baby swaddling to a tablecloth to you name it.

You can pay $20-60 here at the eco-mom place, which is running a black Friday sale, or you can do what I did and buy a floaty large square scarf from Goodwill for $2. Yes, real silk is gorgeous. But also: $2. Or you can buy a whole set of floaty scarves from Lakeshore Learning for $17.

Playscapes

One of my favorite mental categories for play opportunities is what I call “playscapes.” That’s essentially a setting for pretend. Basically, it’s dolls but not only with dolls. For example, for the preschool and toddler set, this Melissa and Doug farm mat play set at Khols on a black Friday deal for $16.

Fisher Price’s Little People are the classic example of this kind of thing, and I’ve been slowly adding Little People playscapes. I like that they are all compatible and indestructible, although they used to have a cleaner, simpler, more attractive design. They’re aimed at toddlers and preschoolers, but elementary schoolers will play with them quite fixedly if you have a good selection.

Kohls has them for buy one, get one 50 percent off this black Friday, and Amazon generally has good prices. I prefer the ones that make fewer noises.

The on-trend bigger kids’ version of this — besides Lego, of course — are the variety of little critters and houses for them, such as the Peppa Pig, Calico Critters, and Woodzeez. This year the hands-down best deal I saw for these was Walmart’s black Friday $40 for the Lakeside Lodge or Adventure Treehouse Calico Critters gift set, which retail otherwise for $90.

If you want something a little less commercialized and less plasticky, this site has a wide range of natural playscapes, many of which the child would construct himself, an added bonus. For example, this fairy house set.

Perhaps the ultimate in open-ended playscapes are train sets and wooden blocks. Both are also a multi-year and multi-age option, because if you have enough components you can have preschoolers through adults building these.

My husband’s family growing up slowly amassed a fabulous wooden train set thanks to annual theme gifts from an uncle. We liked the idea so much we decided to do the same thing, and are slowly building our own wooden train set. Every year I look for another add-on. The main brands are all compatible, although Brio is the premiere brand.

This year I bought what I thought was a good deal from Kohls’ black Friday offerings: A Melissa and Doug set that has pieces we want and thanks to a double discount was about 40 percent off the sticker price. A bigger set for those starting out has a similar discount.

For wooden blocks, I recommend the preschool-classic standard-unit size blocks. They are widely available in many brands, and all compatible. You want to get both just the basic sizes and then some accessory blocks, like this Melissa and Doug architectural set or this Keva cutouts set. The Melissa and Doug sets regularly go on sale for at least 40 percent off around holiday time. Stage is offering a great architectural set for a $20 doorbuster this black Friday.

Board and Table Games

Growing up, my siblings and I played a large variety of card games. Today my sweet spot for a family game is something a wide range of ages can play at least at some level. Some card games — like War and Spoons — accomplish that. Also fitting the bill are board games like Parcheesi, Sorry, and Memory. My kids also like Chutes and Ladders, but I refuse to play that because it’s infuriating.

My goal in a game is to create memories of joy and laughter with my family (and any friends who might happen to be around at game time) to strengthen our relationships. So far we’ve kept it simple, but more gamey friends have helped introduce us to some perhaps less-common but still very fun games that fit our need for age-inclusive play.

The first one I want to mention is Quixx. It is a simple-enough, fast-moving game that accidentally also builds kids’ sense of the number line, addition, and subtraction (which is perfect for early elementary schoolers or any kids subject to Common Core). Learning to play goes quickly and it’s a small game perfect for tucking into the car for a camping trip or trip to grandma’s. My four-year-old can play with help.

If your kids have a hard time losing when playing a game, try a cooperative game that helps redirect that competitive edge. Outfoxed was the first recommendation on that front from a board games family friend. Children as young as three (our friend’s two-year-old can play with coaching) can play this game, but it is also fun for older children and even adults playing with the littles.

Slamwich (get this cool tin-box version) and Ticket to Ride are also highly recommended games, more for middle-elementary aged children. Amazon describes the latter as “a cross-country train adventure in which players collect and play matching train cards to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America.” It’s one of those board games that also has many expansion packs, offering multi-year gift and play opportunities.

Hobbies and Skills

One of the best gifts you could give someone is an introduction to a hobby or equipment to feed an existing one. To that end, Joanns is offering a black Friday deal of 40 percent off its many crafting classes, such as the Learn to Sew class, Learn to Crochet, and Learn to Paint with Watercolors. When I was a child my mother paid a local seamstress to teach me how to follow a pattern and other sewing basics, and thanks to it I’ve been able to enjoy that skill for years.

If you’re not near a Joanns or Michaels store, you can buy a membership to an online craft class repository. Or a how-to book or kit, or gifts like these below. With gifts like these, I recommend planning to take some time to do the new skill with the child you’re giving the gift to. Relationships and personal instruction help a new skill move more reliably from a one-time thing to a lifetime thing. Plus, it’s a great “excuse” to build a new aspect into your relationship.

Life-Enriching Experiences

This gift category is highly localized, and wonderful to receive. It would include a family pass to the local zoo, aquarium, or art gallery. It might be music lessons or an art class, or concert tickets. It could be a National Park pass, a summer day camp, or swimming lessons. It could be a contribution to the child’s college or first car fund, or to his private school tuition bill.

There are so many potential gifts like this I will just stop there, but wanted to remind folks that sometimes less-tangible, less-“stuffy” gifts like this can be the very best kind. And because these take a load off of the family budget, they are a two-fer gift to child and parent.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/11/21/your-black-friday-fueled-guide-to-imagination-based-childrens-gifts/,2018-11-21

Black Friday Deal Round-Up",https://thefederalist.com/2018/11/23/brights-2018-gift-giving-guide-black-friday-deals/,2018-11-23
Film Critics' Wokeness Is Reinstituting A Moral Code For Movies,"After Kevin Hart bowed out of the Oscars due to homophobic remarks he made years ago (that he no longer holds), Ellie Bufkin pointed out that virtually no comedian is eligible to host if we abide by the left’s new absurd bar of behavior. Now the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is considering no host at all.

If there’s a point where Hollywood can no longer kowtow to the demands of an extremely social-justice-oriented group of film critics that dominates much of the mainstream, this might be it. It’s a good time to realize that the current crop of film critics who guide the way many of us view and respond to films are uncomfortably clustered together on the ideological spectrum, and that can be dangerous if left critically unexamined.

Like any corner of thought in America affected by polarization, film criticism has been lately feeling the effects of a sort of dogmatic thought in which films are judged by a narrow filter of wokeness. In 2007, Roger Ebert reviewed the Wes Anderson film “Darjeeling Limited” and praised its “Indian context,” noting Anderson and his co-writers Jason Schwartzman and Roman Coppola “made a trip through India while they were writing the screenplay. It avoids obvious temptations to exoticism by surprising us.”

Anderson’s quirky visual style and life-affirming themes of belonging, however, don’t really register to film critics in 2018, as Odie Henderson writes on Ebert’s legacy, RogerEbert.com: “Unlike that Roald Dahl adaptation, ‘Isle of Dogs’ does not have a compelling story, and even worse, it has the most egregious examples of its director’s privilege since ‘The Darjeeling Limited.'” When Ebert passed away in 2013, Ebert’s widow decided to honor his legacy by inviting the nation’s best film critics to contribute reviews, but this seems to be a massively different view of the way Ebert approached movies.

Another example is Glenn Kenney’s review of “Tag.” A similarly innocent comedy about a group of adult friends who have played the playground game continuously for 30 years. Kenny writes: “No one should be surprised, I think, to learn that the actual group of men on which this movie is based are in fact all white. It’s not so much that I’m under the impression that tag is a game most sensible persons of color might consider corny. It’s more that, well, try to imagine a group of African American men feeling safe enough to play ‘adult tag.'”

Kenny is now calling any film that features white people on screen having fun without overt racial commentary to now be racially insensitive. By that same logic, is Ed Helms’ character required to comment on the Flint water crisis when he gets thrown into a pool?

The problem with these reviews is that they focus on a narrowing definition of what’s acceptable: Henderson never gives Anderson the wiggle room to safely delve into the territory of the Japanese director he’s trying to pay homage to in the film. His review echoes those accusing Anderson of sloppy cultural appropriation, which is part of the newfound trend of narrowly defining cultural appropriation as a red flag signaling malicious intentions. This although many have pointed out cultural appropriation has been a necessary ingredient of cultural development that has rarely discriminated between oppressor or oppressed.

Whether one agrees with the criticism above or not, the problem with the state of film criticism is that reviews are written with primary emphasis on the same dichotomy, and when it’s prevalent, it closes the door to other opinions.

The last two Oscar races were essentially decided by which film was “more woke.” Frontrunner “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” (a bold film that is ultimately about female rage and mid-American disenfranchisement) faced backlash for allowing a racist character to be redeemed (again, not valuing the obvious fact that narratives are supposed to work that way). As noted progressive critic Sasha Stone pointed out, the idea that blacks hated the movie wasn’t even accurate, but the noise was enough to sideline the film. More disconcerting, such an argument presupposes that movies are designed to appeal to any one moral school of thought. The year before, “La La Land” got criticism for daring to have a white character be a connoisseur of jazz.

One of the dangers of this advocacy is that it’s not reflecting what people want to see. “Mother!” received a cinematic score of 69 percent, with the reviewers by and large undecided on whether they approved of the film’s feminist messages. While reviewers like Alex Bevan at Pop Matters split the difference between the two camps, Jess Joho at Mashable attempts to posit the film as a feminist manifesto — over writer and director Darren Aronofsky’s own explanations for his film. As the headline-making cinemascore demonstrated, audiences cared significantly less than critics about the feminist underpinnings in determining where it’s a good film.

The same phenomenon occurred with “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” The film was exonerated by film critics for, as one critic put it, being “the most triumphantly feminist Star Wars movie yet,” and “a celebratory inclusiveness that seems entirely in the Jedi spirit,” while the viewer rating on RottenTomatoes went down from 93 percent to 55 percent. Some of the headlines revolved around anger at the social justice messages, and while these arguments of “feminist propaganda” don’t necessarily represent the majority of audiences either (including me), a strong case could be made again that the critics were judging the film based on its congruity to their pet causes rather than its merit as a film.

One of the problems with this advocacy is that misleading arguments become more misleading when presented en masse. Remember the #OscarsSoWhite Campaign that formed in response to 2014 and 2015 nomination slates that had no non-Caucasian nominees? It was widely assumed that the Oscars had been short-changing black nominees. But as of the first year of the movement, the Oscars had awarded nominations to 30 black actors over a 14-year period, which amounts to 10.8 percent of Oscar nominees.

The black population in America, according to the last census, is 12.2 percent. The proponents of #OscarsSoWhite might have been looking at all of Oscar history when citing low numbers, but such long-form views minimized the improvement that the Oscars voting body made on its own without such advocacy this century.

That a critic with an agenda would cherry pick statistics to suit his argument is not ideal, but it isn’t unexpected. The problem, however, is that when an event occurs that runs afoul of a critical community so clustered together in ideology, the sheer volume of articles that cherry pick can blindside a consumer into losing her critical senses.

Look at what happened when the progressive Netflix series “Sense8” was cancelled a year ago. The outrage extended to Vanity Fair arguing that the cancellation was a step back for the network’s mission statement of inclusion, and The Mighty, Bustle, and Indiewire all echoed similar themes. The network was also accused of everything from insensitivity to outright homophobia in a storm of tweets.

If the critics were to have taken a look at the network’s overall history, they would have seen that nearly every show released at the time met some benchmark of inclusion. Word space would prevent me from listing every single Netflix show, but here’s a brief rundown: “Grace and Frankie” has female protagonists and tackles ageism; “Daredevil” and “Atypical” tackle ablest privilege from both the physical and psychological realms; “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” has a female protagonist, and a survivor at that; “Glow” tackles sexism; ”Narcos” features Hispanic actors in a third world setting; “13 Reasons Why” deals with bullying from a female perspective; “Chewing Gum,” “Dear White People,” “The Get Down,” and “She’s Gotta Have It All” tackle the black experience; and “Orange is the New Black” has a little bit of everything. Although headlines of “Netflix does a swell job” don’t make good clickbait, that doesn’t make it any less true.

The danger is that when critics become too restrictive, they start veering closer to the era in the mid-20th century, in which Hollywood was ruled by the Motion Picture Production Code that imposed moral limits on Hollywood. No liberal today would call the motion picture code a positive social development. (The code demanded, for example, that homosexuality never be shown in a good light). However, that’s the kind of development that goes on today all the time.

In the past couple of years, screenings of “Gone with the Wind” were cancelled in New Mexico and Memphis. The informal leader of Black Lives Matter, April Reign, attempted to organize a cancellation of the TV show “The Confederacy.” And the backlash to “Detroit“ (directed by a white woman) made clear that the school of thought that only a black film maker can make movies with a black theme is still strong enough to cause hesitation to green light.

Stone, the influential progressive critic, openly admitted this past week that most movies of the past wouldn’t pass the test today:

Movies like Martin Scorsese’s The Departed, when glimpsed through the lens of the culture that demands every film instruct society on how we should behave, may not be considered right-minded enough to win Best Picture today. It crackles with brilliant dialogue, it tells a truth, but it stars almost all white men and racial epithets are used throughout, from the very first shot. So many great films of the past, when put through the sausage grinder of today, would fail to meet appropriate criteria. … Every so often in American film history you’ll find a movie that accidentally reflects today’s idea of what art should say, but it’s almost like playing the lottery. Good luck.

There’s nothing wrong with expressing concerns about whether an artistic product is handled with sensitivity, but to attempt to limit whether that art can be disseminated comes at a cost, and that applies to objections to Kevin Hart and whatever backlash we will have to brace ourselves for this coming Oscar season. The disconcerting thing about the backlash to “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” a year ago wasn’t whether it was progressive, it was the idea that all movies must be designed to appeal to any one moral school of thought.

Every Oscar loss, every protest, and every mass wave of slanted criticism has an effect on what Hollywood greenlights, and how bold films can be. Like most film goers, I appreciate the novelty of seeing different walks of life portrayed on screen. As someone familiar with the evolution of minorities on screen, I can equally appreciate the opportunities that have come with their increased visibility. However, neither of those things coincide with enjoying watching a critical mass coalesce towards a more narrow and dogmatic form of “inclusivity.”

'Les Miserables' Reveals The Only Vision Of Change That Can Succeed,"There is no lack of competing visions for societal change. The Me Too movement, Black Lives Matter, and the Women’s March all find common ground in a certain vision of change: if enough people gain awareness of the problem and participate in some level of revolt, society will reject whatever the bad action is (sexual assault, systemic racism, lack of gender equality, gun violence, etc).

Such a vision for social change is nothing new. It gets its modern beginning in the mass riots at the start of the French Revolution. The storming of the Bastille has captured the Western imagination for more than 200 years because it seems to fulfill this hope. The people rose up against injustice, overthrew its symbol, and society progressed. Our modern revolutionary organizations hold a similar hope: if the people all band together, “anything is possible.”

Such a view does not cohere with the biblical perspective on human nature, society, or history. The Bible locates hope of change not in human revolution, but in ultimate redemption of reality at the return of Christ. This biblical view is tucked within a contemporary cultural artifact: the currently touring Broadway production of “Les Miserables.” Based on Victor Hugo’s 19th-century novel, this musical is a profoundly Christian play, and it points to the coming return of Christ as the day true change will occur. Because of the quality of its literature, drama, and music, this message has spread worldwide.

A World of Depravity and Despair

The world of “Les Miserables” is beset by numerous social problems. We see clear economic disparity: Jean Valjean is a poor ex-con. Through the gift of Father Myriel’s silver, he becomes a wealthy businessman. Fantine’s tragedy is primarily economic: after losing her job, she finds herself out of options and must eventually become a “lady of the night” to financially support her daughter, Cossette.

What society would be complete without con artists? The Thenardiers represent the criminal class who live by tricking or robbing the economically productive. “Les Mis” shows us the scope of economic options, and the difficulty of moving from poor to wealthy.

Simultaneously, the play reveals an ineffective government unable to foster flourishing for all. The government is represented through Inspector Javert, who constantly privileges the nobility. In his world, the law is unfair, and Javert has no room for compassion or extenuating circumstances. “In mercy’s name” means nothing to Javert’s cold justice.

Finally, the running thematic element of “Les Mis” is an unjust prison system. Valjean’s initial crime (stealing a loaf of bread) receives five years of punishment, extended to 19 for attempted escapes. Upon receiving parole, Valjean discovers he has no possibility of supporting himself. No village wants to hire an ex-con, none but a foolishly naive priest will offer him hospitality.

“Les Mis” shows us a world resembling our own: a society filled with wealth, but rife with inequalities and existent injustices. The play offers us hope for change in the form of two young revolutionaries: Enjolras and Marius.

As young men in 1832, Enjolras and Marius are products of the French Revolutionary spirit born after the chaos of the revolution (1789-1805). Enjolras leads a band of wealthy friends who believe that revolution will solve their problems. His views are summed up in the song “Do you Hear the People Sing?”

Staged with Enjolras singing the initial verse then joined by a chorus, this song opens the revolutionary scene launched on the tomb of General Lamarck. Enjolras presents himself as the visionary who calls others to join him in the revolution. He sings, “the song of angry men, this is the music of a people who will not be slaves again.”

He calls his revolution a “crusade,” and posits that joining it will grant people access to his vision of new possibilities: “When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums, there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.” This revolution will bring the good life.

Such a life does not come without cost: “Some will fall and some will live.” But those who fall are an acceptable price because “the blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of France.” Enjolras encapsulates his goal in the symbol of the barricade: “Beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see?”

Here is the revolutionary dream in its purest. Enjolras has every confidence that at his call “the people will rise” (in the song “Red and Black”). Then evil will be undone and a new world will dawn.

A Second Vision of the Good Life

While Enjolras remains unshaken in his revolutionary fervor, his friend Marius is pleasantly distracted by love for Cosette. The clash between Enjolras’ universal dream of revolution and Marius’ particular love of an individual woman lies at the heart of “Red and Black.” This conflict offers a clue to the argument “Les Miserables” makes about human revolution and human happiness.

The song’s setting is the bar where the revolutionaries gather to plan the revolution. Enjolras is raising morale, and suddenly Marius enters, twitterpated with thoughts of Cossette. Enjolras discovers that his friend has lost the vision, and embarks on a dramatic song to persuade him otherwise.

He explains that “the colors of the world are changing day by day.” Red is “the blood of angry men” while black represents “the dark of ages past.” At the same time, red is also “a world about to dawn,” and black is “the night that ends at last.” Their task is to bring about the new world. There is no time for the foolishness of love, or the concerns of one person!

Marius has forgotten that “now there is higher call! Who cares about your lonely soul? Our little lives don’t count at all!” In one of the best examples of contrast in this musical, Marius sings back his interpretation of red and black. In Marius’ eyes, red reveals that he “feel[s] my soul on fire” while black is “my world if she’s not there.” Red contrasts “the color of desire” with black, “the color of despair.”

Enjolras’ rhetoric is too much for Marius, and Marius rejoins his revolutionary companions. For Enjolras, the revolution demands everything: the individual lives “don’t count at all.” All he can see is the envisioned future on the other side of the barricades. Yet happiness for Marius lies in a relationship with a particular person. By the end of the story, Marius’ happiness survives, while Enjolras’ vision of universal change dies on the barricade.

Something Truer than Revolt

In the course of the second act, the revolution fails. The people do not rise, and those with more guns triumph. After giving the audience reason to love the revolutionaries, “Les Mis” transcends sentimental naiveté to embrace a realistic approach to revolution; the majority of such movements fail.

The final note of the musical is not just the salvation of Valjean, but the hope of earthly redemption that applies to all mankind.

In the song “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,” Marius mourns his friends, revealing the cost of failure. Staged in the same bar where Enjolras, Marius, and their comrades planned the revolution, Marius stands alone. He recalls when “they rose with voices ringing” about tomorrow, “and tomorrow never came.”

Where they expected to find triumph, there is now only the “lonely barricade” bereft of living souls. In the place “where we talked about revolution,” the grieving Marius asks “What was your sacrifice for?” Marius expresses the failure of human revolution to bring about the promised tomorrow; we need something more, something truer, than human revolt can deliver.

From this cry of despair, “Les Mis” mounts to a joyous conclusion. Marius and Cossette marry, the Thenardiers return for one last hilarious scene, and Valjean is escorted to heaven by the souls of Fantine and Eponine. The final note of the musical, however, is not just the salvation of Valjean, but the hope of earthly redemption that applies to all mankind.

Wiping Away the Tears from Every Eye Forever

In the “Epilogue,” all the characters who died in previous scenes return, singing from their positions in eternity. They repeat the “Song of Angry Men,” but with significant twists. “Tomorrow” no longer lies beyond the barricades of human revolution, but in that glorious moment when the eschaton arrives and all creation is redeemed.

Hope is no longer found in political revolution, but rather in ‘the wretched of the earth’ being welcomed to ‘the garden of the Lord.’

“Do you hear the people sing” returns, but it is no longer the “song of angry men.” This is the “music of a people who are climbing to the light.” That light is no earthly government making all things right, but rather living “in freedom in the garden of the Lord. We will walk behind the plowshare, we will put away the sword.” In this garden “the chains will be broken and all men will have their reward.”

These characters still ask “beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see?” but the epilogue adds “somewhere” to “beyond the barricade, indicating that the location is spiritual rather than physical. Hope is no longer found in political revolution, but rather in “the wretched of the earth” being welcomed to “the garden of the Lord.”

The call to pilgrimage there is transmitted by “distant drums.” Hope lies in tomorrow, when this promise of a renewed creation arrives. “Les Mis” ends with assurance that “Tomorrow comes!”

The Heart of ‘Les Miserables’ Success

“Les Miserables” is a superb drama filled with memorable characters, wonderful lyrics, and a redemptive story line. Since its first performance in London in October of 1985, critics have generally despised the show. Since it’s a traditionalist story filled with traditional characters, why, critics wonder, would anyone go see this story?

Part of its strength lies in that it asks the questions everyone wants answered: How can we be saved? How can the world be redeemed?

Yet from 1985 and into 2018, “Les Mis” has been a consistent sell-out show: since 1985, it has been seen by more than 60 million people in 42 countries. Part of its strength lies in that it asks the questions everyone wants answered: How can we be saved? How can the world be redeemed?

“Les Mis” responds with profoundly Christian answers: we are saved through encountering God’s grace, like Jean Valjean did, then living in light of that encounter with Christ. It’s shown through the rest of Valjean’s life after Father Myriel says, “I have bought your soul for God.”

At a societal level, “Les Mis” suggests our hopes can never rest in political revolution. Rather than revolution establishing a government that will undo all injustices, the Bible depicts evil remaining until Christ returns and completes the redemption begun at his resurrection. The earth and those in it are still “groaning,” awaiting the consummation of ages in Christ.

Through its excellent storytelling, “Les Miserables” has conveyed these gospel principles to people all around the world. Perhaps “Les Mis” succeeds because it taps into truths people long to know.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/12/25/les-miserables-reveals-vision-change-can-ever-hope-succeed/,2018-12-25
High-Profile Films Show How To Bravely Discuss Race In 2018,"The slate of high-profile films dealing with the African-American experience that will appear throughout the 2018-2019 awards season—primarily “The Green Book,” “Black Panther,” “BlacKkKlansman,” “If Beale Street Could Talk,” and “Widows”—is an interesting reflection of the recent renaissance of black filmmakers. Spike Lee, who pioneered the current path for films about the black experience that are artistically innovative and pedagogical enough to gain widespread appeal, also has a film in contention this year with “BlacKkKlansman.” The question is whether this new wave has surfaced innovations in the way films can spur discourse about race.

When Lee broke through in the late 1980s with “She’s Gotta Have It,” “School Daze,” and especially “Do The Right Thing,” he was stylistically innovative and self-assured in a way that American filmmakers hadn’t been in some time. At the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, another indie filmmaker with a penchant for experimentation, Steven Soderbergh, won the Palm d’Or for the film “Sex Lies and Videotape.” It was the first time in nine years that an American director had won what was arguably cinema’s greatest international prize. Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,” boasting that same intimacy of scale as Soderbergh’s film, was a runner-up that year.

Lee’s films were thought-provoking and enlightening. At a time of little visibility for black actors or filmmakers, Lee jump-started the careers of Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, and Lawrence Fishburne and ran an entire production company that gave opportunities. “Do the Right Thing,” a film about racial tension on a hot summer day that culminates into a riot, has been cited in countless studies

Not only are Lee’s views being validated today, but black filmmakers have followed in his footsteps, such as Lee Daniels (“Precious,” “The Butler”), Ryan Cogler (“Fruitvale Station,” “Black Panther”), Ava Duvernay (“Selma”), Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”) and Barry Jenkins (“Moonlight,” ”If Beale Street Could Talk”). In 2016 alone there were nine films about the black experience—”Queen of Katwe,” “Race,” “Moonlight,” “Fences,” “A United Kingdom,” “Hidden Figures,” “Birth of a Nation,” “Free State of Jones,” and “Loving”—in wide-release.

Overtaken by His Own Success

As a perhaps inevitable consequence, the impact of Lee’s films has been diluted. “BlacKkKlansman” follows the true story of a black undercover cop who infiltrates the Klu Klux Klan. The cop, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), infiltrated the local branch of the Colorado Springs KKK in the 1970s from a phone line and even developed a relationship with David Duke (Topher Grace).

The thing is, he never actually met with them in disguise. Stallworth simply set things up via phone while a different cop (Adam Driver) actually attended the meetings. In other words, it’s a weak premise. While Lee manages to fashion an entertaining cop thriller, the film’s main hook is that it allows Lee to continue to say something about race.

Therein lies the challenge with a such a heavy slate of recent films about the African-American experience. A great number of films in the past few years, like “A United Kingdom,” “Hidden Figures,” “Birth of a Nation,” “Mudbound,” “The Help,” “Race,” “42,” and Lee’s previous film “Miracle,” feature lesser-known chapters of history that highlight African-American heroism. These films also spotlight the obstacles African-Americans faced at various points in history.

The thesis that racism exists is nothing new to audiences today, so the idea that racism existed is even less of a history lesson that’s worth building a film’s entire theme around. Not that there isn’t something to be gained from looking at different chapters of history, but what makes a film innovative now has to be something different.

Barry Jenkins: Assuming Spike Lee’s Mantle?

Jenkins makes the case well as a spiritual successor to Lee with his film “If Beale Street Could Talk.” Steeped in cinematic history and full of experimental flair, the film focuses on a 22-year-old father-to-be whose life is upended when he is accused of rape and has little chance of fighting the charge due to institutionalized poverty, a racist cop, and a harsh justice system.

It’s shot like a period film but so relevant to the present, with incarceration rates now a hot topic, that it could easily read as set in 2018 if the clothing and music were switched. Additionally, “If Beale Street Could Talk” has the pedagogical focus of a Lee film but also moves the viewer emotionally.

Similarly, “Black Panther” changed the way a film can comment on race by testing the ability of a science fiction work to comment on society through a symbolic looking glass. Whether the film’s current Oscar push comes from an authentic place is difficult to discern, however, because the voices acting on racial politics (those who want to see the first black superhero film properly memorialized) and the comic book geeks hoping Marvel Oscar nominations will bestow legitimacy are very loud. They cloud the film’s reception, as Errol Teichert notes.

Another school of thought is that films about the black experience won’t be ghettoized by that genre label. In this sense, a film like McQueen’s “Widows” deserves a lot of praise for assembling such a diverse cast while making the characters’ racial identities a non-issue. In the cast, there are black people and their struggles , but there are also white people and Latin people with their own problems, and no one’s baggage overshadows that of anyone else. While the film is flawed in story and pacing, it is not a racial parable so much as a film about complex characters who happen to be from different races.

Sensitivity Protects These Films from Stronger Criticism

When Lee’s films first came out, his voice was undeniably brave. As evidence of the film’s ability to promote meaningful discourse, Lee has often told a story about how black and white people see the ending of “Do the Right Thing” a different way.

Ten years ago, Clint Eastwood and Lee got into a shouting match over black people’s representation in World War II films, and the media treated Lee as a provocateur. If that argument happened today, Eastwood would be considered public enemy number one, as the definition of racism has been massively lowered. Attacking Lee would now instantly bring up the “r” word.

Not as much previously, however. Go to the YouTube comments on Lee interviews for the films “When the Levees Broke,” “Miracle,” or “Inside Man” (films that came out between 2006 and 2008), and you will see plenty of nasty vitriol. Lee is currently more en vogue, but through it all, he has been a loud and unapologetic voice. Largely it’s the reception that has changed.

In that sense, all of the above-mentioned films are relatively safe because the vast majority of film critics today see their job description as advocating for films by people of color and women. Sure, getting a film about an obscure mathematician in the backroom of NASA or a cop in Colorado Springs greenlit might not be easy, but once you’re past that step, you’re generally welcomed with open arms.

What It Takes to Be Brave about Race in 2018

Instead, I’d argue that a brave film in 2018 is a film that makes its viewers uncomfortable. In that sense, the bravest film about the black experience is “The Green Book.” It tells the true story of the friendship formed between concert pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and club bouncer Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) as they embark on a concert tour throughout the Deep South in the 1960s.

A brave film in 2018 is a film that makes its viewers uncomfortable.

The film shows two people who are undeniably off-putting in different ways. The pains of being black in the 1960s despite Shirley’s great accomplishments are never invisible for a second, and he garners admiration for handling it all so gracefully. These qualities coexist with Shirley’s negatives, such as a provincial condescension to his travelling companion.

For his part, Vallelonga is highly unfiltered. He says pretty much whatever comes to his head, and some of it is shocking by today’s standards. Vallelonga’s saving grace is that he’s not malignant, just lacking in social graces.

Not only is this novel, but it’s perhaps the most urgent message: To be able to talk and have a meaningful discussion is what we need, even if it means we have to throw being politically correct out the window. Comedy is partially about the release in tension. To see two people get at each other in a productive way that causes a lifelong friendship is not just hilarious but highly cathartic. This isn’t an advocacy for being rude to an African-American acquaintance, of course, but no two characters in a movie should have to carry proper behavior on their backs.

So there you have it: Many of the films this year are admirable, but the most meaningful one is, ironically, by the man who made “Dumb and Dumber.” It’s a film that might run afoul of critics for a variety of reasons as awards season rolls along (for example, film critics now hold it against a white filmmaker for directing something with black subject matter) but audience love for the film is deservedly strong. This is a film with something to say and the finesse to say it well.

Black Mirror’s ‘Bandersnatch’ Is A Technical Tour De Force,"Major spoilers below.

British writer-creator Charlie Brooker’s dark near-future anthology series “Black Mirror” has played on technophilia and technofear since the first episode aired on Channel 4 in Britain in 2011. As a cult following expanded into an international audience, the show has migrated to the broader and larger-budgeted vistas of Netflix, and a fifth series is on the way later in 2019.

But for now we have the first “Black Mirror” movie, and it’s quite a lot in itself: “Bandersnatch,” a breakthrough experiment in audience interactivity that is driving Internet obsessives to geek out over the endless potential story permutations. Professional reviewers are granting it a milder but still admiring thumb’s-up. But will it be a ground-breaker for Netflix, opening up new vistas of visual storytelling, or go down as a bold novelty one-off?

So what’s unique about it? It’s a setup reminiscent of those 1980s choose-your-own-adventure paperbacks: At various points of the movie, you make decisions for Stefan Butler, a 19-year-old fledgling video-game designer in 1984 London.

What It Looks Like You’re Getting Into

Butler (played by “Dunkirk’s” Fionn Whitehead) has a project based on a book that was among his dead mother’s possession, a doorstop of a science fiction novel called—you guessed it. Stefan takes his “Bandersnatch” demo to hot gamemaker Tuckersoft.

The enigmatic Colin is Tuckersoft’s brilliant young game designer, taciturn but seemingly willing to help Stefan. Caught between sniping with a cold, secretive father and commiserating with his empathy-oozing therapist, Stefan drives himself, or is driven, literally crazy trying to complete and emulate the complex multiple narratives of the source novel.

(For extra credit: Bandersnatch was also the name of an actual abandoned video game project by Liverpool-based Imagine Software, which according to Wikipedia went bankrupt on July 9, 1984, the day this movie begins. The word comes from an imaginary creation of author Lewis Carroll.)

Watching “Bandersnatch” on Netflix requires some selection-capable functionality (e.g., a computer mouse) because the movie at various points makes you choose between two options, each leading Stefan down a different narrative path. Some choices are silly, like which cereal Stefan will have for breakfast. Other decisions are much more momentous, and some are eventually forced, suggesting there are limits to free will, a suspicion Stefan begins to pick up on.

There’s More Down That Thread

The Hollywood Reporter got a peek behind the mirror and found 250 different segments and five endings with multiple variants, with more than 1 trillion possible combinations of story based on the decisions viewers make. One convoluted path ends at an old-fashioned “Easter egg” — a playable ‘80s-style video game named after a “Black Mirror” episode.

There are several references to previous episodes scattered within “Bandersnatch.” The story gets more “meta” as it goes, as the parallel tracks of our choices and Stefan’s doubts about his reality begin to join up. Stefan in his paranoia suspects he is being controlled by outside forces, imagining a bizarre “streaming” entity from the 21st century that calls itself “Netflix.”

Then it dawns on you that he’s right: We are controlling him. The enemy is indeed us. A New York Times critic wrote: “The idea behind the interactive push is simple: Viewers will care more if they are complicit.” Not only can you not have the story of “Bandersnatch” without that conceit of control, the story is the conceit.

It’s a Video Game Movie

All this makes “Bandersnatch” rather difficult to discuss in the conventional way, but let’s give it a shot. It’s directed by David Slade, who also handled one of “Black Mirror” season four’s best efforts, the sleek, minimalist “Metalhead.”

“Bandersnatch” is quite different, set not in the near future but in a very specific past (July 9, 1984, remember). For this 1980s nerd, there were disappointingly few scenes of the game itself, but they look great, resembling a genuine leap for 1984 technology while also looking very much like 1984 technology.

Yet the story has a slightly airless quality, especially after some scenes become familiar through repetition. There’s no conventional emotional arc of highs and lows, downfalls and redemption. There are memorable scenes, depending on the choices you make, some gruesome, some darkly playful, like when Colin introduces Stefan to LSD, or when the therapist breaks out the swords.

The cast feels a little underpopulated, although one can sympathize with filmmakers who had enough story branches to attend to without juggling additional characters. One can only imagine what the script looked like, although there’s no visible strain in the actors’ performances.

It’s alternatively refreshing and unnerving to watch a movie without having an idea when it will end. Like life, your version of “Bandersnatch” is based on decisions you haven’t made yet (or have not yet been made for you—unless it’s all predestined….wait, am I in a “Black Mirror” episode?).

It’s less a narrative than an experience. There is no chance to completely lose yourself in the story when you’re constantly being pulled out of it and made to click. Then again, it’s also not something you can casually keep an eye on while scrolling on your phone.

Caveats aside, “Bandersnatch” is a tour de force technical achievement. Although Brooker has previously sworn off message movies, in “Bandersnatch” this experimental medium truly is the message. As you make the choices for Stefan, the nagging question surfaces: Who or what is making choices for you?",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/04/black-mirrors-choose-adventure-movie-bandersnatch-technical-tour-de-force/,2019-01-04
The Worst Racism My Children Experienced Came From Black Peers,"In December, McKenzie Adams, a fourth grader from U.S. Jones Elementary School in Demopolis, Alabama, despondent after relentless taunting by other black children for her relationship with a white child, hanged herself in her family’s home. Although suicides resulting from school bullying have sadly risen steadily over the years, McKenzie’s death spoke to me on a very personal level.

In the summer of 2005, while visiting my grandparents in the northeast, my husband and I met up with my cousin, an international teacher, and his new wife, whom he’d met while teaching in Zambia, Africa. In recounting her history, Justina told us of the very recent death of her sister and how her 21-year-old nephew was struggling to feed and care for five siblings as young as 2.

After much soul-searching and discussion, my husband and I approached Brian and offered to adopt his two youngest sisters, who were 2 and 6 at the time. He gratefully agreed, and in May of 2007, after a two-year adoption process that would have stymied any but the most ardent adoptive parents, I flew to Zambia, Africa to bring home our daughters, Barbara and Betty (yes, Betty White).

We knew that adopting two little girls (4 and 9) from the other side of the world into a family of two boys (4 and 2) wouldn’t be easy in terms of bonding and re-assimilating the family birth order structure, but it was the stuff like what little McKenzie Adams experienced that we didn’t see coming, and it quickly blindsided me.

The First Time It Happened, I Was Floored

One day late that first summer, while out shopping, we ran into one of our associate pastors. Our church had provided simply amazing support during our adoption struggles and it was a joy to have the opportunity to visit with any fellow parishioner and clergy about the adoption, the girls, and our new forever family, so I gratefully stopped to visit with her.

As we chatted before we left the store, the pastor, a black woman, suddenly lowered her voice, became somber, and inquired as to how I was “immersing the girls in their culture.” I truly wasn’t sure what she meant, so I asked.

She then began to sermonize about how important it was for me to get the girls subscriptions to “black” magazines and to make sure and watch “black” movies and TV shows so they could see and relate to people of their color. She veritably assured me that, as a white woman, I couldn’t be expected to understand the “black experience” in America. I needed to be sure and make appropriate and relevant material accessible so they could better assimilate with black culture.

As a staunch believer in the dream of Martin Luther King Jr., this pastor’s admonitions didn’t sit well with me. In fact, I knew for certain her guidance for rearing my children was at best perpendicular to his vision. MLK advocated against bitterness and hatred in the black community because his ultimate goal was that “little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.”

I will never forget the heat rising in my face. I must have stared at her as though she’d grown two heads right in front of me. It actually angered me that, instead of focusing on the girls’ adaption to a completely new country and their new lives as Americans, this woman chose to hone in on racial politics, especially as a pastor.

When I finally composed myself, I offered my thanks, but explained that our family didn’t really “see” color, so we had no intention of raising any of the kids in our family to be anything other than “Americans,” hence we probably wouldn’t be comfortable taking that kind of suggestion.

Discontent with my answer and intent upon pressing her point, she continued. She believed my thought process unfortunate because my “whiteness” couldn’t process the fact that the girls’ fate would always balance at the pinnacle of someone else’s prejudicial small-mindedness. It was up to me to make them vigilant of the discrimination that would surely come their way.

Unable to continue the conversation any longer, I told her we needed to get going, said our goodbyes, and exited the store, and fumed all the way home.

My Kids Identify As Americans

Martin Luther King Jr. was no separatist, no racist; he was a uniter with a vision to bring people together. I still struggle to see how in the world the words of my long-former pastor match up with the dream of one of the greatest men in U.S. history. Why in the world would I raise my girls to look for specters in shadows? Why would I raise them to identify with a specific race as if being members of the human race weren’t enough?

Yes, my daughters are from Africa, and they communicate with their family there regularly, but once we adopted them and landed in America together, they became Americans. Not African-Americans, not black girls, but girls who would grow up in a nation where they were afforded the opportunity to become anything they wanted to become.

Today, my daughters are 21 and 16, and we have raised them and our other three children on this philosophy, yet it somehow continually shocks me that any real racism they’ve encountered has come from black contemporaries. Although the 21-year-old had some difficult emotional struggles and returned to Africa to live with her brother and finish high school, she came back to Oklahoma after graduation, joined the National Guard, and has begun college with the intention of becoming a nurse.

Education has always been important to Barbara, who’s always been a hard worker dissatisfied with anything less than an “A” in her classes. Of all my kids, she and my oldest son seem to share an innately conservative bend, and tend to be reserved in public.

One day we were talking in the kitchen after she’d returned home from school, where she’s struggled with the constant racial politics in her college English class. She wanted help beginning her latest paper regarding disproportionate brutality by police toward black Americans. She recounted her frustration that so many black contemporaries in the military had razzed her because her last name is White and she’d been adopted by a white family. When I asked her how she dealt with that kind of thing, she just shrugged her shoulders and said, “What are you going to do?”

Thank God she’s a strong young woman. Her answer could have been suicide.

Racism Isn’t Okay If You’re Black

Betty is my straightforward social butterfly. Although she and the two boys have been homeschooled since 2012, she’s participated in no end of extracurricular activities, knows no strangers, and has no qualms about providing her opinion on anything to anyone at any time. Currently, she’s a manager on the local homeschool football team (she also nannies and runs her own photography business).

The other night she came home from practice and told us that one of the black boys on the team, who constantly makes racial comments, had called another black boy the “n-word.” Characteristically, Betty told him not to use that word because it was disgusting. He then said something like, “What do you mean? You’re an ‘n-word’ too.”

She told him she was in no way an “n-word,” yet he was apparently intent on convincing her she was. His next retort was something like, “Hey, we’re both from Africa.” She said she looked him straight in the face and said—I’m sure with her hilariously sharp attitude and a little head bob for good measure—“I’m from Africa. You’re from Oklahoma, and I’m no ‘n-word.’”

She went on to tell us that this kid has also mocked her about hanging around white kids, including her white boyfriend, who is also on the team, and acting and speaking like she is “white.” Again, if Betty hadn’t had a strong personality, what could this kind of ridiculing behavior, from someone who “looks like her,” done to her emotionally? We know what it did to McKenzie.

It’s Time to Rethink Our Social Stalemate

As an educator, I’ve made a point of studying the history behind some of the things I was and wasn’t taught throughout my education. For example, I’ve learned, and taught our kids about the Constitution, our republican form of government, and the genesis and history of our American political parties. We’ve also studied popular thought about slavery and racism versus what history says about these issues.

Yet even with the unfathomable reaches of the internet, few sources address these issues outside the progressive ideology of racial identity politics. It’s truly bizarre how little genuinely unbiased scholarship is available today, worldwide, despite our pervasive use of technology.

Recently, I’ve begun to follow the Blexit movement. Happily, many of the myths created by liberals and progressives to instigate groupthink and wrong-headed ideas about race and politics like the kind exhibited by the football player Betty argued with are addressed on the website.

Seeing this truly gives me hope for the future because, however trite it seems, knowledge is power. I hope people presented with this information will begin to read and study and think about justifying their belief systems, not simply falling into a thought process based on the words of community leaders, friends, or family members. Having a source willing to communicate history and truth is a good thing, and can only lead to enlightenment among any willing to be enlightened.

Kids Strong Enough to Think for Themselves

Early on in my parenting, I realized I couldn’t fight my kids’ battles for them, and I wouldn’t want to if I could. Instead, my husband and I have tried to rear all our kids with the persistent belief that they’re responsible for themselves and their actions and that it’s up to them to harness their God-given talents to be whatever they want to be without falling back on excuses of any kind. They’re also to be humble in their accomplishments, strong in their character and beliefs, and kind to those around them, regardless of how they are treated.

I have long understood that my kids are but a drop in a sea of kids being raised mainly by public education, which today churns out liberal ideologues at an alarming rate. Like most parents, I wonder what life will hold for them in adulthood. Will they be able to navigate an independent course? Will they succumb to the pull of those around them to submit to groupthink, or will they remember that history teaches the best lessons and that knowledge alone is power over their ultimate destinies?

Like all parents, I have no answers to questions only time abides. I can hope, however, that the life of sweet little McKenzie Adams will open the eyes of the black community to the destruction of racial politics and that my kids will join others with the same kind of independent streak and, ultimately, help steer the course of this country toward one in which differences are celebrated within the context of the whole, not parsed out as weapons of contention and conflict.

Women's March Refusal To Condemn Racism Eviscerates Intersectionalism,"On January 14, Women’s March leaders Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland joined the cohosts of “The View to talk about the controversy currently enveloping the organization: namely, that its leaders are anti-Semitic and have baked racist beliefs into the Women’s March platform — an accusation leveled by none other than Women’s March founder Teresa Shook.

Offensive Statements Against Jews (And Israelis)

The radically anti-Semitic associations of Mallory and co-organizer Linda Sarsour are well-documented. Sarsour is rabidly anti-Israel and called Imam Siraj Wahaj , an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing who defended Egyptian terrorist Omar Abdel-Rahman, a “respected scholar,” and her “mentor, motivator and encourager.” She also said Israelis should not be “humanized” because they are “oppressors.”

Mallory is most recently known an Instagram picture she took with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, also a known anti-Semite. It was never deleted.

Farrakhan’s most recent expression of hate to go viral was in a speech on the 23rd anniversary of the Million Man March, in which he said, “You know what they do, call me an anti-Semite, stop it. I’m anti-termite,” he said, also calling Jews “stupid.”

Mallory was also accused of telling Vanessa Wruble, an activist of Jewish ancestry, that “Jews needed to confront their own role in racism.” Wruble was later “pushed out” of the organization, according to the New York Times, and believes her Jewish identity was partially responsible for the separation. Here is the full interview with Mallory and Bland on “The View”:

To her credit, Bland stated that “the Women’s March unequivocally condemns anti-Semitism.” “The View” cohost Meghan McCain then pressed her, “So you condemn Louis Farrakhan’s statements about the Jewish people,” to which she responded, “Yes, and we have repeatedly in statement after statement this year,” directing the audience to their website.

This is from the “Women’s March Statement on Anti-Semitism, Homophobia and Transphobia:”

Women’s March is an intersectional movement made up of organizers with different backgrounds, who work in different communities. Within the Women’s March movement, we are very conscious of the conversations that must be had across the intersections of race, religion and gender. We love and value our sister and co-President Tamika Mallory, who has played a key role in shaping these conversations. Neither we nor she shy away from the fact that intersectional movement building is difficult and often painful. Minister Farrakhan’s statements about Jewish, queer, and trans people are not aligned with the Women’s March Unity Principles, which were created by women of color leaders and are grounded in Kingian Nonviolence. Women’s March is holding conversations with queer, trans, Jewish and Black members of both our team and larger movement to create space for understanding and healing. Our external silence has been because we are holding these conversations and are trying to intentionally break the cycles that pit our communities against each other. We have work to do, as individuals, as an organization, as a movement, and as a nation.

A separate statement released by Sarsour reaffirms the alleged commitment to “fighting bigotry in all its forms,” and that “every member of our movement matters to us, including our incredible Jewish and LGBTQ members.”

“We should have been faster and clearer in helping people understand our values and our commitment to fighting anti-semitism. We regret that,” the statement read, also reiterating that the Women’s March is “an intersectional movement.”

Rachel O’Leary Carmona, chief operating officer of the Women’s March group, told The New York Times in the December 23, 2018 report that “steps were being taken” to add Jewish women to the Unity Principles. This has been done, but it’s notable that it took two years and massive controversy to obtain the change.

Tolerance Is Hard When You’re Associated With Farrakhan

It’s really not hard to see why Women’s March activists are having a “difficult” and “painful” time building the movement, which is evidently stunting their ability to defend Jewish women from anti-Semitism the same way they seek to defend other racial and sexual minorities. The movement is proud to be “intersectional” and is “committed to dismantling systems of oppression.”

If you don’t know what intersectionality is, it’s essentially a matrix for determining where you belong in the victim hierarchy. So, being a woman means you face patriarchal oppression, but being a black woman means you are even more of a victim because you are racially oppressed, and being a black lesbian woman means you are still greater a victim because you are sexually oppressed, too.

The oppressor-oppressed worldview from which intersectionality springs is part and parcel of neo-Marxism, which also sprung privilege theory . The matrix of oppression that identifies privilege as a form of oppression and organizes groups into an hierarchies of victimhood and privilege is the key to understanding Mallory’s statement to the Times regarding the meeting with Wruble: “Since that conversation, we’ve all learned a lot about how while white Jews, as white people, uphold white supremacy, ALL Jews are targeted by it.” Even Wruble agreed that Jewish women should “grapple with their racial privilege.”

In other words, from the neo-Marxist perspective, Jews are a “middle-man oppressor.” They “uphold white supremacy” in their whiteness and benefit greatly from the oppressive capitalist system, the “myth of meritocracy,” as privilege theorist Peggy McIntosh would put it, but they also are also victims of the same white supremacist system.

It’s important to realize that the statement clearly isn’t referring to the fringe neo-Nazi white supremacists in saying that Jews “uphold” white supremacy. She is referring instead to the broader socioeconomic system that privileges whites. When she says they’ve been “targeted,” she is probably referring to the explicit dehumanization and hatred that fuel the likes of the Tree of Life shooter, which she views as the extremist end of white supremacist oppression rather than the bulk of it.

Neo-Marxism: Just As False Now as It Ever Has Been

Further evidence of how neo-Marxist thinking has guided the Women’s March and resulted in minimizing (at the very least) the Jewish identity within the movement is found in the same report: Wruble said one of the activists planning the first Women’s March told her, “We really couldn’t center Jewish women in this or we might turn off groups like Black Lives Matter.”

Jews can’t be a focus because black activists will be offended, you see. In the most charitable interpretation, this is because some members of Black Lives Matter have taken Palestinian activist positions against “Israeli occupation,” and the potential for pro-Israel rhetoric from Jews in the Women’s March could drown out those voices.

At worst, the statement could refer to desiring the involvement of true black supremacists, black separatists, and anti-Semites such as those belonging to the Nation of Islam. (Wruble says she was told NOI would be providing the security for the march.) Either way, it demonstrates that, according to the organizers’ ideology, perspectives from some minorities were more important than perspectives from other minorities, solely by virtue of their race.

A third party, Evie Harmon, was privy to some of the early conversations about the Women’s March and said she overheard Mallory and Perez, “a Latina criminal justice reform activist,” “berating” Wruble. They allegedly referred to “you people” repeatedly and went so far as to say “you people hold all the wealth.”

Mallory denied this exchange took place but admitted to saying that she didn’t trust some of the white women she had been working with, according to the Times.

This idea that Jews are by definition part of the oppressive class as “whites” despite the fact that they are a specific ethnicity with thousands of years of heritage is why Mallory has such a hard time unequivocally condemning anti-Semitism. Although she stopped short of saying explicitly, “I have a problem with Jews as a people group,” Mallory made it abundantly clear in her appearance on “The View” that she is on some level sympathetic to anti-Semitic views.

Mallory repeatedly refused to explicitly condemn Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, opting instead to say, “I don’t agree with these statements.” She even backtracked from that weak statement by clarifying, “It’s not my language, it’s not how I speak, it’s not how I organize.”

Black Americans Don’t Need Support from Racists

Her insistence that she had to be at a Nation of Islam “holy day” because “that’s where her people are” is an admission that the racist Nation of Islam beliefs — such as black supremacy, that Jews are the “slum lords” of the black community , and that Jews are “termites” — were not abhorrent enough to warrant disassociation from the religion, despite the fact that there are plenty of other ways African Americans can come together in solidarity that don’t involve inciting hatred toward other people groups.

Mallory pushed back on the condemnation of her association with Farrakhan by saying she also goes into prisons and is “trying to help people move from wherever they are today and build that unity and bring them to a place where we live in a more fair and equitable society.” But we know Mallory wasn’t at Saviour’s Day to evangelize equality contrary to NOI teachings, because Mallory didn’t just show up to the celebration, she took a picture with Farrakhan and posted it to Instagram for the world to see who she stands with, calling him the GOAT (greatest of all time). You would think that if ever there were a place to clarify one’s rejection of racist rhetoric, that post would have been it.

Yet even on “The View” Mallory did not say one positive thing about Jews or claim that her attitude toward them is friendly, but vaguely referred to her “twenty years of activism” as evidence of where she stands. This media appearance, to a mostly female, liberal-leaning audience, would have been a critical moment to be as explicit as possible in her condemnation of anti-Semitism and her solidarity with Jews.

But that’s not what happened. Mallory is such a radical neo-Marxist, such a faithful adherent to privilege theory and intersectionality, that she is not even willing to speak well of Jews and ill of Jew-haters to save the movement she’s leading.

Taking her statements on the whole, especially if Wruble is to be believed, it certainly seems like she thinks Jews are oppressors and that resisting their position of privilege, or at least putting their problems on the back burner, is part of her plan to move toward that “fair and equitable society.”

The Black Panthers Were Murderous Thugs Who Don't Deserve Accolades,"When I walked into the library of my university mid-semester and spotted a massive Black Panther Party tribute exhibit, it felt like a line had been crossed.

When my generation thinks of the 1960s, we think of milkshakes and poodle skirts. The civil rights movement, the war on crime, and World War II are reserved for pages in a textbook. The only thing that was truly passed down from my elders in that time period to me was a feeling of fear at two names: the Klu Klux Klan and the Black Panthers. They were radical organizations made up of thugs who sowed violence and inspired terror. Both managed to survive at least two generations.

Apparently, the Black Panthers’ reputation has been rehabilitated. The exhibit took up an entire room in the front entrance of the university library, and had a pristine, museum-grade quality rarely seen in the type of place that makes you pay for your own printer paper. It was made up of black and white photos of elders whose only significant action was to smile harmlessly at the camera.

Hosted, rather ironically, by the school’s Center for Judaic, Holocaust, and Peace Studies, the photos, according to the front board, “reveal the humanity of the groups’ members rather than their invented personae.” Black Panther members “are real people, with real stories, who are your next door neighbors. They don’t fit the profile of rabid, anti-white, cop-hating terrorists…”

Ericka Huggins is one of the smiling old ladies in the exhibit. She helped torture young Alex Rackley with other Black Panther members, boiling the water they used to pour over his chest and commanding him to be quiet when he pleaded for mercy. Now she’s a lecturing professor. Rackley is dead. After falsely admitting he was an informant in hopes of stopping the hours of torture, Black Panthers killed him and dumped his body in a river.

The exhibit is just one piece of a new attempt to rewrite the narrative of the Black Panthers and recast them as absolutely harmless. New articles and documentaries––and now a Golden Globe Awards joke––create a completely different organization who built free breakfast programs for children and medical clinics.

Never mind the fact that medical volunteers were forced to take classes on the Black Panther philosophy, that their socialist policy of giving away free supplies to supporters came from extortion of local businesses, or that the Black Panthers were literally building a militia of armed individuals who believed they were their own sovereign people surrounded by an oppressive nation of “whities” who deserved death.

Black Panthers Weren’t Helping Black Americans

It is sacrilegious to refer to Black Panther Party members as “misunderstood” when there were many other and better activists working to improve conditions of blacks at the time. Desegregationists of both races conducted sit-ins, effectively boycotted transportation, demanded legislation, and tested Supreme Court decisions. They won the Brown v. Board of Education decision, the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the support of the president. Gaps between black and whites began closing.

In the midst of this, an undercurrent of tension and hate was taken advantage of by white and black supremacy groups that encouraged war. They fed off race riots and, when the violence they bred was reflected back at them, cried foul. They widened the gap between segregationists and desegregationists. The turmoil that kept the Black Panther Party alive eventually led to their implosion, as they began losing support and top members to jail and shootouts. They left little behind.

Extremism in an age of tension yields a vicious cycle of discord. The ‘60s are a strong example of this. The race riots that broke out in cities across America permanently crippled local economies, leading to a 4 to 7 percent decrease in male employment that lasted two decades wherever a riot had occurred. A 1968 New York Times article written by a concerned citizen pleaded with proponents of extremism, asking how they expected to accomplish change when the demands they made seemed to repel it.

“That expectations rise is good; that they rise so fast that no policy of any type carried out by anybody can satisfy them is bad. That people feel powerful and free to express their resentment is good; that their resentment may overthrow a system capable of satisfying their needs and hopes is bad.”

A Resurgence Of Extremism

This extremism has emerged today in ideologies that demand “reparations” barely disguised as a self-centered vengeance and are not interested in change, but commotion. Extremism is easy. It grants a satisfying self-righteousness to those who point fingers like a witch hunt at others. It doesn’t require tackling a problem or formulating the complicated solutions those problems demand.

If we look back to the 1960s and the parallel problems they faced––race riots, police brutality, black power, resurgences of socialism, protest on college campuses, and a divided America––history tells us that extremism doesn’t accomplish the real change that our nation so badly needs, but only adds to its wounds.

It is bad enough to be ignorant of history, but to misrepresent it is a crime of deception. Eliminating the bloody history of the Black Panther Party presents a fictional fairytale that defangs the past and hides all its traps. My generation deserves better than to be deceived by obsessive fans of an extremist organization that belongs in the past. We deserve better than simply replicating an older generation. And if we follow this path of extremism and discord, then we must be prepared for all of the consequences that come with it.

"After Apologizing, Gina Rodriguez Still Under Fire For ‘Anti-Black’ Remarks","The problem with the fight over Gina Rodriguez is that it’s even a fight at all. Rodriguez, an outspoken progressive known best for her starring role in “Jane the Virgin,” is on the receiving end of some intense ire for issuing a string of allegedly “anti-black” remarks.

Much of the backlash can be traced to at least July 2017, when Rodriguez tweeted, “Marvel and DC are killing it in inclusion and women, but where are the Latinos?! Asking for a friend…” That was considered erasure by critics who accused her of ignoring Latino actors in relevant films, and of shifting the focus away from celebrating “Black Panther’s” importance. Rodriguez also earned scorn for interjecting when an interviewer asked her “Smallfoot” co-star Yara Shahidi about being a role model for “so many young black women” to say, “So many women.”

Then came her comments on equal pay. “I get so petrified in this space talking about equal pay especially when you look at the intersectional aspect of it, right? Where white women get paid more than black women, black women get paid more than Asian women, Asian women get paid more than Latina women, and it’s like a very scary space to step into,” Rodriguez said during a roundtable discussion. Because there was confusion over whether she was speaking specifically about Hollywood, where Sofia Vergara was the highest-paid actress of 2018, or the general workforce, this elicited another round of criticism.

That brings us to today. Now people are angry at Rodriguez because she apologized for all of it— but not exactly to their satisfaction. In a Tuesday appearance on “Sway in the Morning,” Rodriguez described the controversy as “devastating” and launched into a pretty emotional apology. Here’s an excerpt:

If I have hurt you, I am sorry and I will always be sorry, but you have to know that, until you know my heart, there’s no way that we can live off clickbait, you guys. You are allowed to feel pain and I empathize with your pain, and I’m sorry if I caused your pain because it is the last thing I want to do … We don’t need to fight each other and if I caused that notion, please forgive me because that is not my intent at all.

It was not accepted. Rodriguez’s conversation with Sway was long, and critics were further irritated because the actress invoked her “dark-skinned” father and shifted some of the blame to “clickbait” that stripped her words of context.

To be clear, I very much understand the frustration of celebrities wading into charged political debates without doing their homework and then looking for sympathy when people react badly. But given her clear display of good faith, there’s plenty of room to criticize Rodriguez without labeling her “anti-black” or implying she’s racist.

At worst, Rodriguez is insensitive. At best, she’s fully on the side of her critics. The point is that we blunt the edges of these very important definitions when we apply them to someone like her, who may be guilty of misspeaking but is almost certainly not guilty of personally harboring any racist attitudes.

These pile-ons also deter good-faith debate. Perez Hilton, for instance, hesitated to back Rodriguez, for fear of being called a racist. A lot of people probably decided to stay out of it entirely for the same reason.

We live in a world where I was afraid of even commenting on this new Gina Rodriguez clip for fear of, like her, being called racist or anti-black. Well, I'm not! And I don't believe these are crocodile tears! Donald Trump is racist and anti-black. @HereIsGina is FAR from that!!! pic.twitter.com/pKVbMpm5eA — Perez (@ThePerezHilton) January 23, 2019

If anything, Rodriguez’s comments gave her critics an opportunity to air their disagreements, and further what they perceive as a critical conversation. But these instant tides of vitriol intimidate people out of expressing viewpoints within perfectly reasonable boundaries, and snuff out that process of debate before it can even begin. That’s not healthy for anyone. Of course, this is also all exacerbated by the structure of social media, which incentivizes dunking over nuance, and more easily facilitates attacks over conversations.

The whole ordeal is another reminder that we’ve fallen into a pattern of debate that’s not at all constructive. When someone comes to the table with wrong-minded opinions clearly rooted in good intentions, meet that person there if you want to actually solve the problem— whether she’s an entitled celebrity or a misguided Twitter user.

Are The Only Racists The NYT Isn’t Sympathetic To White Racists?,"Last weekend, a group known for decades to promote racism advanced on a group of school boys while hurling racial slurs, including against a black student in the boys’ midst. These slurs included, as multiple videos of the altercation and its lead-up show, “child-molesting f-ggots,” “n-gger,” “dirty -ss crackers,” “d-mn cracker whites,” “racists,” “blue-eyed demon,” “incest kids,” and calling Native Americans “savage.”

They charged that the white students were going to “harvest” a black Covington Catholic student’s bodily organs, and threatened violence. Their preachers publicly promise “There’s about to be 144,000 Nat Turners risen up, killing so-called white people, babies included.” Nat Turner was the leader of a pre-Civil War slave revolt that led to 180 murders of people on both sides. They shout on street corners that “One of the top three fantasies of women is to get raped.”

These easily demonstrable facts have been reported by even such compromised hard-left institutions as the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and are available within a 30-second scan of Google search results. Yet, The New York Times decided to do a profile on the Black Hebrew Israelites this week that opens: “They are sidewalk ministers who use confrontation as their gospel.” It continues:

Hebrew Israelites practice a theology that says God’s chosen ones — black, Hispanic and Native American people — have strayed and need to be led back to righteousness. So they post up on street corners in big cities, usually in predominantly black communities, wearing flashy garb — purple shirts or black robes, for instance. They shout, use blunt and sometimes offensive language, and gamely engage in arguments aimed at drawing listeners near.

This is, at best, remarkable restraint in reportage that the paper rarely applies to groups progressives don’t like such as Christians and conservatives. This is, at worst, the Times covering for racism because of the identity of the racists. The entire article is written in a “some people say they’re hateful, but others say they have a right to be hateful” tone. Read it yourself.

This from the people forever on their high horses about calling out bigotry, even bigotry that nobody can find and nobody intended. It’s as if they don’t actually care about racism itself, but whether the highly emotionally charged concept of racism can be used to manipulate the people of their choosing, regardless of its accuracy in any particular case. If someone considered a leftist ally does it, it’s not racist. If anyone else does it, it is racist. See? Simple.

The New York Times is establishing a track record of this sort of thing, too. Recall that just a few months ago the paper’s editorial board hired Sarah Jeong, an Asian-American, and stood behind her despite public comments like these I quoted in August: “White people have stopped breeding. You’ll all go extinct soon. This was my plan all along.” “Oh man it’s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men.” “Dumb-ss f-cking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs p-ssing on fire hydrants” (vulgarities altered).

At the time, both Jeong and the Times excused her by saying that it was mean people on the internet’s fault that she had uttered racist remarks. The same gaslighting has been going on with the Black Hebrew Israelites, who claim it’s okay to be racist against white people and Indians and Jews because white people have been racist towards black people. The Black Israelites profile ends with this equivocation between kids wearing red hats and people who promise literal race wars.

To many black people, Hebrew Israelites are a harmless part of their communities, said Todd Boyd, a professor of race and pop culture at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, one of many cities where the group can be seen working the streets. More alarming to many African Americans, he said, is ‘seeing a white guy in a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.’

The Times also quotes an SPLC employee making similar excuses for the Black Hebrew Israelites’ obvious and virulent racism: “‘These are really fringe movements, and they’re also very different than white nationalist groups that have access to power,’ Ms. Beirich said. ‘This kind of thinking arose in reaction to white supremacy and the abuse and exploitation of black people.'”

It is deeply insulting for anybody to assert that they are so lacking in perspective and self-control that they can’t help but scream obscenities at children who wear a hat celebrating a president some people dislike. Hats don’t scream at people, they don’t threaten people. They couldn’t possibly hurt anyone. Excuses like this are patronizing and infantilizing to the point of themselves being racist slurs. This is a bigotry of low expectations.

That is a pattern for the left in general, far beyond The New York Times. Consider affirmative action in college admissions, which tells black and Hispanic students that they are incapable of achieving on par with white and Asian students simply because of the color of their skin. Shelby Steele lacerates progressives’ almost compulsive racist fakery in his book, “Shame: How America’s Past Sins Have Polarized Our Country.”

This is the dynamic of the new liberalism. Superficially, it is very ‘caring’ toward blacks, minorities, and the poor. It befriends them, promises them all manner of programs and policies. It makes a show of being deferential toward their woundedness, of bowing before their past victimization as before an irrefutable moral authority. But, of course, all this deference is a seduction. The new liberalism does not pursue the actual uplift of minorities and the poor. It purchases dispensation from America’s past sins for whites — and the imprimatur of innocence. Minorities and the poor, seduced by all the promises scattered like rose petals in their path, are thus manipulated into bestowing that imprimatur.

This is all a game. It is not about actually repenting of the sin of racism, and achieving true justice. All people should favor that, because it is morally right. Instead, this game is really about making people feel either guilty or vindictive, so other people can manipulate them more easily. And weaponizing racism to win at politics is sickening.

Some Americans still don’t know they’re being played. But others have begun to notice the obvious double standard in The New York Times and other cultural leaders’ treatment of racist remarks depending on the skin color or political affiliation of the people making them. It is having the effect racism always does: Destabilizing the social trust we badly need to maintain a free society that respects every single citizen’s inherent natural rights and God-given human dignity.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/25/racists-nyt-isnt-sympathetic-white-racists/,2019-01-25
"No, It’s Not White Supremacy To Say Minorities Shouldn’t Be Racists","After reading news of a 9-year-old in Alabama who hung herself as a result of bullying from black peers allegedly because she had white friends, I wrote an essay describing some of the ways our mixed-race family had also experienced this kind of racial politics.

Although my entire thesis was that “differences [be] celebrated within the context of the whole, not parsed out as weapons of contention and conflict,” immediately upon publication of the piece my Twitter feed began to fill with invectives, racial slurs, and threats. In fact, at least one person tracked me all the way to my workplace and sent a threatening email, which was turned over to local police.

Yet that reaction is a drop in the bucket compared to the story of the Covington Catholic High School boys. The Twitter amplification of a one-minute video unleashed a torrent of racial bias accusations picked up by mainstream news outlets with little attempt to uncover even simple facts, directly resulting in threats against the teenage boys and their families, public condemnation by Covington school officials and the Kentucky Catholic Diocese (since removed), the closure of the school due to threats of violence, and finally, the Paul Harvey-esque “rest of the story” provided by the release of the full video virtually exonerating the students.

Further reporting uncovered the damning actions and background of the Native American activist who accused the boys of racism, and the Black Hebrew Nationalists whose vile and racist language the boys apparently tried to drown out with cheering, resulting in a subsequent apology from Covington Bishop Foys and the deletion of hundreds of rush-to-judgment condemnation tweets.

Does Anyone Even Know What ‘Racism’ Is Anymore?

I hope this nonsense has caused at least a few thinking people to wonder what the word “racism” even means today. After being referred to as both a racist and a white supremacist, it did me, so I went searching and found an essay written by a South African writer that included the following paragraph:

Holding prejudiced dehumanising, insulting and derogatory opinions or stereotypes about particular groups of people is bigotry – no matter who you are. Treating people unjustly based on these prejudices is discrimination. If your prejudice is based on race then you are racist. If you treat people unfairly based on racist prejudices, it is racial discrimination. Any attempt to fudge or negotiate away this most fundamental understanding of discrimination based on race betrays an intellectual dishonesty, a devotion to narrative rather than truth, a pettiness and a lust for score settling rather than truthful, honest debate and discussion.

According to this definition, it would take a veritable Herculean effort to label the actions of Covington Catholic School students as racist. In fact, the attacks on these boys indicate the “intellectual dishonesty” of the “narrative rather than to truth,” as a recent Babylon Bee parody and writer Robby Soave make clear.

It doesn’t work in my case, either. A white family adopting black children and raising them to be individuals with their own convictions rather than those of a specific race or class is neither racist nor white supremacist. It is, however, a slap in the face of the Uncle Tom narrative established at the beginning of the 20th century to denigrate those who aspire to a life beyond the pigeonhole of race. It is a gut punch to an ideology for which political correctness has virtually ended discussion thanks to fear of oppression and harassment, but it’s not racism.

Using a racist brush to paint over purely ideological disagreement is ignorant, uneducated, and dishonest, yet it’s accomplished consistently and without the slightest thought today, especially on Twitter.

Is There Black-on-Black Racism?

According to the previous definition, a black person who refers to another black person as behaving like a white person is a racist because the stereotypical ideology sparking that labeling process is entirely race-based.

Interestingly, during the Covington Catholic incident, many in the public who might not have known about this kind of racism became aware of it via recording of an interaction between the assembled students and members of the Black Hebrew Israelites, a religious sect with a history of name-calling, racial slurs and other verbal thuggery.

In the video, members of the sect can be seen calling a black Covington student a “ni–er” and telling him the white boys would “steal his organs” when he “got old enough,” at which point one of the students says, “Hey, we love you Bo” and several of the boys rallied around him. Undeterred, the BHI member repeatedly yells at the same student numerous times, “Get out ni–er”.

Yes, this an extreme example exhibited by an extreme group, but it doesn’t negate my experiences all the way from my public school days as a student on into my adult years as a public school teacher, of hearing black kids bully other black kids for hanging out with white kids or doing well in school, just as has happened to my daughters.

Whether we want to believe it or not, this practice is reality and it needs confrontation and correction. Just like any form of racism or bigotry in our society today, it shouldn’t be given a pass for any reason.

Protected Classism Wreaks Social Destruction

Unfortunately, policies like that outlined in a “Dear Colleague” letter to public schools through the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice under President Obama have only helped pour fuel on the identity politics fire.

Written in January of 2014, this letter dictated ways public school discipline policies must be reformed to address a finding indicating that, “African-American students without disabilities are more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended.”

Although numerous studies have shown that adopting these policies has hurt students, many public schools continue perpetuating them, most probably because a civil rights indictment from the Department of Education would mean a threat to federal funds for a school district.

Preaching against bullying and racism in public schools while insisting racism and bullying are appropriate when applied to a specific race is a perfect example of the kind of insipid mental gymnastics that destroy civilizations. Treating one group of people better or worse than another because they look different is either wrong or it’s right.

It’s not right for one group and not another, or in this case but not that. This is how truth works—it’s an either/or proposition. We need to unlock the “truth formula” and use it on everything, liberally.

Running Away from Bullies Just Creates Bigger Bullies

Although roundly demonized for my essay throughout the Twittersphere, I’m grateful for its publication because, on the flipside, I was also sought out by some of the warmest, most encouraging people imaginable.

Kevin Batts, a writer and friend from my Common Core fighting days, called me after reading the article. He and his wife both got on the phone and shared experiences with me like that of our daughters. They talked about how painful such situations have been for them and how much they appreciated my tackling a subject few are willing to even acknowledge, let alone be bold enough to write about.

His white kids never had any real problems, but his black kids were made fun of because they ‘talked white,’ had white parents, and ate ‘white lunches.’

Another friend whose family has also benefitted greatly by transracial adoption wrote to tell me that while his kids were enrolled in a predominantly black public school system, his white kids never had any real problems, but his black kids were made fun of because they “talked white,” had white parents, and ate “white lunches.” He wanted to reach out and thank me for writing the piece because he’d been able to relate to the same experiences and thoughts we’d had.

“Culture,” he said in relation to his kids, “is not tied to genetics or skin color but to what one is accustomed and so their culture reflects our culture.”

I’ve also had correspondence with people from around the country and overseas thanking me for simply tackling the ridiculousness of today’s racial politics in a public forum. Filmmaker Eli Steele, for example, wrote to share his film “How Jack Became Black,” which began when his multiracial child was unable to check a race box on an elementary school enrollment form and was refused admittance. “Be skin color or be individual?” Eli asks from his website.

Other friends have told me how much they wanted to tweet or comment to provide back-up, yet they feared what the mob would say or do to them in response. “Please know I support you,” they’d say.

Standing behind those who speak out against the rising tide of censorship is as important as standing in front.

Hey, I get it. Reading some of the comments posted to my Twitter account made my cheeks burn and heart race, almost like I’d done something wrong. At one point, I even wished I hadn’t shared our experiences, struggling against the bullies’ mentality that we weren’t entitled to our own story because it didn’t match theirs.

In the end, it was important to force myself to remember that as a citizen of the United States, the First Amendment protects me from not just the government, but others who might be offended by my words. I not only have a right but in some cases a responsibility to get those out.

Apparently, the family of Nicholas Sandmann, the teen who stood smiling as Nathan Phillips drummed and chanted in his face, has hired a high-profile attorney to find the IP addresses of Twitter users issuing actual physical threats. Although it would be great if someone attempted to actually make these people follow the law, here’s the takeaway: without an ability to speak freely, a civilization cannot be free.

When you can be fired for your faith, or fined for your business, or bullied into abandoning your work or ideals, or fruits of your experiences, you’re no longer a free person—you’re a slave to those you’ve allowed to force you into silence. Granted, not everyone is as comfortable with controversy as others, but standing behind those who speak out against the rising tide of censorship is as important as standing in front. For, as Martin Niemoller knew, once they’ve come for everyone else, there won’t be anyone left to stand up for you.

Riveting Stories Of Black History From The Backwoods Of Alabama,"It’s Black History Month and time for the annual student essays and programs on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman, and Jessie Owens. Who better a hero, for example, than a runaway slave who freed others and later was nurse, scout, and spy for the Union Army, like Tubman? Yet there are so many other stories to tell, so why not look at some other heroes worthy of recognition?

With a little digging––a treat for this Yankee transplant––I found some African-Americans who believed in a dream bigger than the narrowness of life in the Jim Crow South, and worked hard, despite the trying times they lived in, to create better lives for fellow African-Americans. I’d like to introduce you to three of my new heroes, who grew up in the backwoods of rural Alabama and became teachers, healers, and builders worthy of a Black History Month essay.

Rosa Young

Rosa Jinsey Young was born in 1890 in Rosebud, Alabama, a tiny community in rural Wilcox County, the fourth of 10 children from parents just out of slavery. From childhood, her heart was set on teaching “her people,” since there were few schools then for blacks.

She picked cotton to earn money to attend teacher training classes in Selma, and after getting her degree, she raised money in black and white communities to buy land and build a school. In 1912, she opened the Rosebud Literary and Industrial School to over 100 students.

Then the boll weevil beetle hit Alabama in 1915 and killed the cotton crop, the main source of income for both African-Americans and whites. It looked like her dream would die. She persevered, eventually joining with Lutherans from St. Louis who worked alongside her to start 35 Lutheran churches and schools in the Alabama Black Belt, in backwoods communities like Possum Bend, Tait’s Place, Holy Ark, Ingomar, Bashi, and Hamburg.

Despite the stranglehold of Jim Crow laws on dollars for black schools, Young didn’t let her students go without. With her small teacher’s salary, she bought books for children whose parents couldn’t afford them, and had a well dug at one school so the children would have fresh drinking water. A petite and sickly woman, Rosa helped educate hundreds of children and raised multiple generations of African-American Lutheran pastors and teachers.

Dr. Lincoln Laconia Burwell

Lincoln Laconia Burwell was born in 1867 in rural Marengo County to a family so poor that his parents had to send him to live with his older brother when he was age seven. With his savings from farming, he attended Selma University, which had been established by black Baptists in 1878, and went onto medical school.

Returning to Selma, he set up the first black-administered hospital there in 1907. (At that time, hospitals had “houses in the yard” for black patients.) When he couldn’t get white pharmacists to fill his prescriptions, he took pharmacy classes, then opened up his own drugstore. Burwell’s infirmary lasted through integration and was known for providing excellent care for blacks, who were treated like first-class citizens.

Burwell was active in his church, serving as deacon and trustee. He also served on the board of Selma University. Despite poverty, segregation, and discrimination, Dr. Burwell brought healing to hundreds of his people over decades of service.

David Benjamin West

We know very little about David Benjamin West except that he was from the small town of Marion, Alabama, about 50 miles northwest of Selma. He was a contractor and an architect, possibly self-taught. In 1894, he was hired by the black congregation of First Baptist Church, the first black congregation organized in Selma, to build a new sanctuary.

The brick Gothic Revival church he designed and built is considered one of the most “architecturally significant late-19th-century black churches in the state.” The design is cruciform, with the Victorian-styled sanctuary housed beneath a steeply pitched tin roof. Built over a full basement, the main floor is raised about eight feet above grade. Large triple-stained-glass windows, flanked by smaller one, dressed both sides of the church. It was heralded as “the finest colored church edifice in Alabama” by an early historian.

Some 28 years later, he designed and built Tabernacle Baptist Church. The prominent two-story brick and stone church features four towers, one at each corner of the building, and is topped by a dome enclosed by a clerestory. Multiple stained-glass windows decorate the large sanctuary.

The first black congregation to build on Selma’s main street, Tabernacle was built with two identical commanding entrances. During the Jim Crow era, black congregants were not allowed to walk on Selma’s main street, so that entrance could only be used during funerals. The rest of the time, the entrance on the side street was used.

Today both First Baptist and Tabernacle Baptist—where Dr. Burwell attended and served––still stand, with active and civic-minded congregations, testaments to the excellence of heroes who served, taught, healed, and built. Just a few blocks away is Trinity Lutheran Church, begun through the work of Rosa Young, one of 12 Lutheran churches her work began that are still serving communities from Selma to Mobile and Pensacola.

Black History Month is a good time to find and celebrate these heroes who pushed past barriers of poverty, discrimination, segregation, and hate to work hard, serve others, and leave a legacy of faith and fortitude for those following in their footsteps.

"Even If You Aren’t Jeff Bezos, Don’t Give In To Blackmail","In the Medium post heard ‘round the world last week, Amazon CEO and now scandal-checkered billionaire Jeff Bezos proclaimed that National Enquirer and its parent company, AMI, not only tried to blackmail him, but he refused to give in.

“Rather than refuse to capitulate to extortion or blackmail,” Bezos decided to share what happened, because, as he wrote, “If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?”

Bezos was right to point out that normal people are blackmailed, particularly young people in revenge porn situations, and they don’t feel they can stand up to it because they fear the social consequences of their blackmail material going public. Yet Bezos’s strongly worded letter shows just why, even if you aren’t Jeff Bezos, you shouldn’t give in to blackmail.

In his Medium post, Bezos details how and why AMI owner David Pecker allegedly blackmailed him. Pecker recently entered an immunity deal with the U.S. Department of Justice and has been investigated for his company’s relationship with the Saudi government.

The National Enquirer received salacious photos and texts allegedly of Bezos’ torrid affair with Lauren Sanchez. The National Enquirer, via Pecker’s attorneys, said they would publish the photos unless Bezos and company claimed to the press that they “have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.”

Whether the Enquirer was just digging up dirt on Bezos for fun or were trying to save their own reputation, it’s still blackmail. As this excellent Reason aticle points out, blackmail follows this formula:

A has a plausible claim that B should do X (e.g., make good on a warranty, or pay a debt).

A is demanding that B do X.

A is threatening to reveal that B hasn’t done X.

Since the pictures have nothing to do with AMI’s demands, it’s definitely blackmail and a punishable offense. Rather than capitulate to the National Enquirer’s demands, however, Bezos refused to give in and instead, published a letter that deflated the story and reveals how slimy they really are.

Blackmail Is a Growing Trend

Unfortunately, while Bezos may be unique in his billionaire status, the blackmail he experienced comes up often now in the digital age of over-sharing and smartphone-ready personal information. It’s worth pointing out that Bezos likely would not have been blackmailed if he had remained faithful to his wife. (Although AMI sounded desperate enough—they may have tried to blackmail him with something less salacious or fabricated.)

It’s a generally good rule that if you don’t want to be blackmailed with juicy gossip or intimate photos, don’t do these things. Problem prevented.

However, blackmail still arises regardless of the moral condition of the people involved or the context of the relationship. It is particularly common now among teens and college students. These folks, who have grown up with cameras at their fingertips, often think nothing (at first) of sharing intimate photos or information with a close friend or an intimate relationship, only to have that held over their head later as a threat when the relationship ends.

Blackmail Has Devastating Consequences

Blackmail, especially revenge porn, can have devastating consequences. Gawker initially refused to take down a video the site had published in 2010 showing a drunk young woman having sex in a bathroom stall at a sports bar despite her pleas to remove it and the possibility the video might have actually shown a rape, not consensual sex. Although Gawker eventually removed the video, it had already spread to other sites.

The incident was revisited when Hulk Hogan sued Gawker for publishing a secretly recorded sex tape involving him. That decision, and Hogan’s lawsuit, eventually spurred the website’s demise.

Last year, at least five British men committed suicide after they were conned by a large-scale “sextortion” gang. Someone from the group poses online as a member of the opposite sex looking for love. They coerce the naive person into performing sex acts on a camera, only to inform him or her later that he or she must pay a ransom or see the photos and videos released to friends and family.

An Italian man landed in court considering charging him with manslaughter when his girlfriend killed herself after he threatened to share intimate videos and photos with her family. Tovonna Holton, a 15-year-old Florida girl, committed suicide after her classmates saw a leaked Snapchat video of her in the shower. It was rumored her ex-boyfriend had posted the video on Twitter after their breakup, even though he denied it.

Even if blackmail doesn’t cause suicide, it can cause a person severe emotional distress. At least 41 states plus Washington, D.C. now have revenge porn laws making publishing private, semi-naked, or naked photos (like Gawker regularly did) illegal. As Bezos pointed out, the copyright of the photos was never AMI’s to begin with, so it’s illegal on that front as well.

While it might be tempting to hurt someone who has hurt you, it shouldn’t be done. Blackmail is immoral, dirty, desperate, illegal, and, as Bezos showed, legally and publicly actionable.

Resist the Urge to Capitulate

Everyone should resist the urge to capitulate to blackmail, whether you’re a professor at the hands of an angry ex, or a CEO at the hands of an immoral publication. Bezos’s public response was an epic alpha move that anyone else could also consider. His refusal to bend to National Enquirer while exposing their efforts to blackmail gives him the upper hand.

Annmarie Chiarini was a college professor and victim of revenge porn when her ex-boyfriend claimed he would “destroy” her, repeatedly posting nude photos of her online, before most revenge porn laws had been passed. She now encourages people to realize “it doesn’t define your life.” The average person facing such a quandary may not feel as alpha as Bezos, or have his massive resources, but you can utilize the law, keep your spirits up, remain steely-eyed, and refuse to give your blackmailer a win.

As Bezos wrote: “Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.”

Now Is The Time To Revive MLK’s Vision For African-American Culture,"Shortly before his untimely death, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. proclaimed, “I am integrating my people into a burning house.” King saw the impending spiritual death of America, and knew that black people would feel the effects of this decline before any other group.

In his seminal work, “The Negro Family: The Case For National Action,” the esteemed American politician and scholar Daniel Patrick Moynihan made a similar observation, noting with alarm the decline in the black family structure. The family has served as the core of American prosperity, but has declined as our country has become more liberal.

America’s spiritual and cultural values have been replaced by a corporatist liberal technocracy that seems to undermine the robust values the country was built upon, as Patrick Deneen’s “Why Liberalism Failed” explores in detail. The term “degenerate” holds little weight as a result of the direction we have gone in, but it is the most apt description of the country. The zeitgeist of America is now hedonism, operating only with the present in mind, and showing little concern for the future.

Killing Our Future

A man’s challenge was once to ensure that his legacy laid the foundation for a brighter future. America’s culture of momentary pleasures completely betrays King’s great sacrifice, and nothing shows this more clearly than how little we value our future human capital.

The loosening of abortion laws in our nation is the most recent example of the deterioration of the cultural fabric. These changes will be most felt by the descendants of the very same people Dr. King sought to liberate.

The scores of black lives lost before they’ve even had the chance to reach oxygen is the true symbol of a dark period. The practice shows a form of racism produced by corrupt capitalism and is antithetical to the traditional values King believed necessary for his dream to be fully realized. Unfortunately, his foresaw that the post-civil rights era would be best characterized as an American nightmare. King knew that the tides of liberalism might reach toward noble ideals, but their detached worldview would inevitably lead the country into a cultural decline.

Putting a Price Tag on Human Life

In the latter part of his life, King’s speeches took on more class-oriented themes. While the ideals he espoused might seem solely Marxist, they are better understood as a concern for the spiritual actualization of the nation. Of late Tucker Carlson has in a sense picked up this mantle from the right-wing perspective.

Carlson has generated some protest from both political sides for saying modern capitalism, as defined by crony practices, has crippled the spirit of the nation and denied many American citizens access to a healthy and happy life. In the same vein, King feared that profit would replace God, leading the nation down a dangerous path.

The current discourse about abortion excuses the act under the pretext of women’s rights. While the role of the government is not to dictate what a woman does with her body, this truism in progressive discourse cannot obscure that we live in a country where everything is examined via a cost-benefit analysis, even human life itself. Like just about everything else in our society, abortion is destined to become just another consumer product. It is of no use to virtue signal against this degeneration, though, because like Dr. King, anyone with an understanding of life steeped in traditionalism could have seen this moral lapse coming a mile away.

Faith Prepares Us to Resist a Dehumanizing Culture

King was rightly labeled a true conservative by the Washington Post. The label is of course too limited to capture the full breadth of Dr. King’s worldview, however. He is in fact a traditionalist, specifically a Protestant traditionalist. Just like the man he is named after, King radically expounded upon the Christian faith.

King exposed America to the culture and tradition of the black church. The strength of the black church was rooted in turning to faith to overcome the struggles black people faced in America. By sharing this power with the nation at-large, King sought to embolden a form of the Christian faith robust enough to exist in the modern world.

Anyone who considers himself a Christian should commit to a deep study of King’s philosophy. His is a resistant Christianity that forces the faith inward upon the individual to prepare one to deal with difficulty on earth. It is characterized by an understanding of Jesus rooted in a radical and a spiritual acceptance of the ugly truth.

Just as Dr. King’s Christian outlook prepared black Americans to resist the dehumanizing nature of racism, it can prepare today’s Americans to resist the dehumanizing nature of modern western culture. To follow King’s mission means choosing a path of healing over judgement. The act of judgement should be rightly left to God, and actualization is the reward for adhering to one’s values.

Jesus did not spend time with prostitutes and tax collectors to validate their degeneracy, but because they represent the tradition of the ugly truth. Acceptance of the truth, no matter how awful it may be, is the precursor to salvation. It is this strict adherence to seeking the truth that caused many black evangelist preachers of his time to reject King’s vision. He was admonished by many black religious leaders, save a few pioneers like the Rev. Clay Evans in Chicago.

‘Injecting New Meaning and Dignity’ Into Civilization

As time passes, Dr. King’s true legacy becomes clearer, and it is now paramount to look back in order to find a way forward. Written on the Dr. King statue at Morehouse College is a quote that characterizes his mission: “When the history books are written in future generations, the historians will have to pause and say, There lived a great people—a black people—who injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization.”

This expresses his hope that future generations will look back on the legacy of black Americans as representative of the true magnitude of human capability. It also underscores the importance of Black History Month.

Just like the religious foundation is crucial to the utility of King’s great message, one must also understand its racial element. The message is tribal and is therefore antithetical to the liberalism of our age. It underscores a form of civic nationalism, where one’s ethnic identity still holds value. His America is one where citizens act as the best possible representatives of their respective cultures and traditions.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is lionized because he held the truth up as the highest ideal to strive for. The recent uncovering of the Virginia governor’s shameful past clearly indicates why now, more than ever, we need to confront the ugly truths of the past in order to deal with the ugly truths in the present. Black History Month should not be understood as a liberal celebration, but a challenge to preserve traditional black culture in America that is aligned with Dr. King’s dream, despite the burning going on all around us.

First Two Self-Made Female U.S. Millionaires Are A Racial Success Story,"Money is not the only, nor even most important, marker of personal success. But it’s not insignificant when examining the progress and contributions of a historically oppressed minority to society. A notable marker of business success is achieving the status of millionaire. When marking the significant accomplishments of African-American people in the world of industry, determining the first millionaires in that community is as interesting as it is significant.

The first two self-made female millionaires in America were African-American women, and they both have remarkable stories. One is relatively well-known; the other, not so much. Sarah Breedlove, better known by her later-attained business name, Madam C. J. Walker, is usually credited with being the first self-made female millionaire in America.

Madam C.J. Walker’s Incredible Story

Sarah was born into a slave family in Louisiana in 1867, just after the Emancipation Proclamation — so she was technically born free. Orphaned at age 7, she only had three months of real education, which she received through reading and writing lessons in Sunday school. Sarah married at the age of 14 and was widowed six years later. After her second marriage failed, she married an established businessman and changed her name to the notably elegant Madam C. J. Walker.

In her young adulthood, she was determined to earn enough money to give her only daughter, A’Lelia, a much better life, one that afforded a quality education. Over time, by being uncommonly shrewd, clever, and hardworking, she did so beyond her wildest dreams by becoming Mary Kay long before Mary Kay.

She created an extraordinarily successful line of hair care and beauty products for African-Americans from her meager life savings of $1.25. Beyond being owned and run by a black woman born from a slave family, the company’s primary distinguishing feature was its sales model.

It used mail orders, but the most dynamic angle were “Walker’s Agents,” the more than 20,000 women who went door-to-door selling Madam’s line of products. These well-trained women were given a branded uniform of pressed white shirts, neat black skirts, and a black attaché case to reflect their professionalism.

These women spread across the country demonstrating the miraculous “Walker System” for advanced hair care and growth to millions of black women.

While unskilled white male workers were making about $11 a week, Madam’s agents were earning from $5 to $15 a day. That was more than they could make in a month doing kitchen work, and they were their own bosses. They got out what they put into it, making them partners in the business.

This was a remarkable opportunity for uneducated, but highly motivated, African-American women to earn an outstanding and empowering income for their families, often elevating their earning power beyond what their husbands could earn. Madam also ran a school of cosmetology where women could learn the skills needed to open their own beauty shops and use Madam’s products.

In 1917, Walker held the first national gathering of businesswomen in the country in Philadelphia, the Madam C. J. Walker Hair Culturists Union of America, to train and motivate her agents. Prizes were given to the women with the highest sales and the most charitable contributions to community efforts, an activity Walker was deeply involved in and encouraged.

She gave $10,000 a year to help young African-American men and women attend college, and sent six new students to the Tuskegee Institute every year. She was a gracious funder of the NAACP and YMCAs for black youth, as well as many causes fighting racial injustice. She expected her agents to do the same, and they did.

The Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company grew mightily throughout the United States, as well as in the Caribbean and Central America in her lifetime. The brand is still going strong today.

From her great wealth, Walker built many houses and townhomes, but the grandest was Villa Lewaro, at Irvington-on-Hudson, just north of New York City, neighboring John D. Rockefeller’s mansion. She spared no expense in furnishing it as to make any tycoon proud. The New York Times reported that neighbors “gasped in astonishment” that a black women could own such a stunning home. It was so massive she was able to host her subsequent annual company conventions there.

Madam told Booker T. Washington she was not in the business world only to make a life for herself and her employees, “but to do all the good I can for the uplift of my race.” She did in immeasurable ways, in her innovative products themselves, life-lifting and dignity-giving employment opportunities, her philanthropy, as well as her own personal example and message that an African-American woman can build something unbelievable out of just $1.25.

Her obituary in the New York Times announced in its 1919 headline, “Wealthiest Negress Dead” at the young age of 51. The Times noted that “her death recalled the unusual story of how she rose from a washerwoman making only $1.50 a day to a position of wealth and influence among members of her race.” Her influence was far greater than that.

Annie Malone: The True First Female Millionaire

Contrary to most reports, Walker was not the first African-American millionaire. Not even the first female millionaire. That title belongs to the humble but supremely confident Annie Malone. It was Annie who established and built the first international industry inventing, manufacturing, and selling cosmetic and hair care products for black women, doing so under her brand name Poro. She served as a formative mentor to Madam Walker as well as her employer. (Walker decided to break from Malone, becoming her primary competitor after she moved to Denver to open that market for Malone’s Poro line.)

By 1914, Malone reached multimillionaire status while Walker was working hard to get her business off the ground in Indianapolis. In 1916, Malone broke ground on a mammoth four-story corporate headquarters in St. Louis, occupying a full city block. It housed her street-level retail store front and her highly influential Poro College, which taught young African-American women cosmetic skills and life skills such as dignified comportment, professional dress, and social confidence. The musician Chuck Berry graduated from Poro in 1952, along with his two sisters.

The complex also housed a 500-seat auditorium, gymnasium, dining hall, bakery, chapel, and rooftop greenhouses for growing herbs for her products and fruits and vegetables to feed her students. The rest of the complex housed her laboratories, mail rooms, shipping depot, and the factory that produced her large and growing product line. It was an impressive structure by any standard, a small city employing several hundred busy, remarkably industrious, and successful people.

Madam Walker got her agent sales idea from Malone. It was Malone who created the first team of carefully trained and commissioned professional women decades before the Avon model came along. These women were not just sales agents, but skilled beauticians who elaborately demonstrated the products in their customer’s homes. Malone’s business grew internationally, to North and South American, Canada, Africa, and the Philippines, having trained and dispersed some 75,000 Poro agents as well as establishing beauty schools in 32 U.S. cities.

Annie was, in many ways, more philanthropic than the extremely generous Madam. She was far less conspicuous in her spending, lifestyle, and personal promotion, even though she was one of the first Americans to own a Rolls Royce. In fact, it was her quiet nature and reserved public image what allowed her less wealthy mentee to become remembered as the first self-made female millionaire, while Annie and her Poro enterprise is largely unknown.

It is truly incredible that these two poorly educated daughters of slaves founded highly successful and influential industries, growing fabulously rich beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. But even more stunning, they achieved all this in a decade or so, while no white woman or black man ever came close to achieving such a feat at that time.

We Won’t Solve Racism By Blacklisting Liam Neeson,"Recent scandals involving Liam Neeson and two top elected officials in Virginia have shown a rapidly evolving landscape for what is considered racism. The conversations around these events are generally being dictated by critics on the left, who prescribe a solution based on the idea that the easiest way to better society is to eliminate the racist individuals through massive demonization.

As the reaction to these two recent scandals have shown, however, this doesn’t really solve those problems because it’s not based in the true complexities of racism and doesn’t involve discourse and education, which are far more successful.

Liam Neeson and the Sins of the Past

To recap, Neeson gave an interview to The Guardian in which he spoke about how he dealt with a friend’s rape several years ago by fantasizing about beating up (possibly fatally) a black person: “I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I’d be approached by somebody – I’m ashamed to say that – and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [Neeson gestures air quotes with his fingers] ‘black b-stard’ would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could…kill him.”

The blowback has been swift. A sample: “While Neeson later appeared on ‘Good Morning America’ to clarify his comments and deny that he was a racist, the damage was already done. Neeson will now be known as an actor who contemplated a hate crime,” wrote Kara Alaimo in an assessment that doubled as a personal condemnation and forecasting that his career should suffer.

So let’s review: Liam Neeson revealed he had held racist beliefs in his past. Some treated this as sufficient cause to put Neeson on trial with the oversimplified question about who he is today: “Racist or not racist?”

There could be thousands or even possibly millions of people out there with the same thoughts in their head that Neeson shared. Imagine what would happen if they saw Neeson being villainized to such a degree for expressing his former opinion. They would likely be scared of expressing similar thoughts out loud.

As a result, their views might never be modified because they will never have a personalized conversation to correct their misperceptions. They could also be steered passively to the darker corners of the internet where those views are not only welcome but nurtured and weaponized that would make them even more strongly racist.

The Virginia Scandal and Past Blackface

Let’s look at the scandals regarding Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring, who have admitted to wearing costumes that fall under some definition of blackface more than 30 years ago and faced calls to resign because of their racial insensitivity.

The definition of blackface has been considerably loosened in just the last five years, as well as the degree to which it’s been considered such a massive offense. In 2013, State Assemblyman Dov Hikind wore blackface to a Purim party and was quoted as saying, when asked if he’d learn his lesson, “Next year I was thinking I’d be an Indian. But you know, I’ve changed my mind about that. I don’t think that’s a good idea. Somebody will be offended.” Despite the quasi-humorous response, he retained his seat until his retirement.

In 2008, almost a quarter-century after Northam’s yearbook photo, “Saturday Night Live” cast member Fred Armisen donned dark makeup to dress up as Barack Obama. Anyone who was keeping up with pop culture during that period likely can’t recall an outrage anywhere near the size of today’s over such things.

The point here is that context can’t be removed if one is to make a proper judgement. A discussion of that judgment can’t be driven by today’s symbolism.

A similar example of a cultural appropriation that shook the internet was Keziah Daum last year. The Utah teenager who wore a Chinese dress to the prom and faced viral backlash that originated from a Twitter response: “my culture is NOT your g-dd-mn prom dress.”

One Chinese writer published an objecting article noting that the dress itself, the qipao, was a 1920s Shanghainese fusion of Western form-fitting styles with the original chángpáo. Another Chinese writer pointed out that “cultures borrow from one another, even between the victor and vanquished….Jihadists may be chopping the heads off Western hostages, but even they sometimes wear T-shirts, jeans and trainers, and use Western-invented weapons. That’s cultural appropriation!”

In a response entitled “There’s No Such Thing as Harmless Appropriation,” one writer at the Independent wrote: “The debate her prom pictures have prompted is justified. Cultural appropriation is about power, and to many she is the embodiment of a system that empowers white people to take whatever they want, go wherever they want and be able to fall back on: ‘Well, I didn’t mean any harm.’”

Chinese writer Alex Lo responded quite saliently, “I would argue those who scream loudest about cultural appropriation are themselves after power. As soon as you raise issues about your own race and culture, you pretty much shut people up, because most people don’t want to be accused of being racist, elitist or not being ‘woke’, in the parlance of social justice warriors (SJWs).”

In other words, wearing blackface shouldn’t equate to punishment for leading a discussion about blackface. In keeping with the danger of shutting down cultural discussions, I’d like to suggest the lack of distinction between the two—as evidenced by Megyn Kelly’s recent firing and the professor at Yale who was harassed about Halloween costumes—is more worrisome than someone dressing as Michael Jackson for party purposes.

Discussion Is the Most Important Cure

The problem with any solution that seeks to cure racism through full-blast eradication is that this treats racism as a defining trait of character when it’s more a pre-conceived set of malleable beliefs. Similarly, branding people bad is not only a needlessly cruel and inaccurate description but it further discourages the notion that opinions and the way we see one another can be changed. In other words, it’s another full stop before the discussion and education component of coming to better terms about race.

There’s nothing more inevitable than people growing out of their beliefs.

Neeson is not necessarily a racist today but a man who harbored racist feelings in the past. There’s nothing more inevitable than people growing out of their beliefs. The litmus tests to see if he’s truly changed are, to some degree, justified, but the burden of proof doesn’t need to be on Neeson to dance around in a flawed PR circus of our making. Beside the terrible precedent it sets for digging up every ghost in someone’s closet, this behavior simply ignores basic human nature, which is that people change and grow.

The other main question being ignored here is what is racism measured by? It should be defined by the amount of harm it causes. Neeson just had a thought of doing something harmful. He wanted to, but ultimately did not act on that thought. What specific harmful consequences did that spread other than imparting the lesson of not acting on your violent thoughts?

Similarly, consequences matter with someone like Northam in office, both in terms of him sending a message that promotes blackface and his ability to do good things for the black community. He has pledged to lead the charge to remove more Confederate statues and push affordable housing. Whether he carries this out remains to be seen, but those actions should carry more weight than a symbolic infraction.

Racism Has Become a Moving Target

Another problem with fighting racism: It evolves in real time. Just as the proponents of cruel and unusual punishment for blackface have argued that the definitions of racism have changed and we have to draw a stronger line in the sand, we must also consider the changing opinions of those affected by blackface and other forms of cultural appropriation.

In order for these standards to be properly set, there needs to be a continued open dialogue.

For example, how well-reported were tweets of support from China that encouraged Daum to wear her prom dress? Or a 2016 Washington Post poll that found nine out of ten Native Americans weren’t offended by the Washington Redskins name? Or that 60 percent of African-Americans showed support for Northam staying in office in early February?

A recent article from Politico catalogued how what is considered scandal-worthy has changed over the decades. What was originally homosexuality and extramarital scandals transformed to drug use and draft dodging and has now transformed to sexual harassment and racial insensitivity.

There is nothing necessarily wrong with changing standards of right or wrong, assuming they are improving, but in order for these standards to be properly set, there needs to be a continued open dialogue about those issues with everyone involved and people being prepared to hear views that do not align with their political orientation. Anything less is not progress.

The Epidemic Of Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes In Brooklyn Is No Hoax,"As much of the country was transfixed by a hoaxed hate crime in Chicago over the past month, a very real wave of hate crimes in Brooklyn has been taking place. In New York City overall there have been 36 hate crimes against Jews so far this year, according to The New York Times, compared to only 21 last year. In the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn alone, ultra-orthodox Jews have been violently attacked at least 15 times since October of last year.

In most of these cases there is no apparent motive beyond anti-Semitism. No robbery occurs, and often the attackers — generally black men — and their victims are complete strangers. State and local government, as well as the New York City Police Department, have stepped up measures to protect the community, but the incidents have continued apace.

The spate of anti-Semitic attacks raises some significant questions. First and foremost, why is this happening and how can it be stopped? But also, why have the news media and the nation’s politicians been so quiet about an epidemic of hate crime in our country’s largest city? Why isn’t this a big story?

To get at an answer to the first question, we have to peer back through some troubling Brooklyn history. In 1991, the Crown Heights riots exploded in the Brooklyn neighborhood shared mainly by black and ultra-orthodox New Yorkers. Tensions between the two groups had existed for years. Then, a Jewish driver killed a black child. The crash was clearly shown to be an accident, not intentional or negligent, but deadly violence was the result nonetheless. In the years since, tensions have calmed, but never truly disappeared.

The roots of the disputes are murky. The ultra-orthodox are a strange set of neighbors in New York City. It is an insular community, in which a strict form of Jewish law, including dress codes and famously hats, is enforced. Anyone who attempts to leave the community, or live outside of its silo, is cut off from friends and family.

This is not the kind of attitude one typically looks for in neighbors. Its one thing for the Amish to promulgate this kind of lifestyle in rural Pennsylvania, but the ultra-orthodox are smack in the middle of the most populous borough of New York City. Existing in such an exclusive way in that environment is sure to cause tension, but just as surely is not grounds to be physically attacked.

For its part, the black community in New York City has struggled with accusations of anti-Semitism dating back at least to the riots. Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam has a foothold in the community, and with that comes some pretty awful messages about Jews. Even non-adherents to the Nation of Islam in the black community have a complicated relationship to Farrakhan and his message.

Recently Women’s March leader Tamika Mallory put this in some perspective when she refused to denounce Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, citing the good works he has done in black communities. To a lot of Jews, this is like saying you won’t denounce the Klan’s racism because they do a Christmas toy drive. Jewish organizations have attempted to do outreach into the black community, but frankly, the black community has its own work to do, especially in terms of condemning anti-Semites like Farrakhan.

The question of why this onslaught of anti Jewish violence is happening so quietly is not as important as stopping the violence, but it’s still important. Any fair-minded observer would agree that if 15 black people had been victims of racially motivated beatings in relatively white Bensonhurst since October, it would be a big national story. In fact, just one such alleged incident in Chicago got more coverage on its own than the attacks in Brooklyn have.

To some degree this is explained by the fact that the ultra-orthodox keep their own counsel, and do not engage in a lot of public relations outreach. But it’s more than that. It is very clear that news outlets are much more comfortable not only reporting, but also extrapolating on white violence against blacks than they are black violence against Jews.

Some of this reticence may be understandable. It can be reasonable for journalists to consider race in how they cover a story. Given the unfair stereotypes about black men regarding crime and violence, it makes sense to try to avoid feeding that stereotype. But the answer cannot simply be to bury the story because it is uncomfortable. Rather, the facts and context can be reported and explored in a nuanced manner that makes clear no broad generalizations about anyone are being asserted.

Likewise, politicians both locally and nationally need to speak up about this violence against Jews. In the wake of the alleged Smollett attacks, the tweets poured like wine from Democratic presidential candidates, yet none seem very interested in these repeated attacks on Jews in Brooklyn. That should change.

Shining a spotlight on white racists, such as the abhorrent participants in Charlottesville, is easy. It comports with a comfortable narrative about how vestiges of white supremacy still exist and must be confronted. Talking about black men committing violent hate crimes against Jews is far more complicated and difficult, yet it has to happen.

If these attacks continue, and the press continues to shield the city and country from it, people are going to die, just as they did in 1991. Now is the time when we need strong leadership from local officials and a news media willing to be upfront about what is going on. If that doesn’t happen, there is every reason to believe Brooklyn’s ultra-orthodox Jewish and black communities could be headed back into the bad old days.

Meet Black American Women Who Broke Stereotypes With Achievement,"No reasonable person would deny that education, particularly higher education, is a key indicator of social progress and personal empowerment. As we celebrate Black History Month and the significant achievements of African-Americans, it’s essential to appreciate the first African-American academics, particularly black women.

These women are a handful of remarkable pioneers, not only brilliant, but of titanium resolve and determination. We will look at several key individuals: the first African-American woman to graduate from college, the first three to earn Ph.D. degrees (they all did so the same year), and the first two to earn their medical and law degrees.

The First College Graduate

Ohio’s Oberlin College was the first institution of higher education in the United States to, by overt policy and intention, admit black students, doing so two years after its founding in 1833. Consequently, the first African-American woman to earn a bachelor’s degree did so with honors from Oberlin on August 27, 1862.

Mary Jane Patterson (1840-1894), the oldest of seven children, was born of freed slaves. Once liberated, her father had moved his family from North Carolina to Oberlin to join its burgeoning black community of both freed and fugitive slaves.

Oberlin had what is likely the first integrated public elementary school. At Oberlin College, Mary Jane was a stand-out student both academically and by reputation. One of her professors, in a letter of reference, said she was “a superior scholar, a good singer, a faithful Christian, and a genteel lady.” He recommended to prospective employers that Mary Jane was worthy of the highest teacher pay afforded to women. Mary Jane’s two sisters both earned their degrees from Oberlin as well.

Upon graduating with her bachelor’s degree, she was hired as a teacher at Philadelphia’s Institute for Colored Youth, then went to Washington D.C. to teach at the Preparatory High School for Colored Youth, America’s first public high school for black students. It would later become the prestigious Dunbar High School, where many of the women highlighted in this article attended and taught.

The pioneering Mary Jane served for many years as Dunbar’s first female principal. She continued to teach there until her death. A peer described her as “a woman with a strong, forceful personality, and showed tremendous power for good in establishing high intellectual standards in the public schools.”

Historical side note: Lucy Ann Stanton was the first African-American woman to graduate from a four-year college program, doing so 12 years earlier than Mary Jane Patterson, in 1850. But Lucy Ann only received a certificate of graduation, not a full diploma. This is because she was enrolled in Oberlin’s non-diploma granting women’s program, while Parker was enrolled in the more rigorous men’s school. In addition, 10 years before Patterson earned her diploma, Grace A. Mapps earned a four-year degree from New York Central College, but there is no record of whether this was merely a certificate or an actual diploma. History is rarely simple.

The First Academic Doctors

Who was the first African-American woman to earn the prestigious title of doctor of philosophy, otherwise known as a Ph.D.? There were three African-American women simultaneously working on their Ph.D. degrees at various institutions, and each graduated the same year—1921. They are: Georgiana Simpson (1866-1944), University of Chicago; Sadie Mossell Alexander (1898-1989), University of Pennsylvania; and Eva Dykes (1893-1986), Radcliffe College.

Dykes completed her program requirements first but was the third to receive her degree because of a technicality. She was edged out simply because Georgiana Simpson’s school (the University of Chicago) had the earliest graduation ceremony that spring. Dykes’ Radcliffe College had the latest. The three were separated by mere weeks.

Eva Beatrice Dykes was a high achiever by any measure. She earned two bachelor’s degrees, summa cum laude from Howard University in 1914 and magna cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1917. The following year, she earned her master’s degree from Radcliffe, then her Ph.D. in 1921 in literature. Her dissertation was on the English poet and satirist Alexander Pope, examining his attitudes about slavery and influence on American writers.

Upon graduation, she taught at Dunbar High School then became an award-winning professor of English at Howard University. She published two academic books, highlighting the literary works of African-Americans for students and general readers. She wrote a regular column for the Seventh-day Adventist Message magazine from 1934 until two years before her death in 1986.

Georgiana Simpson began her graduate work while also teaching at Dunbar High School. She earned her Ph.D. in philology, the study of languages and their written texts. Her concentration was in German.

She resided in the women’s dormitories at the University of Chicago, but was met with complaints by white students. When asked to leave by the director of the residence hall, she refused—but finally acquiesced at the demand of the university’s president.

After graduating, Georgiana returned to Dunbar because no college would hire a black woman to teach anything besides home economics. Even though Simpson taught high school, she continued doing advanced academic work as she could. On March 26, 1936, she wrote a letter to W.E.B. Du Bois agreeing to contribute an article to a massive project he was editing, the “Encyclopedia of the Negro.” She offered to write a philological article on “the Negro dialect” or “the basic philosophy of the Negro folk literature.”

Sadie Mossell Alexander was also extraordinarily accomplished. Not only was she the second African-American woman to receive a Ph.D., doing so in economics, she was the first woman of any ethnicity to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. She became only the second woman to be admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar, and of course, the first African-American woman. She was also the first African-American woman appointed to the city solicitor’s office of Philadelphia as well as the first woman (white or black) to serve as secretary of the National Bar Association.

Finding it difficult to secure work in the academic field of economics, Alexander practiced law until her retirement in 1982. Working in her husband’s law practice, where they both gave time to civil rights law, she specialized in estate and family law.

In 1963, she served on President John F. Kennedy Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. She was the niece of the first African-American painter to earn international acclaim, Henry Ossawa Tanner (one of my favorites), and Hallie Tanner Johnson, a physician who founded the Nurses’ School and Hospital at the Tuskegee Institute.

First Medical Degree

America’s first African-American female to earn an M.D. degree and become a physician was Rebecca Crumpler, doing so in 1864 from what is now the Boston University School of Medicine. In 1883, she became the first woman to publish a medical text book, “A Book of Medical Discourses in Two Parts,” written for nurses and mothers for the care of women and children. She developed the text from careful and detailed notes she made over the years in her medical practice.

Historians have questioned whether Crumpler ever truly earned her prestigious “first,” as it was long—but falsely—believed that Dr. Rebecca Cole was the first African-American woman to earn an M.D. We now know that Cole received her medical degree in 1867, making her the second African-American woman to do so. Susan Smith McKinney Steward was the third in 1870, and she enjoyed significantly more professional and public prestige than either Crumpler or Cole.

Crumpler explained her motivation and inspiration to practice medicine to the readers of her book this way: “It may be well to state here that, having been reared by a kind aunt in Pennsylvania, whose usefulness with the sick was continually sought, I early conceived a liking for, and sought every opportunity to relieve the sufferings of others.”

She also gave relational advice in these pages to single girls and wives. To the girls she advised, “It is best for a young woman to accept a suitor who is respectable, vigorous, industrious, but a few years her senior, if not equal age.” To wives who desired long, happy marriages, she explained, the secret “is to continue in the careful routine of the courting days, till it becomes well understood between the two.” Essentially, live in later life with same the passion you had early on.

Her husband, Arthur, had been a fugitive slave. They were married for 30 years and were both tireless workers in Boston’s celebrated Twelfth Baptist Church.

First Law Degree

Charlotte E. Ray was the first black female lawyer in the United States, earning her law degree from the Howard University School of Law in 1872. She was also the first woman admitted to the District of Columbia Bar and the first woman of any race to argue a case before the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. She also practiced corporate law. Fredrick Douglass praised her in the pages of his newspaper, often reporting on her notable achievements and holding her up as an inspirational role model to black girls.

Ray was the daughter of one of the most important leaders of the Underground Railroad in New York. Her father was a congregational pastor to primarily white congregations, which was nearly unheard of. He was also widely respected as the owner and editor of the abolitionist newspaper The Colored American.

Ray’s sister, Henrietta Cordelia, was a noted and published poet. One of her poems was read at the unveiling ceremony of the Freedman’s Memorial in Washington D.C., a statue erected in honor of the “Great Emancipator,” President Lincoln.

To protect against institutional prejudice against women potentially being admitted to Howard’s Law School as well the bar, she registered for both as C. E. Ray. Her most famous case was not in her field of corporate law, but rather family law. Argued before the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, she took the 1875 divorce case of an impoverished and illiterate woman, Martha Gadley, who had for years lived under the extreme abuse and cruelty of her husband.

It was nearly impossible that such a woman could secure a divorce at this time, even under such dire circumstances. Taking up the challenge out of sympathy, Ray succeeded in getting the case before the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and secured Gadley’s legal freedom from her husband.

One of the first women to have an independent practice, Ray gave up her work in the legal profession due to prospective clients’ reservations about hiring a woman to handle their valuable corporate and real estate cases. She moved to Brooklyn to work as a teacher alongside her two sisters. Today, the National Bar Association bestows the Charlotte E. Ray Award to female lawyers of distinction.

Considering the obstacles they had to overcome, it was relatively quickly that African-American women, rising out of the evil chains of slavery, attained distinction as brilliant and notable scholars. Each made valuable and lasting contributions to her academic field as well as to her community. They stand as wonderful examples to us all, and especially to young African-American women, of what resilience, courage, and unwavering determination can accomplish.

"Jussie Smollett Cries Wolf, People Believe Hate Crimes Less","Two of history’s most famous storytellers can provide insight into a modern political controversy.

One is Aesop, the ancient Greek author of fables, including “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” In that fable, a young, bored shepherd amuses himself by pretending a wolf is chasing his sheep. When the shepherd yells, “Wolf, wolf,” nearby villagers run from their homes to help. When no wolf can be found, the shepherd laughs at the villagers’ credulity. When a real wolf threatens his sheep, however, the villagers refuse to be fooled again, despite the shepherd’s sincere pleas.

Now move from the hills of Greece to the streets of Chicago, where a young actor, Jussie Smollett, claimed to be a victim of racism. Smollett asserted that two men wearing “Make America Great Again” caps attacked him and tied a noose around his neck while yelling racist and anti-gay slurs on Jan. 29. California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Rev. Al Sharpton were among those decrying the apparent attack, with both senators demanding federal laws against lynching.

When Chicago police found that Smollett fabricated the incident, they arrested him Feb. 21 and charged him with felony disorderly conduct. On March 7, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony charges. However, powerful people used their influence not only to get all charges dropped but also to get all records pertaining to the case sealed.

The “attack” on Smollett ostensibly reflects the increased bigotry that President Donald Trump supposedly inspires. Yet those perpetuating such hoaxes risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism by sacrificing truth on the altar of political expediency.

Smollett Added to a Chorus Crying ‘Wolf!’

Smollett’s hoax merely attracted the most national attention among numerous similar fabrications. One week before the presidential election, an arsonist painted the words “Vote Trump” on the walls of the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, a black church in Greenville, Miss., before destroying it. The arsonist? Andrew McClinton, a black congregant with a prior criminal record.

Immediately after the election, a swastika and the words, “Heil Trump” and “Fag Church” were found on the walls of St. David’s Episcopal Church in Brown County, Indiana. The graffiti was “among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win,” wrote the Washington Post. Yet six months later, police arrested organist George Nathaniel Stang for vandalizing his own church.

“I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag,” wrote Stang, who added that he wanted to “mobilize a movement.”

In December 2016, Yasmin Seweid asserted that three intoxicated white men yelling “Donald Trump” called her a terrorist and tried to remove her hijab forcibly while riding a New York subway. Seweid also claimed no other passengers tried to help her. But Seweid admitted to fabricating the incident, and was arraigned two weeks later for filing a false criminal report, a misdemeanor in New York State.

Hate Hoaxes Are Rife on Campuses, Too

In 2017, students at St. Olaf’s College, Drake University, Kansas State University, and the Air Force Academy Preparatory School found threatening messages with anti-black insults on campus. The messages appeared in notes on car windshields or under dormitory doors, on whiteboards, and as painted graffiti on a car.

The Air Force Academy’s superintendent, Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, asked students, faculty members, and staffers gathered at a meeting to use their cell phones to record his message, in which he briefly referenced the riots at Charlottesville, Va. and Ferguson, Mo.: “If you can’t treat someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.” The Air Force posted Silveria’s entire five-minute speech on its Twitter account.

At Kansas State, black students led similar meetings to discuss possible racism on campus. The FBI even began a civil rights investigation.

Larger rallies took place at St. Olaf’s and Drake. Students at St. Olaf’s, a Lutheran college in Minnesota, staged protests, presented their demands by interrupting a forum, and forced classes to be cancelled for one day. At Drake, about 3,500 attended a rally supporting two minority students who received racist notes in their dorms.

“Why do you only show up in times of crisis?” Maleigha Williams, president of Drake’s Coalition of Black Students, asked the crowd. “Why do you only come when someone asks you to?”

Ensuing investigations, however, determined that the incidents at all three colleges were staged. Students from Drake, Kansas State, and the Air Force Academy Preparatory School—the reported targets of the messages—admitted writing them.

In September 2018, Adwoa Lewis from Baldwin, N.Y. claimed that as she was driving home, four white teenagers told her she “didn’t belong here” and yelled “Trump 2016.” When Lewis awoke the next morning, she found one of her tires slashed and a note on her windshield telling her to “go home.” But police discovered that the confrontation never happened, and Lewis admitted writing the note.

Fears of Saying the Truth Abound

Those examples reflect a larger problem that another famous author, Hans Christian Andersen, addressed in his story, “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” Two swindlers, posing as weavers, persuaded an emperor to purchase garments made from materials that would be invisible to anybody who was stupid or unfit for office. Naturally, the weavers produced nothing. But the emperor, his courtiers, and his subjects believed the weavers’ lies for fear of finding themselves stupid or unfit.

‘Simply put, Klansmen armed with nooses are not lurking on Chicago street corners.’

In today’s United States, the lie is the idea that Trump promotes a resurgence of the kind of bigotry that enabled Jim Crow to flourish and 30,000 members of the Ku Klux Klan to demonstrate their power in 1925 by marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. The fear is the dread of being considered “racist,” and the swindlers are such notables as Harris, Booker, Sharpton, and the rest of the “democratic socialists” in the academy, the media, the entertainment industry, and the Democratic Party, all of whom refuse to confront the hoaxers forthrightly.

“There is very little brutally violent racism in the modern USA,” wrote Wilfred Reilly, an assistant political science professor at Kentucky State University, a historically black college, for USA Today. “There are less than 7,000 real hate crimes reported in a typical year. Inter-racial crime is quite rare. 84 percent of white murder victims and 93 percent of Black murder victims are killed by criminals of their own race, and the person most likely to kill you is your ex-wife or husband. When violent inter-racial crimes do occur, whites are at least as likely to be the targets as are minorities.”

“Simply put, Klansmen armed with nooses are not lurking on Chicago street corners.”

Hate Hoaxes Desensitize People to Real Racism

Yet facts cannot serve a manipulative narrative.

“In college campus hate hoax cases … the individuals responsible almost invariably say that they staged incidents to call attention to real incidents of racist violence on campus,” Reilly wrote. “Certainly, the media giants that leap to publicize hate crime stories later revealed to be fakes, and the organizations that line up to defend their ‘victims’ — the Southern Poverty Law Center, Black Lives Matter, CAIR — think that they are providing a public service by fighting bigotry.”

They not only risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism. They declare the civil rights movement to be a monumental failure.

James S. Robbins, a columnist for USA Today, believes Smollett exploited that mindset.

“Why did Smollett believe that his alleged plan to manufacture outrage would succeed?” Robbins wrote. “Most probably because it was designed to fit a specific, well-established victimhood narrative. In this case, it was the young, gay, black celebrity versus the beastly, MAGA-preaching white racist homophobes. There is no ambiguity in that almost cartoonish scenario.

“The props and Trump-implicating rhetoric were necessary to establish the supposed hate motive. Otherwise Smollett might have been viewed as just another Chicago crime victim. And it was important to tie the faux attack to the idea prevalent on the left that the advent of the Trump era has unleashed an unprecedented wave of violence against ‘the other’” (emphasis added).

By perpetuating that lie, “democratic socialists” do more than cynically promote their agenda. They not only risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism. They declare the civil rights movement to be a monumental failure. They essentially assert that such men and women as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Medgar Evers, James Meredith, Ralph Abernathy, and the Freedom Riders fought—and, in some cases, died—in vain.

Those who perpetrate and enable false racial crimes must remember the advice an old villager gave the young shepherd at the end of Aesop’s fable: “Nobody believes a liar…even when he is telling the truth!”

"If We Cancel Kate Smith, We Must Cancel The New York Yankees","It was announced this week that both the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Flyers would stop using their traditional recorded version of Kate Smith singing “God Bless America” during their games. This happened after it surfaced that Smith had performed songs now considered racist during during her hey day in the 1930s. The Flyers, with whom Smith is more closely aligned as the good luck charm for their 1974 Stanley Cup run, even removed a statue of her from the Philadelphia sports complex.

In a brilliant monologue, sports commentator Jason Whitlock broke down the absurdity of these moves. The whole video is worth watching. Among other things, Whitlock points out that the song “That’s Why The Darkies Were Born,” recorded by Smith in the 1930s, was satire that was also performed by black civil rights legend Paul Robeson. I hope Robeson, one of the most important black figures of the 20th century, won’t have to meet this same fate.

This is damn well said by @WhitlockJason on insane “God Bless America” singer controversy. pic.twitter.com/7roaE2M1eU — Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) April 20, 2019

But I would like to focus for a moment on the New York Yankees, which is arguably the most important sports franchise in the world. The irony of this team cancelling Smith for actions she took almost a century ago that are only mildly problematic, while their own team refused to hire black ballplayers, is astounding.

Smith sang a silly song. The Yankees systematically denied qualified black baseball players the right to make a good a living for more than half a century. So why is Smith being exiled while the Bronx Bombers go along like nothing happened? The answer is that throwing Smith under the bus more than 40 years after her death costs nothing. It is the empty virtue signaling that corporate America prefers to reflecting on their actions.

If we must lose Smith — if her statues must be taken down, if her songs must be silenced — then how do we justify allowing modern players, including black players, to wear the uniform of a team that denied black Americans agency and personhood? Any fair treatment of this situation would require that the Yankee pinstripes be retired right along side Smith.

Amidst the controversy, Stephen Smith of ESPN chimed in to try to explain why banishing Kate Smith is acceptable. His co-panelist Will Cain argued that if we go down this road of dragging everyone who did something inappropriate nearly a century ago, who will be left? He even pointed out that maybe Barack Obama should be cancelled for his bigoted views on gay marriage, and that was only a decade ago. Smith thought he had an answer.

He said, “That’s pretty d-mn easy for you to say, because you’re not the offended party. It’s real easy for the group that is not the offended party to take that position.” Cain replied, “There will always be an offended party, Stephen A, and they’ll make that argument to you one day.” Count on it.

Smith’s deeply misguided point seems to be that if some group of people are offended — and it’s not entirely clear who actually is offended by Kate Smith — then their destructive desires must be entertained and acted upon. No discussion is needed, no context is required, no good works come into play. Just tear down the statue and throw the offender into the dustbin of history.

Fair enough. I am deeply offended by the fact that the New York Yankees refused to field a black player for the first half of the 20th century. Don’t tell me that’s just how it was. Don’t tell me it was the rule. Branch Rickey and the Brooklyn Dodgers had the courage to break that rule in the 1940s, well before the beloved Yankees did. How can this be forgiven? How can we celebrate their legacy while Kate Smith’s is destroyed?

The only fair and just thing to do here is for the New York Yankees franchise to fold, along with all but the expansion Major League Baseball franchises that came into being after integration. We can replace them quickly with new teams, teams that never denied black people the right to play. If Kate Smith is being cancelled for her actions 80 years ago, then so must the New York Yankees be.

These are the rules. Well, sort of. These are the rules when it doesn’t cost anybody any money. These are the rules when we decide to deride the memory of a woman who achieved greatness at a time when that was very hard.

She immortalized a second national anthem, and raised millions to support the war effort in World War II. Yet she is a problem for singing a satirical song. But Joe DiMaggio is a hero even though he consented to outright racism that helped him secure his job. Let’s end the Yankees. Please sign my petition.

Trans Admission To HBCU Undermine What It Means To Be A Black Man,"Beyonce’s new Netflix movie about her Coachella performance exposes the audience to the culture of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). HBCUs appeal to people because of their history and tradition.

These colleges continue to provide an education to black students, although all races are welcome to attend, that emphasizes being positive members of our community. While people like Beyonce and billionaire Robert Smith shining the spotlight on HBCUs can benefit the institutions, I fear mainstream culture has began to corrode the mission of some of these colleges. That includes my alma mater, Morehouse College, which has been an all-male institution — until now.

Morehouse, the Powerhouse

Morehouse is an all-male college that boasts alumni such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Howard Thurman. The Atlanta-based college, like the city it is located in, has a strong gay male culture. In 2009, students cross-dressing on campus led administrators to create a dress code that explicitly forbade students from wearing women’s clothes.

Despite the dress code, the shifting culture around gender identity brought many young men who consider themselves gender non-conforming. I attended Morehouse with several non-conforming students who are biologically male, and I consider them just as much my Morehouse brothers as any other alumnus.

When Morehouse hired last year its first non-alumni president in five decades, I feared he would bring the sort of corrosive liberal policies that define predominantly white colleges and universities. This fear may have been founded, since the men’s college has recently changed its admissions policy to include the acceptance of transgender people who are biologically female.

The new policy states, “Morehouse will consider for undergraduate admission those applicants who live and self-identify as men, regardless of the sex assigned to them at birth.” This makes it clear the agenda of its Ivy League-educated president is to make Morehouse just like the liberal, white campuses that he is accustomed to. The “who live” part of the policy is the most troubling.

When I was a student at Morehouse, we were able to celebrate our differences and learn from one another. This was, in large part, due to the fact that the majority of us were black men. That common understanding is what makes Morehouse different from other colleges. This is undermined by stretching the definition of “black man.” If anyone can be a black man, this cheapens the experience of students currently on campus.

It is unsettling that a bureaucrat will get to determine what it means for a student to “live” as a man in order to determine whether someone with two X chromosomes should be allowed to attend an all-male college. Accepting students who are biologically female undermines the fact that the campus is historically all-male.

Morehouse was founded in 1867 to provide black men a college education. This tradition has stood more than 150 years, only to be undermined by people who don’t care about the history of the college. Spelman College, an all women’s HBCU located next to Morehouse, has instituted a similar policy to allow transgender males to attend. They celebrated when a trans man graduated from campus, even though this person was biologically female.

Gender Ideology Undermines the Unique Value of Each Sex

This redefinition of biological “sex” is merely the tool of destructive identity politics, and it does not belong at HBCUs. These sorts of policies are especially out of place at single-sex campuses that don’t even allow students to have overnight visitors of the opposite sex.

Single-sex colleges and the notion that sex is assigned at birth cannot coexist. An astute Twitter commenter pointed out that the logical end of these liberal gender policies is also the end of single-sex institutions. A student at Morehouse has suggested that because “they” do not use masculine pronouns the college should stop using masculine pronouns. While these single-sex colleges might seem out of date, upholding tradition is the greatest defense against the degenerative, liberal forces that threaten our nation.

HBCU traditions are under threat thanks to outside influences that promote a western universalism based on faulty leftist ideology. Just like feminism has been used to manipulate women, identity politics continues to be used to manipulate minorities. The fact that Morehouse and Spelman have accepted these policies points out how dangerous it is to be beholden to external parties. Accepting this foolishness is little more than a cash grab. HBCUs will quickly find out that chasing liberal validation will only result in fool’s gold.

Paying lip service to the liberal elite plays on people’s emotions to gain political power. Statements like this from the current president of Morehouse: “I think Morehouse having the courage to speak to issues of masculinity in today’s environment is important,” diverts attention from the real issues facing America’s black communities. A positive black masculinity is best used to address the issues we have building strong family structures. Accepting a belief system that views traditional masculinity as toxic diverts this mission.

HBCUs have remained a beacon of hope in promoting traditional values, but they are clearly not impervious to the constant threat of liberal thinking.

The Far-Left Doesn’t Represent Black Men

Morehouse and black people in general are in no way advanced by the far left’s views. The slippery slope toward “eliminating sex distinctions” is a threat to the black nuclear family.

Identity politics foster “a spirit of resentment” that pits the sexes against one another. The worst aspect of identity politics is that it makes citizens easier to control. This agenda conveniently makes all struggles the same.

A white man once proclaimed to me it was okay for him to refer to himself as a “pink n—er” because he is gay. Intersectional thought like this compels people to compare struggles and assume they are equal. Predominantly white colleges have disavowed their own traditions in order to keep up with the times, causing much of the value in American higher education to be watered down. HBCUs should not follow suit.

HBCUs are going down that same path because out-of-touch bureaucrats believe that is in the best interest of these institutions’ future. Yet these campuses are too precious a resource to water down in a time where all forms of tradition stand against the agenda of America’s corrupt elite.

In The Maw Of Wokeness,"The first thing I saw at the first National Antiracist Book Festival was a white college kid with a disappointing tuft of an attempted goatee wearing a Colin Kaepernick shirt. I thought about telling him that I was sitting on a plane across from Kaepernick a week earlier – I remain a fan of his play style, and have been ever since he was running the spread at Nevada – and was disappointed when the former quarterback whose corporate Nike-backed mantra is “Believe in Something Even If It Means Sacrificing Everything” declined to give a mild-mannered old lady who humbly requested it an autograph. You should never meet your heroes.

The National Antiracist Book Festival is a project of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, headed by Ibram Xolani Kendi, who describes himself as “hardcore humanist and softcore vegan”. In 2013, he changed his middle name from Henry (Xolani apparently means “Peace” in Zulu) and his last from Rogers (Kendi apparently means “loved one” in Meru). He is an Ideas columnist at The Atlantic, where he compiled a syllabus for Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, and author of “Stamped From The Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America”, which includes most of them.

According to Kendi’s invitation letter, The National Antiracist Book Festival recognizes that it is primarily about anti-black racism. In its panel schedule, it is exclusively so. In the absence of other knowledge, one could come away from this conference with the perception that there is only one kind of racism, and only one kind of racist – that all crimes of racism are white on black. It began with segments on “the history and persistence of racism in the Christian church”, was bisected by a screening of the film “I Am Not Racist… Am I?”, and ended with Michael Eric Dyson on Jim Crow. You can probably predict everything that came in between.

Attendees exuded a mix of fashionable wokeness. A woman with a Luis Vuitton bag and $800 Gucci sneakers dutifully took notes as DeRay McKesson spoke in his trademark Patagonia puffy vest, deploying a series of lines and catchphrases that seemed less tied to the topic of the panel (“On White Supremacy”) and more about his personal priorities, such as explaining Brett Kavanaugh’s badness to his aunt. “They hid the White House papers, it was bad!”

McKesson talked about circulating at a Hollywood event, and experiencing an unnamed interlocutor questioning his claimed statistic that “white high school dropouts make more than black college graduates.” (The actual statistic is median accumulated wealth, not income, and doesn’t differentiate between graduates and those who attended some college, who presumably face the attendant debt.) McKesson claimed he responded to his questioner by saying: “The only reason you have more white people is you killed off half the other people and enslaved the other half.” Recognizing the shibboleth, the audience clapped.

“White supremacy is a smog, we all inhale it,” McKesson said. It is “a system of domination that infects every area of society.” His message to white folks: “How did you personally work to make all the Band Aids look like you? What did you do for the Homestead Act? … White supremacy is baked into the structure, it’s intentional. People made this up. It was designed.”

In the panel “On Democracy,” a white girl in an H&M jacket wore a shirt with the message “Dream Like Martin Lead Like Harriet Fight Like Malcolm Think Like Garvey Write Like Maya Build Like Madam C.J. Speak Like Frederick Educate Like W.E.B. Believe Like Thurgood Challenge Like Rosa.” She listened as Carol Anderson, Alicia Garza, and Kendi all came to the conclusion that America has never had a democracy, and instead had a government that was, in Kendi’s understanding, “stamped from the beginning to build and maintain the power of white folk.” A listener in the back corrected aloud: “RICH white folk!”

“We’ve never had a democracy,” Kendi said. “In order to have freedom you have to have power. You have to have power in order to be free. People of color have never had power, women have never had power… antiracists must organize and accumulate power, the power to make and break policy.”

Anderson, the author of “White Rage”, “Bourgeois Radicals”, and “One Person No Vote”, argued that what remains underappreciated is the ever-present nature of racist anger by white people in every aspect of life, furthering “policies to put black people back in their place”. For this, she cited multiple claims she presented as facts, including: 16 million people were purged off voter rolls between 2012 and 2016 (“that’s white rage,” she said, “they’re electorally dead”); that Georgia’s Brian Kemp purged 10 percent of voters from Georgia rolls before 2018 election; that Kemp withheld 1,000 voting machines from minority counties on election day; that Ohio stopped being a swing state because it allows only one early voting location in each county; that in Wisconsin, 27 percent of black voters were prevented from voting in 2016 by voter ID law; and that GOP Secretaries of State including Kemp and Kobach have publicly claimed “voting isn’t a right, it’s a privilege to be earned.”

These claims awed the crowd and even the moderator, shaking their heads and murmuring with frustration. Most of them, you’ll be happy to learn, are exaggerated or in some cases totally untrue.

First, keep in mind the states are required to cull their voter lists. “The 1993 National Voter Registration Act mandates that state and local elections officers keep voter registration lists accurate by removing the names of people who die, move or fail in successive elections to vote.”

Second, those 1,000 voting machines: they were withheld “because of an ongoing federal lawsuit that argues Georgia’s electronic voting machines could be hacked or tampered with.” Abrams’ allies have made similar claims: “The suit was filed last November by Fair Fight Action, the nonprofit arm of a new voting rights organization founded by [Stacey] Abrams…”

Prior to the midterms, there was a question whether the machines were vulnerable to being hacked, so a September ruling from U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg – an Obama appointee and sister of liberal reporter Nina Totenberg – ordered them sequestered.

Third, that 27 percent of Wisconsin black voters? It was based on a “survey” of a grand total of 288 people, and they were asked whether they were “deterred”, not blocked.

As for the claim that Ohio stopped being a swing state because it allows only one early voting location in each county – which would be news to Senator Sherrod Brown, and to Barack Obama, who won the state under the same rules in 2012. – it assumes that people are too dumb to use the mail.

About that claim GOP Secretaries of State including Kemp and Kansas’s Kris Kobach have publicly said “voting isn’t a right, it’s a privilege to be earned”? The closest example I can find is that Kemp’s lawyers have argued that voting by mail is a “privilege and a convenience, different in kind from the fundamental right to vote itself.” And, well, it is.

And what effect have all these purported efforts to target black voters achieved? Much higher turnout!

“If Georgia’s Brian Kemp is a vote suppressor, he’s the least successful vote suppressor alive. Turnout in Georgia was immense. In the previous gubernatorial election, Republican Nathan Deal won with 1.3 million votes. In November, Abrams lost with 1.9 million votes. There were roughly 2.5 million total votes cast in 2014. In 2018, more than 3.9 million Georgians voted. That almost matches the total votes cast for president in 2016.”

The total turnout in Georgia gubernatorial elections goes like this:

2006: 2,122,185

2010: 2,576,161

2014: 2,550,648

2018: 3,939,409

The turnout for the presidential election in 2016 was 4,141,447. They got 95% of that in the midterm, which is just unheard of. If Kemp was trying to make black people “electorally dead”, he did a very bad job of it.

Why is all this happening? Because it is a mechanism for seizing power by destroying the enemy narrative, and the enemy in this case is the United States of America. It advances an argument against Frederick Douglass, who said “The Constitution is a glorious liberty document.” And it all started at the moment Democrats started telling themselves they no longer needed the votes of poor white people. Interesting coincidence.

Clad in a Black AF shirt, Damon Young, the author of What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Blacker, argued in the panel “On Poverty” that “If you are a black person creating art, you want to subvert the white gaze, but my editor at Harper Collins is white, I haven’t googled Harper or Collins but I assume they white – am I really subverting? Or am I still performing?”

His co-panelist, D. Watkins, echoed this perspective. “I’ve been muffled and silenced a lot, my best lines have been eaten.” He detailed an argument with an editor about referring to ordering a “chicken box” as opposed to a “box of chicken.”

Will Joe Biden’s Black Support Squash ‘Identity Politics’ In 2020?,"In South Carolina, the latest Post and Courier-Change Research poll cements Joe Biden’s status as front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. The former veep leads Sen. Bernie Sanders by 46 to 15 percent, with Sen. Kamala Harris following at 10 percent.

Biden’s success in the Palmetto State (and beyond), fueled to a large degree by African-American Democrats, threatens to tilt the party away from the far-left progressivism the establishment media had assumed will dominate the 2020 primary campaign.

At the outset, consider how significant Biden’s black support is in South Carolina:

https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/1127934501378772998

As Dan McLaughlin noted at National Review, “[South Carolina’s] Democratic-primary electorate was 43 percent white and 55 percent black in 2008, 35 percent white and 61 percent black in 2016. By 2016, black women alone (37 percent of the primary voters) outnumbered all white voters in the South Carolina primary.”

Biden’s current coalition reflects the “upstairs/downstairs” schism in his party between the wealthier, whiter, college-educated elites and the poorer, more diverse, less-credentialed rank-and-file. While most of the 2020 Democrats are fighting over the “upstairs” group, Crazy Uncle Joe is cleaning up with the “downstairs” group, which probably constitutes the largest bloc of Democrats.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Biden is not relying on Democrats remaining the party of Barack Obama. The coalition the former president assembled was different. Obama relied on “upstairs” demographics including the college-educated, woke progressives, and younger voters. Biden’s “downstairs” coalition skews much more to older voters.

What Biden shares with Obama is goodwill with black voters. The reflexive reaction would be to assume Biden merely inherited black support from the first black president. The reality is likely more complicated than that.

A recent New York Times story on black voters in South Carolina captures some of the ideological debate existing even within this demographic (some of it generational). But in addition to Biden’s association with Obama, black voters historically have been at least as pragmatic as ideological. (Even the far left recognizes this.)

As one voter told the NYT: “Trump casts a shadow of uncertainty, while Joe Biden is security.” In primaries, black Democrats also have tended to favor “safer” choices like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. It is often forgotten that Hillary polled well against Obama with black voters in the 2008 cycle until he beat her in the very pale state of Iowa and almost won the similarly pasty state of New Hampshire.

Biden’s current lead in Iowa is only a few points; his low double-digit lead in New Hampshire remains narrower than in South Carolina. But if Biden wins either of those early contests, his current black support would make him tough to beat.

McLaughlin again has sobering numbers. By next March 17, five weeks after New Hampshire, “64 percent of the delegates will have been chosen. Some 93 percent of those delegates will be selected by primaries, not caucuses; 46 percent of the delegates through March 17 will be chosen by states likely to have majority-nonwhite electorates, and another 22.6 percent by states where white voters are likely to be below 70 percent. This is not Bernie Country. If he hasn’t shown overwhelming strength in the first two primaries, he’s going to find himself swimming against the tide.”

Indeed, since Biden’s entry in the race, things have gotten worse for Bernie. Even a glance at the current Real Clear Politics national poll average for the Democratic nomination shows Biden rocketing while Sanders slumps. However, Bernie’s decline is not primarily due to black voters (with whom he’s doing better than in 2016, though that is a low bar). Rather, whites without college degrees, who were a mainstay of Bernie’s support in 2016, are moving over to Biden.

As a result, Bernie has become more of an “upstairs” candidate at a time when the “upstairs” pool of voters is split among the rest of the candidates not named Biden. So far, Bernie’s appeal “upstairs” has a ceiling because the old-school socialist has declined to wallow in the wokest forms of identity politics.

To beat Biden, someone will have to attract a critical mass of not only the Democrats’ “upstairs” pool, but also the party’s nonwhite voters, particularly blacks (other nonwhite demographics tend to be smaller and more heterogeneous politically). To date, Sanders seems unlikely to accomplish the second part.

Harris conceivably could rebuild the Obama coalition, but has come off as a pure “upstairs” candidate. She may need to win or finish strong in Iowa or New Hampshire to convince nonwhite voters she is a safe choice who can win. Biden’s remaining rivals—particularly Pete Buttigieg—fare so poorly with nonwhites to date that they seem every bit the longshots the top lines of the polls suggest.

Given this landscape, the field is left hoping Crazy Uncle Joe blows himself up, which has not happened so far, in part because his staff is trying to give him the scripted campaign of a vice-president. Even assuming Biden does let a few gaffes fly along the trail, one lesson of President Trump’s success may be that ordinary voters care about gaffes much less than journalists do.

Another lesson of 2016 may be that the front-runner sometimes remains the front-runner. Biden is the best-known of the field and he is not polling like Jeb Bush. Identity politics is increasingly popular within the Democratic Party, but the fact that the field has overwhelmingly pitched itself to the “upstairs” faction makes it less likely any of Biden’s rivals can assemble the coalition needed to beat him.

Are Pro-Choicers Okay With The Black Baby Death Toll?,"“The right doesn’t actually care about black or brown babies.” I have seen viral variations of this quote on social media countless times the past couple of weeks, amidst pro-life victories in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Ohio, and more.

I listened as Alyssa Milano claimed that protecting the preborn would be “catastrophic” for black women. I was deeply disturbed as major news outlets flooded readers with arguments that black women would be hurt the most by pro-life laws, even to the point of enslaving them once again. And I was in utter disbelief when Ohio state Rep. Janine Boyd proposed an amendment to a bill that would only allow black mothers to have an abortion.

The left thrives on recklessly leveraging race. They inflame and foment racial differences until their voters are hysterical over the idea that slavery is returning to our country at the hands of the pro-life movement. The left’s frenzied panic and outlandish claims compel me to respond to the insidious lie that “the right doesn’t actually care about black and brown babies.”

I am black. I am pro-life. And I do care. I think I can speak for all pro-lifers when I say we care about all pre-born babies—babies so early in development that they don’t even have a skin color yet. Regrettably, it is the left that has a race problem at its core, and this problem is as old as the institution of slavery.

It is the left, in fact, that worships an organization that was birthed out of the racist ideas of its founder, Margaret Sanger. She was a staunch proponent of the contemptible, progressive, eugenics movement—the discredited philosophical concept that “undesirable” people should be eliminated from the gene pool of the human race. “Undesirables” like the poor, illiterate, disabled, and the dark-skinned.

Unfortunately, Sanger’s degenerate beliefs led her to work very closely and intentionally with the black community, “assuring” them that her goal was not to “exterminate the Negro population.” America’s intricate strategy to dovetail racist policies and eugenics was so effective that it was studied by one Adolf Hitler, and the horrors of the eugenics movement were fully realized in the unspeakable atrocities of the Holocaust.

Fast-forward to today, and Sanger’s early organization, the American Birth Control League, has become today’s Planned Parenthood, and the intentional targeting of America’s minorities continues. It appears that 79 percent of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities are within walking distance of black and brown neighborhoods. Indeed, more than 19 million black babies have been aborted since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973, effectively reducing the size of today’s black community by 40 to 50 percent!

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 36 percent of all abortions in the United States are performed on black women, despite the fact that they represent just 13 percent of the population. Hispanic babies are also aborted at 1.5 times the rate of white babies, making up 18 percent of all aborted babies. Essentially, more members of the black community are killed by abortion each year in the United States than by all other causes combined.

Despite the intentional targeting of poor and minority communities that has persisted across the decades, Sanger’s strategy to ensure that blacks remain unaware of their extermination has worked perfectly, with both pro-choice blacks and their allies insisting on their right to choose.

More than 100 years ago, the “pro-choice” party of today insisted that the institution of slavery was also a choice to which every state was entitled. Their platform was that each state should have the right to choose whether slavery was a morally acceptable option for its own citizens. In addition, states were not allowed to impose their moral beliefs about slavery on others because slavery was a constitutionally protected right.

If leftists were truly staunch advocates of racial equality and harmony, they should be moved to address the fact that the face of abortion has a color. They should be compelled to address the fact their pro-choice platform of a century past has resulted in tens of millions of lives lost, a great many of them black. Pro-lifers understand that a law that is ruled to be “constitutional” can still be morally reprehensible.

So the next time you hear someone on the left claiming that the right doesn’t care about brown and black babies, know that it’s a lie designed to cover up their own shameful past and present. The truth is this: Regardless of political philosophy, no one is doing more to protect brown and black babies than the pro-life movement.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/intersectionality-lie-pro-choicers-okay-black-baby-death-toll/,2019-06-10
Black Mirror Series 5 Is Less Tech-Focused And More Character-Driven,"Series five of “Black Mirror,” writer-creator Charlie Brooker’s dark anthology series, dropped on Netflix last week. This newest batch of episodes is less preoccupied with what the tech world may look like in the near future and more interested with how we are dealing with it today.

Character-driven and grounded in more or less present-day reality, this might be the least “Black Mirror”-ish series to date, and a possible start to the show’s mature period. That sounds ominous, but Brooker has scored a strong if short season this time out, again taking advantage of our collective unease about the technology—those “black mirrors”—we have surrounded ourselves with.

Each of the three episodes of series five (remember that Brooker spent a lot of energy on the technically innovative “Black Mirror” movie “Bandersnatch”) tops out at just over an hour. One episode leans tense and serious, one is screwball and farcical, the other an intriguingly mature look at friendship, marriage, and sex.

After gaining a cult following from its shocking UK debut in 2011, “Black Mirror” moved to Netflix for its third series, with longer running times and more exotic locations, including American settings, although the show has oddly never filmed in the United States. Series three focused on high-tech eye-tech, while series four tapped into an existential fear of being trapped in our own digital hells. Series five, if it has a theme, is about fighting off loneliness via personal connection.

As always with the show, don’t infer anything from the episode titles.

Episode 1, ‘Striking Vipers’ Grade: A-

Brooker proves there is still something interesting to say about virtual reality technology. Two college friends, Karl and Danny (played by Anthony Mackie from the Marvel movies) meet up and bond again over the titular kung-fu fighting video game, based on the “Street Fighter” franchise.

Eleven years later, Karl, the more outgoing and impulsive one, hasn’t settled down, while the reserved Danny and his now-wife Theo have a slightly boring middle-aged marriage, being bossed around by their high-tech dishwasher. Karl gives Danny a fateful birthday gift: An immersive, virtual reality version of “Striking Vipers.” But when Danny and Karl role-play as fighters “Lance” and “Roxette” inside the game’s world, what else changes besides their handles?

Brooker has an underappreciated talent for slice-of-life pathos, steering a murky path through the workarounds of marriage and friendship. Situations here that could have easily come off ludicrous were effective thanks to the quietly believable acting. I am not a big fan of drama-mode “Black Mirror,” but this episode really worked.

Episode 2, ‘Smithereens’ Grade: B

Actor Andrew Scott goes all-in as a London rideshare driver with a desperate, potentially deadly obsession with the social media company of the title. He’s on a quest to speak to company founder Billy Bauer, who is on a 10=day technology fast in Utah complete with Jesus sandals and a man-bun.

The thin, mechanistic plot is aided by a quiet, tense atmosphere. But questions about motivation become a fatal flaw. The story may have worked better five years ago when the perils of social media hadn’t become quite so baked into our digital cake. As is, “Smithereens” is an ironic victim of the show’s cultural imprint—foreseeable partly because we’ve absorbed so much “Black Mirror” over the last five years.

Episode 3, ‘Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too’ Grade: A-

This is the surprise smash of series five, with a “Vox Lux” vibe, but more entertaining. Parallel themes of loneliness are experienced by world-famous pop star Ashley O (played by actual world-famous pop star Miley Cyrus) and one of her legion of teenage fans, Rachel, struggling at a new school while receiving little empathy from older sister Jack, a sullen guitar player resistant to Ashley O’s charms, and their widowed father, beavering in the basement to perfect “humane” mouse control.

As in “Striking Vipers,” things change with the arrival of a birthday gift for Rachel: A miniature stylized robot doll, branded Ashley Too, its circuits stuffed with banal paeans of encouragement and empowerment, like the star herself. Inspired by the doll to mimic Ashley O’s choreography for a school talent show, Rachel practices with amateur enthusiasm and amateur talent, leading to a scene that feels inevitable but is still heart-breaking.

When catastrophe strikes, the two stories merge and the tone abruptly changes, as various teenage movie genres start crashing into each other pell-mell. There’s a sinister Svengali crew and echoes of “The Fugitive,” making a fun farce that is goofy, corny, and crammed with incidents, demonstrating a message of individual empowerment without making an after-school special about it.

Reviewers aren’t wild about the series five package as a whole, but for me, two neat stories out of three is pretty good for late-period “Black Mirror.” Brooker made a change of pace, slowed things down a little, and got away with it.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/black-mirror-series-5-less-tech-focused-character-driven/,2019-06-12
"Thomas Sowell Talks About Discrimination, Race, And Social Justice","A newly updated version of Thomas Sowell’s book, “Discrimination and Disparities,” came out this spring. The author and famed economist sat down with writer David Hogberg to talk about it and his life’s work.

David Hogberg: I want to read to you something that a currently very popular actress by the name of Brie Larson said at a recent awards show. She stated that, “USC Annenberg’s Inclusiveness Initiative released findings that 67 percent of the top critics reviewing the 100 highest grossing movies in 2017 were white males. Less than a quarter were white women and less than 10 percent were unrepresented men. Only 2.5 percent of those top critics were women of color. Now you’re probably thinking right now that … doesn’t represent the country I live in. And that’s true. This is a huge disconnect from the U.S. population breakdown of 30 percent white men, 30 percent white women, 20 percent men of color, and 20 percent women of color. So, why does that matter? … If you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color, there is an insanely low chance a woman of color will be able to see your movie and review your movie … We need to be conscious of our bias and do our part to make sure that everyone is in the room.”

That’s an example of the main fallacy that you expose in your book, correct?

Thomas Sowell: It’s one of the many fallacies. My God! We could play the same game with basketball and get even greater skewed representation. Blacks are the vast majority of basketball players in the NBA. That quote is downright silly.

What’s become so frustrating to me over the years is people who assume that if people or events are not evenly represented, then that’s some deviation from the norm. But you can read through reams of what scholars have written and find that nowhere is this norm to be found. You can read people like Gradell and others who have studied internationally various cultural events, and they say again and again that nowhere do they find a distribution of people who is representative of the population of the larger society.

So [people like Larson] are taking something that no one can find and making it a norm, the deviations from which should cause the government to intervene to correct this supposedly rare thing.

Hogberg: What is the “Invincible Fallacy”?

Sowell: It’s what been illustrated by the example you mentioned. It’s the belief that people would be, in the normal course of events, proportionally represented in various endeavors in the way they are represented in the general population. And if that doesn’t happen it must be some kind of negative factor like either genetics or discrimination that is causing the deviation.

What’s frustrating is that I can come up with 100 examples to the contrary, but the people who believe in the fallacy do not have to produce even one example—not one speck of evidence from anywhere in the world over thousands of years of human history that what they are asserting is the norm has ever, in fact, happened.

For example, there is a book called “Why Nations Fail” that asks, why are there such economic disparities among nations? It compared the U.S. to Egypt and asked, why has Egypt failed? The authors wrote as though what happens in the U.S. is the norm. When, if anything, what happens in Egypt is closer to a norm. In any case, they are assuming that there is this natural tendency among nations that has somehow been thwarted in Egypt and therefore we must do something about that.

Hogberg: If you were to make a list of the causes of disparities with the most important causes being at the top of the list and the least important toward the bottom, where would discrimination be?

Sowell: I wouldn’t even attempt to rank them since there are so many causes. Just one that I mention in the first chapter of the book is being the first-born child in a family. First-born children tend to have higher IQs than their siblings. They are generally more successful in all sorts of endeavors, they tend to have higher incomes—you can run through the list. There are so many reasons for disparities that to single out one reason a priori is almost madness.

Hogberg: So what impact does discrimination have?

Sowell: It can have some negative effect. But that is the whole point. When you say A has a certain effect on B, it does not mean that every time you see B you can infer A. One example wholly away from economics or politics is that some children are years late, later than most children, in beginning to talk. Some of them have very severe mental retardation. Because there are many reasons that some children begin talking late does not mean that we can say that mental retardation has nothing to do with it. But there are other children who talked late and grew up to be intelligent and in some cases geniuses like Albert Einstein.

I didn’t write a book that says discrimination has no effect. There’d be no point in my writing a whole chapter on discrimination in the book if discrimination had no effect. I did write this book to say that disparities arise from all kinds of factors.

Hogberg: Is it possible for people to face severe discrimination and still prosper?

Sowell: Yes. The Jews are a classic example. So are the overseas Chinese. Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. You could run through a long list of them.

Hogberg: How important is geography in affecting outcomes?

Sowell: Huge. Just one of the reasons it is important is the enormous difference in the cost of land transport versus water transport. One example I note in the book is that in the days of the Roman Empire you could ship cargo the length of the Mediterranean Sea, more than 2,000 miles, at a cost less than the cost of carting that same cargo 75 miles inland. So, if you lived 75 miles inland, you had nothing like the prosperity that you had on the coast.

And while modern transportation has eased some of that cost, it has by no means eliminated it. So even now, if you are born up in the mountains and someone else is born in the river valley, then the odds are huge against you of ever being as prosperous as that person born near the river.

Hogberg: Before I move on from our discussion of the Invincible Fallacy, I want to briefly talk about genetic determinism. Today, the idea that difference between races is due solely to genetics is pretty much limited to the political fringes in the U.S. But 100 years ago it was huge among the intelligentsia, correct?

Sowell: Absolutely. For example, John Maynard Keynes set up the first eugenics society at Cambridge. And there were many others—Madison Grant, Woodrow Wilson, Harold Laski, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells. In fact, just recently I was looking back over R.H. Tawney’s 1931 book “Equality.” He’s this great egalitarian who says in passing that there is proof of the genetic inferiority of certain peoples.

Hogberg: Now, regarding the practice of discrimination, in your book you note that even if, say, employers are racist and they want to discriminate in their hiring practices, there are often powerful forces that may prevent them from doing so. Can you explain?

Sowell: It depends on the context. If, for example, it is an industry operating in a labor market in which there is a chronic surplus of qualified job applicants, then it costs the employer nothing to turn away qualified applicants from groups he doesn’t like and instead hire people from groups he does like that are still qualified.

But you seldom have that in a free market because wages adjust over time. You may have temporary surpluses or shortages, but those things tend to self-correct. It is when you have something like the minimum wage law, where you raise the wage rate above where it would be in a free market. Therefore, you increase the amount of workers available to the industry but you reduce the quantity of workers that employers demand because labor is now more expensive. And so you create a chronic surplus of labor.

I go into detail about the minimum wage in the book. And what is fascinating to me is to look back to 1948, when, for all practical purposes, the minimum wage law didn’t apply because inflation had made all wages above what was specified in the law. At that time not only was unemployment as a whole a fraction of what it is today, there was no difference between the unemployment rate of black teenagers and white teenagers. Today that seems almost impossible to believe.

It’s only later on, when politicians started increasing the minimum wage to keep up with inflation and so on, that’s when the total unemployment of teenagers in general became some multiple of what it was in 1948. And that’s when a gap opened up between the unemployment rate of black teenagers and white teenagers.

So, the increase in unemployment among black teenagers was not due to racism, which was at least as great in 1948 as it is today. Rather, the cost of discrimination to the discriminator had changed. You lowered the cost of discrimination. As you would expect, you lower the cost and more is demanded.

Hogberg: There were even costs to discrimination in South Africa, correct?

Sowell: Even in South Africa. That was the classic case. And I use that example in the book instead of getting bogged down in these questions about how much racism exists and so forth. I deliberately picked the country where there is no question at all about the racism of the people in control of the country. Which is to say that the whites had openly proclaimed white supremacy. And yet in South Africa, there were occupations where the black workers outnumbered the white workers even though it was illegal to hire any black workers in that occupation. And this was not due to the white employers having different social views. Rather, the cost to them of not hiring blacks was just too high.

If I may, just the other day I came across an article about how employers setting up new factories in the United States have been deliberately locating those factories away from concentrations of black populations because they find it costlier to hire blacks than to hire whites with the same qualifications. The reason is that the way civil rights laws are interpreted, it is so easy to start a discrimination lawsuit which can go on for years and cost millions of dollars regardless of the outcome.

It makes no sense from a business standpoint to hire a black worker if a white worker can be hired with the same qualifications who can’t start a lawsuit. So what this suggests is that when you give some people special rights, those special rights have special costs, not only to other people but to the people with special rights.

Hogberg: Related to discrimination, you have a section where you note that Harlem, which was predominately white in the early 20th century, was less hostile toward blacks when it came to providing housing that blacks could afford than San Francisco is today. Please explain.

Sowell: The landlords of Harlem weren’t less hostile toward blacks, they were more hostile. The realtors and building owners were assuring the white tenants that they were not going to let any blacks move into Harlem and, thus, there was no reason for their tenants to leave. Well, as it turned out that was a bad prediction. And my point is the reason it failed was the cost to the discriminators.

Now, if every single realtor in Harlem had stood firm on not letting blacks into Harlem, then Harlem might not be black today. But even racists, who prefer one race to another by definition, tend to prefer themselves most of all. So if a landlord has a building where he is having trouble finding tenants at the prices he wants to charge, but he can find blacks willing to pay those prices, then he is not going to pass up that money. Most people would not. And once that process starts, it becomes costlier and costlier for the holdouts among landlords and realtors to continue holding out.

Now, in San Francisco, they have restricted the supply of housing by restricting the building of housing. And there is no cost—people who already own houses or apartment buildings can easily vote to restrict the building of more housing. That causes the price of existing housing to go up. So, by 2005, the number of blacks living in San Francisco was less than half of what it had been in 1970 even though the total population of the city had increased. And that’s because more and more blacks were priced out of the housing market and forced economically to leave San Francisco.

So I doubt there was anywhere near the amount of hostility toward blacks in San Francisco in the late 20th century as there was toward blacks in Harlem one hundred years earlier. But where the cost of discrimination was low, people discriminated and where it was high they had to give it up.

Hogberg: Let’s talk about crime. You write, “Statistics cited in support of claims that the police target blacks usually go no farther than showing that the proportion of black people arrested greatly exceeds the roughly 13 percent of the American population who are black.” Why is that charge misleading?

Sowell: It’s misleading because what is relevant is not the percentage of people in a population but the percentage of people who are doing a given thing, in this case committing crimes. As long as there has been data collected, the homicide rate among blacks has been some multiple of the homicide rate among whites. Among blacks and whites, murderers tend to kill people among their own race. It’s the one area where segregation still reigns. And so, therefore, the relevant comparisons are the number of black homicide victims as compared to white victims and the number of blacks arrested for homicide as compared to whites.

The media have this thing where they do not mention the race of people who commit a crime but they do mention the race of people who are punished for committing a crime. Well, just from that one inconsistency you can generate a whole range of outrageous rhetoric about how the cops are targeting blacks.

There have been studies, for example, of people who are speeding on the highway, and they show that blacks speed more than whites. Therefore, it is not at all surprising if the cops pull over more black motorists than white motorists. So the whole argument that cops are discriminating against blacks falls apart when you put facts into the equation. Unfortunately, there are lots of people who have great incentive to avoid putting facts into the equation.

Hogberg: In other books you talk about what you call the “cracker culture” among blacks. What is that, and how much does that have to do with the higher crime rates in black areas in the U.S.?

Sowell: It’s many things. It’s a culture that is far more violent. It is far less oriented around education or entrepreneurship. It puts far less emphasis on human capital. Andrew Carnegie once went down to Birmingham and saw iron ore and coal located very close to each other. He wondered why someone hadn’t thought to build a steel mill there. The transportation costs of bringing the coal and iron ore together would be relatively cheap.

But, of course, the people in Alabama were not the same as Andrew Carnegie. And even years later when they did develop a steel industry in the South, the more complicated things that had to been done with steel were still being done in Pittsburgh and Gary, Indiana and other places in the North because they did not have the same skills in the South.

Now, the white population in the American South has had a higher violent crime rate than the white population of the rest of the country. Nor is this unusual. The murder rates in Eastern Europe have for centuries been some multiple of the murder rates in Western Europe. Like so many things that should theoretically be equal, they’re not, and they never have been.

Now, of course, over 90 percent of blacks in the U.S. came out of the South at some point in history. And so it’s not surprising that they bring many of the same cultural attitudes of Southern Whites to the North, East and wherever else they settle.

There is a whole history behind these things. But whatever the history, these groups were culturally different whether they were black or white or whatever.

Hogberg: You have a section on merit versus productivity, and you discuss the difficulties in judging merit in the sense of moral worth. Can you talk about that?

Sowell: Merit is the extent to which outcomes are due to the virtues of the particular individual compared to those circumstances the individual was born into or encountered in the larger world. I find it hard to believe that anyone specifically thinks that he can separate those things out in order to tell who is meritorious. Perhaps a mass murderer would have turned out to be a humanitarian under some other conditions, but we don’t know what those other conditions would be, and we certainly don’t know how to change him from a mass murderer into a humanitarian. And so we have to deal with things as they are.

What we can judge is productivity. We do know that someone will, say, produce a certain amount of a product per hour, while someone else will produce a lot more and someone else will produce a lot less. One of the problems of the political left is that they come up with things that they want to do, but pay very little attention to the key question of can you actually do those things? For example, wealth redistribution.

Those on the political left have no question in their minds that they can determine which rich people are unworthy and thus it is justifiable to confiscate wealth from them, and which poor people are worthy and should be given that wealth. One of the key problems for such schemes is that the source of wealth is human capital—the skills and knowledge about how to generate wealth.

Human capital is inside people’s heads and it can’t be confiscated. You can confiscate money and wealth and all the tangible things that you want to, but those things wear out over time. And unless you have someone there who can generate some more, you are worse off than before.

There are countries that have gone through that process and I mention some of them in the book. Some group in a country is prospering wonderfully and then a political leader says, well they have too much, we’ll take it from them. In some cases, they expel that group and in other cases, those people flee to a different country because they are tired of people taking their wealth.

Hogberg: Let me pose a related question. In Washington, D.C., there is the Trump International Hotel, owned by Donald Trump. People who stay there are certainly lining Donald Trump’s pockets. Now, Trump is certainly not a paragon of virtue. He has not been faithful to his wives for example, and he has at one time or another associated himself with vile people like Roy Cohn. What would you say to people who say it is immoral to book a room at Trump International Hotel?

Sowell: Is it immoral to buy a Volkswagen because Hitler was one of those promoting the Volkswagen? I mean, the Trump Hotel notion is silly beyond words. Perhaps there should be a moral surcharge based on the background of Hilton or some other hotel founder before we book a room at any of them? Again, that is asking people to do something we are not equipped to do.

Hogberg: Toward the end of the book you talk about what we can learn by examining the causes of disparities among different groups, and you write, “We can learn how dangerous it is, to a whole society, to incessantly depict outcome differences as evidence or proof of malevolent actions that need to be counter-attacked or avenged.” Why is that dangerous?

Sowell: I think we’ve seen a good illustration of why it is dangerous based on what has happened in the U.S. and Britain since the 1960s. Back then, one of the big preoccupations was with countering the fact that some people had more than other people. What the political left sets out to do is one thing; what they’ve actually done is quite another.

The left has polarized whole societies. They have set the sexes against each other, the races against each other, the classes against each other. They have delegitimized moral principles, they have delegitimized law and order, and the consequences can be seen almost daily. For example, the homicide rate among black males fell by 18 percent in the 1940s and by 22 percent in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it rose by dozens of percentage points—I don’t recall the exact number. [The homicide rate among black males per 100,000 population rose about 83 percent from 1960 to 1970—Ed.]

Steven Pinker’s book on violence internationally shows that this trend in homicide rates is something that happened across the Western world at the same time. There were declines in homicide rates until 1960, and then in the 1960s homicide rates did a U-turn. They shot up to levels that hadn’t been seen since the 19th century. It was quite a coincidence. Indeed, there were many such “coincidences” of trends that were getting better and then suddenly turned around and started getting worse in the 1960s.

Now the academics who study the history of that era aren’t likely to see it since they are often too busy celebrating the 1960s. Thus, the bad ideas and their consequence are not the sorts of things academics are going to put into their books.

Hogberg: What changed in the 1960s that caused all of that?

Sowell: It is what I call the “Social Justice” vision. That is, if there are disparities, it proves that somebody was wronged by somebody else. It’s one of those things that you don’t need one speck of evidence for. It sounds so good that many people will easily buy into it.

And many people around the world have paid with their lives for that vision. Especially in communist countries where communists came to power to supposedly correct such disparities. And once the communists are in power they create problems that make the problems that came before seem like nothing.

But that’s true of the left in general. They judge their actions by the wonderful things they are trying to do and are often oblivious to the actual harm they visibly doing to society.

Hogberg: Related to that, did you follow the controversy surrounding the actor Jussie Smollett? And what impact do hate-crime hoaxes have on fomenting racial hatred?

Sowell: I’ve tried not to, but it is hard to escape. The impact certainly isn’t good. What’s amazing is how impervious some people are to evidence that the charges are hoaxes. I think back to the Duke-Lacrosse case, where people were just hell-bent on believing that this terrible crime had been committed. And counter evidence didn’t stop the prosecution or the public. Some people, activists especially, are primed to believe certain things and when they see an opportunity they run with it, facts be damned.

Hogberg: We have an epidemic of hate crime hoaxes in the nation, going back at least ten years. Do you think that has a lot to do with the social justice vision?

Sowell: Yes. Especially given that these claims are so readily believed and rewarded. You can turn in the grievances for benefits just like they were airline miles.

Hogberg: And what makes it even worse is that Smollett got off with a slap on the wrist, apparently because he is connected to someone close to former President Obama.

Sowell: Yes. And that’s one of the deadly costs of all this stuff. You eventually erode the faith people have in the law. And once people no longer have faith in the law, you cannot hire enough police officers to maintain law. When the lawbreakers are a small group, the cops can keep that under control. But once the idea that the law is just a racket becomes pervasive then society is in a very dangerous situation.

Hogberg: You write that our society has a taboo “against discussing anything that might be considered negative in the individual behavior or social culture of lagging groups” and that is “counterproductive.” Why is that taboo counter-productive?

Sowell: It is counterproductive because human beings of every conceivable background are so imperfect that to exempt anybody from criticism is not a benefit but a curse. Think of the proverbial mother who dotes on her child and makes excuses for everything he does wrong. That child is going to have some hard time in our society. The reason is that not everybody is going to be making up excuses for him. And he could even end up behind bars for a long time because he didn’t realize that people other than his mother wouldn’t make excuses for him.

Hogberg: Finally, you’ve now released a revised edition of “Discrimination and Disparities,” a book that challenges this widely held notion that most if not all disparities are due to discrimination such as racism and sexism. And yet, outside of conservative media, this book doesn’t seem to be getting any attention. Why is that?

Sowell: I think back to a time when my books were reviewed not only by The New York Times but also the New York Review of Books. These days that doesn’t happen. I can’t say definitively, but I think people find that their best strategy is to pretend my books don’t exist if they can’t answer the arguments in them. And it’s not just with my writing but also other writers who challenge the prevailing vision. Their books are not going to get reviewed because the reviewers who believe in the prevailing vision don’t have a very effective answer to that challenge.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/an-interview-with-thomas-sowell-on-discrimination-race-and-social-justice/,2019-06-13
African Americans Don’t Need Reparations. We Need Responsibility,"In 2007, much like today, liberals were demonizing the president and looking to shore up their base for the next major election. An issue dragged out of the political closet was the notion of paying reparations to blacks now for slavery dating back to before America’s founding. Here they go again.

The vehicle then, as today, is a bill to set up a commission for studying the idea of a national apology for slavery and post-Civil War segregation as well as possible taxpayer reparations payments to black Americans. Back then, the bill was sponsored by Michigan Rep. John Conyers.

This year, because Conyers resigned due to allegations of sexual misconduct, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee is carrying the torch for reparations with the apparent blessing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Several liberal presidential contenders also recently weighed in favoring reparations.

It’s significant that the congressional hearing for Jackson Lee’s House Resolution 40 on this issue was held on June 19. Known as “Juneteenth,” it is the anniversary of when blacks in Texas first learned about the end of the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and their freedom. It is now celebrated nationwide to commemorate the end of black enslavement in America. It is also a day when black Americans are supposed to celebrate opportunity and self-determination—values prized by those newly freed slaves in Texas.

It is ironic that blacks are still calling for reparations in 2019, and using Juneteenth to do it. We have had many opportunities to put ourselves on equal footing with other Americans and pursue the American Dream. But too many of us have failed to do so.

We failed after the Civil War, during the civil rights era, and with President Lyndon B. Johnson’s implementation of the Great Society and its major welfare initiatives. Those were supposed to be revitalizing times for blacks. Yet, in the last case, welfare only increased dependence and destroyed families. What happened?

Over the years, black leaders failed to bring their communities to prosperity by promoting and teaching sound principles for economic growth. They also failed to help people use the resources that are available to every American regardless of their ethnic background.

It is said that one reason LBJ built the modern welfare state was to help secure black votes for his party. Yet Democrats’ ill-conceived policies actually caused more poverty in the black community. It caused more blacks to look for a handout rather than seek a hand up through self-determination. It essentially made the black community increasingly dependent on the government.

Reparations are treated as the cure for inequality. But they are not. Successful blacks such as actor Danny Glover and author Ta-Nehisi Coates call for reparations during a period in our history when illegal aliens are being handed benefits intended for disadvantaged American citizens. They are draining taxpayer resources and our economy at an alarming rate.

Why should blacks want to seek reparations in the 21th century when slavery was ended by the Civil War more than 150 years ago? Why are Congress and others suddenly getting in on the act? It’s merely politics.

Reparations should not be a topic of discussion in today’s America. Progress and success should be our focus as we strive to achieve the American Dream. We should focus on keeping America great, not looking for another huge socialist payout.

Congress should instead be reminding black Americans that opportunities already exist for them as they have existed for generations. It’s up to individuals to take advantage of these opportunities and strive to succeed.

Let’s flip the script from reparations to personal responsibility. The latter will bring about lasting results that a reparations check can never do.

Is Buttigieg Telling The Truth About Why He Fired A Black Police Chief?,"Democratic presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been under fire since a white police officer shot and killed an African-American man a week ago. But Buttigieg’s estrangement from the local black community dates back to 2012 when the newly elected mayor fired the city’s first African-American police chief.

On Sunday the nation got its first glimpse of the racial divide threatening to destroy Buttigieg’s presidential ambitions when CNN ran clips of the townhall the mayor held in South Bend. Unlike the friendly gatherings of Democratic primary voters that have occupied Buttigieg’s time over the last month, the black community in this mid-sized college town showed only anger at him.

Sunday’s outrage focused on the shooting death of Eric Logan by South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O’Neill. In a press conference held after the shooting, state Prosecutor Ken Cotter stated that O’Neill confronted Logan in response to a 9-1-1 report about car break-ins. O’Neill told his superiors that he shot Logan after the suspect approached him with a knife drawn and ignored multiple orders to drop the weapon. Logan died after officers rushed him to a nearby hospital in their squad car.

Since then, racial tensions in South Bend have escalated. Buttigieg’s attempt to calm the community during Sunday’s townhall-styled listening session backfired, with the young mayor only further enraging the crowd. The black community’s disdain for Buttigieg pre-dates Logan’s shooting death, however, to Buttigieg’s firing of the city’s first black police chief, Darryl Boykins.

Buttigieg Fired Boykins After Racist Tapes Surfaced

Boykins, who had worked his way up to police chief after starting with the department in 1984 as a patrolman, served in that position from 2007 until March 2012, when Buttigieg replaced him with a white police chief. The surrounding circumstances have long roiled the black community and raised still-unaddressed concerns in the northern Indiana town of a department-wide problem of racism. Known locally as the “police tapes” scandal, Boykins’ firing followed the discovery that department had recorded the telephone calls of several South Bend police officers.

According to the local U.S. attorney’s office, the South Bend Police Department “had a practice over many years of recording certain police phone lines and radio communications, but not all phone lines.” In a letter provided to Boykins’ attorney, the U.S. attorney’s office explained that their investigation into the department’s practice revealed that “the Police Chief would inform the Director of Communications on which lines should be recorded and historically all 911 calls and all police radio traffic were recorded.”

Additionally, “lines usually recorded were police front desk lines, the Chief’s office lines, a line for internal affairs, the main detective bureau line, and most of the division chiefs’ lines.” In approximately 2010, “during a change in leadership at the detective bureau, the Chief of the Detective Bureau’s line was mistakenly not recorded and the line assigned to one of the detectives in the bureau was mistakenly recorded instead,” the letter read. “Once this was learned, the recording on that line continued.”

After police communications director Karen DePaepe heard on the tapes what she described in court filings as “discriminatory racial comments of high ranking officers” in the department, and “something I believe to be possibly illegal,” she told police chief Boykins about the conversations and handed him numerous cassette tapes that had captured the telephone calls.

Others in the police department got wind of the recordings, leading one or more of the officers taped on the line to complain to the local U.S. attorney’s office in January 2012. The local U.S. attorney’s office then “asked the FBI to commence an investigation because the interception of telephone conversation could violate the Wiretap Act,” the letter to Boykins’ attorney explained.

Buttigieg, According to Lawsuit: Resign or Be Fired

Then, at the end of March, according to a race discrimination lawsuit Boykins later filed, Buttigieg’s chief of staff (or the local equivalent), Michael “Schmuhl met with Boykin on Buttigieg’s instruction, and threatened Boykins with both a federal criminal prosecution and employment termination if Boykins did not ‘voluntarily’ resign his post as Chief of Police.”

Boykins further alleged that during this meeting, Schmuhl led him “to believe that, through prior meetings between the Mayor and the United States Attorney, Buttigieg had struck a deal with the U.S. Attorney, whereby the U.S. Attorney would agree not to prosecute Boykins for violations of the federal wiretap act if Boykins would agree to the demotion.”

Boykins resigned, but shortly after attempted to rescind his resignation. Yet Buttigieg refused to allow Boykins to rescind his resignation, instead returning him to the department in a demoted position.

Many in the black community condemned the newly elected mayor for firing the police chief and demanded Buttigieg release the tapes. Buttigieg refused, prompting the city council to file suit to access the recordings. That case is still pending, and the public still does not know the content of the recordings—just the claims that they contain racist conversations.

Buttigieg Blames U.S. Attorney’s Office

As criticism mounted over Buttigieg’s firing of the city’s first black police chief, Buttigieg began to publicly point his finger at the U.S. attorney’s office. In his political memoir “Shortest Way Home,” the mayor detailed his version of the events:

A few weeks into the job of mayor, I learned that my newly reappointed police chief was being investigated by the FBI. Eventually a message came through, thinly veiled but quite clear, from federal prosecutors: the people responsible for the covert recordings needed to go, or charges might be filed. Why did they send me that signal, instead of just acting on their own? Was the intent to do me a favor, giving me a shot at resolving this quietly and helping my young administration without getting bogged down in the scandal of indictments just a few weeks after we got started? Maybe. Or perhaps they just understood the politics of all this before I did. Why should a U.S. attorney shoulder the responsibility of taking down a bellowed African-American police chief, if he can get the mayor to do it for him by removing him from his position? . . . I had lost confidence in the leadership of a chief who had not come to me the moment he realized he was the target of an FBI investigation.

Buttigieg repeated his claim as recently as April of this year, when The New York Times reported that the mayor-turned-presidential-candidate said, “It was made very clear to me by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney that either we would take employment action or there would be indictments.”

Boykins Attorney Claims Buttigieg Is Lying

But while the mayor publicly placed blame at the U.S. attorney’s office, Boykins’ attorney, Tom Dixon, claims that federal prosecutors were privately assuring him that no such conversation had occurred. Dixon told The Federalist that after the mayor first claimed he had demoted the police chief at the request of the U.S. attorney’s office, in exchange for the federal prosecutors dropping the investigation, one assistant U.S. attorney (AUSA) reached out to him “assuring me their office would never make a charging decision based on a quid pro quo employment decision by a municipality.”

Then, after the mayor floated the second justification—that he demoted Boykins because the police chief hadn’t informed Buttigieg that the chief was under investigation—Dixon said he then had a second meeting with multiple AUSAs. Dixon claims that, at that meeting, the AUSAs unequivocally stated that their office did not suggest, in any way, that the mayor should remove Boykins or the police chief might be charged with federal wiretap crimes.

“Nor was Boykins a target or subject of a federal investigation, as Buttigieg claimed,” Dixon told The Federalist. Rather, Dixon said that “In the second meeting, the ASUAs confirmed that Boykins was neither a subject nor a target of the investigation.”

It was then, according to Dixon, that the AUSAs gave him “a letter summarizing the results of the FBI’s investigation into the South Bend Police Department’s long-standing policy of taping telephone calls.” The federal prosecutors concluded that police department’s informal policy did not violate federal wiretapping laws, Dixon stated.

U.S. Attorneys Claim Dixon’s Story Wouldn’t Happen

Dixon had previously told The New York Times of his conversation with “an assistant prosecutor in the United States attorney’s office, a lawyer he knew from church, about the mayor’s assertion.” “Tom, that explanation is so contrary to the protocols of U.S. attorneys’ offices,” the Times reported Dixon recalling, “We never would condition a determination on prosecuting or not prosecuting based on an employment decision. It would never happen.”

The Federalist spoke with the three AUSAs Dixon indicated were involved with, or familiar with, this matter and they all refused to comment. They would neither confirm nor deny Buttigieg’s version of events or Dixon’s claims of his conversations with the AUSAs. The Public Affairs Office of the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Northern District of Indiana likewise refused comment.

Buttigieg’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

This backstory explains the visceral response Buttigieg received when he reached out to the local black community on Sunday. The recent police shooting has elevated the significance of Buttigieg’s firing of Boykins and his explanation for that decision. But so long as the U.S. attorney’s office remains silent, the public faces a he-said, he-said dispute, and has no way of knowing whether Buttigieg or the former police chief’s attorney is speaking the truth.

With racial-tensions rising in this mid-sized community, the U.S. attorney’s office—which is now under new leadership—needs to answer the question: does Buttigieg have an integrity issue, or does the U.S. attorney’s office?

It Doesn't Matter If Disney Casts A Black Actress As 'The Little Mermaid',"Casting decisions for Disney’s upcoming “The Little Mermaid” remake have been trickling in over the last few days, and fans have been waiting on tenterhooks to discover who will be the live-action Ariel. When Disney finally announced last Wednesday that the honor will go to the relatively unknown Halle Bailey, fans on both sides of the political aisle had pretty much the same reaction: she’s black!

Progressive news outlets immediately began to rhapsodize about the wonderfulness of a “black Ariel.” Vox called it “a giant deal” and “an exciting step forward.” HuffPost said the fact that Ariel will be black is “awesome,” and BET called the casting announcement “incredible news.”

There was also a rush to condemn as racist anyone who expressed disappointment or any criticism over Disney’s choice. One website lumped all those who disapproved together under the moniker “white Twitter,” while a variety of other sites labeled all dissenting voices “racist.”

It’s true that some of the reactions to Disney casting Bailey are outright racist. But many other fans are calling foul, assuming that Disney cast Bailey not for her talent—she’s a relatively unknown actress—but for the color of her skin. One Reddit user, for example, called the casting choice “proof of Hollywood pandering.” Another called it a “publicity stunt” and pointed out that using race for publicity is “kinda offensive.”

Focus on Ariel’s Talent, Not Her Looks

Both sides have it wrong. See, Disney didn’t cast “a black actress” as Ariel. They cast an actress. Sure, when we first saw the picture of the person who’d be playing our favorite redhead, we might have done a double-take. She doesn’t look like the cartoon character voiced by Jodi Benson in 1989.

But, after the initial raised eyebrow, shouldn’t our first question have been: Can she act? And our next one should have been: Can she sing? I mean, you really couldn’t induce me to care less about the color of her skin, but I care very deeply about whether she’ll do my second favorite Disney princess proud.

When Disney initially made the announcement that Bailey would be the new Ariel, they didn’t say, “Ariel will be black!” They said, “It was abundantly clear that Halle possesses that rare combination of spirit, heart, youth, innocence, and substance—plus a glorious singing voice—all intrinsic qualities necessary to play this iconic role.”

Only time will tell if this is true, but if it is, I’ll buy my ticket now! Sure, Disney may have had some leftist-appeasing motive in casting a black actress instead of a white one, but they didn’t flaunt it in their announcement. It was everyone else—leftist and conservative alike—who proclaimed her blackness to be her defining feature.

The story of “The Little Mermaid” is not about skin color. In fact, Ariel is a mermaid—her skin could be blue, or silver, or purple with rainbow sparkles. And her worth—like the worth of every other Disney princess—is judged on what’s on the inside, not on the outside.

Her bravery, determination, and independence know no color. There’s no reason she can’t be black. And there’s no reason that what she looks like on the outside should matter to us at all.

Inner Beauty on the Backburner

Feminists (and Disney itself) have been on a mission for the last couple decades to shift our understanding of what it means to be a princess. In the early days of Disney—and even during Disney’s renaissance, of which “The Little Mermaid” was a part—Disney princess narratives emphasized inner beauty. The princesses had goals—adventure, freedom, fulfillment—and it was through their inner courage and strength that they achieved them.

But lately, the princesses have emphasized physicality, like martial prowess, athleticism, and physical strength, and not had much to say about inner conviction or heart. Is it any wonder that, upon learning that Bailey will be the next Ariel, that the immediate focus is on what she looks like, not whether she can act or sing?

The fact that leftists have shifted the narrative such that immutable qualities like race and sex take precedence over earned qualities, like courage and hard work, shouldn’t mean that we fall into the same trap. Who cares what Ariel looks like, as long as she still strives for the life she knows she deserves? Who cares what color her skin is, as long as she still sings “Part of that World” with a voice full of yearning and sorrow? Who cares what sort of hair she has, as long as she still stands up for what she believes in and lives her life on her own terms?

Here’s a thought: let’s judge Bailey not on “the color of [her] skin but by the content of [her] character.” Or at least, her acting and singing skills. Progressives won’t do that, but we can and should. “The Little Mermaid” is the story of a girl whose voice—her inner self—meant everything. Let’s judge Bailey accordingly.

Facility Volunteer: 'Prison-Like' And 'Concentration Camp' Claims Are False,"Several Democratic 2020 White House hopefuls took turns standing outside of the Homestead migrant shelter in southern Florida last month to criticize the current administration’s immigration practices. The 2020 contenders ranged from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-T.X.), who blasted Homestead’s “prison-like” conditions.

“There weren’t children playing. There weren’t children laughing the way children usually do when they’re moving from one place to another,” Warren said to reporters following her visit to the facility. “These were children who were being marched like little soldiers – like little prisoners – from one place to another. This is not what we should be doing as a country.”

Those accusations dumbfounded volunteers and employees who work at the migrant facility, who described just the opposite. Local pastor Russell Black has been volunteering at the shelter about once a week since its opening in 2015, he said. Black told The Federalist he has been impressed by the conditions and care at the facility and said the children were well-cared for by trained staff and management while being given ample recreation.

“From day one, I was amazed at the care and expense given to the children,” Black said.

One employee at the facility, Melissa, who declined to provide a last name out of concerns of harassment, noted that the children are provided three full meals a day and two snacks. In addition, each child who enters the facility is given a full medical exam to assess his or her mental and physical needs. If a child’s physical needs were too extreme for the facility to handle, he or she was transported to a nearby hospital, all at U.S. taxpayers’ expense.

The Homestead shelter is one of the largest and most controversial migrant detention facilities in the country. Contracted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it is the only facility for illegally entering non-citizen children run by a for-profit company and not directly overseen by the state.

Melissa says there are approximately 1,300 minors currently housed at the facility, with an average waiting period there of 32 days, with 24/7 medical care available to them. Black said it was rare to see the same child at one of his Saturday services after a month or two, noting that while based on individual circumstances, workers at the facility usually had the children out within 30 days.

According to Melissa and Black, children at the facility are being taught in four academic subjects per day and then are given hours of recreational time either outside or indoors in the evenings, depending on the children’s preference. Children also had what Black described as “self-led” talent shows on a fairly regular basis and participated in arts and crafts activities.

In the facility, a youth-care worker is assigned to 6-8 children, according to Black, who is with the kids at all times and is responsible for knowing where each child is and for his or her safety at all times. This is a higher adult-to-child ratio than nearly all states require of licensed daycare facilities for children of school age and of all public school classrooms.

Black, emphasizing that he could only speak to his experience at Homestead and not to other detention facilities, said nothing about Homestead resembled a cage or a “concentration camp,” noting that each child living in the facility is also given his or her own bed and mattress in addition to a hot shower every day.

“I’m very proud of the efforts made to make the time that the children spend in the shelter is as pleasant and brief as possible,” said Black.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/16/immigration-facility-volunteer-prison-like-concentration-camp-claims-flat-false/,2019-07-16
Far Left Prepares To Throw Barack Obama Into The Dustbin Of History,"The mood of left-wing Democrats might be neatly summarized by the media coverage of last weekend’s Netroots Nation conference. The progressive left seems poised to consign former President Barack Obama to the dustbin of history. Moreover, supposedly woke agitators do not seem to care how their exercise might affect black voters who comprise a crucial part of their 2020 electoral strategy.

According to Vox, “Progressive activists know their enemy in the 2020 Democratic primary: Joe Biden.” As Vox notes, “Some activists at Netroots conceded they would support Biden in a general election if they had no other choice.”

Dean Obeidallah of CNN and The Daily Beast finds this concession a sign of a pragmatism that should make President Donald Trump quake with fear, as opposed to the rock-bottom minimum expectation for a group that claims to believe the president is an existential threat to the republic. Not unlike the Hollywood types who take private jets to climate change conferences, the gap between rhetoric and action is considerable.

After a Mere Four Years, Obama Nostalgia Is Gone

The left’s antipathy is not limited to Biden. At the Washington Post, David Weigel profiles “The Democrats who don’t miss Obama (or Biden).” In his day, Weigel covered any number of Tea Party conferences (often unfairly); if he noticed that Netroots is the left-wing, hall-of-funhouse-mirrors version of those events, he failed to include it in his news “analysis.”

Rather, Weigel provided a deadpan account of how “the largest annual gathering of liberal activists, which pulls everyone from electoral data gurus to disability rights activists into one loud space, had no nostalgia at all for a two-term president who, for a while, seemed to redefine the Democratic Party.”

In this telling, Obama — and by extension, Biden — “left activists demoralized, reducing Democratic Party power to its lowest levels in 90 years.” That Obama redefined his party as further to the left and that it is in tatters because he pandered to the activist left too much is a possibility simply too terrible for them to contemplate.

Yet Weigel, in some obligatory throat-clearing, includes the following concession to political reality: “Although most Democratic voters adore Obama, and although he’s far more popular than other former presidents, the thought of winding the clock back to before the 2016 election does not animate liberals.” Weigel’s use of “liberal” rather than “progressive” or “left-wing” is fairly misleading, given how Democrats tend to identify themselves:

Republicans identify most with conservatism, Democrats identify most with Obama; Democrats split in ideological identificationhttps://t.co/7NKhd2QsTf pic.twitter.com/kLQP0vVZgp — Matt Grossmann (@MattGrossmann) March 6, 2019

Fond memories of Obama may not animate the Netroots, but they do animate rank-and-file Democrats, including those who identify as liberal. Obama nostalgia is at the heart of Biden’s campaign, which is a constant source of angst for the progressive left.

Black Voters Matter

Moreover, the former vice president’s current lead is based in significant part on his commanding lead among black Democrats, which is the salt rubbed in the far left’s wounds. As Vox reports, the clear favorite at the Netroots conference was Sen. Elizabeth Warren, followed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris.

As with Weigel’s report, there is a key point made only in passing: “Warren’s biggest challenge is still with black voters, whom she is struggling with compared to Sanders, Harris, and Biden. A recent Morning Consult poll showed Warren netting just 7 percent of black voters who said she was their first choice, compared to 21 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Harris (and Biden in the lead with 38 percent).”

The problem does not stop there, either. Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was the top fundraiser for the second quarter of 2019, sucking up $24.8 million — three times as much as he raised in the first quarter. In the same Morning Consult poll, he was the first choice of 2 percent of black voters.

For a crowd that thrives on accusing America of perpetuating white supremacy, progressives seem to have little fondness for America’s first black president. In a campaign where progressives preach the need to energize voters of color, they seem indifferent to the preferences of black voters. The left prefers a well-known candidate such as Warren (with an almost equally well-known likability problem), who polls in single digits with this crucial constituency, all the while telling themselves they can make people of color like her. If you wrote this as fiction, editors would reject it as unrealistic.

Progressives Must Find a Balance

Progressives have another argument open to them. Perhaps the smartest observation at Netroots came from Minnesota Attorney General and Democratic National Committee Deputy Chair Keith Ellison, who said, “Biden wasn’t put on the Obama ticket because he and Obama agreed. They put him on because they didn’t. He was a ticket balancer.” The left should embrace Obama instead of shunning him, while painting Biden as the odd man out.

This gambit requires some humility from progressives, inasmuch as it would require them to take some responsibility for the decline of the Democratic Party on Obama’s watch. But if the left simply chooses to abandon Obama and his legacy, there is no guarantee the alternatives will fully energize the black voters they need.

Also, tossing Biden overboard probably hurts Democrats’ chances with working-class, white voters, which will matter more than they think in the high-turnout presidential election most expect. Progressives can almost taste victory, but the manner in which they dismiss major blocs of the Democratic coalition remains as big an obstacle to their success as their extreme platform.

"Silverman Fired For Past Blackface, Northam Remains In Office","Sarah Silverman was just fired from an upcoming movie for appearing in blackface in a sketch on “The Sarah Silverman Show” from 2007. In the 12-year-old sketch, Silverman wears blackface to determine whether it is harder to be black or Jewish in America in 2007

It was heavily satirical, with the punch-line of Silverman receiving negative comments from passersby for her racially insensitive appearance. She has since repeatedly apologized for the episode.

Silverman has spent the past few years going through a radical image change. She began her career as a shocking comic, thriving on a clever brand of bad-taste humor, highlighted in her specials such as “Jesus Is Magic.” This approach seeped into her self-titled show, in which she played an exaggerated fictionalized version of herself: self-absorbed, childish, and completely lacking self awareness. The show’s humor arose from her poor decisions and antics, with the audience laughing at her rather than with her.

However, all of this changed in the mid-2010s, when Silverman replaced her shocking humor with political correctness. She has apologized for many of her past jokes that dealt with sensitive subjects such as rape, abortion, and racism. The former textbook example of political incorrectness has become an outspoken advocate for using ideology to check comedy.

Despite her apparent redemption and transition into “woke-ness,” Silverman’s remorse has not rendered her immune from the outrage machine. Yet six months earlier, another scandal had no such effect on the career of the man in the center.

Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook was uncovered in February, showing a photo of a man in Ku Klux Klan garb standing next to a man in blackface. While many high-profile Democrats called for Northam to resign, many others argued that a bad decision from so long ago should not have the power to ruin his career.

Northam’s scandal caused a dip in his polling numbers that is leveling out. The Constitution of Virginia prevents governors from serving consecutive terms, so he will be unable to run for reelection in 2021, but this scandal will likely have no major effect on his political career going forward.

This “cancel culture” so rampant in today’s society has become incredibly oppressive, but also randomly enforced. Blackface is a terrible and racist form of humor, but Silverman’s and Northam’s uses were thoroughly different in intent.

The photo of a man in blackface next to a man in KKK robes clearly has malicious, racist intent. The joke minimizes the violence and brutality of hate groups like the KKK and the toxic effects of their racism. Silverman’s joke had the opposite intent. She wore blackface to point out how terrible blackface and racism are.

Silverman’s satire is similar in nature to Robert Downey Jr.’s phenomenal and Oscar-nominated performance in “Tropic Thunder.” Both use provocative and shocking humor to make people think through the use of laughter.

Regardless of whether the sketch is actually offensive enough to warrant Silverman’s firing now is up to the individuals with authority in the situation. However, we must acknowledge that the incident occurred 12 years ago, and she has apologized for it endlessly.

If Northam can be forgiven for a hateful photo he chose to highlight on his med school yearbook page, then shouldn’t we apply the same benefit of the doubt to a comedian attempting to make a genuine point against racism, even through arguably misguided means?

"Buttigieg Exposes Dems’ ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ Approach To Black Voters","In recent polling, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg attracts roughly 1 percent of black voters. One explanation for this is low name recognition. Yet there is reason to think Buttigieg’s same-sex marriage may be problematic to one degree or another with this key Democratic demographic. Democrats and the establishment media would prefer not to discuss it.

It is too early to say definitively that Buttigieg has a problem with black voters. At this point in the campaign, when polling Democrats about Democrats, favorability ratings tend to be inversely related to “don’t know / no opinion” responses.

Low name identification becomes a larger problem when attempting to analyze sub-samples such as of black voters. In early August, 62 percent of black Democratic primary voters in Morning Consult’s tracking survey did not know who Buttigieg is. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions about his potential appeal to black voters.

On the other hand, blacks in early primary and caucus states are learning about Mayor Pete. Some of what they are learning may not be appealing on the issues, such as his admission of failure in diversifying South Bend’s police department. Black voters are also learning about his sexuality; some are not thrilled with it.

In South Carolina, the first primary state with a significant black population and one likely to be decisive in the voting, black churchgoers have mixed feelings about Buttigieg’s homosexuality. Joe Darby, a pastor in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and local NAACP leader, told the Associated Press: “It’s a heavy lift in the black church. Just as nobody who is racist likes to say, ‘I’m a racist,’ nobody who is homophobic in the black community likes to say, ‘I’m homophobic.’” Darby later added, “The most damning comment was at a clergy breakfast, and when his name was brought up another guy said, ‘Yeah, that’s the guy who kissed his husband on TV.’”

Black Americans’ attitudes about Buttigieg are not monolithic. The AP also interviewed congregants at a Baptist church in Greenville who dismissed Mayor Pete’s perceived sin. Others were simply willing to vote for him if he had the right politics and could beat President Trump. Even in these opinions, however, there is the sense that Buttigieg’s sexuality may be an obstacle among churchgoing black voters.

These interviews are anecdotes, but they are consistent with broader data. The most recent Pew Research Center polling indicates only 44 percent of black Protestants support same-sex marriage, the same level of support found among Republicans and leaners (the figure for Democrats and leaners is 75 percent).

Overall, blacks lag other racial demographics in supporting same-sex marriage. A bare 51 percent majority of blacks support same-sex marriage, as opposed to 58 percent of Latinos and 62 percent of whites. These numbers suggest Buttigieg may have difficulties attracting black support even if he becomes better known among voters generally.

While black attitudes on LGBTQ issues pose a particular problem for Mayor Pete, his candidacy exposes a more general issue for a Democratic Party whose elites are disproportionately white leftists. The elite response so far, including from establishment media, has been to bury the issue.

For example, three Democratic presidential candidates—Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker—campaigned at the Victory Missionary Baptist Church in Las Vegas. The church is led by the Rev. Robert E. Fowler, Sr., who believes being gay is “enough to send you to hell.” Fowler also has compared homosexuality to child molestation, which apparently caught Harris completely unaware:

Harris says she was not aware of the Nevada pastor’s homophobic comments before speaking at his church (Booker and Sanders have also spoken there) pic.twitter.com/CJbQt2C56m — Christopher Cadelago (@ccadelago) August 8, 2019

Eventually, all three candidates issued statements distancing themselves from the pastor. The story was covered by outlets that serve an LGBTQ audience or have significant LGBTQ readership, such as DC’s Metro Weekly, The Advocate, and the Mercury News. No more than a handful of center-left outlets touched it.

In contrast, everyone knows how the story would have been covered if the candidates had been Republican. In the first instance, Republicans get more scrutiny for campaigning in churches than Democrats ever have. In the second instance, the media would have swarmed Buttigieg for comment.

Furthermore, Mitt Romney’s faith, the Mormon religion’s position on LGBTQ rights, and the antipathy of some conservative preachers to Mormonism were media fodder for two consecutive campaign cycles. In 2008, the establishment media made the anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic pastor John Hagee’s endorsement of Sen. John McCain a story for months after McCain made clear he did not endorse Hagee.

Most recently, during an interview on an unrelated topic, CNN’s Don Lemon ambushed a pro-Trump pastor regarding his 2012 statement comparing same-sex marriage to child molestation. CNN was missing in action regarding the Fowler’s similar comment, let alone the three Democratic candidates who campaigned in his church.

Mayor Pete’s candidacy throws a spotlight on the relative social conservatism of black Democrats on LGBTQ issues, but the difference is not limited to that topic. Nonwhite Democrats are also relatively more conservative on Israel, the Me Too movement and other issues.

The party’s leftist elites seemingly have adopted a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach with its social conservatives. So far, it’s working. There is little social conservatism among the 2020 candidates; there is no sign that nonwhite Democrats are abandoning the party in any significant number.

But the fact that Democrats tolerate socially conservative nonwhites—so long as they keep their mouths shut and vote for leftists—will not go unnoticed by the right in an election cycle where the Democrats plan to campaign on their supposed moral superiority and enlightenment regarding social issues.

Why Kirsten Gillibrand Dropped Out,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, whose politics are, er, flexible, has dropped out of the presidential sweepstakes, and not a moment too soon. The highest she ever reached in the polls was 3 percent—and it was downhill from there. Her politics were so “flexible” she didn’t get traction even with women voters, who were her primary target. She was a giant hypocrite among hypocrites. And she played the race card shamelessly.

She was asked by a reporter what she would “do for Baltimore and other cities that need help.” It’s too bad her interlocutor didn’t list the other cities that “need help.” It’s a roster of places that have been governed, mostly for decades, by liberal Democrats. The moderator’s question was oh-so-trendy because President Trump had just tweeted out his message that Baltimore is a Hell-hole, and that its congressman—for the last 23 years!—Elijah Cummings (who happens to be black), is partly to blame.

During a tour of Baltimore last year, the city’s mayor, Catherine Pugh (no white supremacist she), described the situation there in language rather more graphic and startling than anything Trump has ever said: “What the h-ll? We should just take all this sh-t down. … Whoa, you can smell the rats. … Whew, J-sus. … Oh, my G-d, you can smell the dead animals.”

When a couple of years ago Trump described some African countries as Hell-holes (the transcript’s a bit fuzzy) he was gang-banged by the usual posturing hypocrites, not one of whom was known for vacationing in said Hell-holes, nor probably in Baltimore either. Oh, my God, you can smell the hypocrisy.

But Gillibrand wasn’t about to take on the situation in Baltimore. She pivoted to the Democrats’ post-Russia-collusion campaign hope: white supremacy. So in answer to the question, what would you “do for Baltimore and other cities that need help” she replied, “I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is.”

Come again? Is she hearing impaired? No, she’s just doing what comes naturally: playing the race card.

“When their son is walking down the street …”—whoa! Whose son, exactly? Their son? In her scenario, Gillibrand is talking to a bunch of white women (“those white women in the suburbs”): how can a plurality of white women have “a” son? One son between them? Between all of them? Or just some of them? Even the pointy-headed professors at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton-Stanford Center for the Study of Bizarre and Quite-Unbelievable Sexual Antics and Practices haven’t produced a male baby from a group of women, not of any color.

Gillibrand means, “When their sons are walking down the street ….” Is that too technical for a girl from upstate New York to master (snowflake alert: use of word “master” may channel unpleasant feelings of male dominance)? Probably not, and if she can’t manage a sentence as simple as that one, how would she ever have been able to manage the nuclear codes?

“When their son is walking down the street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him” from being shot, said Gillibrand.

How to play the race card! Gillibrand’s half right, but wholly wrong. It’s their boys’ white skin color that may protect them, but it has nothing to do with privilege. It has to do with the odds, odds that almost everyone knows: it’s more likely that a non-white boy in a hoodie is a “problem” than a white boy in a hoodie.

One person who knows that is Jesse Jackson. That’s why he said, famously: “There is nothing more painful to me … than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery, then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.”

Why did Jackson feel relieved, Sen. Gillibrand?

Jackson knew the numbers as does almost everyone else. According to a study by the Vera Institute of Justice, black people are 3.6 times more likely to be incarcerated than white people, down from 6 times in 1996. Does Gillibrand know that young black men commit homicide at nearly 10 times the rate of white and Hispanic young men combined? This means that, however unfair it may be to assume that a black male is criminally inclined, it is not entirely irrational.

As interesting, or perhaps more interesting, black adults in the United States consistently express more concern about crime than white adults. Does Sen. Gillibrand have any clue why? Could it be that most black crime is committed on black people, for whom crime prevention is therefore exceedingly important?

Black boys tend to be a problem, but it really isn’t entirely their fault. Most of them grow up in broken “families”: the black illegitimacy rate is 77 percent. That’s the real problem, in part a legacy of the sexual sixties.

Illegitimacy’s a problem Sen. Gillibrand and the surviving ultra-permissive contestants for the Democratic nomination don’t dare discuss. They’d rather play the race card and blame all societal ills on whites, and white supremacy, and white supremacists, and Donald Trump. And you. And me.

Oh, my G-d, you can smell the hypocrisy.

Next Marvel Movies To Feature Characters Dulled By Identity Politics,"After the massive success of its first wave of movies culminating with the epic “Avengers: Endgame,” Marvel has announced its second generation of movies for the many fans not ready to leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While some of the surviving Avengers will continue to appear together, the popular superhero Spider-Man will sadly be on his own due to Disney’s greed.

What drew the most attention with the new lineup of MCU movies, however, was its expansion of identity politics. “The Eternals” will feature the first openly gay character; the Thor movies will now feature a female protagonist, Lady Thor; and, to top off the intersectional pyramid, the spinoff character Valkyrie from “Thor: Ragnarok” will be a bisexual black woman. The final Avengers movie hinted at much of this development, when it opened with Captain America comforting a gay man discussing his dating struggles and concluded with a tableau of female superheroes leading the fight against Thanos.

Obviously, this announcement is calculated to trigger some buzz — good and bad — about the upcoming movies and partake in the current zeitgeist. Whatever the reaction may be, however, fans can predict with near certainty that the hubbub over these decisions will likely be more interesting than the movies themselves.

Just as it has killed comedies, political correctness now threatens to kill superhero movies — not exactly in box office sales, but in terms of quality entertainment. While there is a healthy push to feature every variation of race, sex, and sexuality in prominent roles, there is also a harmful push to remove every flaw and potential stereotype associated with such a person.

It is not enough to cast someone different for the main role (which, again, is a good thing); the character that person plays must be above reproach in all regards — in other words, they must be boring. A quick review of the recent blockbuster action movies (all owned by Disney) attests to this unpleasant truth.

Political Correctness Creates Boring Heroines

A female protagonist must now be far more powerful than the other characters, including the villain. She cannot show weakness; this would be sexist. Therefore, in movies such as “Captain Marvel,” “Wonder Woman,” the new “Star Wars” films, and even the new “Men in Black” sequel, the heroine vastly outshines anyone around her, to the point of hardly ever struggling. The Disney princess movies have also followed this trend to a lesser degree.

While this may signal female empowerment, it deflates the plot and characters. What exactly is the conflict for any of these women who clearly have nothing to challenge them? Inevitably, the conflict becomes themselves. These heroines need to overcome their insecurity and humility and just dominate. Once Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, and Rey finally learn to trust themselves and stop listening to others, they win the battle handily.

And they must do it alone. Relationships, particularly romantic ones, are superfluous for the female superhero. Captain Marvel — who may be the queen Valkyrie is looking for — has no love interests. The most she does with her similarly attractive and powerful male mentor (played by Jude Law) is fight him.

Rey is the same; she either fights men or asks them to hold her beer while she fights other men. Wonder Woman seems to have feelings for Chris Pine’s character, but for much of the movie, they are brothers in arms. The Disney princesses also share this attitude about men, where they either ditch the idea of a romantic partner (Prince Charming is the epitome of the patriarchy) or treat it like a forgettable afterthought. Love stories are apparently for the weak.

Audiences understandably feel little connection with these heroines. Fans, both men and women, are eager to cheer them on, but they find this difficult when the snowman shows more warmth, the failed storm trooper shows more courage, and Samuel L. Jackson shows more gentleness.

Even if supernatural power makes a woman the hero, she needs to have flaws to make her human. The same rule applies to men, which is why Superman will always disappoint audiences, while Batman mostly succeeds.

Political Correctness Ruins Diversity of Personalities

Action movies with nonwhite heroes often run into a different kind of problem, but for the same reason of keeping politically correct. Whereas being female removes all potential flaws, being nonwhite often removes any distinctive personality.

With the lone exception of Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson), expressing one’s racial identity seems to be considered racist. Thus, the black sidekicks of Ironman and Captain America, War Machine and Falcon, do little more than act as foils for the two white heroes who lead. The same goes for Valkyrie and Heimdall in the “Thor” movies and Maria Rambeau in “Captain America.”

Even when the main protagonist is black, this problem of whitewashing still appears. There is nothing particularly unique about Black Panther, who simply fights the villain because it’s the right thing to do. His race adds nothing to his character. Whatever efforts the creators made in reproducing and celebrating African traditions, he and the other Wakandans practically have more in common with the Vulcans and Klingons from “Star Trek” than any person in a modern diverse society. Wakanda is a societal version of the female superheroes: It has no flaws, is incredibly powerful, and does not need anyone else for anything.

By contrast, race does play a part in Black Panther’s nemesis, Killmonger. He experiences adversity by growing up on the streets of Oakland (a real place, not a sci-fi utopia) and being denied his patrimony, which fuels his desire to escape this situation and take control. He is relatable and admirable for making it as far as he did and not settling for victimhood. But he is nevertheless the villain who goes mad with power, plans world conquest, and falls to Black Panther. Order is restored, but an interesting character and a relevant argument about the black experience are lost.

Fans Are Ready for an Interesting Superhero

Fans have few reasons to hope Hollywood will approach its new movies any differently. A politically correct culture that preaches celebrating diversity while handling that same diversity with kid gloves leaves two options for filmmakers: (1) They can treat it superficially and include in peripheral roles minorities who act no differently than the white male characters in the foreground, which is what they have done with most of the movies thus far, or (2) they can place minorities at the center of their films and either make their characters virtually flawless or indistinguishable from a white male superhero, and compensate for subsequent blandness with abundant special effects and an attractive cast.

More than likely, Marvel will take the second option for its fresh new characters, who more resemble inoffensive political figures than people with real problems. Its gay character in “The Eternals” already sounds like a superpowered Pete Buttigieg. According to the Marvel Studios president, “He’s married, he’s got a family, and [his homosexuality] is just part of who he is.” Valkyrie will probably resemble a superpowered Michelle Obama, who will happen to have a high-powered wife instead of a high-powered husband.

Fans can only hope that once the novelty wears off, producers will explore a third way of having diversity in their movies and finally ignore the pressures of political correctness altogether. That would mean allowing women, LGBT people, and nonwhite people to be realistic human beings. This does not mean exploiting stereotypes like the “Rush Hour” movies (which almost certainly would not be made in today’s cultural climate), but crafting characters and narratives that make the minority protagonists natural and relatable, like “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.”

Not only would taking a more authentic approach to diversity make the movies more interesting and fun to watch, it would also go further in eliminating negative stereotypes and erasing boundaries between different groups. Empty movies that mean only to virtue signal leave people wondering if it’s possible to create a quality movie with minority leads. It is possible, and audiences are ready for it.

Here’s Where Canada’s Election Stands After Trudeau’s Blackface Scandal,"On October 21, Canadians will go to the polls in the 43rd Canadian federal election. Justin Trudeau has been prime minister since 2015 after sending Conservative Prime Minister Steven Harper into retirement and gaining 148 seats in parliament—the largest increase since Canada became a British dominion in 1867. Will the “golden boy” of former PM Pierre Trudeau still be in power come October 22? Well, things just got interesting.

Trudeau had seemingly made it through the SNC-Lavalin government corruption scandal , a trip to India that turned into a public relations nightmare , and a groping accusation dating back to 2000. However, a blackface bombshell broken by Time magazine has cast the Liberal PM’s re-election chances into some doubt.

Mussing Trudeau’s Image as a Social Justice Hero

The blackface scandal has undoubtedly chipped away at Trudeau’s personal brand. He’s spent most of his career in politics crafting an image as a compassionate, tolerant, and nearly transcendent figure. For years, the Canadian PM has been the left’s poster-boy for “diversity,” “inclusivity,” and “equality,” exemplified by a 2018 townhall exchange where Trudeau insisted a questioner use the phrase “peoplekind” instead of “mankind.”

With his tepid response to the increasing amount of blackface photos (and video as well ), Trudeau’s credibility as a champion of “multicultural values” and “racialized communities” is now being questioned even by those on the left. The blackface revelations prompted the Washington Post to opine that “ Canada’s left should dump Justin Trudeau .”

While some may accept Trudeau’s claim that he wasn’t aware of the problematic nature of his blackface makeup while he was in high school in the ‘90s, voters may have a harder time forgiving Trudeau for his “brownface” used for an “Arabian Nights”-themed party from 2001, when the would-be PM was 29 years old.

However, even before the blackface photos and video emerged, cracks began to emerge in Trudeau’s image. Results from a large poll conducted on September 18 showed that less than a quarter of Canadian women believe Trudeau when he proclaims he’s a feminist.

Accusations of Hypocrisy May Condemn Trudeau

Beyond the shameful blackface incidents, some of Trudeau’s opponents have honed in on his double-standard in applying the rigid, usually unforgiving standards of the “woke” left and the coinciding cancel culture movement it has spawned.

One year ago, Trudeau commented in an interview with CBC Radio that “there is no context in which someone doesn’t have responsibility for things they’ve done in the past.” During a 2018 event in Quebec, Trudeau responded to a heckler by saying her “intolerance” and “racism” indeed “has no place” at one of his gatherings. This past July, Trudeau publicly castigated President Donald Trump for what Trudeau thought were “racist” comments. Yet in the face of the latest ignominy, Trudeau is refusing to apply the same standard to himself, rebuffing any calls to resign or step down as Liberal leader.

The left’s outrage mobs caused Megyn Kelly to lose her job for merely recalling that children in the ‘70s used to darken their faces for Halloween costumes. Trudeau has worn blackface on at least three occasions and refuses to step down as Liberal Party leader. Right or wrong, by Trudeau’s own comments and the left’s modern “rules,” Trudeau shouldn’t even be running for re-election right now.

For this inconsistency, Trudeau was hit hard by comments from the Maxime Bernier, the leader of the new right-wing Peoples Party of Canada. Bernier wrote on Twitter , “I’m not going to accuse Justin Trudeau of being a racist. But he’s the master of identity politics and the Libs just spent months accusing everyone of being white supremacists. He definitely is the biggest hypocrite in the country.”

Trudeau’s Responses Have Not Put an End to the Scandal

As part of his damage-control, Trudeau wouldn’t definitively answer how many videos or photos exist of him in brownface or blackface, though on the first day of the scandal he only mentioned one additional instance.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Canadians may have been able to accept Trudeau’s initial apology “had he not lied about it,” but may now have trouble with Trudeau’s words since Scheer says it’s clear now his apology “was based on a lie.” Even more glaringly, Trudeau refused to answer if he hasn’t worn blackface since 2001.

In a 30-minute press conference a day after the blackface scandal broke, Trudeau claimed he didn’t know how offensive and hurtful his actions were because since he was born into a “place of privilege,” his own “lived reality” had become a “massive blindspot.” Trudeau used some of his speaking time to tell Canadians there was still much work to be done to eliminate the “systemic racism” that he claims still exists.

This response, as weak as it may be, is not entirely surprising. Even when at the helm of a disgrace, it’s very Trudeauian to pivot to how all of Canada can learn from such “teachable moments” with national soul-searching and introspection. It remains to be seen if a majority of Canadians have grown tired of such rejoinders.

How Canadian Politics Differs From The United States’s

There are a few important facts for Americans to bear in mind with regards to Canada, and its current political situation.

1) Canada’s population is about the same as the state of California ( 37 million to 39 million ). Aside from a few exceptions—most notably the western province of Alberta and some pockets of Ontario and B.C.—the average Canadian also shares the same politics with a Californian Democrat. What counts for the political “center-left” in Canada is far-left in the United States. What’s considered “left” in Canada, most Americans would brand as openly socialist.

Members of parliament from the Conservative Party of Canada would be on the left-most spectrum of today’s Republican Party, or even mid-1990s “ Blue Dog Democrats .” MPs from the Liberal Party of Canada would line up, on average, with Elizabeth Warren. Canada’s third most popular party, the New Democratic Party, is a radical leftist group Bernie Sanders would likely relish the chance to lead.

2) As a parliamentary system, the leaders of Canada’s political parties don’t run in a separate race to control an executive branch (as candidates do running for president in the United States). Instead, each leader of the parties runs to be a member of Parliament for his or her own district. If a party elects a majority of MPs (170 or more out of 338 seats in the House of Commons), that party’s leader becomes prime minister. An American equivalent would mean Donald Trump would have to run for Congress and be elected in his district, and would then only become president if the GOP won a congressional majority (218/435 House seats).

3) The Liberal party has been called Canada’s “natural governing party,” and for good reason. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Liberal party has only been out of power for 40 years. The party’s hold on the Canadian electorate and its successful branding as the “centrist” and “reasonable” option are well-established.

So, Where Does the Election Stand Today?

To win a majority government in the upcoming election, a Canadian political party needs 170 seats. An average of seat projections from 338 Canada , Canadian Election Watch , Calculated Politics , Too Close To Call , and the CBC predicts a minority government for Trudeau’s Liberals.

However, there are numerous caveats. First, we’ve only had one round of polls since the blackface scandal dropped. The effects of the outrage—and whether its negative influence on the Liberal numbers will stall, fade away, or fester and worsen—won’t be known for weeks.

Second, the upcoming debates can have an enormous consequence on the outcome of the election. In the 2015 Canadian federal election, mediocre debate performances from NDP leader Thomas Mulcair are one of the reasons his support plummeted and transferred to Trudeau, who had copiously preparated for the debates and memorized his arguments.

Third, support for the Liberals was waning even before the blackface scandal broke. Conservatives gained in Nanos Research’s tracking poll prior to September 18, and the momentum has carried through into September 21, according to Mainstreet Research.

Frank Graves, a well-respected longtime Canadian pollster from EKOS Research, says he’ll soon be releasing polling that shows a dramatic reversal in the all-important province of Ontario. According to Graves, the lead the Liberals once had in Ontario seems to have “evaporated almost overnight.” The Liberal majority that was once a decent bet has turned into a reality where Graves thinks “maybe the Conservatives are in majority range now.”

Lastly, analysis of the last four Canadian elections shows that movement can occur in the final month. In the last month of both the 2004 and 2008 campaigns, Conservatives gained just 2 percent. Yet the final 30 days of the 2011 election saw the Conservatives gain 2 percent while the Liberals dropped 7 percent, handing the Conservatives their largest victory since the party united Canada’s right-wing in 2003. Similarly, with one month out, Canada’s last federal election in 2015 saw a dead heat between Conservative PM Steven Harper and Trudeau turn into a comfortable victory for the Liberals on election day.

It’s not hard to envision an outcome where upon waking up on October 22, neither the Liberals nor Conservatives have a majority government. If this comes to pass, and the victorious party can’t form a functional, minority government than can govern with the support of NDP, Green Party, or Bloc Québécois allies, Canadians might be headed back to another election far sooner than they hope.

Black Progress Requires Reviving The Legacy Of Booker T. Washington,"“The persons who accomplish the most in this world … are those who are constantly seeing and appreciating the bright side as well as the dark side of life.” — Booker T. Washington, “Character Building“

Generals often make the mistake of preparing for the next war, as if it will play out like the last. Take the French Maginot Line. A series of concrete fortifications, obstacles, and weapon installations, built in the 1930s to deter German invasion, the Maginot Line was a highly advanced structure for its time. It was 280 miles long and up to 15 miles wide. It even had air conditioning.

Unfortunately, it proved useless. The Maginot Line was designed to fight a “trench war,” as had predominated the Western Front during World War I, but the technology had changed. The way the new war played out was different. The new German Panzer tanks simply went around the Maginot Line. Worse yet, the French government had put so much time and resources into building the Maginot Line, it had failed to prepare its military to adequately fight the Germany army. The French were caught on their heels, and the Nazis conquered the country in a matter of weeks.

I fear that this same fault has too much dominated African American strategic thinking for several decades. The civil rights movement was our last “great war,” and too many are preparing for the next “great black struggle” as if it will be the same as the last one. Here we risk creating our own Maginot Line. But our enemies have also learned from the last war, and they have been making half-time adjustments.

Killing Booker

Throughout my life, Martin Luther King’s picture has been ubiquitous in black people’s homes, neighborhoods, schools, institutions, and so forth. In my world, MLK’s image has been everywhere — MLK, the icon. But there was a time before anyone had ever heard of Martin Luther King Jr.

Back in the day, Booker T. Washington’s image was ubiquitous in black America. And not just black America. After the death of Frederick Douglass, Booker became the most photographed and most famous black man on the planet. Not only was he the greatest icon among African Americans, but the world identified African Americans with the words and image of Booker T. Washington.

Carter G. Woodson, the “father of black history,” recounts a trip to Europe in 1907, when a German stranger insisted that Woodson attend a dinner party at his home, simply because Woodson was the same race as the “great Booker T. Washington,” whom the German came to deeply admire after reading Booker’s “Up From Slavery.”

The Black Revolution of the 1960s changed all of this. It was, of course, a political revolution, the dismantling of Jim Crow, and the elimination of the de jure American color caste system. But it was also a cultural and ideological revolution. The phrases “black pride” and “black power” capture this new way of thinking. Like all such revolutions, it was iconoclastic, attempting to smash the icons of the past. Its attacks on dead white men, such as the Anglo-American Founders, are well known. But it smashed black icons as well.

Longtime black celebrities such as Louis Armstrong and Sidney Poitier were increasingly looked upon as Uncle Toms. The civil rights establishment was viewed suspiciously as bourgeois. Washington took the biggest hit. To MLK and Rosa Parks’ generation of black Southerners, Booker had been the hero — his image, name, donations, philosophy, and program. The Black Revolution put an end to all of that. MLK replaced Booker as the black icon, with some Malcolm X strongholds in the northern cities.

The black academics of the new left eviscerated Booker. Their overall claim, that Booker was personally responsible for the unnecessary extension of Jim Crow, is a vicious slander, and never backed up by any real evidence. Instead, these critics have directly lifted their attacks from two contemporary Massachusetts-born and Harvard-educated quarter-black Americans, William Trotter and W.E.B. Du Bois, who were largely motivated by their envy of Booker’s power and position.

These men believed they should be the national black spokesmen, not Booker. Why they believed this is not clear. Maybe because they were born higher in the color caste system than Booker. Trotter’s father was a wealthy white man who left his son a small fortune. Maybe it was because they went to Harvard and Booker attended Hampton. Maybe because Booker was born a slave, while they were born to free bourgeois black or biracial families. Whatever their reasons, no one has ever persuasively argued that they would have been superior black national spokesmen to Booker.

Resurrecting Booker

Judging strictly by merit, Booker T. Washington should be no less celebrated by Americans than Martin Luther King Jr. Yet in which idols a society worships and which it does not, politics is always involved. The original Martin Luther broke from the Roman Catholic Church because salvation itself had become too political.

Similarly, the leading black voices today have made black salvation in America too political. During his time, Booker understood the game far better than his critics. To say they were playing checkers while Booker was playing chess is a cliché, but nevertheless, an apt one. He believed the center of power in American society lay not in the hands of the politicians, but instead in the hands of the industrial capitalists, whose interests were peculiarly served by the courts and legislatures across the country. This is why he de-emphasized radical politics and emphasized social and economic development, which he viewed would inevitably lead to political progress.

To be fair, as Du Bois evolved over the decades, his views in some ways became closer to Booker’s. His last editorials in the 1934 issues of “The Crisis” express views on Jim Crow closer to Booker’s than the younger Du Bois, de-emphasizing the political fight against segregation and putting greater emphasis on building black institutions and black human capital accumulation. Du Bois eventually came to see the industrial capitalists as the real center of American power, as did Booker. What continued to differ radically was their respective responses to this reality.

For Booker, the answer was a practical black development model and program, rooted in his own personal observations of the specific problems endemic to the freedmen, owing to their recent condition of servitude. To put it briefly: their relative inability to accumulate and pass on capital intergenerationally, both financial and human.

The school of the plantation entirely failed to teach the slave these skills or allow for the creation of institutions favorable to the accumulation of black capital intergenerationally. This is necessary to the advancement of a free people in any society, especially a capitalist one. In the longer term, Booker hoped the efforts of his time could lay the foundations for an elite black industrial capitalist class, thus allowing blacks to be real players in the game.

In contrast, Du Bois became a communist who advocated for the overthrow of the whole worldwide capitalist system. He was a strong admirer of Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. The elder Du Bois’ dystopian vision of black salvation was an American Marxist-Leninist Revolution, carried out by the steady hand of a black Stalin or Mao. In contrast, Booker’s vision of black salvation is hopeful, rational, and pragmatic.

Booker Versus ‘The Radical King’

Cornel West’s “The Radical King” is a terrific collection of MLK’s speeches and writings, with a passionate introduction by its editor. Perhaps more than any other black academic celebrity of his generation, West has sought to passionately articulate his version of “The Radical King,” his interpretation of the direction MLK was going when he was so tragically assassinated. Whether or not one agrees with West’s interpretation, he’s been a dedicated and effective evangelist.

For years, black intellectuals and activists have been digging through the history of MLK’s life after the civil rights movement, looking for clues of how to proceed with the struggle from the prophet himself and trying to reconstruct a coherent philosophy from speeches, writings, and anecdotes. The assumption here is that MLK was really onto something, that he was about to make a huge breakthrough before he was untimely silenced by an assassin’s bullet — that it was because he was about to really change things that he was killed.

Readers should re-examine this assumption by folks like West, among others, and entertain the possibility that perhaps MLK was lost, that he was on the wrong path at the end of his life, with respect to his role as de facto national black spokesman. I’m not questioning MLK’s choices as a private citizen, but whether certain political decisions were the most effective options to advance black progress, given his preeminent role.

Was his choice to break with President Lyndon B. Johnson the most effective option for advancing black progress? Was his choice to rail against the “Eastern Establishment” the most effective option for advancing black progress? Especially since these folks were so essential in the implementation of the civil rights and Great Society agenda for which King so passionately advocated. Were these political mistakes?

Would black progress have been better served after the civil rights movement by MLK returning to his roots in the ways of Booker T. Washington, instead of aligning himself with the agenda of white radicals? That is to say, putting less emphasis on radical politics and more on black capital accumulation and institution-building? Would black progress have been better served if MLK had cultivated closer relationships with leading businessmen and affluent people to help finance black development, rather than railing against the capitalist system?

What did it really accomplish anyway?

Trudeau Weathers Blackface Scandal As Conservatives Look For Opening,"There are just three weeks left before Canadians will vote in the 2019 federal election. The blackface scandal that rocked the start of the campaign and threatens to undo Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s image has been fully factored into the polls.

We’ll know soon if enough if Trudeau’s Liberal Party of Canada holds onto or even expands on their seats in parliament. During the last week, there have been some notable shifts in projections and voter sentiment. Here’s where the race stands now.

Conservatives Say Trudeau Has Damaged Canada’s Image

Since the initial revelations, Trudeau was questioned multiple times about the exact nature of his most offensive blackface costume, but stuck to a campaign talking-point that he will “continue to be open with Canadians.” The scandal was also the focus of the PM’s first interview since the scandal broke, in which Trudeau continued to dodge questions about the possibility of future revelations and more “skeletons” in Trudeau’s closet coming back to haunt him.

The blackface video from the 1990s may prove to be the most harmful to Trudeau’s image as new high-quality footage of the incident has now been uncovered. The new clearer video brought the scandal back into the campaign and earned Trudeau fresh condemnation from former allies on the left such as Piers Morgan.

The Conservative Party of Canada has incorporated Trudeau’s blackface scandal alongside embarrassing commentary from across the world into a bold new ad blitz. Canadians have long guarded their image abroad, typically a source of pride. In another ad, Seth Meyers quips that “Canadians traveling in Europe are gonna start telling people they’re American.” The CPC ad is part of a narrative telling Canadians Trudeau is “not as advertised.”

Along with stressing the damage that Trudeau has done to Canada’s image around the world, CPC leader Andrew Scheer has promised that, if elected, his government will re-open the SNC-Laval scandal, in which Trudeau is accused of using government power to affect a criminal case. Scheer announced, “A Conservative government will launch a judicial inquiry into Justin Trudeau’s role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal … [ensuring] no other corrupt politicians can stonewall police investigations, because no one is above the law.”

‘Green’ Issues Drawing More Attention

An interesting turn in the 2019 federal election campaign has been the increasing prominence of “the environment” as an issue. Trudeau sat down for a one-on-one meeting with climate activist Greta Thunberg. Trudeau promised to pay for the planting of 2 billion new trees in the next decade but was chided by Thunberg for “not doing enough” to stem what the 16-year-old sees as a coming “climate apocalypse.”

With the apparent rise of environmental concerns in the minds of Canadian voters, the Green Party of Canada has witnessed a bump in its numbers, seemingly at the expense of the Liberals. It remains to be seen whether the “Green surge” is a momentary aberration brought on by the press coverage given to the “Global Climate Strike,” or a permanent pivoting to the environment as a top election issue.

The Green Party will have to confront, however, the parliamentary budget experts who gave the Greens’ proposed budget a failing grade. Analysts have declared that the Green Party’s budget doesn’t add up and is in effect, unworkable.

Leader of the Far-Left NDP Attacks Trump

Raising quite a few eyebrows while campaigning in British Columbia, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh voiced to his supporters that he hoped President Donald Trump would be impeached. Singh added that it was “disgusting that the president could inflame hatred against people and be so divisive.” Of his impeachment hopes, he said his comments were “a little tongue-in-cheek.”

One day later, however, Singh doubled-down and repeated his comments, this time exclaiming that he wasn’t joking after all. As relayed by CBC, Singh told reporters “Canadians expect to have someone who’s going to stand up to Mr. Trump … Canadians don’t want someone … who is going to back down from a bully.”

The comments may have made for some easy applause among NDP faithful, but Singh’s remarks drew a fair amount of criticism from across the voter spectrum. Regardless of one’s opinion of Trump, it’s very ill-advised—and in poor taste—for the leader of Canada’s third-place political party to speak so disparagingly of the legally elected head of the nation’s largest trading partner and ally. If Singh manages to somehow pull off what would be an unbelievable electoral upset, he’s created quite an unenviable diplomatic starting position with the United States.

Trudeau’s Blackface Scandal May Still Hurt Liberal Odds

According to Frank Graves’ eagerly awaited polling results from his EKOS firm, the blackface escapade had a severe initial negative effect on voters. Twenty-eight percent of respondents said the incident was “serious.” Twenty-four percent indicated that it would affect how they vote. Of Liberal Party voters, only 6 percent consider the scandal serious, and 7 percent say it will affect their vote.

Polling from Abacus Data corroborates the findings from EKOS. While a full 76 percent said that it either “didn’t bother them” or “felt they could move on,” 24 percent said that they were “truly offended” and it “changed their view of Mr. Trudeau for the worse.” Abacus notes that of that last group, two-thirds were Conservative Party voters—leaving about 8 percent of voters, scattered across the various parties, whom the Liberals may be on the verge of losing. If that turns out to be true and if that holds until October 21, then the blackface scandal may well end up costing the Liberals crucial seats in tight races, and perhaps the election.

It appears on the whole, however, that blackface backlash has subsided. Graves notes that the quick turnaround indicates “large pockets of turbulence in the voter landscape.” This volatility combined with the number of close races across the country could make for quite an interesting election night. One region to keep an eye on will be the so-called “905” area of Ontario, outside the city of Toronto.

So-called ‘905’ Region May Decide the Election

While uncertainty clouds how well the Liberals can expect to perform in Quebec, the path to winning the election looks to come down, once again, to the seat-rich province of Ontario. Central to any party emerging victorious in Ontario lies in the 905 ridings which, in turn, means the 905 is the key to forming a government.

A closer look at polling from Nik Nanos shows that Trudeau’s Liberals are losing ground in the 905 region—named for the area code given to the regions of Halton, Peel, York, and Durham, the Niagara Peninsula, the city of Hamilton, and parts of Northumberland County. CTV went so far as to say the Liberals are getting “hammered” in Ontario’s 905 region.

Worth remembering is that when conservative Doug Ford become the premier of Ontario in last year’s provincial election, conservatives won 21 of 25 seats in the 905 belt. Ford’s popularity, however, has suffered a hit since his inauguration. Trudeau has taken to name-dropping Ford at every opportunity whenever he’s on the campaign trail in Ontario. Nevertheless, it would still be quite the turn of events if the area flipped back to the Liberal Party in a little more than a year.

One riding to keep an eye on is Northumberland—Peterborough South, which contains the delightful lakefront town of Port Hope (recently the stand-in for the fictional Derry, Maine in the latest “It” films). Although the riding was part of a redistricting in 2013, the Northumberland region of the 905 has long been a bellwether of national sentiment. The riding containing Northumberland has coincided with the party that wins the federal election for the last 26 years.

Due to how tight all of the riding-by-riding fights are in the 905, it’s improbable either the Liberals or Conservatives can afford to stumble there. A few percentage points in either direction could swing the entire contest and decide who becomes prime minister of Canada.

Latest Projections Still for Liberal Minority Government

For this update, I added in projections from LISPOP, who is providing projections out of Wilfrid Laurier University’s Laurier Institute for the Study of Public Opinion and Policy. This week’s average of seat projections from 338 Canada, Canadian Election Watch, Calculated Politics, Too Close To Call, LISPOP, and the CBC predicts a minority government for Trudeau’s Liberals.

Although I’m currently predicting the Liberal Party of Canada will come up short of the 170 seats to form a majority government, it’s very likely the NDP would agree to prop up Trudeau’s Liberals and allow them to govern.

Again, this result is by no means a sure thing. On October 2, the first major debate (taking place in Montreal, Quebec) may well shake up the standings. There remains a lot of movement and undecided voters among the Canadian electorate, and as noted, the 905 region will go a long way in deciding who leads Canada for the next four years.

College-Educated Whites Are Fracturing The Democratic Party,"Elizabeth Warren’s rise in the polls (and Joe Biden’s stumbles) will start obscuring what the first eight months of the presidential primary campaign revealed to many: the Democratic Party is fractured along lines of ideology, identity, and age (if age is not a subset of identity). A new survey suggests college-educated whites are driving fissures into the Democratic rank-and-file.

Even before the presidential cycle started in earnest, it was becoming apparent that Democrats have an “upstairs / downstairs” coalition, in which a relatively small elite drive policy in ways that do not always serve the interests of the party’s traditional working-class base.

The large-scale “Hidden Tribes“ survey conducted by the left-leaning More in Common group suggested “progressive activists”—the furthest-left 8 percent of Americans—were more white than all but the most conservative 6 percent of Americans. A follow-up study showed progressive activists have among the most distorted views of their political rivals.

Moreover, “Democrats’ understanding of Republicans actually gets worse with every additional degree they earn. This effect is so strong that Democrats without a high school diploma are three times more accurate than those with a postgraduate degree.”

White progressives have similar, if lesser, problems with their fellow Democrats. In the wake of the “Great Awokening,” white liberals have moved to the left of the black Democrats on some racial issues. The schism extends to other issues, including Israel, immigration, and gender identity.

These previous studies and polls left open the question of how big the divergence was between the median Democrat and the party’s far-left, disproportionately white elites. Echelon Insights, a political research and intelligence firm, recently conducted a survey matched against voter files that begins to lift the curtain further on whether and how the “Great Awokening” has affected Democrats overall.

Echelon created a “social and cultural values index,” based on Democratic and Republican responses to eight questions regarding immigration, marijuana legalization, the death penalty, abortion, reparations for slavery, and LGBTQ issues. By this measure, college-educated white Democrats (at -50.9) are further to the left than “Trump Republicans” are to the right (at 48.9).

They are further to the left than Democratic primary voters (at -37.1) and donors (at 44.4). And college-educated white Democrats are more than twice as far to the left as black (-24.6) or Latino (-24.3) Democrats are. Minority Democrats are much closer to the index score for non-college whites (-21).

The Echelon survey also reveals that Democrats are much less unified in their views on these social and cultural questions. For example, on the question of reparations, non-college white Dems largely oppose them (scoring 54 on the index), white college Dems less so (scoring 14), Latino Dems barely supporting them (at -2), and black Dems strongly supporting reparations (at -55). In contrast, Republicans overwhelmingly oppose reparations (all groups scoring in the 80s).

Various splits also arise on other issues in the index. White college and Latino Democrats oppose a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, while non-college whites and blacks mildly support one. White college Dems strongly oppose requiring transgender people to use bathrooms matching their birth sex, while black Dems mildly support it. And white college Dems are the only group opposed to the death penalty for murderers.

Echelon further asked Democrats how concerned they were about issues beyond those in the index, disclosing further splits between white college Dems and other demographics. President Trump’s policies are of extreme concern to 77 percent of white college Democrats, but only 58 percent of black Democrats. (There is a roughly similar split on “Trump’s offensive tweets.”) Climate change is of extreme concern to 71 percent of white college Democrats, while only 38 percent of black Democrats feel that way.

Conversely, 69 percent of black Democrats are extremely concerned about gun violence; a bit surprisingly, only 53 percent of college-educated whites agree. Seventy-three percent of black Dems are extremely concerned by police brutality, as opposed to 37 of college white Dems (and only 33 percent of white non-college Dems). Indeed, on the general topic of racism, 69 percent of black Dems are extremely concerned, while only 56 percent of white college Dems are (and a mere 40 percent of white non-college Dems).

Obviously, we should not read too much into the results of a single survey. But along with some prior polling, it appears that college-educated white Democrats as a group are much less woke than the party’s elites on racism and other issues of importance to black Democrats. This finding may support the theory that the “Great Awokening” among progressive elites is a phenomenon associated with (and perhaps driven by) Twitter and other forms of social media. But these results are in tension with prior polling regarding white liberals and bear further exploration.

More broadly, Echelon’s results suggest that college-educated white Democrats are the demographic most responsible for pushing the party leftward, particularly on social and cultural issues and “resisting” President Trump. They are an outlier within the Democratic Party, let alone the general electorate.

Given that the Democrats’ current electoral strategies are aimed more at college-educated whites than non-college whites, the party’s schisms are likely to continue in the medium-term.

Black People Are Still Slaves. Why Haven't You Heard About Them?,"Every day across the African continent, black men, women, and children are captured, bought, and sold into slavery with the Western world paying scant attention. Human rights groups have marched and battled against abuses noticeably less cruel and evil than human bondage, yet no major organization has attempted to free today’s black slaves, much less taken meaningful steps to raise awareness about their plight.

For instance, in Mauritania, although slavery has been legally banned five times since 1961, it nevertheless persists with tens of thousands of blacks continuing to be held in bondage. While it is forbidden in the Qur’an for Muslims to enslave fellow Muslims, in Mauritania, racism trumps religious doctrine — as it did in the West — as Arab and Berber Muslims enslave African Muslims.

Twenty-five years ago, Mohamed Athié, a political refugee from Mauritania, and I broke the story of a modern-day black slave trade in The New York Times. Our nascent American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) mobilized the public, and piqued media interest. In Sudan, tens of thousands of African women and children from mostly Christian villages were being enslaved during the jihad raids of the Second Sudanese Civil War.

Americans heard stories of abduction, rape, beatings, forced conversions, and genital mutilation. Between 1995 and 2011, Christian Solidarity International, a grassroots human rights group, liberated more than 100,000 of these slaves in European- and American-funded slave buy-backs.

President George W. Bush, moved by the plight of the slaves, helped the black south split off and eventually form South Sudan, the world’s newest nation, in 2011. It was estimated then that as many as 35,000 blacks remained enslaved in the north. Nobody knows how many are there today.

The AASG, which led abolitionist campaigns from 1995 to 2005, ceased its activist work when South Sudan won its freedom. But today, the enslavement of black Africans has spread as a result of the growth of violent Islamist movements and anti-black racism. The need for human rights groups’ intervention and efforts has never been greater.

Americans first heard about Islamist slave raids in Nigeria when Michelle Obama made it a cause célèbre with her “#BringBackOurGirls” hashtag, but interest quickly faded, and Boko Haram continued to kidnap hundreds of Christian girls into jihad slavery. So cruel are the events of their captivity that some girls prefer death as suicide bombers to the life of a slave. Today, Fulani Muslim herdsmen raid Christian villages, massacring their inhabitants. President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim, has done relatively little to stop the assaults, even in the face of demands for action from the White House.

In Algeria, sub-Saharan Africans fleeing violence and poverty are enslaved by Algerian Arabs as they attempt to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. According to the Global Slavery Index (GSI), 106,000 black Africans are estimated to be enslaved in Algeria. Migrant women and children of both sexes risk being forced into sexual slavery, while men perform unskilled labor.

Black Africans hoping for a better life in Europe also travel to Libya, where they are caught and trafficked across the Mediterranean, often to Italy. The auction of a black man for $400 was filmed by CNN. The GSI estimates as many as 48,000 migrants are enslaved in Libya, with survivors reporting torture and sexual slavery.

Two forces hinder efforts toward freeing these slaves. First, Louis Farrakhan, who wields outsize influence in America’s black community, focuses his efforts on conversion of blacks to Islam. Thus the fact that Arab Muslims are enslaving Christian and Muslim blacks is more than inconvenient for this goal and his influence, and is easier ignored. In the 1990s, Farrakhan dismissed reports of modern-day black slavery as a “Jewish conspiracy,” intimidated African Americans from acting, and ignored evidence provided in a Pulitzer Prize-nominated news investigation that was conducted at his behest.

The second problem stems from Western rights organizations’ obsession with perceived Western crimes, which logically requires them to ignore or marginalize victims of non-Western abuses. Compare the West’s response to the crime of apartheid in South Africa and its lack of concern to end the Arab trade in African slaves. The human rights establishment seems to be moved less by human suffering than by its need to be seen as “the good whites.” Such narcissism abandons those most in need of Western concern.

These remain the challenges to those whose hearts respond to the cries of humans in bondage. They were overcome 20 years ago with the liberation of Sudan’s slaves. They can be again. Human bondage is a moral outrage. All decent people should see its victims as their own brothers, sisters, and children, and act to rescue them. It is time for human rights groups to focus on freeing Africa’s slaves.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/14/thousands-of-black-people-are-still-slaves-so-why-havent-you-heard-about-them/,2019-10-14
Ibram Kendi Reveals The Dangers Of Reducing Everything To ‘Racism’,"“Generally, we have defined racist policies by the perpetrator and intent, rather than the victim and the outcome.” Thus Ibram X. Kendi opens his interview with Ezra Klein on his new book, “How to Be an Antiracist,” revealing the essential problem of his argument.

There can be no coherent notion of justice without the concepts of “personal intent” and “personal responsibility” for the reasonably inferable consequences of one’s actions. This is true for both accused and accuser, or what Kendi terms “perpetrator” and “victim.” This also reverses a traditional notion of American justice, as the accused is assumed guilty without a trial.

Maybe a better title for the book would be: “How to Be a Racist without Really Trying.” Kendi’s book never makes a sincere attempt to adequately demonstrate cause and effect with respect to its principal contentions by any discernible method, empirical or otherwise.

What Is an ‘Antiracist’?

Kendi defines his terms in his National Book Award-winning “Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas.” Whether one is an “antiracist” is strictly a function of one’s interpretation of racial disparities between blacks and whites: income, education, crime rates, single parent families, and so on. According to Kendi, an antiracist is someone who attributes all racial disparities to “racist policies.”

So what is a racist? Kendi defines a “racist” as someone who believes some or all racial disparities are black people’s fault.

Klein observes, “Why can’t it be both?” noting that Kendi’s definition requires greatly expanding the notion of “racism” and “racist.” While many Americans, including me, believe words indicating some form of bigotry, such as “racist,” “sexist,” and “homophobe,” are thrown around too loosely in public, especially on social media, Kendi thinks vastly expanding their usage would be great for American society.

His approach seems counterintuitive, given we live in a society being ripped apart by ethnic, cultural, and political divisions. So why does Kendi think calling more people racist would be a good idea?

Because what he calls “racist ideas” have historically been used to justify “racist policies.” Here I agree with Kendi. No doubt, deeply racially bigoted theological justifications were given for American slavery. Moreover, racially bigoted justifications were also used to justify Jim Crow. I would even grant Kendi that racially bigoted ideas are used to justify some policies today.

But this still doesn’t clarify why it would be a positive good to call more people racists, given the deep fracturing that already exists in our society. Does not a time of increasing civil strife call for a more diplomatic approach? Calling more white people racists publicly is not going to heal what ails us.

Is the Problem with the ‘People or the Policy’?

Kendi’s reasoning is that since people used racist ideas to justify slavery and Jim Crow, others are likely still using the same racist ideas today, and consequently all racial inequalities are a result of racist policies. Slavery is the original racist policy that created “racial inequities,” and this policy gave rise to a “racist ideology” to justify it. Jim Crow was a racist policy that created racial inequities, giving rise to a racist ideology to justify it.

Today we have racist policy giving rise to racial inequities. So if you believe any differences between black and white outcomes are not wholly a result of racist policies, you have been infected by racist ideology. This is how Kendi’s logic works.

Kendi offers us a dichotomy: “The problem is with the people or the policy.” If you think the problem is with the policy alone, you’re an “antiracist.” If you think the problem is with both or just the people, you’re a “racist.”

Why? Because the system is to blame for all black people’s problems, or so Kendi would like us to think. Even ultra-liberal Klein had a tough time swallowing the hogwash Kendi peddled. For example, Kendi recounts a speech he gave as a teenager chastising black youth for engaging in too much irresponsible behavior, such as criminality and teenage pregnancy. Today, Kendi considers that speech racist.

It’s a podcast, so there’s no visual, but you can hear Ezra Klein do a verbal double-take: “Huh? What? The teens were getting pregnant. They were committing crimes.”

Kendi Ignores the ‘Slave Mentality’

Having taught in the ghettos of Philadelphia, I can tell you the biggest problem is what these kids bring into the classroom, whether from home or off the streets. But it really all starts at home. In this environment, people are poor and single-motherhood is the norm, often young mothers. Children receive little or no academic preparation at home. Since there is a lack of fathers, they are more likely to be influenced by negative peer pressure, by the vice that inhabits any urban ghetto. This applies especially to boys, but also to girls.

Of course, it is not the children’s fault they were born in difficult circumstances. And we can trace some of these problems directly to slavery. This is the crucial point, that while there do exist racially bigoted policies and practices today, some of the difference in outcomes between blacks and whites also arise from a kind of black intergenerational PTSD — what Malcolm X called a “slave mentality” and what James Baldwin called a “ghetto mentality.” Same difference.

This is where Kendi and I really differ. In truth, Kendi knows that part of the reason for racial inequality is the proliferation among too many African Americans of a modern-day slave mentality or ghetto mentality. All black people know this, and frankly, you can’t hide this fact from white people.

So why is Kendi playing this game? Because he appears really to believe that racist policies are the main obstacle to black progress. This is probably a result of his concept of black progress. For Kendi, all black progress, more or less, has been the result of “antiblack” political activism. Economics and hard work don’t seem to play into it — nor education, nor family, nor moral discipline, nor institution-building, nor church. Black people owe everything they have to political activists such as Black Lives Matter and Colin Kaepernick.

This is a very narrow and misleading view of black progress, to say the least. I take the more traditional view — that of Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Carter G. Woodson, Baldwin, and even Malcolm X — that the main obstacle to black progress is the historical remnants of the slave mind.

Kendi Advocates for Moral and Cultural Relativism

This is also most peculiar about Kendi’s work: Through some kind of intellectual hocus-pocus, he imposes his view on the great black leaders and intellectuals of the past, using them to justify his position. He tortures their views and tries to make it look like they agree with him. For example, he lists “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and “The Fire Next Time” as antiracist books, when these men clearly argue that the most important obstacle to black progress is the modern-day slave mind. It’s practically the theme of Malcolm X’s autobiography.

Honestly, Kendi’s book is trivial and highly misleading. Goethe once said that when he first read the work of Immanuel Kant, “It was like a light came into the room.” In contrast, reading Kendi feels like putting shackles on your brain.

Underlying this all is a doctrine of moral and cultural relativism, the idea that one set of cultural practices or moral norms is not better than another; they are only different. This raises the question: How can we know racism or being a racist is wrong if all cultural practices are just different, none being better than another. How can we know slavery itself is wrong? What about the antebellum, Anglo-Southern culture that practiced slavery and generally believed God sanctified it? Is that also just different?

Kendi’s model makes moral reasoning impossible, such that one cannot even argue whether racism is a good thing or a bad thing. His work exemplifies why I do my best not to use the word “racism.”

When I was a boy, my parents would repeatedly tell me not to use the word “like” because it turned into a verbal crutch, a substitute for thinking. They told me the same for using curse words. For black intellectuals today, the word “racism” has become a verbal and intellectual crutch — a substitute for truly investigating cause and effect, the basic principle of scientific inquiry. Kendi’s work exemplifies this dynamic.

"Why Kanye Will Back Off His Christianity Phase, And That’s A Good Thing","Kanye West just released a gospel album. His latest body of work is a distinctly Christian renunciation of his former secular music. The music alone is a solid romp for Kanye, with moments of true beauty.

The album is only weak due to the strength of the gospel genre. The song “Say Yes” by The Shekinah Glory Ministry is far superior to anything West could create sonically in homage to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Instead, Kanye’s true value is the persona he has created and the cult following that comes with it. I visited the Kanye West pop-up shop in Los Angeles on Sunday, and he was gracious enough to visit the line outside. The reaction to Kanye wasn’t the same as your run-of-the-mill celebrity sighting. He carried himself like a man visiting his followers.

Like the man and his music, the Kanye cult represents the beauty in frailty. This is why the born-again Christian aesthetic fits Kanye so well. Still, he calls himself a “Christian innovator,” while Christianity does not need innovation. Christianity cannot be watered down and remain itself.

Understanding the nature of the born-again phenomena and its unique ties to the West is crucial. With its legitimacy in question more than ever, for the moment Kanye West has become the face of Christianity. Kanye is one with popular culture, and he is now trying to re-integrate the Christian faith into it.

There is beauty in this vision, as it is the sort of thing one could imagine birthed from the mind of a child. Yet this beauty is of the superficial sort. Kanye defends children jumping on tables, but the truth is feet don’t belong on tables, just like Jesus doesn’t belong in your breakfast cereal.

Many great artists are by nature temperamentally conservative because they are led by beauty. Beauty is hierarchy, as so much of it is objective: Either a person is beautiful, or he’s not, and while there are some shades of grey the big contrasts are easy for anyone to spot if they are being honest.

Just like his brush with conservatism. Kanye’s political diatribes also reflect his music: Lots of noise with momentary flashes of brilliance. He is primarily an artist of excess and perfect for modern society because of our material abundance.

For many it takes a transcendent act to progress in their journey of self-discovery. Not unlike Kanye, mine was sparked by the emergence of President Trump, although I find the president palatable for different reasons than Kanye does.

Admittedly, I find many but not all black Trump supporters carry a bit of a grudge against the black community. This is not self-hatred, as many would categorize it, but more a cry for attention. The MAGA hat is an excellent political symbol for this purpose. It is powerful, and that’s why I keep mine in the closet.

Kanye has learned not to be overly political, and he will soon learn not to be overly Christian. He made it a point to bring his traveling church to the historically black Howard University. Unlike mainstream institutions, historically black colleges have been able to maintain a fairly healthy relationship with tradition. HBCUs are proudly black and Christian but not overtly such. A reverence for tradition is a good match for Christianity and Kanye could use more of it.

I was merely a man with opinions at Morehouse College, a HCBU. It wasn’t until attending a predominantly white university for my PhD did I begin to understand the dilemma uniquely faced by black people who had spent more time in mainstream society. The more liberal environs repress being black in a manner that often leaves people out of rhythm.

The same can be said for one’s faith, or any other immutable identity, for that matter. While we are not merely our races, feeling like a genuine member of a group is important. Kanye’s decision to wear the Jesus hat instead of the Trump hat is a clear attempt for him to get back into the good graces of his people. Young black Christians love the Kanye album.

West’s fame is primarily due to how relatable he is. He is the perfect tragic figure for modern western society. He is often the butt of his own joke, intentionally or otherwise. At worst, he’s childish, but at his best he displays how weakness can be strength.

"No, Bernie Sanders, Police Are Not Out To Get Black People","Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to perpetuate the myth that all law enforcement officers are somehow out to destroy black lives. When a student asked the presidential hopeful what he should do if he were pulled over by the police, Sanders said:

I would respect what they are doing so that you don’t get shot in the back of the head, but I would also be very mindful of the fact that as a nation, we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit. I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with that police officer, but I would also defend my rights and know my rights and make sure if possible that police officer’s camera is on what goes on.

This advice may have elements of truth, but ultimately not enough. Sanders is correct that the student should “respect what they [law enforcement] are doing,” for officers have a certain amount of authority over citizens by law. But law enforcement should be respected not out of fear, but because of their essential role in our communities.

Sanders Perpetuates the Narrative That Police Are Corrupt

Sanders would have us believe our nation is missing the mark on law enforcement accountability. His statement comes after two attention-grabbing incidents in which police officers committed illegal actions. How could anyone forget the cases of Amber Guyger or the Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who killed a woman in her home? The officers in question were, however, held accountable, amid a wave of public revulsion.

Studies show some black people have an unfavorable view of law enforcement performance in their communities. But the studies don’t ask questions about what influences these views. Have these black people actually had a negative encounter with an officer? In that case, a negative view would be more than understandable.

But what if, having never directly experienced racial discrimination from a police officer, they’ve been swayed by the biases of friends and family members? People tend to believe something is true if they hear it repeated enough. When they latch onto it, they dismiss any evidence to the contrary.

Sanders and leaders of predominantly black communities (and I would argue all communities) should encourage citizens to find more constructive and positive ways to interact with law enforcement, and vice versa. Does it not bring a smile to one’s face to see a video of an officer of the law dancing with children or playing sports with young people?

Of course, these things happen all of the time. But people seem to forget about them because we are inundated with news that only shows the worst of interactions between law enforcement and minorities.

Law Enforcement Is Not ‘Institutionally Racist’

Whenever stories emerge involving a black person being slain at the hands of an officer, people quickly move to the tired (but useful for some) “America hates blacks” narrative. Some people don’t need an investigation before they adopt this tone. They believe they know the truth: that the institutional racism of yesterday is the exact same institutional racism of today.

Anyone who questions that argument is deemed a racist. Any black conservative who questions it is an “Uncle Tom.” This is not to say every black person ever killed by a white policeman was guilty or that the shooting was justified. However, to assume every instance is because of “institutional racism” or to come to a conclusion before all the facts are out is a disservice to the truth.

Another consideration: Many tend to forget and even dismiss the reality of a police officer’s job. Theirs is inherently dangerous work, and they have to be on their toes at all times. Not everything is so black and white. Politicians are not always the best at breaking down the gray areas of life.

Sanders could have asked the student to picture what it would be like to be in this situation. A more meticulous approach may have been controversial, but it would have been far more beneficial to the student. Yes, know your rights as a citizen. Also, know the rights of police officers.

Citizens and Officers Must Show Mutual Respect

Those in law enforcement should also concentrate on possible strategies that could diminish the number of interactions between themselves and citizens. For instance, a recent video came out that displayed a police officer wrestling an 11-year-old girl to the ground. While this was taking place, her school administrator told the officer she was not a threat. Although this policeman, who later resigned, should have used common sense, it’s possible he was just not properly trained.

Sadly, common sense is not common to everyone. Nevertheless, if he had been given the tools to police his community effectively, this man would still have a job, the girl (and her family) might still respect law enforcement, and, ultimately, this little drama would not have played out and become a part of the long list of ugly exchanges between officers and black citizens.

Citizens should also concentrate on how to converse with law enforcement, even when disagreements arise. Cooperation and communication will lead to a better view of them overall. Additionally, don’t believe that every single African American has had or will have a negative and racist encounter with a police officer.

If you would like some friendly advice, here are some principles to adhere to — regardless of your skin color:

Do not move suddenly when you’re pulled over. Turn off your car and roll down your window. Keep your hands on the steering wheel. When the police officer approaches your vehicle, do not get an attitude. If you have a problem with what he or she is saying, wait for your day in court to argue your case. When they ask for your license and registration, make no sudden movements. Ask if you may retrieve those items before moving. State what you are doing before you do it.

If you have done nothing wrong, you should have nothing to fear. The list above has not led this black driver astray yet.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/05/no-bernie-sanders-police-are-not-out-to-get-black-people/,2019-11-05
Why The Left Loves Ta-Nehisi Coates,"Ta-Nehisi Coates’ new novel, “The Water Dancer,” has topped The New York Times bestseller list. I can’t remember ever seeing so much fanfare for a literary novel, particularly a debut one. Coates has been on all the talk shows, including a special edition of Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club. Now, that’s access.

Of course, Coates had to pay his dues first as a journalist. He started off in 1998 writing occasional articles for the Washington Post on hip-hop. In 2008, Coates began writing for The Atlantic, and rode the black Bourgeois Obama wave to professional stardom.

Coates’ success has been a hot topic among black intellectuals. Coates has expressed shock that white people are so interested in his work, since this was not his intent. But regardless of intent, affluent white liberals have become Coates’ most important audience and fan base. White liberals turn to Coates when they want to understand “the black experience.”

Coates’ rise to fame has many factors. His most famous article and first cover story for The Atlantic, “The Case for Reparations,” is a perfect example of making the most of opportunities presented. Coates is an eloquent and experienced writer, with a strong and passionate point-of-view. But there is more to this story.

Blacks in the American Two-Party System

The United States has a two-party system. Each party has a political coalition with disparate interest groups to form a majority governing coalition. In his classic, “The Emerging Republican Majority,” Kevin Phillips demonstrates the surprising consistency of these interest group coalitions over centuries, even if the party in which they are seated changes.

After the Civil War, blacks allied themselves politically with the Republican Party, which at that time was the party of the Union, Abraham Lincoln, and the “Eastern Establishment.” In opposition was the Democratic Party. At the heart of this coalition were white Southerners and white ethnic Northerners, particularly Catholics. While there has been fluctuation over time, and interest groups have changed parties, these same political coalitions more or less remain in the 21st century.

In today’s Democratic Party, blacks play a role as “junior partners” to the Eastern Establishment. Their primary duty is to vote for Democrats. In contrast, the Eastern Establishment is responsible for the financing, the “big ideas,” policy-making, foreign and domestic, and for constructing the “intellectual models” on which the Democratic Party’s ideology and policy are based. Within this large domain of responsibilities, a small section is set aside for black intellectuals and politicos to discuss “race matters.”

Many white Americans wonder why black pundits and intellectuals seem to always talk about “racism.” No doubt racial bigotry is real, and perhaps these folks have a bit of a morbid obsession, but it also arises from the role that they are pressed into playing by the Eastern Establishment. Many black intellectuals would like to be involved in creating the “big ideas,” policy objectives, and intellectual models, but there is strong pressure from the Eastern Establishment for black intellectuals to stick to their lane: “race matters.”

Moreover, the manner in which black intellectuals discuss “race matters” must be consistent with the intellectual model that the Eastern Establishment creates. They must not stray from the de facto ideology. This is easily enforced, because the Eastern Establishment has substantial control over the life chances of black intellectuals and pundits. They largely decide who will be funded and promoted, whether they will be published and where, whether they will be celebrated and given awards, and whether they will be on television.

Coates is very much a product of this system, and has thrived in it, to his credit. One can view Coates’ success from different perspectives, but I will spend the remainder of this essay looking at Coates’ work from the point-of-view of the function it serves in “The Great White Culture War.”

Coates at his heart is a “cultural warrior.” He has in part earned his literary status by demonstrating that he is more useful to the Eastern Establishment’s side of the The Great White Culture War than any black intellectual of his generation. In fact, if you look at the black intellectuals being promoted today by the Eastern Establishment, they are generally battle-hardened cultural warriors.

Black Intellectuals’ Role in ‘The Great White Culture War’

Pat Buchanan’s “culture war” speech at the 1992 Republican Convention was divisive, but prophetic. The Cold War with the Soviet Union had come to an end, but a domestic Cold War within the United States, a “cultural war,” was on the rise. Today, that “Great White Culture War” is ripping the American republic apart.

This culture war exists within white America. There is no culture war in black America. There are not violent debates about immigration, abortion, feminism, or LGBTQ rights tearing black America apart. These are peripheral political concerns for the black demos. Yet intellectuals and pundits of color are able to make careers out of fighting on one side or the other of this Great White Culture War as “mercenary soldiers,” or sometimes a more important role.

Black intellectuals and activists serve two basic functions on the left side of the Great White Culture War. One, they are tasked with “exposing” the “logical contradictions,” “moral hypocrisy,” and hidden “violence” and “domination” that underlies traditional Anglo-Protestant culture, thus discrediting it. It’s a task to which they are extremely well-suited.

Second, they are the “keepers of the legacy” of Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights movement, and the tremendous moral authority that movement carries. Consequently, they can “loan out” the moral authority of the civil rights movement to contemporary left-leaning political movements, which are aiming to gain political legitimacy.

The problem is that these roles that black intellectuals play in the Great White Culture War tend to undermine each other. This is particularly clear with the LGBTQ movement. Let me explain.

From the ‘Protestant Ethic’ to ‘Post-Structuralism’

Both the abolitionist movement of the 19th century and the civil rights movement of the 20th century were rooted in what might be called the “Protestant ethic.” King’s April 1963 “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” meant as an appeal to white Christian ministers across denominations, gives one a sense of the moral consensus of the day.

Ultimately, these movements were ideologically based in an American version of the Pauline doctrine of human equality: blacks and whites are equal, because they can both become Christians, and thus achieve eternal salvation. It is important to note that political movements for racial equality have only been successful in this country when rooted in some such Christian ideology and theology.

Political movements for racial equality have only been successful in this country when rooted in some such Christian ideology and theology.

The success of the black revolution that MLK led spawned many imitators. Notably, that includes the sexual revolution, which gave rise to two political movements, which are pillars of today’s cultural left: “third wave feminism” and “gay liberation,” today called LGBTQ. These movements sought to imitate the success and draw moral authority from the historical example of the civil rights movement. They adopted its language as much as possible.

But they wholly rejected the ideological basis for MLK’s movement, the Protestant ethic. In fact, these movements saw Christianity as “the enemy,” as one of the central institutions that had caused their historic “oppression.” Consequently, they looked for a new philosophical model, and they found it in Paris, France. It has many names, but we will call it “post-structuralism,” and its most important exponent was the late Michel Foucault.

After World War II, what might be called “structuralism” dominated Parisian intellectual life, a school of thought rooted in the idea that human phenomena can and must be understood with respect to a well-defined and permanent “structure” that underlies human life and society. The most fashionable school of structuralism was Marxism. Alexandre Kojeve and Jean Paul Sartre reigned supreme.

Note that “structuralism” is an attempt to provide a model of human life and society without referencing any fixed concept of “human nature.” In fact, Karl Marx denied the existence of a permanent “human nature,” but instead teaches that what we call “human nature” has in fact been historically constructed by “human work” over time.

Structuralism is an attempt to provide a model of human life and society without referencing any fixed concept of human nature.

Foucault was of a younger generation, and while he initially was a dedicated Maoist, he eventually turned to a new radical intellectual pose in the form of what we are calling “post-structuralism.” He maintained his disdain for French “bourgeois” norms, but instead of advocating for proletarian revolution, his attacks turned to French bourgeois morality and ethics, utilizing a clever critique of French institutions to discredit them.

Influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, he developed an historical or “archaeological” method, conducting a series of “studies” on a variety of topics: madness, the medical profession, the prison system, the human sciences, and human sexuality.

Like Marx, Foucault teaches that human nature is historically constructed, but he turns the discussion in a different direction. He looks at how “men of science” have historically constructed the “concept of human nature” over time. He sees a “will to power” within the scientific project to impose the concept of a fixed “human nature” on society, historically enforcing its intellectual model through the “violence” and “domination” of society’s powerful institutions.

One of Foucault’s main themes is debunking the notion that modern bourgeois French society has made moral or ethical “progress” in its practices and institutions. For Foucault, we may perceive our institutions and practices to have become more humane over time, but we are in fact simply blind to the hidden “violence” and “domination” within them. We have not made moral or ethical progress. We are just better at hiding the “violence” and “domination” from public view and public consciousness.

What’s Wrong with Foucault

No doubt, Foucault has some interesting ideas. But as Noam Chomsky notes, the problem with Foucault’s work is that he “throws the baby out with the bath water.” Just because there are logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and even outright bigotry in institutions does not in itself discredit these institutions, nor their overall doctrine, methods, and mission. It doesn’t take away from the overall benefits they have brought to human society. Internal reforms simply need to be made.

Chomsky gives the example of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Most scientists are men. Some in the scientific profession have acted in bigotry towards women. And power dynamics do play an important role in determining which scientific projects are pursued. But this in no way discredits MIT or other major scientific institutions as pillars of our material progress and prosperity, not to mention our physical health and national defense. It in no way discredits the “scientific method.” Internal reforms simply need to be made.

Just because there are logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and even outright bigotry in institutions does not in itself discredit these institutions.

Today’s LGBTQ movement’s critique of American Christianity, which takes its inspiration from Foucault, is similarly bankrupt. While it is undeniable that Christian institutions, doctrine, and methods have historically been wrought with logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and outright bigotry, this in no way discredits their important role in the progress of our society. It in no way discredits their important role in the progress of humanity. Internal reforms simply need to be made.

The post-structuralist model is the current fashion of the intellectuals of the American Eastern Establishment today. Consequently, if a black intellectual wants to get ahead, he must adopt it in some fashion, consciously or unconsciously. He must interpret the civil rights and abolitionist movements through a post-structuralist lens, so that their moral authority may be seamlessly leant to other “liberation movements,” like the LGBTQ movement, which uses this model. This is the price of entry to the black intellectual elite.

This is a steep price. The moral authority of both the abolitionist and civil rights movements rests in the American Protestant ethic, and the Pauline doctrine of human equality. To reinterpret these movements and ground them instead in some kind of post-structuralist ideology undermines their moral credibility—especially since this ideology is hostile to the American Protestant ethic.

Here we see the special value of Coates to the left-side of The Great White Culture War. For Coates, Anglo-American civilization is entirely discredited because of African chattel slavery. This is nothing new or original.

But what Coates also contributes is his doctrine that African-American Christianity is also entirely discredited because of its central role in African chattel slavery. This puts his work wholly in line with the cultural left. No other preeminent contemporary black intellectual has so strongly dissociated American Christianity from the successful acquisition of equal rights for black Americans. This is why Coates is a perfect black cultural warrior for the Eastern Establishment.

How One Man Refuses To Be Defined By A Racial Identity,"There is a saying from Roman antiquity: Nihil humanum a me alienum puto. “I am human and I consider nothing human alien to me.” I confess this swaggering pronouncement (by the Roman poet Terence) has always left me feeling a touch ambivalent.

For starters, there is a great deal about the human condition that, upon reflection, is quite alienating. Ignorance, solipsism, envy, cruelty, capriciousness, bigotry, vulgarity, idiocy, superstition, provincialism, and cowardice, to name a few. Not a very agreeable list, but then man is the only animal that blushes, or needs to.

Nonetheless, there is surely something to credit in the idea of the unity of human experience, and in the solidarity of human belonging. For better or worse, the concept of human nature is not infinitely plastic, and to a remarkable degree, members of our species are the same everywhere. This insight is powerful ballast against the eternal promptings of race and tribe. As Thomas Chatterton Williams points out in his learned and candid memoir, Self-Portrait in Black and White: Unlearning Race, Terence did not proclaim, as he might have, “I am Roman, therefore nothing Roman is alien to me.”

It would be quite impossible to reconcile Terence’s imperishable (if not pristine) insight with any form of racism, which we may define ab initio as the belief that there are human races. This capacious Roman notion of humanity will not be pressed into the service of chauvinists who are accustomed to thinking with their epidermis, and denying that human beings share a common nature.

It is also a salutary reminder that the very idea of distinct human races is old but not ancient. One need not visit the Swedish history museum in Stockholm to discover that the roots of racism can be traced to the 1735 publication of Systema Naturae by the naturalist Carl Linnaeus.

Williams opens Self-Portrait in Black and White with the understanding that our modern concept of race was erected on this shabby scaffolding. He is well-positioned to grasp what basic biological reality and genome studies have taught us, namely that using distinct races as a means of categorizing the species Homo Sapiens is empirically insupportable, in addition to being philosophically primitive.

The son of a “black” father and a “white” mother, Williams grew up earnestly believing in the old American rule that a single drop of “black blood” makes a person—in this case himself—“black.” Instructed by his parents that there’s no such thing as “half-white” in a world where “black” is a social construct, and a salient one at that, Williams asserted his “blackness.”

Self-Portrait

This identity would not prove a lasting one. After moving to Paris with his French wife, Williams greeted the birth of his conspicuously white-looking daughter, Marlow, with the shock of recognition that “whatever personal identity I had previously inhabited, I had now crossed into something new and different.” Against America’s conception of the fixedness of race, he decided that Marlow’s blond hair and “inky-blue irises” offered irrefutable evidence “of the fluidity of racial borders.” From then onward, this rupture of identity leaves Williams determined to bow out of “the all-American skin game that demands you select a box and define yourself by it.”

Separated into three accessible chapters, Self-Portrait in Black and White is a carefully argued and elegantly written plea for the colossal chore of “unlearning race.” It is an engaging and incisive meditation on the author’s “confrontation with the fiction of race”—a fiction that (you may have noticed) still holds many in its thrall.

The subtext of much of today’s mainstream discourse on the subject is that America’s racial composition is essentially binary. If this weren’t so, the implied hierarchy of racial identities that fuel heated arguments about affirmative action or reparations would be drained of much of their energy and coherence.

Williams refuses to abide the “narcissism of the small difference” that sustains this flawed and backward way of thinking, which he contends is simultaneously too exacting about the color line and, somehow, not exacting enough. For what kind of mental framework allows the author and other mixed-race people to be “laughed at scathingly” for identifying as black one day, and berated for rejecting the same identity the next? What is race, Williams is compelled to ask, “if a man, at various stages, can be either “black” or “white”?” It’s a good question, and one not easily evaded by anyone who participates in this corrupt and corrupting kabuki play.

The problem of racial difference in America—and abroad, where racial categories can vary dramatically from those in these United States—“is always presented as an economic, political, biological, or cultural problem,” observes Williams. “But I want to say that it’s at least as much a philosophical and imaginative disaster.”

After exposing and combating the sheer absurdity of racial categorization and its related “mechanisms of conformity and control,” Williams’s conclusion is deceptively simple: for people “of all skin tones and hair textures” to “turn away from the racial delusion” that has so brutalized, impoverished, and embittered the human experience. What amounts to an accident of birth, after all, is a poor grounds for identity, allegiance, or meaning. It is, in other words, a grave mistake to believe that identity is only inherited when it can and must also be forged.

The author makes clear that he is not renouncing his “blackness” so much as “rejecting the legitimacy of the entire racial construct in which blackness functions as one orienting pole.” Understanding that human variation is gradual rather than discrete, Williams is loath to make too much of it. (He does not wade into the thorny subject of race as a pragmatic construct based on real variation corresponding to shared ancestry that allows some useful, if basic, inferences to be drawn.)

He suggests that most so-called “black” people “do not feel at liberty to simply turn off or ignore their allotted racial designation, whether they would like to or not. But that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t” (original emphasis).

Imaginary Flowers

This declaration of abstention will repel the identitarians in our midst, who insist that difference is here to be reinforced rather than transcended. But, if emulated, will such a declaration leave anyone shorn of hope or empowerment? Not in the least. The alternative to thinking, or feeling, in black and white is to unblinkingly face the facts of existence, and take hold of “the beautiful truth, in all its terrifying complexity, that we all contain multitudes.”

By this point, I was put in mind of what Karl Marx wrote (in his Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right) about religion being the opium of the people. This frequently misunderstood argument is pregnant with implications for our preoccupation with race as an overriding form of identity and means of uplift. It deserves to be quoted at length.

Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of the heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people. The demand to give up the illusions about its conditions is the demand to give up a condition that needs illusions. Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers from the chain not so that men will wear the chain without any fantasy or consolation but so that they will break the chain and cull the living flower.

The “imaginary flowers” adorning the chain of race (to leave the matter of religion aside) can be understood as the defensive retreat into tribal identities. Identity politics defined by race is an understandable emotional response to persistent prejudice, but it is also an intellectual and political cul de sac that cannot supply a common ground on which all citizens can stand together.

The indisputable fact is that, while inequities based on past and present oppression and bigotry persist, race has never been less of a barrier to personal advancement. This is no reason to diminish our fervor for fairness, or to lose sight of the real and intolerable obstacles that stand in the way of full equality. But it is a compelling reason to seek the overthrow of those obstacles from within the system that has brought us this far.

In a particularly affecting passage, Williams confesses that leaving behind his racial identity could be construed as a betrayal of his (“black”) ancestors, who suffered grievously on account of it. This is precisely how Williams’s labor will be perceived and portrayed by a legion of detractors and social justice advocates who count themselves proud members of “his” race. In conversation with an acquaintance of similar disposition, Adrian Piper, he confesses his abiding anxiety that his daughter might grow up unafflicted by guilt for her “people’s” past evils. (Would this indifference, he seems to wonder, constitute a “white” lie?)

“Why would you want that in the first place?” she replies matter-of-factly. “If the pain and the guilt isn’t there, why introduce it?” Williams had never encountered such a frontal challenge to this pious and plaintive premise of allegiance to the past. He found her objection surprisingly difficult to counter.

“It seemed of a piece with something Richard Wright once stated: Every hour that a man is fighting for his freedom is an hour that he is not free,” he writes. This spurs the thought that perhaps the most glorious triumph over racism is not ferocious anti-racist campaigning, so much as instinctive and steadfast autonomy from the entire concept.

Abjuring a posture of either submission or resistance to such a pernicious and ridiculous dogma, this spirit of independence charts its own course and aspires to be master of its own fate. It takes for granted the “ancient right” that, in Kipling’s words, gently but firmly insists on “leave to live by no man’s leave.” Did the vast historical injustice endured by his people not justify—nay, did it not demand—such a life? To ask the same question in a different way: Was it not a shame, after so much horrendous suffering, for a life to be lived not wholly free, still encumbered by the backwardness of racism and reeling from the weight of history?

The Value of Authenticity

It is impossible to forget that we still live in the prehistory of the human race, but it has nonetheless been thoroughly depressing—shocking, even—to behold how resilient the old claims about racial difference have proven in a time when most of us hoped that any such claims might have lost their grubby power. Terence’s emphasis on the universal rather than the particular has acquired a bad odor in America’s governing class since the conscription of “identity politics” by the political right. “No aliens are human,” to reprise an old jab against the Immigration and Naturalization Service, seems to be the de facto slogan of the current administration and, by extension, the party and nation for whom it is the standard-bearer.

There was a period, before the advent of Trump, when identity politics was widely thought to be a property of the “left,” and perhaps the neo-Marxist left, at that. This is plainly no longer so, if it ever was. The bulk of the right is, by outward appearance, nurturing a new nationalism, expressly opposed to the liberal principles of the founding in favor of a nationhood rooted in culture and religion. As such, it is no longer interested in being—or even pretending to be—a foil to the tribal impulses of the left, but rather bids fair to be an incubator of its own.

This illiberal nationalist movement has entrenched the salient and shameful habit of American society to deliberately flinch from the unconscionable fact of involuntary servitude that so long disfigured this republic. That the Confederate banner and other symbols of the Slave Power became an early flashpoint in the Trump-era culture war came as no surprise to anyone.

Meanwhile, there’s no question that, with progressives tirelessly cultivating subgroup grievances in accord with critical race theory, and “consciousness” on the basis of these affiliations, the left is continuing its long march into the morass of identity politics. A recent book in this genre, Ibram X. Kendi’s How to be an Anti-Racist, argues for a more capacious definition of bigotry that acknowledges “capitalism is essentially racist.”

It has apparently decided that essentialism—the idea that the most salient thing about a person is his or her race—neither can be nor should be transcended. Since these confining categories are widely understood to be mere “reflections” of our demographic identity, it is increasingly believed that individuals are not only products but also prisoners of them.

The Democratic primaries of this year have put on stark display that the party of Jefferson and Jackson—or rather, since those once-venerable names have become irretrievably tarnished in progressive eyes, let’s say the party formerly belonging to those racist figures—is in the grips of what Mark Lilla, no conservative, has dubbed “a kind of moral panic about racial, gender, and sexual identity.” Bizarrely, in the New York Times’ “1619 Project,” the left’s flagship publication even pronounced our democracy’s ideals to be “false when they were written.”

The time when the concept of a fixed and universal human nature, as well as the majestic-if-fallen human condition, was still regnant in American political life appears to have ended. Within a brief passage of time we have traveled a great distance, all sail and no anchor, away from the original premises and purposes of the American experiment. Instead of appreciating the complex nature of identity as a multiple and plural phenomenon, more chosen than inherited, the reigning ideology of the day presses individuals into members of a tribe. This flattening of the individual self points to the atomization of society into a hierarchy of warring identity and interest groups.

It’s considered the height of enlightened thinking to deny the unassailable truth that progress has been made on the race question in the United States, as if the dogs, firehoses, and billy clubs of white supremacy still reign in this land. This ideology of anti-racism (as opposed to hostility to racism) has become what John McWhorter calls a “secular religion,” in which whites acknowledge that they possess “white privilege” (akin to acknowledging one’s fundamental sinfulness as a Christian). Any dissent from this dogma is regarded as blasphemy against the one true faith, and must be punished accordingly.

It is against this bleak background that one begins to appreciate the subtlety and audacity of Williams’s enterprise. Without that background, his project looks very much like common sense. As virulent and discrepant forms of identity politics gain broad purchase, Williams rebuffs the perverse effort to racialize, and therefore politicize, every realm of human existence. The only way to do right by the worth and dignity of the human personality is to preserve some sense of a brotherhood under the skin, just as Terence exemplified.

In the midst of the balkanizing tendency to chisel away at the keystone in the arch of the American creed—e pluribus unum, “out of many, one”—Williams insists on keeping it firmly in place. Instead of indulging the false comfort of narrow identity and allegiance, he takes refuge in what Lincoln called “the whole great family of man.” It is that refuge which nurtured, and still nurtures, America’s incomplete but immense progress relating to race—progress on which the viability of liberal civilization depends.

In Against Identity, Leon Wieseltier declared that, “Only one in possession of an identity would understand why one would wish to be rid of it.” Williams has had ample opportunity to absorb the force and weight of that curse for himself and, having done so, intends to “retire from race” for good. This mental and moral achievement is made possible by the judgment—deceptively simple but unfailingly agonizing—that the principle of freedom is of the essence of a life well-lived.

Whatever the value of today’s sought-after “authenticity” in the eyes of others—and the value it confers is appallingly high—it is never worth the tradeoff of being false to oneself. Standing athwart the color line, Williams is adamantly resolved to live and act as if he were free, and in so doing furnishes us all with an example of emancipation to be admired and emulated.

Intercept: Buttigieg Falsely Claimed Endorsements From Black SC Leaders,"On October 24, Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg released an op-ed claiming more than 400 South Carolinians have endorsed his “Douglass Plan for Black America.” It turns out that the three black politicians listed at the top of his press release never endorsed the plan and 40 percent of the endorsement names listed are of white people.

According to The Intercept, Buttigieg sent out a press release with the op-ed, citing three prominent South Carolinians including: Columbia City Councilwoman Tameika Devine, Baptist pastor and state Rep. Ivory Thigpen, and Johnnie Cordero, chair of the South Carolina Black Caucus.

“There is one presidential candidate who has proven to have intentional policies designed to make a difference in the Black experience, and that’s Pete Buttigieg. We are over 400 South Carolinians, including business owners, pastors, community leaders, and students. Together, we endorse his Douglass Plan for Black America, the most comprehensive roadmap for tackling systemic racism offered by a 2020 presidential candidate,” the press release read.

But The Intercept found none of these politicians endorsed Buttigieg or his plan, which includes financial reparations for slavery more than a century after the fact and decriminalizing drugs.

Devine told The Intercept she has yet to endorse a presidential candidate and did not intend her support of Buttigieg’s plan to be read as an endorsement for his candidacy at large.

“Clearly from the number of calls I received about my endorsement, I think the way they put it out there wasn’t clear, that it was an endorsement of the plan, and that may have been intentionally vague. I’m political, I know how that works,” Devine said.

Thigpen says he told the Buttigieg campaign he was a strong Bernie Sanders supporter and was not interested in endorsing Buttigieg or the Douglass plan.

“How it was rolled out was not an accurate representation of where I stand. I didn’t know about its rolling out. Somebody brought it to my attention, and it was alarming to me, because even though I had had conversations with the campaign, it was clear to me, or at least I thought I made it clear to them, that I was a strong Bernie Sanders supporter — actually co-chair of the state, and I was not seeking to endorse their candidate or the plan,” Thigpen told The Intercept.

Johnnie Cordero, the third politician listed in the press release, is no longer listed as a supporter. Cordero told The Intercept he never endorsed the plan or Buttigieg.

These politicians were listed as supporters because Buttigieg’s campaign sent out an email telling politicians they needed to opt out if they did not want their name on the endorsement list. Thus people’s names ended up on the endorsement list, even if they had never explicitly endorsed Buttigieg or his plan.

The email sent out to prominent South Carolinian politicians reads as follows:

Good afternoon — Thank you for your willingness to publicly support Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s Douglass Plan, the boldest plan in the 2020 candidate field to combat the effects of systemic racism and make comprehensive investments in Black communities. Below is an op-ed that will run in the Carolina Panorama this week announcing the support of over 400 Black South Carolinians for the plan. Given that you have signed on as an endorser, you will be included in the list of endorsements attached to the opinion piece. If you do not want your name included, please let us know by 4pm ET today.

Not only did Buttigieg’s campaign mess up the endorsement, they also used stock photos of Kenyans in their promotional material for the Douglass plan.

Buttigieg’s campaign has yet to make a statement on the false endorsements and stock photos. The mainstream media is currently far more focused on Buttigieg’s first place numbers in Iowa.

The media has also ignored other potential scandals in Buttigieg’s political history, including his firing of South Bend’s first black police chief and his curiously missing campaign records.

The Buttigieg campaign responded with the following message:

Our campaign is working to build a multi-racial coalition, and we sought and received input from numerous Black policy experts and advisers to create a comprehensive plan to dismantle systemic racism: the Douglass Plan. We asked a number of Black South Carolinians, as well as South Carolinians from many backgrounds, to support the Douglass Plan, and we are proud and grateful that hundreds agreed to do so. In the HBCU Times op-ed and in communications with the press, we’ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication. We never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan. After they indicated their support, we reached out to people multiple times giving them the opportunity to review the language of the op-ed and the option to opt-out. We did hear from people who weren’t comfortable being listed and we removed them.

Pete will continue to talk about the Douglass Plan wherever he goes, regardless of the audience, as there are many communities of Americans committed to eradicating racial inequity.

Black Voters Take Issue With Elizabeth Warren’s Plan To Eradicate Charter Schools,"2020 Democratic hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts hosted a rally at a historically black college hoping to talk directly with black Atlanta voters. Her rally was disrupted by none other than, black voters who take issue with her plans to eradicate charter schools.

According to ABC News, Warren spoke only a few words before the school choice organization Powerful Parent Network interrupted her in coordinated protest. The protestors stopped Warren’s speech for approximately 10 minutes.

“Our voice, our choice,” the protestors chanted.

At the event, Warren was attempting to connect with black voters. During her speech she stood under a banner that read, “value the work of black women.” She also hired a DJ to play Drake and DMX songs, and had Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., the first black Massachusetts Congresswoman, pumping up Warren and the crowd.

“I’m here to make a commitment. When I am president of the United States, the lessons of black history will not be lost. Those lessons will live in every part of my presidency,” Warren said. “As a white woman, I will never fully understand the discrimination, pain and harm that black Americans have experienced just because of the color of their skin.”

Warren continued by insisting the government create a reparations plan for black Americans.

But, Warren’s plans to get rid of charter schools may be a big reason for her inability to build a coalition of black voters in key swing states like Georgia and South Carolina.

A poll commissioned by Democrats For Education Reform found white Democrats oppose charter schools, while black and Hispanic Democrats are in favor of charter schools. The goal of many charter schools is to close the disparity in education between minorities and non-minorities.

This is a perfect example of Warren pandering to black communities in order to earn votes, but not actually creating policies that reflect the intersectional desires of black people in America.

Sarah Carpenter, the leader of Powerful Parent Network, told ABC that Warren needs to talk to black voters before crafting policy to eradicate charter schools.

“I told [Warren], you gotta talk to real people on the ground,” Carpenter said. “It felt like she attacks our children’s choice, charter schools.”

Why Trump’s Gains With Black Voters Could Swing The 2020 Election,"Will African Americans abandon the Democratic Party in 2020? Not a chance. Black voters still have deep ties to the party that finally agreed with Republicans on passing the Civil Rights Act in 1965 and continues to extol “multiculturalism” and black “identity” politics at every turn.

Every time members of the GOP appear to be coddling prejudice or failing to condemn racism against blacks, Democrats’ message that Republicans are the “enemy” of ethnic minorities resonates, dashing the GOP’s hopes of making gains with black voters. But in 2020, Donald Trump clearly has an opening with African Americans that Republicans have not seen in some time.

Despite condemning Trump publicly as a bigot, Democrats are privately worried about this. They should be. Two recent and highly reputable polls have registered an extraordinarily high “favorability” rating for Trump among black voters – about 34-35 percent, far exceeding the 8 percent of the black electorate that actually voted for Trump in 2016. That’s a huge jump from the 9 percent favorability rating among African Americans he earned in 2018 and the 13 percent he achieved earlier this year.

Of course, a 35 percent favorability rating may not translate into 35 percent support in the 2020 election, but it doesn’t have to. Even a substantial gain to double-digit support could provide the margin of difference in key swing states, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, sealing Trump’s reelection.

Trump’s 8 percent of the black vote in 2016 was a notable improvement over Mitt Romney’s 6 percent in 2012 and John McCain’s 4 percent in 2008. But it’s a far cry from where Republicans once stood with African Americans nationally or at the state level, where a GOP candidate sometimes earns 25 percent or more of the black vote.

Historical Black Support for Republicans

The last time a Republican presidential candidate achieved double-digit support from black voters came in the Nixon-Ford years (1968-1976). President Richard Nixon, much like Trump, saw appealing to black voters as critical to his election hopes.

With ultra-conservative George Wallace fanning the segregationism flames on his right, and Democrats calling for an expansion of welfare on his left, Nixon tried to appeal to moderates in both parties and among whites and blacks alike with a message of support for black economic aspirations and social mobility coupled with support for police and “law and order” in the face of riots and other forms of urban violence.

That crossover message didn’t give Nixon majority black support. But it did give him 16 percent of the black vote in 1972, which was unprecedented in the modern era. No Republican — except Jerry Ford in his losing bid to Jimmy Carter in 1976 — has ever come close to achieving that level of support after African Americans switched their support from Abraham Lincoln’s new, antislavery Republican Party to eventually supporting Democrats in the next century. Indeed, modern Republicans since Nixon and Ford have not even done much to try — until Trump, that is.

Trump Has Cultivated Support from Black Voters

Trump’s overtures to the black community have been steady and consistent. Some, such as his support for criminal justice reform, have received considerable publicity. No previous president, Republican or Democrat, has managed to build a bipartisan coalition for reducing the disparities in sentencing for blacks accused of drug dealing and other relatively minor nonviolent crimes.

But Trump did by making the issue a top policy priority and by expending political capital to woo support. Even longtime critics such as Van Jones, who served in the Obama administration, praised Trump’s efforts, much to the chagrin of his fellow Democrats.

Trump has also cultivated public acclaim from popular black celebrities such as Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. (Nixon did much the same with Sammy Davis Jr., who campaigned tirelessly for him). West and Kardashian have nearly unrestricted access to the Oval Office to consult with Trump on racial issues, and they’ve returned the favor by lauding the president and his policies. When Kardashian appealed to Trump in 2018 to grant clemency to an imprisoned 63-year-old black grandmother, Trump met with Kardashian at the White House and promptly commuted the woman’s sentence.

Behind the scenes, Trump has made other unprecedented gestures that also carry real substance. For example, in 2018, the White House moved to designate a number of historic sites with special importance to African Americans as “national monuments.” One of these is the home of Medgar Evers, the NAACP field secretary and civil rights leader gunned down by white supremacists in 1963. Corey Wiggins, executive director of the NAACP’s Mississippi chapter, praised Trump’s decision.

Trump has also designated Camp Nelson, long considered a landmark commemorating the contributions of black soldiers to the Civil War, as a national monument.

Will Black Voters Swing the 2020 Election for Trump?

None of these gestures might matter much if African Americans weren’t also gaining in the Trump economy. The numbers speak volumes. According to a report by the liberal Brookings Institution, the five metropolitan areas with the largest black populations — New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and Washington, D.C. — have seen black median household incomes increase substantially, from rates of 7 percent in Washington, D.C., to a whopping 21 percent in Atlanta.

The reason? An unprecedented number of African Americans have secured new jobs. In San Francisco alone, black employment levels have risen by 13 percent, higher than increases for any other racial group.

How much support can Trump actually gain in 2020? It’s not clear. But it’s important to note African American men are far more likely than women to gravitate toward Trump. Past voting numbers bear this out. In 2016, Trump earned 11 percent support from African American men compared to just 4 percent from women. African American women seem to retain a deep underlying hostility toward Republicans generally, and white male Republicans like Trump especially. That may not change.

Still, just a modest swing of African Americans toward Trump in 2020 could prove decisive. Even in 2016, the failure of black Americans to show up in the same numbers as they did for Barack Obama the previous two cycles helped tilt the election in key Rust Belt states. Trump’s ability to win even 15 percent black male support in states like Pennsylvania might provide him the margin he needs, even offsetting some expected losses from suburban women.

Yet with Democrats poised to mobilize their black support like never before, Trump cannot afford to rest on his laurels. The party has already begun spending heavily on a positive GOP message to black voters in 10 key states for 2020. Trump would be wise not only to tout his successes thus far but to announce additional initiatives to demonstrate that his commitment to black aspirations is real and ongoing — and that African Americans can expect even more from him during his second term.

If Trump wins in 2020 with expanded black support – as well as Hispanic support, which also appears to be rising – it won’t just be a personal victory. It could signal the beginning of a new era in national politics, in which Democrats can no longer count on ethnic minorities operating in political and ideological lockstep.

How Trump Can Triple His Support Among Black Voters In 2020,"In 2016, Donald Trump received a slightly higher share of the black vote than did Mitt Romney in 2012 or John McCain in 2008. But he still received just 8 percent.

Now black support for Trump is in the mid-30s. While a 30 percent approval rating doesn’t necessarily translate into a 30 percent vote-share from black Americans in 2020, 30 percent approval is significant. Even if black support for Trump were in the mid-teens on election day, that could swing states like Michigan, Florida, and even Minnesota solidly into Trump’s camp.

Some of this increased black support is due to a historically low unemployment rate for black Americans, along with hefty income gains for many black Americans, as working-class and blue-collar wages finally begin to outpace managerial wages. Another reason is surely Trump’s criminal justice reform efforts.

Other issues include school choice, which blacks resoundingly support — and likely propelled Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to victory in 2018, because a group of black mothers swung in his favor.

The Disconnect Between Black America and Democrats

There’s a tremendous chasm between the black American working class and the Democratic Party. On issues such as education and abortion, huge polling gaps emerge between Democratic whites and blacks. Even among Democrats who are politically active, one-third of black Democratic primary voters say abortion should be illegal all the time, compared to only 3 percent of white Democratic primary voters.

On economics too, better-off white liberals have little in common with the priorities of many black voters. Most black voters would rather talk about wages, social mobility, and fairness, in stark contrast to those who obsess over pronouns and climate change. And when many Democrats talk economics, they talk about student debt bailouts, which would disproportionately benefit the relatively better-off.

Stating the obvious, a coalition that includes white, left-wing college graduates on one hand — who insanely compare LGBT issues to being black in the South during Jim Crow — and socially conservative, black Christians on the other, is irrational and absurd. Black America suffers terribly when transgender rights are considered the new civil rights, abortion is treated as a sacrament, and gender fluidity is assumed to be more important than jobs and economic mobility.

Overall, only a fifth of black voters (and less than a quarter of Latino voters) describe themselves as very liberal. Half of black American voters say they are moderate or conservative. In the words of one author, “[T]he Democrats have shed working class whites, but black voters, once a tilting force, are becoming the new working-class whites, frustratingly more conservative and less radical than the Left would like.”

Given this, it isn’t good enough for Trump to get 15 percent or even 25 percent of the black vote. He should aim for at least one-third of the black vote in 2020. With such a feat, American politics could truly become post-racial, as both parties would actually compete for black votes. Black America, and all of America, would benefit tremendously.

Why Many Black Americans Approve of Trump

Deeper factors are at play in Trump’s growing black support, beyond a checklist of issues a Republican political consultant would cook up.

Much of Trump’s rising support among black America is due to Trump’s unconventional but foundational conservatism. Trump won by touting the American working class, nationalism, and cultural conservatism. Given that many black Americans are working class, culturally conservative, love their country, and wish to see a politically and economically post-racial America, it makes sense that this foundational platform would jive with working-class voters, white or black.

But black America won’t come over to the GOP unless the conservative party directly addresses issues affecting black communities. We can talk about the minimum wage’s harmful effects on many young black males’ first-job prospects, but that doesn’t address the main problem: After rapid deindustrialization, many men are facing a lack of working-class jobs.

Blacks left the Republican Party mostly during the Great Depression because President Franklin Roosevelt focused on working-class issues and spoke directly to the common man and woman. Any effort to bring black Americans back to the GOP must involve doubling down on Trump’s working-class focus. Trump can accomplish this huge task of bringing black Americans back into the Republican Party in 2020 by running on a “Contract with Black America,” which has three points: the cessation of black pain, black economic equality, and American families first.

The Cessation of Black Pain

Borrowing from Adrian Norman, this point has a rhetorical element. Trump must go into black communities, talk, and listen. He must acknowledge that blacks have received an unfair deal in America for too long, but point out that Democrats’ efforts are only making things worse.

First, black Americans have been shortchanged on the public services government is supposed to provide. Too many poor black kids are assigned to bad schools, and too many young black men have been incarcerated. Here Trump should find ways to get states to mirror his federal criminal justice reform efforts.

On education, Trump should start with an overhaul of the federal Title I funding formula, which hugely affects urban schools. States and localities that don’t stand in the way of charter schools should be awarded. On the campaign trail, Trump should slam local politicians who are blocking charters and school choice.

Public schools in urban areas must be made better too. To get better teachers in urban public schools, the formula should give more federal money to states that release school districts from union-demanded pay scales that punish top teachers. This would set local districts free to explicitly pay more to smart people who have better job options, especially in the math, science, and special education fields, which are all hurt by socializing teacher pay scales.

Title I dollars should also be used to incentivize states to end the accrediting cartel. States should recognize teacher credentialing from private accreditation organizations as equivalent in worth to state credentials, and offer certification reciprocity with other states. Teacher credentialing is a major cash cow for state universities, but it saddles future teachers with debt, while doing little to serve children. The accreditation racket particularly harms poor black children, for it keeps good teachers out of urban classrooms.

Next, go after bastions of elite privilege. Endowments of major colleges that are above a certain dollar-level should be taxed further. Harvard and Yale come to mind. The proceeds should fund post-high school apprenticeships, scholarships for America’s underprivileged youth to attend technical schools, and science and math scholarships at the nation’s historically black colleges.

Apprenticeships and technical schools could replace a costly college education for some. These scholarships wouldn’t be based on race, but solely on income and class. Perversely, black Americans can be left behind by affirmative action programs, which too often go to better-off “minorities” who don’t need the help.

While liberals obsess about climate change, actual communities where black Americans live have been neglected. Local environmentalism, run by local communities, should be the focus instead. This includes trash cleanup and policies to reduce homelessness and open violation of the law. And infrastructure in these areas is a must — not a shiny new government building, but infrastructure that brings more working-class jobs into an area.

Next, the president must stress shared values and Americanism. Blacks deserve their slice of the American pie. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream of a race-blind society, which stems from America’s founding documents, won’t be realized until general economic equality exists between whites and blacks.

The future of America depends on an American identity superseding racial identity. This doesn’t mean “diversity” or achieving “color-blindness.” It means white Americans have much more in common with black Americans than with Europeans — because we are both Americans, and this country means something.

But Democrats’ efforts to create equality among Americans, primarily motived by cynical and short-term politics, have utterly failed.

Economic Equality

First, Democrats took away many black men’s jobs via the Davis-Bacon Act. In the Jim Crow South and even in the North, unions were whites-only. Black laborers would do often higher-quality construction work for less money. Davis-Bacon came along and said any project tied to federal money must pay the prevailing union wage. The law was explicitly passed on the grounds of race, due to white union complaints about black laborers taking work.

Then the Democrats packed black families into urban areas via segregated public housing. “The projects” is the popular descriptor for these liberal dreams that quickly turned into nightmares for the families that lived there. As any sociologist will tell you now, the last thing you do to poor people is pack them all tightly together in an area with little economic opportunity relative to their skills.

Next, Democrats passed a massive welfare expansion that explicitly paid dads to be out of the home. Dads, short on work, left during the week to give their kids vastly more resources. The system snowballed into the broken black families we have today.

While Republicans have been asleep at the wheel or even indifferent about these issues for decades, it was Democratic policies that wrecked black families. Up until 1950, black women had a higher marriage rate than white women. During this time, the number of black children in single-parent families was under 10 percent. Until the 1960s, despite massive racism, blacks were catching up to whites economically. Yet despite the civil rights push in the ’60s, black progress came to a standstill when Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson used federal largess to intrude upon black lives.

Black economic equality starts with undoing this toxic economic cocktail. First, Davis-Bacon should be amended to be void if unions benefiting from the law are not racially representative of the area of the country the union is in.

Further, a policy of reindustrialization should be pursued. This includes but is not limited to monetary reform, infrastructure focused on manufacturing and supply chains, and a small general tariff on foreign products to fund this infrastructure. These ideas could fit neatly into an overall agenda of Middle Class Capitalism.

Reindustrialization would help both the white and black working class, but historically black urban areas will not be revitalized until factory jobs that can provide young men a middle-class wage return to those areas. Infrastructure should focus on increasing manufacturing benefits in these urban areas.

Next, as much as possible, the federal government should pursue policies that force states and localities to change zoning laws to lessen the cost of building new housing. Affordable housing programs should focus on home ownership in distant suburbs and small towns. Such policies would bring new families to suburbs and rural areas, which tend to have less-crowded schools and better public resources.

Meanwhile, infrastructure projects should incent the creation of new industrial centers in these areas. Again, if federal money is tied to the infrastructure project, all-white unions shouldn’t be allowed to push out non-union competitors. Finally, if tax policy is to be discussed, it should be a payroll tax cut.

American Families First

Ultimately, the key to ending much black pain and advancing black economies is black fathers in the home. Statistically, one of the greatest single indicators of a child’s success is the number of fathers in the community. In other words, a father in the home increases a child’s social mobility more than the government ever could.

Yet more than half of black children today grow up without a father in the home. One culprit may be stiff penalties to marriage in the safety net, which black Americans disproportionately bear. That’s why Trump should run on legislation that would use federal dollars to incentivize states to remove these marriage penalties.

Many thinkers blame only culture, which implicitly seems to blame black people. Yet marriage penalties can reach up to a third of a family’s income — easily over $15,000 per year. While a group effect certainly exists when it comes to decisions such as cohabitation and divorce, it’s hard to argue these stark financial incentives don’t matter. That’s partly why the military, which incentivizes marriage and minimizes racial discrimination, sees a much smaller gap between black and white marriage rates compared to the country overall.

Another culprit of black family decline, and of general working-class family breakdown and fatherlessness, is stagnant male wages and a shortage of marriageable men. Aside from the efforts above, Trump should launch a program to expand technical education and apprenticeships, focused on the skilled trades and high-tech manufacturing, at the expense of federal subsidies to “liberal arts” colleges. Meanwhile, these colleges and universities should be required to have skin in the game. If they aren’t producing good results, they should be on the line for student debt.

Finally, American families first, both black and white, requires a crackdown on unfettered low-skill immigration — illegal or legal — and an end to American adventurism and nation-building overseas. It makes no sense for working-class boys and girls to toil away in Afghanistan for two decades. They are forced to defend Afghan forces who do disgusting things, and are fighting a war Washington knows we can’t win and has been lying about for years.

On the subject of immigration, the greatest victims of unfettered low-wage immigration into the United States are working-class Americans — whites, Hispanics, and blacks — who experience a constant headwind to wage gains. Democrats and many Republicans claim immigration doesn’t affect wages, but people would change their tune if we started importing lawyers, college professors, or Vox.com writers. Studies show an influx of labor to an area depresses lower-income wages, at least over the short term. What do you think a steady flow of unskilled labor over the long term does to low-income wages?

The Contract with Black America

The coalition of the Democratic Party is brittle. While Republicans may have a brittle donor coalition, Democrats have a brittle voting-base coalition. Which is worse?

More than 90 percent of black Americans shouldn’t be consistently voting Democrat, unless they are college professors, trial lawyers, or public-sector union workers. Since the vast majority of black Americans aren’t college professors, trial lawyers, or public-sector union workers, there’s a huge opportunity for nationalist, culturally conservative, and working-class-focused Republicans going forward.

Trump is uniquely gifted to bring black America back into the GOP. Come spring 2020, Trump should go to Detroit and launch the Contract. This could help break the chains of identity politics in America and fulfill the ultimate hope of America’s founding documents.

Bloomberg's Plan For Black Americans Doubles Down On Left's Failures,"Perhaps for the first time in many years, politicians are directly competing for black votes. This goes hand-in-hand with signs that black America is no longer monolithically supporting Democrats. For example, President Donald Trump’s approval rating among black Americans is in the mid-30s.

Enter Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg, who just launched his new plan for black America, the Greenwood Initiative, named after a site of both incredible black achievement and pain.

Bloomberg, speaking to a mostly white audience of only several hundred in Tulsa, Oklahoma, unveiled his plan’s three points. The plan is a perfect example of the failure of center-left policy concoctions meant to help black Americans, invariably cooked up by rich liberals.

Doubling Down on ‘Affordable Housing’

First, Bloomberg plans to create “one million new Black homeowners.” To accomplish this, Bloomberg would have the federal taxpayer offer “down-payment assistance,” and bring millions into the banking and credit-score system. He would also start “enforcing fair lending laws, reducing foreclosures and evictions and increasing the supply of affordable housing.”

Too bad we’ve already tried this, and it terribly hurt black Americans. Starting in the 1990s, under a dubious legal theory called “disparate impact,” so-called affordable housing advocates successfully sued banks when different racial groups received differing loan offers and rates. It didn’t matter that the underlying incomes or credit scores completely explained the racial disparity. As long as an overall racial disparity existed, lenders and insurers faced legal liability.

For home mortgages, for example, law requires lenders to report race and sex data. All the trial lawyers had to do was dig through the data, and they had a lucrative lawsuit.

Even when the law doesn’t require loan applications to collect racial data, lenders are at risk. Most recently, the Obama administration’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sought to go after auto dealers using disparate impact theory. But since auto loans don’t collect racial data, the CFPB planned to estimate a loan applicant’s race by guessing based on a person’s name.

The Trump administration put an end to the CFPB’s auto loan shenanigans, but that 1990s affordable housing push, heavily based on race, still ended in misery. To avoid a costly suit and bad publicity, lenders gave home loans to people who couldn’t afford them. People plugged a load of money into payments they could barely afford, and when the downturn hit, they had to walk away. The empty or foreclosed houses piled up and went into disrepair, hurting the home values of non-overstretched black residents in those neighborhoods. Because of this, the 2008 housing bust hit black Americans and mostly black neighborhoods the hardest.

Worse, the same idiots who engineered the massive “affordable housing” push turned around and blamed “predatory lending” when their plans hurt others. Of course, the government’s push for low-cost loans and predatory lending are two sides of the same coin. And the Dodd-Frank bill, which passed after the housing bust and included the creation of the CFPB, was written by the very people who had pushed for unaffordable loans before the crisis and took money from groups and companies that benefitted from the “affordable lending” push.

To avoid lawsuits or lending to people who are less likely to pay the money back, some banks avoid black areas altogether, which is called “redlining.” Redlining is illegal, but it can be hard to prove. So the disparate impact legal theory, heavily supported by Democrats and a boon to rich trial lawyers, may be one reason black America lacks access to reputable financial institutions.

Bloomberg has clearly never thought of the fact that if you give someone down payment assistance, they might not be able to afford the loan either. He also apparently ignored the effects of the 1990s affordable housing push.

What would help? The United States desperately needs less-restrictive zoning laws and the building of more starter homes. The homes built as of late have been disproportionately larger, partly due to the incentives builders face from regulatory, environmental, and zoning costs and restrictions. Instead, Bloomberg’s plan doubles down on something that has already been tried, and failed.

Empowering Trial Lawyers and Democrat Politicians

In the same vein, Bloomberg’s plan says he would fight “discriminatory practices by requiring companies to report on hiring, pay and procurement and collecting more complete lending data.” This sounds an awful lot like bringing disparate impact into businesses’ hiring and buying decisions. That would lead to reduced black employment opportunities and increased racial discord in the workplace — the primary area where Americans of different identities most often intermingle and interact, albeit imperfectly.

Some would wrongly see black men who earned their status as the beneficiaries of firmwide affirmative action. Companies would do all sorts of crazy things internally to avoid reporting embarrassing data, while actual racism or achievement gaps would remain.

The billionaire candidate would also make federal contractors and public servants, including police, take “implicit bias training,” and crack down on conservative states’ efforts to fight against voter fraud.

Hard-to-Navigate Programs in Black Communities

Next, Bloomberg’s plan aims to “boost Black-owned businesses” by setting up “user-friendly one-stop shops for entrepreneurs across the country.” He would also “expand mentorships and incubators, increase access to capital (both debt and equity), support Black-owned banks and expand procurement from Black-owned businesses.” The plan says these efforts would be “aimed particularly at benefitting Black female entrepreneurs, the fastest growing group of new entrepreneurs.”

But the federal government already has myriad programs aimed at minority and female business owners, and their efficacy is poor. What would Bloomberg do differently that isn’t being done now? Never mind the fact that most small-business owners are too busy running their business to navigate federal applications or the various programs available, which means these programs probably go to the connected.

Government is best suited to create an environment where businesses can succeed. If crime is out of control in black areas, entrepreneurs will suffer or stay away. If the infrastructure surrounding an area is dilapidated or there are no broader employment opportunities, such as a factory that offers middle-class wages, the entire business climate in that area will suffer.

On this note, Bloomberg does propose “$70 billion in funding and technical support towards a national initiative to turn around 100 of the country’s most disadvantaged communities, with a relentless focus on evaluation to expand programs that work.” That sounds good, but then the plan says, “Mike’s national initiative will offer communities a menu of evidence-based programs in areas including health, education, infrastructure and justice.” In other words, poor minority urban areas will get another fancy government or nonprofit building.

The Importance of Dads and Jobs for Dads

The plan is remarkable not for what it includes, but for what it doesn’t mention. The two things any community needs — white, black, or otherwise — is stable employment and good wages, especially for young men, and intact families headed by both a mother and a father. Racism exists, and it holds black Americans back, but the United States’ black community uniquely suffers because of the deficit of these two key ingredients to community success.

Where strong black families used to be the norm — from 1890 to 1950, black American women had a higher marriage rate than white women — the black family has been decimated. In 1950, only 1 in 10 black children faced fatherlessness. Today, more than half of black children suffer from fatherlessness. Yet a father in the home is one of the greatest indicators of future economic and social success.

One cause of fatherlessness among America’s working class, which disproportionately affects black Americans, is welfare’s steep marriage penalties, which took off in the 1960s and ’70s. Policymakers who deeply care about the racial gaps in our country should address these penalties.

About the same time the black family was falling apart, America was also rapidly de-industrializing, especially in the ’70s. This de-industrialization disproportionately hurt black men, because black men were disproportionately working class. Evidence suggests that among factory towns, black communities were the first to de-industrialize as crime spiked and families fractured.

One must only drive through the historically black areas in cities such as Detroit or Milwaukee to see the effects of this de-industrialization many decades later. Business parks are empty. Young men, warehouses, and factories stand hollowed out and idle. Yes, these communities need more infrastructure, but the type that makes it easier once again to produce goods in black areas — not another fancy, government-funded nonprofit.

The bottom line is that not every young man should go to college, and where many white, rural areas have at least some middle-class opportunities for these young men — in agriculture or construction, for example — these opportunities are even fewer in urban, black neighborhoods. In addition, because of the lack of dads, too many American men lack the soft skills needed to obtain and hold these limited jobs.

Without employment opportunities for young men, a community will always suffer. The men will be less marriageable. Lawbreaking, systemic poverty, and fatherlessness will vastly increase. This is true for black America, but it’s also increasingly true for pockets of white, working-class America. Bloomberg and the modern day Democratic Party clearly haven’t figured this out. But the politician and party that figures it out will obtain not just the black vote, but command the American political landscape for decades to come.

Blackburn Is Right: Vindman's Military Career Doesn't Mean He's A Patriot,"It seems the Resistance has found their latest target in Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn. Blackburn took to Twitter on Thursday questioning Rep. Adam Schiff’s (D-Calif.) labeling of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as a patriot, accusing the military officer of “badmouth[ing] and ridicul[ing] our great nation in front of Russia, America’s greatest enemy.”

Predictably, many on Twitter expressed outrage at Blackburn’s commentary, but it’s worth noting Vindman’s role in the entire impeachment fiasco has been a far cry from upstanding, dignified, or patriotic. In other words, we can and should harbor gratitude for his military service, yet that should not stop us from recognizing the possibility that his latest maneuvers may have undermined the ability of the Trump administration to perform its job and to maintain a show of strength against our adversaries.

In her criticism of Vindman, Blackburn referenced a lengthy Twitter thread posted in late October by Vindman’s former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jim Hickman, who had alleged that Vindman had behaved inappropriately in his discussions with Russian soldiers: “He was apologetic of American culture, laughed about Americans not being educated or worldly, & really talked up Obama & globalism to the point of uncomfortable.”

Hickman admitted to verbally reprimanding Vindman after allegedly witnessing the behavior: “Do not let the uniform fool you…he is a political activist in uniform.” Regardless of whether one believes these claims, it’s worth acknowledging they exist and may color how someone views Vindman’s role in the impeachment hearings.

Blackburn also pointed out Vindman’s role in leaking information from the July 25 phone call to the whistleblower and thus “break[ing] the chain of command.” As one former Trump National Security Council official expressed to the Washington Examiner back in October, “How is an active-duty military officer allowed to go to a different branch of government to take down the president with scurrilous claims? I think the Army should be very concerned about what this means for discipline in the force. Basically, you have a political disagreement so you vomit mutiny.”

Although some disagree with this argument, it is a perfectly legitimate and reasonable one to make, particularly given widespread concerns over misconduct within various executive branches that seem intent on removing the president (the Carter Page FISA warrant being just one example of how anti-Trump bias has fomented into serious malpractice).

Vindman has not been honest in the process, making the Schiff’s praise an odd fit. In his opening statement during the impeachment inquiry, Vindman claimed to be the “principal advisor to the National Security Advisor and the president on Ukraine and the other countries in my portfolio.” However, when approached by Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio as to the veracity of this claim, Vindman conceded that he had never met, spoken with, or advised the president on anything.

Given the context of the hearings, Schiff’s latest usage of the word “patriot” likely was not in reference to Vindman’s military service generally, but in reference to Vindman’s role in leaking the contents of the July 25 phone call. Whether you agree with Schiff’s statement hinges upon whether you believe Vindman acted dutifully or mutinously. This is a serious debate worth having, for if you believe the latter adverb is more appropriate, then yes, the term “patriot” would be highly ill-fitting.

Many have devoted their lives to this country, who we may or may not find behaved in unseemly ways, thus complicating how we understand their character. Whether you find Blackburn’s statement reprehensible will likely turn on how much faith you have in this entire impeachment process.

Given the circus-like nature of the entire procedure, made more comical by the fact that Rep. Jerry Nadler had discussed going “all-in” on impeachment back in 2018, it’s logical to view this entire debacle as an unpatriotic exercise in reversing the results of the 2016 election. In that case, the latest attacks on Blackburn seem to be another mechanism for silencing this opinion.

13 Key Takeaways From Trump's Epic State Of The Union Address,"President Donald Trump’s rousing State of the Union address to a divided Congress encouraged his supporters with bold defense of conservative values, overtly reached out to independents on the basis of successful implementation of domestic policy goals, and in so doing enraged the Democrat left on what was already a difficult day for them.

Trump highlighted the booming economy, articulated his foreign policy, and tied his vision for the American future to its heroic past and frontier spirit. He also gave a scholarship in real time, bestowed a Medal of Freedom in real time, and dramatically reunited a family with their soldier husband and father, making for the most emotional State of the Union address since President Reagan first began highlighting American heroes in the gallery during his annual address.

The speech was such a success, in fact, that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi lost her cool at the end and literally tore up her copy of the speech in a fit of sputtering rage.

1. The Facts Are Strong

The main reason the speech worked so well was not because President Trump’s delivery was masterful. In fact, a beautiful line early in the speech — “We have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny” — fell a bit flat in his telling.

The speech was well written and played to President Trump’s strengths as a showman, showing policy goals and successes through the gripping stories of real Americans who were present in the balcony. But ultimately the speech was good because the facts were so good.

The Constitution requires the president to “give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” The facts regarding the current health of the United States are undeniably strong. The economy is doing so well that it’s a story that can be told from multiple angles, and the policy successes he bragged about were worth bragging about.

2. The Blue-Collar Boom

While elites in Washington, D.C., continue to resist President Trump, he spoke around them to average Americans, who are experiencing what he called a “blue-collar boom.” Reminding Americans of past presidents’ “jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige,” he instead focused on the results of his regulatory reform, tax cuts, and renegotiated trade agreements.

He cited new jobs, low unemployment rates, decreases in poverty, increases in the work force, increases in wages, the surprising improvement of the manufacturing sector, and more. He tied these successes to the robust stock market, new heights in consumer confidence, and pension performance.

3. Emphasizing Bipartisan Successes

Part of Pelosi’s frustration with Trump is that he didn’t seem to even care that she had just led her caucus into a partisan impeachment of him. He will be acquitted today, perhaps in a bipartisan fashion, but it was an issue he didn’t even bother to address, much less dwell on. He seemed to give the impeachment issue as much seriousness as House Democrats did, which is to say not much.

Instead, he focused on what could be accomplished for Americans if the parties work together instead of in a constant state of Resistance. He noted that criminal justice reform and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement were done by everyone working together.

4. A Speech It Was Difficult to Ostentatiously Oppose

Clearly Democrats had made an agreement to be hostile to President Trump. Many of them sat on their hands no matter the topic. In fact, one leader of the Democratic Party, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, announced her refusal to even show up to the speech.

As President Trump listed economic successes, going into granular detail about how the economy had helped minorities and women, Democrats’ refusal to clap looked odd. By the time people were refusing to clap for 100-year-old heroes such as Tuskegee Airman Brig. Gen. Charles McGee, the oppositional stance looked downright absurd.

These scenes and these Americans are some of what the opposition refused to show even polite applause for.

It was a great State of the Union. These were my favorite moments. pic.twitter.com/YxbKpnAgF0 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) February 5, 2020

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, distinguished herself not just by wearing blue, contra the white outfits a gaggle of Democratic women chose, but by clapping for things when she felt like it, such as for President Trump’s praise of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and for Sen. Tim Scott’s Opportunity Zones.

5. Opposition to Socialism

In a move that angered some Democrats, President Trump highlighted his opposition to socialism. He lamented what socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro is doing to the people of Venezuela, and asserted that all Americans are united with the Venezuelans in their struggle for freedom. “Socialism destroys nations,” he said, “But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.” In a discussion about improving Americans’ health care, he said, “We will never let socialism destroy American health care.”

6. Overt Outreach to Black Americans

President Trump highlighted how the booming economy is helping black Americans. He emphasized how criminal justice reform, a key issue for African Americans, gives former felons a new lease on life.

He highlighted the plight of Stephanie Davis, a single mother trying to get her daughter Janiyah into a better school through opportunity scholarships, putting an adorable face to school choice. He tied the marchers at Selma to the soldiers of Valley Forge. The American heroes he referenced included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman, and various black Americans in the balcony. And he talked about Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

The president is not hiding his attempt to gain more support from black Americans, and the speech follows up on a powerful Superbowl ad highlighting his work on criminal justice reform. Republicans struggle to gain black votes, but Trump already outperformed John McCain and Mitt Romney with these voters in his 2016 bid, before the successes he touted last night.

As Democratic primary voters threaten to pick a nominee who does not excite black voters, the outreach could continue to reshape the Republican coalition. Democratic pundit Van Jones sounded the warning about the effectiveness of this strategy to his CNN audience:

WAKE UP, folks. The #IowaCaucus was a debacle, followed by a strong #SOTU speech laying out Trump’s strategy to win – which includes going for Black voters. This was a warning shot from the Trump campaign to liberals, and we need to take this VERY seriously in order to win. @CNN pic.twitter.com/bgBFms9jtN — Van Jones (@VanJones68) February 5, 2020

7. Boldness Unmatched by Any Other Republican President

Smack dab in the middle of the speech, President Trump thanked conservative hero Rush Limbaugh for “decades of tireless devotion” to the country. In recognition of his work and the inspiration he has provided millions of Americans, Trump announced the country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He had Melania Trump immediately present the honor in front of the assembled crowd.

While it is beyond common for liberal heroes and liberal celebrities to receive awards, Republican leaders acted over the course of decades almost as if it was okay for conservatives to be treated as second-class citizens in this regard. President Trump recognizes that the half of the country that is not liberal also likes to honor its celebrities and heroes.

Limbaugh has taught millions of Americans about conservative ideology, emphasizing the Constitution and the country’s founding ideals, and suffered attacks from the left as a result. He is a folk hero who is beloved in part because he defends tens of millions of Americans against attacks.

No other previous Republican president or nominee would have had the courage to bestow this award on such a deserving American. They would instead have worried about a media backlash. The media and Democrats did in fact react negatively to the honor for Limbaugh, who announced this week he has advanced cancer.

8. Putting an Incredibly Cute Face to Victims of Late-Term Abortion

One of the most touching moments of the speech was the introduction of Ellie Schneider, born at 21 weeks, and her mother Robin. The 2-year-old yawned a huge yawn as she was introduced to the nation in the arms of her devoted mother. It was a reminder that children like Ellie are born at a time when it is legal to kill them in utero. “Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life,” President Trump said, and challenged members of all political parties to agree that “every human life is a sacred gift from God.”

This issue is particularly salient as Democrats more openly support late-term abortion, support allowing children who survive abortion attempts to die, and support exiling pro-life voters from their ranks.

9. A Touching Supreme Court Moment

Supreme Court Justices typically attend the State of the Union Address. Chief Justice John Roberts, also presiding over the impeachment trial in the Senate, was there, although Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not make it.

At one point, President Trump thanked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate for helping him confirm a record number of 187 new federal judges. He noted by name his two Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Elena Kagan, seated next to Gorsuch, smiled at him. Gorsuch, seated next to Kavanaugh, smiled at him as well. It was a reminder that as tough as Supreme Court nomination battles are, the justices are a collegial group and that Trump’s appointees have been well accepted by the group.

10. Articulating a Restrained Foreign Policy

One of the reasons President Trump won in 2016 was his opposition to the way we fight wars. At the same time, he is willing to use American force to advance American interests. This confuses the foreign policy groups at either extreme. When discussing his desire to end the war in Afghanistan, he said of America’s warfighters that they are “the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all.”

Trump highlighted the cost to the American warfighters and their families because of the way we have fought wars. He told the stories of people who had lost lives and limbs as a result of serving abroad. He highlighted the life of Kayla Mueller, who was killed by ISIS leader and founder Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. He highlighted the life of Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, who was killed by a roadside bomb provided by Qasem Soleimani. The families of both victims were in the gallery and when they were introduced, it was heartbreaking.

“War places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families,” Trump said, introducing Amy Williams and her two young children. Husband and father Sgt. First Class Townsend Williams was described as serving his fourth tour in Afghanistan.

In a final example of Trump’s effective handling of the televised moment, he announced to Amy and her kids that Williams was surprising them by coming home. He walked down the steps to greet them.

At the same time, it wasn’t all restraint. Explaining his decision to kill Baghdadi and Soleimani, he said, “Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!”

This foreign policy has been confusing to many in the establishment, but it is a return to the foreign policy embraced by Republican presidents Eisenhower through Reagan, a form of peace through strength.

11. What Conservatives Might Not Like

While not as bad as his previous addresses to Congress or some other presidential addresses to Congress, the State of the Union is always a laundry list of unrestrained spending. This speech was no exception. And while conservatives may strongly support Space Force, Trump’s terminology of “America’s manifest destiny in the stars” could be troubling.

As per usual, there was no mention of attempts to rein in entitlement spending or other government growth. In fact, he said he would “protect” Social Security, which, while a crowd pleaser, is not conservative orthodoxy. Neither did he announce any plans on the debt or provide an update on his southern border wall.

12. A Hopeful National Identity

Apart from the dramatic vignettes of Americans in the galley, the strongest part of the speech was the ending, where President Trump spoke with pride about America’s frontier spirit and work ethic. “This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance,” he said. “We are Americans. We are the pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world, we build the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.”

This ending was both a tribute to American history and optimistic look forward into the future. “Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God’s grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come.”

13. Bad Timing for Democrats

President Trump went into the State of the Union emboldened by his highest voter approval numbers of his presidency. Impeachment led Democratic favorability to decline while Republicans enjoyed majority support for the first time in recent memory. He is about to be acquitted, probably in a bipartisan fashion.

All of those numbers are bad for Pelosi and the Democratic Party she leads. In addition, they had a humiliating debacle of a caucus night in Iowa. The party botched its operation, meaning that the result is still uncertain. But what is known is that the establishment’s favorite candidate, past Vice President Joe Biden, suffered a humiliating finish.

The decision to be hostile throughout the speech caused Democrats to look small and petty, particularly as President Trump spoke of big successes and big goals for the future. Pelosi appeared distracted during the speech, rifling through papers and chomping on her gums. Her ripping stunt at the end of the speech was extremely well received by the media and other partisans on Twitter, but was less likely to play well among average voters.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/05/13-key-takeaways-from-president-trumps-epic-state-of-the-union-address/,2020-02-05
Why Joe Biden’s Collapse In Iowa Means Trouble For Democrats,"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire — Of all the Democratic caucusgoers I spoke with in Iowa last week, not one told me his or her first choice was Joe Biden. Now I know why: there were never that many Biden supporters in Iowa to begin with.

All of the caucus results might not be in yet, but we know enough to say with confidence that Biden’s campaign in Iowa collapsed. Despite leading in many state polls over the past year, he finished a distant fourth, barely clearing the 15 percent threshold for viability and, with 86 percent of precincts reporting as of this writing, earning 10,000 fewer votes statewide than Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who came in third.

The media, which still relies far too much on polls, wasn’t expecting this. But I have a feeling it didn’t shock many Iowa Democrats. As Jay Cost noted on Twitter, Biden peaked at 28.5 percent in the RealClearPolitics poll average in Iowa, but “the more voters saw of him, the less they liked.”

The big story out of Iowa, then, isn’t necessarily the broken app or the utter incompetence of the Iowa State Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee (although those are important stories that will likely take on more significance as the cycle goes on). The big story is that Biden, the presumptive Democratic frontrunner right up until Monday night, might not survive past South Carolina, which has now become his firewall.

By all accounts, Biden was betting big on Iowa, having eschewed much effort or expense in New Hampshire, where the candidates are now campaigning but Biden has a far smaller presence than his rivals. Since the new year, Biden’s paltry media buys and infrequent campaign events in New Hampshire this week indicate he assumed he didn’t need to win the first presidential primary—or that he couldn’t win it.

Here in Manchester, there are scant signs of the Biden campaign—few yard signs, infrequent ads, and almost no events anywhere in the state ahead of the primary apart from a few get-out-the-vote speeches and a CNN town hall earlier this week. (By contrast, the Buttigieg campaign appears to be in high gear, with a steady stream of volunteers coming and going from a field office downtown.)

Beyond New Hampshire, Biden now faces a tough battle in the Nevada caucus later this month, which Sen. Bernie Sanders is favored to win with strong Hispanic support. That leaves Biden with the possible scenario that he goes into South Carolina with zero victories, and maybe not even strong showings, in the first three states—itself a sobering reminder that Biden has never won a presidential primary.

All of that means Pete Buttigieg, who as of this writing appears to have won Iowa by a razor-thin margin, is the Democratic Party establishment’s last, best hope to prevent Sanders from winning the nomination and possibly leading the party to a 1972 George McGovern-style defeat.

Democrats ‘Have Got To Wake Up’

That in turn should greatly worry moderate and centrist Democrats, because so far there’s no sign that Buttigieg, despite his strong showing in Iowa, can put together a coalition of Democratic voters that can win a general election. Specifically, the former South Bend mayor has failed to gather much support from black Americans even as the Trump campaign makes its own appeal to these voters.

Indeed, President Trump’s State of the Union speech Tuesday night seemed tailored to appeal to black and Hispanic voters, touting record-low levels of minority unemployment, job growth, wage growth, and highlighting policies like school choice that would disproportionately advantage black Americans—a point Trump drove home by including fourth-grader Janiyah Davis and her mother among White House special guests to the speech.

Black Americans might traditionally vote Democrat, but they lean more conservative on social issues than their white counterparts in the Democratic Party, as do Hispanics. What’s more, as the Democratic Party moves further to the left—a move driven almost entirely by white leftists—the tension between the party’s woke whites and conservative-minded minorities will become more pronounced, leaving an opening for a GOP appeal.

This isn’t just wishful thinking from the Trump campaign. After the State of the Union, CNN’s Van Jones warned his fellow commentators that Trump’s appeal to black voters just might work. “We’ve got to wake up, folks. There’s a whole bubble thing that goes on—‘well he said s-hole nations therefore all black people are going to hate him forever.’ That ain’t necessarily so,” Jones said. “What you’re going to see him do is say, you may not like my rhetoric but look at my results, look at my record, to black people. If he narrow-casts that, it’s going to be effective.”

WAKE UP, folks. The #IowaCaucus was a debacle, followed by a strong #SOTU speech laying out Trump's strategy to win – which includes going for Black voters. This was a warning shot from the Trump campaign to liberals, and we need to take this VERY seriously in order to win. @CNN pic.twitter.com/bgBFms9jtN — Van Jones (@VanJones68) February 5, 2020

Jones is right, and Trump doesn’t even have to peel off that many minority voters to disrupt the Democratic coalition. Democrats might do that themselves before the general election. It might be enough for Biden simply to get knocked out of the running, which could keep black voters from turning out in significant numbers. With a nominee like Buttigieg, that’s a real possibility, especially if his campaign can’t figure out how to draw more minority support.

As the Democratic presidential campaigns fan out across New Hampshire this week, that should weigh heavy on the minds of Democratic Party leaders, especially given that Sanders leads in the latest New Hampshire poll, which also shows Biden losing support. Having won the popular vote in Iowa (if not the delegate count), a New Hampshire win for Sanders would give his campaign tremendous momentum going into Nevada and South Carolina, and drastically increase the likelihood of a contested convention in Milwaukee come July.

Clarence Thomas’s Life Repudiates The Left’s Hatred Of America,"Clarence Thomas’s life is an emotional testament to the persistence of God’s grace amid the highs and lows of the American story. “I come from regular stock,” says the highest-ranking, longest-serving African-American public servant in a new documentary, “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas In His Own Words.” His story is at once the epitome of the best and the worst of America.

Its depiction in “Created Equal” and his 2008 autobiography, “My Grandfather’s Son,” deserve a prominent place among public knowledge of the civil rights movement, the Supreme Court, black American history, and great Americans. Thomas has earned his place in his country’s history, which means he deserves focus in Black History Month curricula and similar celebrations and inquiries.

Without shying from the serious reasons he and many other unjustly treated Americans might have for cynicism about the project of “liberty and justice for all,” the associate Supreme Court justice also demonstrates how to transcend hatred with magnanimity. It’s a lesson we all can stand to learn better.

Justice Thomas has legitimate reasons to hate America. They begin in his childhood, and extend through today. At age six, he wandered alone in the streets of segregated Savannah, Georgia, while his mother worked. They lived in a black-only tenement with raw sewage stewing in the ditches near where people cooked. “Savannah was hell,” he says in the documentary. His grandparents took over raising him and sent him to Catholic schools, where Thomas received a rare excellent education for a young black boy.

After high school, Thomas enrolled in seminary with the goal of becoming a Catholic priest. The cultural racism of his all-white peers, however, ultimately ended in him quitting seminary after getting notes saying “I like Martin Luther King — dead” and hearing a seminary student rejoice when MLK was shot. That was followed by the race riots and Robert Kennedy assassination of summer 1968. Thomas plunged into anger.

“For the first time in my life, racism and race explained everything,” he says. “It became sort of a substitute religion. I shoved aside Catholicism, and it was all about race.”

He joined the black Marxist revolutionaries at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, who celebrated activists who called for shooting police. When he visited home in Georgia, Thomas’s grandfather and Vietnam vet brother were embarassed and angry about his black power activities and ideology, but he still felt justified.

After he graduated from Yale Law School, however, the only person who would hire Thomas was a Republican. Employers assumed black Yale graduates were of a lower caliber than whites because of affirmative action, and steered clear of him. “The hardest part of taking the job was, he was a Republican. And the idea of working for a Republican was repulsive at best,” Thomas says. Yet with a wife and child to support, Thomas swallowed his distaste and took the job in Missouri.

The job was as assistant attorney general. “At the time, my thinking was that all blacks were political prisoners,” Thomas says now, laughing at his younger self. “That’s sort of the sophisticated level at which I looked at the criminal justice system.” Yet through his job Thomas came into contact with so many cases and data that he had to finally acknowledge that wasn’t true. The vast majority of blacks involved in the criminal justice system were there for just reasons. “It was one of these road to Damascus experiences,” he says in the film, swallowing, with obvious pain in his eyes.

Thomas worked in corporate law next, then moved back into public law. Along the road, he became increasingly conservative in his thinking. The press eventually found out, and made him notorious.

Of course the avatar of this was Thomas’s confirmation battle for the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991. The documentary spends a significant section exploring that saga, incorporating hearing footage with present-day flashbacks from Thomas and his wife, Virginia. Since I was only five years old in 1991, to me the storyline eerily paralleled the Brett Kavanaugh brutalization, rather than the other way around.

I cried watching clips of what Thomas called a “high-tech lynching,” just as I cried watching Kavanaugh battle for his good name and family against similarly heinous accusations. As with Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, Thomas accuser Anita Hill changed her story several times and could provide no corroboration for her claims. Nor had she any explanation for why she followed from job to job a man she claimed had been sexually harassing her. Polls from the time show the majority of Americans believed she was lying.

Thomas’s unjust treatment continues today, mostly at the hands of those affiliated with the political party that claims to represent antiracism. In the wake of the parallel allegations lobbed at Kavanaugh in 2018, Thomas was again dragged out into the popular press and his reputation re-assassinated.

The documentary shows a few of the slurs prominent people and publications have applied to Thomas that would be furiously lambasted as racist if applied to someone with different philosophical commitments. Apparently racism only matters to the people who control culture if it can be used as a political weapon against their opponents. It is therefore permitted to live and even fed, precisely because it is useful to its keepers, rather than rejected equally by all.

“We were told that, ‘Oh, it’s gonna be the bigot in the pickup truck, it’s gonna be the Klansmen, it’s gonna be the rural sheriff,’ and I’m not saying that there weren’t some of those who were bad,” Thomas says in “Created Equal.” “But it turned out that, through all of that, ultimately the biggest impediment was the modern-day liberal. That they were the ones who would discount all those things because they have one issue, or because they have the power to caricature you.”

Thomas’s story doesn’t end there, though, because he is not an asterisk. His monumental body of constitutional scholarship vindicates his mind, and God Almighty vindicates his soul. As a reflection of those graces, perhaps, while he has every reason to be vindictive and bitter, Clarence Thomas has chosen not to be. Instead, he is grateful, effective, and joyful.

Perhaps most of all among the sitting Supreme Court justices, Thomas’s jurisprudence shows veneration for the majestic ideas of what some racists automatically disqualify because a bunch of “white men” agreed with them. Yet the American founders’ greatest ideas (which descend from a great tumult of different-looking people) transcend lesser mental constructs like race, and make it possible for us to do so also. This is why Thomas loves them, as do all people wise enough to see past skin into soul.

Thomas’s honorable discharge of his duties regardless of the suffering they have brought doesn’t erase the sins committed against him, but it does redeem them. It transforms a stepping stone to glory into a stumbling block of shame. This is the American story. It is Thomas’s story. It can also be yours.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/07/clarence-thomass-life-repudiates-the-lefts-hatred-of-america/,2020-02-07
Buttigieg Refers To ‘Dark Money’ As ‘Black Money’ In Front Of African-American Crowd,"During a campaign event in South Carolina, 2020 candidate Pete Buttigieg referred to “dark money” as “black money” when speaking to a room of African-American voters.

“I’m not a fan of the current campaign finance system, and the reality is, it’s not going to get better in all the ways we need it to get better without a constitutional reform. So, there’s things we can and should do right away, they can deal with black money — sorry, dark money —” Buttigieg said, before the interviewer jumped in, saying, “African-American money.”

“I’m always happy to take black money contributions into my campaign,” Buttigieg said, trying to play off the awkward moment.

Pete accidentally calls “dark money” “black money” while speaking to a room of black people. He then makes it so awkward that it physically hurt to watch this video.

pic.twitter.com/ImMvC2DE3u — Greg Price (@greg_price11) February 11, 2020

The South Carolina primary will take place Feb. 29, and Buttigieg is struggling in the polls. RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregation has Buttigieg in fifth place at 5.5 percent in South Carolina. He falls behind Joe Biden, Tom Steyer, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Black voters are an important voting bloc within the South Carolina Democratic Party, and Buttigieg is largely unpopular among that demographic.

One problem for Buttigieg leading up to South Carolina is the incident wherein his campaign misrepresented sentiments from three prominent black South Carolinian leaders regarding his “Douglass Plan for America,” which includes financial reparations for slavery and putting an end to incarceration for drug possession. Buttigieg’s campaign also used a stock photo from Kenya to promote his plan for black Americans.

Buttigieg not only faces national backlash from black voters, but he faced intense backlash in his hometown of South Bend after a white police officer fatally shot a black robbery suspect. Buttigieg has come under scrutiny for this shooting because some critics say the South Bend Police Department has not hired as many nonwhite officers as it should.

Buttigieg’s problem with black voters was emphasized in his inability to connect with them on the campaign trail and is likely to be a central issue during the South Carolina primary.

Meet The 'Colored Patriots Of The American Revolution',"It seems most presentations of black history are either pushing an ideological agenda, such as the “1619 Project,” or so trite and bland that you lose interest. Activism is substituting analysis, and U.S. historical knowledge is declining. Stories that would be otherwise interesting are instead filled with two-dimensional characters that fail to connect to potentially large audiences. And then there are the stories that just never get told.

Many of those can be found in a book titled “Colored Patriots of the American Revolution,” written by William Cooper Nell, an African-American author, in 1852. He wrote the book after the Massachusetts Legislature denied a petition to erect a monument to Crispus Attucks, honoring him as the first martyr of the American Revolution.

By the 1850s, Attucks’ story, and many others, were largely forgotten, which made it easier to think blacks played no important part in America’s story. Nell’s innovative approach of collecting oral records passed down from Revolutionary War veterans showed what these unsung heroes did for their country and why they deserved equal rights.

Reading this book makes you feel like you don’t know the country as well as you thought you did. It’s hard to believe the stories in it are true. Lemuel Haynes, for example, was raised as an indentured servant, enlisted as a minuteman in 1774, then became the first black ordained minister. Here’s the kicker: He accepted the call to be the pastor of a white church, where he served for over 30 years.

Nell Tells Little-Known Stories of Black Patriots

A favorite story of mine, which isn’t in Nell’s book, has to do with James Armistead. Born a slave in Virginia, he enlisted with Marquis de Lafayette’s French units, where he was employed as a spy. He first gained the confidence of Benedict Arnold and then got assigned to the camp of Lord Cornwallis, who wanted to use him as a spy for the Brits against the Americans, not suspecting him of being a patriot.

Armistead became a double agent, collecting crucial intelligence and feeding false information to the British. His efforts enabled French and American forces to trap Cornwallis at Yorktown and win the war. As much as anyone else, we can thank James Armistead Lafayette, who added the name in honor of his general, for America’s independence.

Richard Allen, born a slave, helped Benjamin Rush fight the yellow fever epidemic of 1794 that hit Philadelphia. Allen, along with Absalom Jones, produced the first U.S. publication written by blacks. They defended the black community against accusations of looting and theft during the outbreak, as half the city left town. They later founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Unfortunately, Nell’s book is not widely known. Just as Nell revived the stories of black patriots, I felt the need to revive Nell’s work through a podcast I named “Colored Patriots of the American Revolution.” In each episode, I go through highlights of black veterans from each state.

Racial Harmony Through Integration

I have a feeling Nell’s vision of racial harmony through integration would not go over so well today. He opposed abolitionist organizations that segregated by race. He also fought for integration in schools, the Boston Railroad, and Boston’s performance halls.

Even his book was an effort to integrate the contributions of black soldiers into the historical record. He wanted to show that “the free colored men of the United States bore their full proportion of the sacrifices and trials of the Revolutionary War.”

That differs from a Howard Zinn-like approach, wherein the primary motif of American history is ongoing injustice. The “1619 Project” has taken the “slavery is America’s original sin” school of thought to the absurd extreme of reducing everything to the sole motive of maintaining slavery.

Ironically, this view follows in the footsteps of Stephen Douglas — who vociferously debated Abraham Lincoln on the issue of slavery — when Douglas argued that black people have no part in this American experiment in government. Social justice warriors of our day use this as an identity-based claim for a political position.

The Choice Between Inspiration and Resentment

While we have to struggle with the darker side of the past, thinking there is nothing more to history than systemic abuses leads to a cynical outlook. Nell saw the value in history as a source of inspiration rather than resentment. He seemed to believe in America’s potential and wanted to participate in it, not reinterpret it as irredeemably racist. Even more so, the men who enlisted to fight for America’s independence certainly had high hopes for this new nation based on liberty and equality.

But it wasn’t a Pollyanna-ish hope. It was a challenging, conflicted aspiration. It reminds me of the scene from “The Tuskegee Airmen” in which Lt. Col. Benjamin O’Davis is defending the experimental program that trained black pilots before a congressional committee looking for an excuse to end it. He pointed out that when Jesse Owens humiliated Adolf Hitler’s master race at the 1936 Olympics, the cheers across America came from whites as well as blacks. Yet discrimination based on racism continued:

As a United States Army officer who gladly puts his life on the line every day, there’s no greater conflict within me. How do I feel about my country? And how does my country feel about me? Are we only to be Americans when the mood suits you? A fair and impartial opportunity is all we ask. Nothing that you yourselves wouldn’t demand.

I can only speculate, but I think the black patriots who served in the Revolutionary War would agree with those words. As someone who gladly put my life on the line as an Air Force enlisted man, I have to choose between inspiration and resentment.

My instincts lean more toward building and preserving than deconstructing and reinventing. That’s probably why I’m a conservative. It’s also a natural American quality to hope for a better future. What better time and place is there to be alive than here and now?

Selma's First Black Church Is Still Strong. Look At Its Amazing Legacy,"Now let us have a little talk with Jesus

Let us tell Him all about our troubles

He will hear our faintest cry, He will answer by and by

Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin’

And you know a little fire is burnin’

You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right.

Warren William “Billy” Young can still hear his father Woodrow’s deep bass voice whenever his home church sings his dad’s favorite hymn, “Just a Little Talk with Jesus.”

“We sang that hymn about three weeks ago, and people couldn’t believe I sounded just like my dad,” he says. “I can hear his voice when we sing that hymn, and sing it just like he did.”

First Baptist Church was the center of family life for the Young family. Billy’s father served as deacon, trustee, and treasurer, and his mother, Alice, as deaconess, senior choir director, and president of the missionary society.

“All the time growing up, I’d only be in three places: home, church, or school,” Young said. Perfect attendance at school and church was expected. Choir was the center of their church life, as everyone in the family sang; later, even spouses and grandchildren joined in. Only one family member doesn’t sing, and that’s Billy’s sister Wanda Young Lowe, who plays the organ. She has been playing for services since she was 11. Each played an instrument, too: saxophone, clarinet, trombone, and trumpet.

As First Baptist prepares to celebrate its 175th anniversary this year, the Young family — the four adult children of the now-sainted Woodrow and Alice Young, and their spouses and children — will all be standing with the choir or seated on the organ bench as they celebrate their commitment to the church their father’s family started in 1845, while they were still slaves.

First Baptist’s Beginnings

Established as First “Colored” Baptist Church, it is the oldest black church in Selma and one of the four oldest in Alabama. The church, renamed First Baptist in the 1880s, holds a prominent place both physically and historically in the Selma community. It is the mother church of black baptists in Selma, started the first public and private schools for newly freed slaves, and played a key role in the voting rights movement in Selma, beginning in 1920.

During the 1960s, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), led by now-Rep. John Lewis, set up headquarters at First Baptist and held many nonviolent training sessions and youth mass meetings in its historic building. Lewis leads a congressional civil rights pilgrimage to Selma each March.

First Baptist has always had strong and dedicated members whose faith, tested and tried with slavery, Jim Crow segregation, intimidation, violence, and even a devastating tornado, triumphed over all. It began humbly in the basement of the white First Baptist Church in downtown Selma, where enslaved members organized in 1845 under Rev. Samuel Phillips, who was freed from slavery for his service in the Mexican War.

The Young family’s roots are tied to the founding of the church. Great-Grandmother Amelia came to the United States from Haiti, following a Christian missionary family to their home in Chattanooga. She married a local man and died in childbirth. Her husband sent their daughter, Louise, born in 1893 to Selma to live with relatives and attend First Baptist. She later married Wilson Young, a railroad worker and church member, and their only son, Woodrow, was born March 21, 1916.

The Church’s Role in Selma’s Black History

After the Civil War, the congregation built its own church and housed the first public school for black children. In 1878, the congregation helped found and house the Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School, now Selma University, for training black teachers and pastors. The institution had an African-American president beginning in 1881, a rarity as whites led most black colleges at the time. Most of the school’s presidents were also pastors at First Baptist.

First Baptist was mother to Second Baptist in 1869, Green Street Baptist in 1881, and Tabernacle Baptist in 1884. Churches and segregated schools played a key role as safe havens and centers of community and identity for African Americans in Selma.

The growing congregation needed a larger sanctuary, and in 1894, member David Benjamin West designed and built the Gothic Revival-style brick building, the church’s present home. The design was cruciform, with the Victorian-styled sanctuary and chancel raised 8 feet above the first floor fellowship room and housed beneath a steeply pitched cross gable roof. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is considered “one of the most architecturally significant late-19th-century black churches in the state.” In 2018, it was one of four Selma structures named to the watch list of the World Monuments Fund, an organization committed to preserving global historic sites.

Commitment to the betterment of Selma’s black residents, First Baptist members took prominent roles in the community, and the church’s basement floor became a community center for the surrounding neighborhoods. Charles J. Adams, a trustee at the church and World War I veteran, worked on the railroad. Later, as a notary public, Adams served as a de facto attorney for the town’s black residents’ basic legal needs. He helped many black veterans apply for federal assistance often denied them by white bankers notwithstanding the veterans’ qualifications.

Adams was jailed several times, likely because of his advocacy on behalf of black Americans, but despite the obstacles and discrimination, he helped give black residents opportunities that were otherwise unavailable. With Adams’s support, for instance, the Chestnut brothers opened a grocery and meat business, Chestnut Brothers Market and Grocery, in 1936.

Earlier, in 1918, Adams helped found the first NAACP chapter in the state and began organizing for voting rights. Working with Samuel Boynton, who arrived from Tuskegee Institute as the African-American Dallas County extension agent, they founded the Dallas County Voters League in 1920. As late as 1960, even though blacks were 57 percent of the county population, only 1 percent were registered to vote. Boynton and his wife, Amelia, were members of First Baptist.

Opens Doors for Community Outreach

Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, one of the founding members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., served as pastor of the church for two years in the 1950s.

In 1963, under the leadership of Rev. M. C. Cleveland, the church became the first in the city to open its doors for activities and meetings of the Dallas County Voters League. During the next two years, the church was a focal point of the mass meeting and nonviolent teaching sessions sponsored by the SNCC, which located its offices in the church basement. During the early months of 1965, King, Ralph Abernathy, and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference spoke nightly to the youth at First Baptist Church.

After the marches, the church continued to serve as SNCC headquarters and a food and clothing distribution center for those who lost jobs while registering to vote.

In 1978, the congregation faced one of its most difficult trials when a tornado tore through the church, collapsing two main walls and stained glass windows. Church leaders, including Woodrow Young, determined to rebuild, despite a cost of over $1 million — one of the largest loans ever made in Selma at the time — all of which the church paid off in just a few years through Young’s leadership as treasurer.

Young, who participated in the teacher-led marches for voting rights alongside F.D. Reese, taught algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus at the local black high school, one of the few in the state offering higher-level math classes. Young was also an adjunct at Selma University, the first black math teacher hired at the integrated Selma High School in 1970, and later taught at Wallace Community College. His teaching career spanned 52 years.

First Baptist Today

Today, three of the four Young family members worship at First Baptist (the oldest, Marcellus, lives in San Jose, California). Billy is chairman of the deacon board, a position his father once held, and he sings in the choir. Once a teacher in the local high school gifted program, Billy returned to law school — inspired and mentored by First Baptist member and attorney J.L. Chestnut — and today is assistant attorney general with Alabama’s Department of Revenue.

Billy Young’s love for church and for Selma is visible in all he does. He volunteers on several boards, including the Selma/Dallas County YMCA, the local Democratic committee, and his role as vice chairman of the Selma Redevelopment Authority. Committed to helping raise up a new generation of educated and dedicated, young, African-American men, Young is a mentor and leader of several initiatives based at his church.

Founding president of 100 Black Men of America-Selma, Young and his members mentor sixth- through ninth-grade young men in academics and careers, from learning to tie ties to preparing for the ACT. His fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, sponsors the Alpha Academy, a tutoring program that meets at First Baptist, and has awarded more than $100,000 in college scholarships to local students.

“The members of First Baptist Church are very concerned with the plight of young people in our community and believe it is the religious community’s responsibility to meet the needs of our youngest citizens,” Young said. “The religious community, and especially the men in our religious community, must do more for young men and must devote more time to interaction with the young men in Selma.”

As someone who grew up having “just a little talk with Jesus,” Young continues the family tradition of love for church and family. “God has been too good to me to not be active in church,” he said. “He has really blessed me, and it’s my responsibility to give back, to help someone like others at my church helped me.”

The United Nations Releases An Anti-Israel Blacklist,"If there’s one group you can count on, it’s the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Their members are not terribly concerned about human rights, particularly within their own borders, but they sure are consumed by hatred for Israel.

In March 2016, UNHRC decided the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should release a blacklist of companies “conducting activities in or related to Israel’s settlements,” a move cheered on by supporters of the movement to boycott Israel. However, there were various delays, and that database did not materialize until this month.

In what certainly looks like a clap-back at the Trump administration’s Peace to Prosperity plan for Israelis and Palestinians timing-wise, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet released a list of 112 companies that operate beyond Israel’s Green Line. Not so coincidentally, 94 of the named companies are based in Israel. Six are American companies, including Airbnb and General Mills.

As with the Arab Boycott, this is about stigmatizing Israel and raising the cost of doing business with Israeli Jews. Eugene Kontorovich, director of the Center for International Law in the Middle East at George Mason University Scalia Law School, emailed, “Many of the American firms being targeted have no presence there, but simply do business with companies that do business there. They are simply being blacklisted for refusing to discriminate against Israeli Jews in the provision of their goods and services.”

Unlike the European high court’s recent discriminatory labeling decision, this blacklist doesn’t start with the force of law behind it. However, it can still do real economic damage. As The Jerusalem Post noted, “UNHRC documents have no standing in and of themselves, but are often used as the basis for UN decisions elsewhere.”

Shurat HaDin president Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, who participated in last year’s litigation against Airbnb, emailed, “Exclusively focusing on Palestinians’ claims of occupation and targeting Israel while ignoring all the other so-called ‘occupied territories’ like Northern Cyprus, Western Sahara and Tibet, underscores the Commission’s true agenda. . . . In earlier centuries dictators and despots employed bills of attainder to unlawfully criminalize the conduct of one individual or entity and to punish them without any trial or hearing. Today the UN Commission and its blacklist serves this same despicable role.”

UNHRC is holding Israel to its own, separate standard. In so doing, they lean into the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism.

It might be noted that the UN’s Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief Ahmed Shaheed suggested that the UN adopt the IHRA definition as part of his global antisemitism report last year. However, with the publication of the blacklist, that adoption looks incredibly unlikely. (The special rapporteur did not respond to a request for comment.)

For anyone who doubts that this list is an organic outgrowth of UNHRC’s standing agenda Item 7 and all about punishing Israel, consider that the UN has never published such a list for any other disputed region. Also, as UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer tweeted, this list “turns the UN into Ground Zero for the global anti-Israel boycott campaign.”

At bottom, this blacklist was created to harm Israel, not to help the Palestinians. Its publication benefits the Palestinians neither diplomatically nor economically.

On the first point, Darshan-Leitner observes that the Palestinians remain bound by the Oslo Accords, which require direct negotiations with Israel about borders. On the second, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics noted that in 2017, “The average daily wage for [Palestinian] employees in the West Bank was 98.8 shekels… Gaza Strip 56.7 shekels… in Israel and the Israeli settlements 233.3 shekels.”

There is no question that Palestinians benefit from a strong Israeli economy. Profitable companies can hire more workers, both Israeli and Palestinian.

Palestinian Media Watch also reports that “Palestinians prefer to work for Israelis rather than Palestinians for several reasons. Firstly, the salary is more than double . . . Palestinians working for Israelis are protected by the same laws as Israeli workers, including health benefits, sick leave, vacation time, and other workers’ rights, whereas these protections are not granted by Palestinian employers. As a result of the better treatment by Israelis, Palestinians choose to work for them.”

However, if Israel’s enemies inflict economic damage through boycotts, those companies will be forced to lay off employees, including Palestinian employees. Sinking ships benefit nobody aboard.

The blacklist is scheduled to be formally presented during UNHRC’s new session, which began this week in Geneva. Meanwhile, the United States’s UN Ambassador Kelly Craft has already called the list’s publication “shameful.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has “call[ed] upon all UN member states to join us in rejecting this effort, which facilitates the discriminatory boycott, divestment, and sanction (BDS) campaign and delegitimizes Israel.”

Sen. Ted Cruz has called for an executive order clarifying that American laws opposing Israel boycotts extend to the UN, withholding money “equivalent to the funding provided to the UNHRC and the OHCHR, and impos[ing] visa and travel restrictions on the officials responsible for this campaign, including High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.”

Is the rest of the world listening? It’s time to see who’s willing to stand up everybody’s human rights.

Black History Month Sidelines African-American Triumphs For Politics,"The first black studies department opened at San Francisco State University in 1968, much to the chagrin of conservative black columnist George Schuyler, who had advocated teaching black history since he began his journalism career in 1923 at the black socialist monthly magazine The Messenger.

His objection had to do with the radicalization, politicization, and attendant distortion of black history. Schuyler fearlessly mocked patronizing white liberals and attacked exploitative white communists. During his extended travels to the South in 1925-1926 for the Pittsburgh Courier, Schuyler reported on the accomplishments of black areas of towns and cities and came to admire people like “Mr. James,” who built up a profitable produce wholesale company in Charleston, West Virginia.

In the 1920s, despite segregation and Ku Klux Klan resurgence, most black Americans took great pride in economic independence and their performance as soldiers in all the country’s wars. Black leaders such as James Weldon Johnson, Kelly Miller, and William Pickens staked their claim as Americans and distinguished themselves from black Africans. In 1922, they took part in the bipartisan “[Marcus] Garvey Must Go!” campaign against the black nationalist who had ludicrously declared himself the president of Africa. In the 1950s, Schuyler began championing Booker T. Washington and his belief in black economic self-empowerment.

This is a far cry from Democrats’ disrespectful reaction to President Donald Trump’s public honoring of 100-year-old Tuskegee Airman Brig. Gen. Charles McGee during the State of the Union address. It reveals the influence of white socialists and communists who radicalized young blacks, primarily on college campuses in the 1960s. In Schuyler’s April 23, 1955, column, he reported on the “bore from within” strategy discussed in a Political Affairs article and warned readers to expect “a mass invasion of Reds, crypto-Communists and fellow travelers into the NAACP, Urban League, churches, fraternities, societies, etc.”

Teaching the Wrong Version of Black History

This strategy included education. White socialist Tom Kahn enrolled in 1960 at Howard University to radicalize black students while pretending to fight for civil rights. In 1956, Spelman College hired Howard Zinn, who had been a card-carrying Communist Party USA member from about 1948 to 1953. In 1963, he was fired for insubordination by the college’s first black and first male president.

Zinn used the cover of civil rights to radicalize students. He turned them against the administration — as well as their parents and church leaders — by encouraging them to defy rules about chapel attendance and curfews. In the Aug. 6, 1960, issue of The Nation, Zinn bragged about transforming a Christian women’s college from what he denigrated as a “finishing school” to a “school for protest.”

The evidence of Zinn’s disdain for the United States, which he called a “myth” and a “pretense,” is abundant. For example, he told students that under our system of government, voting made no difference, and in the 1960s, he advocated on behalf of the North Vietnamese enemy as he led anti-draft protests. In his magnum opus, “A People’s History of the United States,” first published in 1980, Zinn grossly distorted American history through selective and misleading quotations, critical omissions, plagiarism of dubious sources, and invention of facts to present a racist country, irredeemable because of capitalism and nationalism.

Sadly, the Zinn version of black history is the one almost always taught to students during Black History Month. As I point out in my book, “Debunking Howard Zinn,” Zinn studiously ignored the achievements of the anti-communist NAACP, praised black communists who often sacrificed fellow blacks to the party, and valorized the Black Panthers and black Muslim separatists such as Malcolm X. Zinn also left out key critical facts about Frederick Douglass, making him appear, as Zinn did with all other blacks, a helpless victim of the American system — wherein blacks’ only hope lay with white communists, a fact unnoticed by today’s critics of “white saviorism.”

Changing the Celebration of Black History

The Zinn push has unfortunately tainted the celebration of black history. Even the U.S. Department of Education newsletter linked to suggested readings including Malcolm X’s autobiography and James Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time.” Time Magazine recommended six movies, all about anger, sexuality, or the Black Panthers.

It did not recommend “Created Equal,” the stunning new movie about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In fact, Time gave most space to a group inspiring riots and police assassinations, Black Lives Matter. During the first week of February, teachers in the country’s three largest school districts — New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles — wore Black Lives Matter T-shirts to school.

Time cited Ursula Wolfe-Rocca, a white teacher from Portland, Oregon, and lead curriculum writer at the Zinn Education Project. Although enjoying nonprofit status as an educational organization, ZEP is overtly political, offering Zinn-inspired downloadable lessons, videos, and books that weave in Trump attacks, conduct smear campaigns against educational organizations, such as the Bill of Rights Institute, and offer materials for the Boston Teachers Union to participate in the Black Lives Matter Week of Action and “Abolish Columbus Day” classroom kits for lobbying on the state, city, and school level.

Time presents ZEP as meeting “the rising demand for resources.” As evidence of the success of teaching black history, the article offers the 80 percent success rate of students, including in underperforming schools, in passing a pilot Advanced Placement African diaspora pilot program. The Columbia Teachers College’s Institute for Urban and Minority Education website, where it was developed, reveals an ideological focus on “common experiences across the diaspora such as imperialism, resistance to oppression and cultural practices.”

After also delving into “music, dance, cuisine, customs and other foundational chapters in the black experience,” students are encouraged to “engage in an inner dialogue with themselves” — part of what one teacher called a “healing process.” “Success” is measured by testimonials from students such as Thalias Henry, who said “he is now able to draw a direct line from the African continent to ‘events in the real world’ such as Ferguson and Black Lives Matter.”

Kayla Sergeant came to appreciate the connection of a “special food … to a specific tribe or people.” According to an article published in the last days of the Obama administration by the American Historical Association’s then-President Patrick Manning, the program was intended “to reach beyond the existing AP constituency.” But the 100 percent nonwhite participation rate indicates a reverse bias. The focus on the diaspora continues the focus on African and not American identity.

The ‘1619 Project’ Injects Racism into America’s DNA

Similarly, The New York Times’ “1619 Project” attempts to de-mythologize the 1776 founding date by presenting the arrival of a ship bearing about 20 Africans in 1619 as the beginning of an exploitation legacy. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also takes that time, “400 years ago,” as the launch for its series on Black History Month, interviewing Morehouse College professor Frederick Knight, who “specializes in the African Diaspora.” (Yet the linked black history quiz concerns mostly black celebrities and sports stars.)

Under the “1619 Project,” even the old Marxist slogan of “black and white, unite and fight” is abandoned, as the project’s critics find a home at the World Socialist. The charge of racism being in the DNA of this country recalls Zinn’s claim that American racism was not limited to prejudiced individuals but baked into the structure of the country. The “1619 Project” delivers a false toxic narrative of universal black victimization and universal white oppression, spurring racial animus.

It’s time to restore real black history: recognition of achievement and overcoming obstacles as citizens integral to this great nation. The examples of George Schuyler, Booker T. Washington, Charles McGee, Clarence Thomas, and Mr. James offer good places to start during Black History Month.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/26/too-often-black-history-month-sidelines-african-american-triumphs-for-politics/,2020-02-26
Why The Right Should Make Immigration A Race Issue—And How,"Over the past few years reports by BuzzFeed News and American Affairs described how some businesses try to hire low-wage immigrants over Americans. They post job ads, as required by the H-2 guest worker program, but in towns far from the job site. They ask for Spanish-speaking workers although the work is in a non-Hispanic area. They set strict requirements that only Americans must meet. Some flat-out say they never hire U.S. workers.

These practices have resulted in multiple complaints from Legal Aid, legal briefs filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and at least one instance of federal imprisonment.

Derrick Green was a casualty of these practices. In 2012 the father of six was fired by Hamilton Growers after just three weeks of picking squash. Green’s quick dismissal reflected a pattern. According to the EEOC, in 2009 Hamilton Growers fired or pushed out “the overwhelming majority” of Americans while few Mexican guest workers met that fate.

Something similar happened in 2010 and 2011. The next farm Green worked for also preferred guest workers over Americans, and he was fired after a few days.

Immigration Disproportionately Harms Blacks

Farms and other low-wage employers often argue they need low-wage immigrants to keep costs down. That argument, however, must be weighed against the fact that mass low-wage immigration hurts American workers, especially poorer ones. Research supports this idea.

A 2016 National Academy of Sciences report stated that “a high degree of consensus exists that specific groups are more vulnerable than others to inflows of new immigrants.” The NAS report identifies nine studies that show harms to Americans with low levels of education.

Given America’s racial politics, it makes sense that the left tends to ignore the racial dimensions of low-wage immigration. You see, Green, and most of the workers fired by Hamilton Growers, are black. Two-dozen black people also brought a lawsuit against J&R Baker Farms. A former employee said they “got rid of” their black workers in 2010. A supervisor at Hamilton Growers once allegedly said: “all you black American people, f— you all…just go to the office and pick up your check.”

Since blacks are disproportionately represented among poorly educated Americans, they bear the brunt of low-wage immigration. The left, which claims to be both pro-black Americans and pro-low-wage immigration, of course downplays this tension.

Conservatives also downplay this tension. We don’t highlight enough how much low-wage immigration harms poor African-Americans. This omission is political malpractice. Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini showed that speaking to working-class minorities—70 percent of whom don’t have a college degree—is the best way for Republicans to adapt a diversifying America. Simply put, we must become the party of the entire working class, not just the white working class.

Immigration Is the Place to Start

To get from here to there, conservatives should recognize that as long as it doesn’t cannibalize other ways of understanding our country, and that America’s worst moments don’t define us, there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with using a racial lens. The fact that the left overuses this analysis does not mean we should underuse it.

Unfortunately, decades of missteps have made us inept at discussing race. Since we’re going to have to start doing so more, and to learn along the way, we should choose our battles carefully. When doing something new, you must crawl before you walk. We should thus engage on issues that play to our strengths and on which voters already trust us.

Low-wage immigration is perfect in this regard. We almost have no choice but to double down on the issue. Opposition to low-wage immigration will define conservatives for the indefinite future. So we may as well use it to reach black voters—the minority group we should prioritize outreach to.

Further, low-wage immigration is an issue we know how to discuss. When we engage with black Americans, we will be able to reframe a message we’re already good at delivering.

Conservatives also have well-fleshed out policies to address low-wage immigration. For all the intra-right disagreements, there is a conservative approach to immigration that can rely on decades of right-leaning policy research.

Yes, The Border Is a Race Issue

The political calculus is also simpler. Both the left and right agree that many blacks oppose low-wage immigration. So not only does this topic keep our coalition intact, it raises tension within the Democratic one. Especially since Democrats have gone all-in on open borders, blacks who care about this issue have only one viable option, unlike on issues such as lowering crime sentences.

Leftists act as if black politics consists only of police brutality, Civil War statues, and reparations. But low-wage immigration deeply affects blacks and should also be a black issue. It’s our job to make the connection.

Consider the liberal trope that American institutions are racist and were designed to hurt blacks. On hearing these arguments, conservatives usually just protest. Although protest may be necessary, it doesn’t have to end there. It would be smarter to concede that general point then pivot to immigration.

We should not be afraid of this concession. American slavery was uniquely evil, and its legacy has clearly shaped many American institutions. Although specific liberal arguments can be overwrought, this point is uncontroversial.

If all American institutions are rooted in slavery and discriminate against black people, that includes all institutions, including immigration policy. We should force liberals to explain why they have ignored this, and highlight that people who look like Green are the main victims of our anti-black immigration system.

E-Verify as Reparations

We must stress how much African-Americans need policies like border security and e-Verify. More than any other group, they need a tight low-wage labor market, and will benefit from conservative immigration policies. Leftist immigration policies have a profound disparate impact against blacks, something we should repeat mercilessly.

We can we also use immigration to expand the debates about reparations. African-Americans themselves don’t agree on what it means, and it’s often viewed as much more than cutting a check. Both scholars and activists argue that reparations must address “underlying structures.”

That is why social policies as diverse as voting rights, health care, housing policy, student debt, and small business loans have all been framed as reparations. Immigration is always missing from this sort of analysis. But if housing policy and health care can be viewed as reparations, then so can e-Verify. The RAISE Act is a much better reparations bill than anything Democrats have offered.

Join the Fight for Black Jobs

Centering black outreach on immigration is not just smart politics. Making these arguments will allow us to engage with race in America on our own terms. Instead of running away from the topic, we would broaden our national conversation. America would no longer able to reduce black people to the issues that leftists choose.

Black Americans have always debated how to best achieve economic progress. Many reasonably believe that fighting racism must lead this struggle. But other prefer to focus on socioeconomics directly. Perhaps nothing better illustrates this intra-black tension than the official name of Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous 1963 gathering: March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

The point here is not to settle this dispute, but to highlight that African-Americans themselves disagree on whether fighting white racism is more important than fighting for black jobs. Democrats have chosen the first path. Until now we have chosen neither, which helps explain why we lose black voters by such a staggering margin.

But there is a sizable black market for the other path, and we should try to reach them. Nationalism and opposition to low-wage immigration will help. At its core, these positions are about valuing all Americans and their jobs before others. This message will resonate with many black Americans.

Meet The Black Musicians Who Revolutionized Gospel Music,"Rev. Charles Albert Tindley knew firsthand about the “raging storms of life” and “trials dark on every hand.” Tindley was born in 1851, the son of a slave and a free woman. His mother died when he was four, and he was sent to live with his mother’s sister for fear he would be sold into slavery if he stayed with his father.

Tindley knew about the world tossing him “like a ship on the sea,” as he was hired out to work from an early age and got no formal schooling. He taught himself to read from scraps of newspapers. When he was 17, he married Daisy Henry, and in 1875, they moved to Philadelphia, where he got a job as a janitor at Calvary Methodist Episcopal Church. The young couple knew about being “destitute of the things that life demands, want of food and shelter.”

The Hymns of Charles Tindley

Tindley was a man of faith and a hard worker. He continued his studies, asking friends at the local synagogue for help learning Hebrew, and taking Greek by correspondence with Boston Theological School. He was later ordained in the United Methodist Church with high academic scores despite no college degree.

After serving in several parishes, in 1902, Tindley was appointed pastor at Calvary Methodist, the same church where he had worked as janitor. It had 130 members when he took over. The mixed-race congregation grew to more than 12,000 under his leadership, the largest congregation in the region. He gave away between 500 and 600 meals each evening and allowed the homeless to get hot baths and clothes in the church basement. Tindley Temple United Methodist Church is still active today and honors his memory.

Tindley was known as a powerful preacher but also as a hymn writer, whose songs of life’s storms pointed to the “stiller of the storms,” Jesus. Sometimes called the “grandfather of black gospel music,” Tindley’s hymns combined a soulful understanding of life’s troubles with Christ’s saving promise in a musical style more common to spirituals and blues. His hymn “I’ll Overcome Someday” was the inspiration for the protest song “We Shall Overcome.”

Today, many of his hymns are published in Methodist and Baptist hymnals. Two of the most well-known are “By and By” and “Stand by Me.” The Five Blind Boys of Alabama, five-time Grammy winners, were founded at the state school for the blind in Talladega, Alabama, in 1939. They were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2003, have sung for three presidents, and here sing Tindley’s “Stand by Me.”

Tindley’s deep faith and his heartfelt, soul-stirring words and melodies inspired many, including a composer and musician in Chicago, Thomas Dorsey.

Thomas Dorsey, the Father of Black Gospel Music

Dorsey, known as the “father of black gospel music,” learned religion from his Baptist minister father and piano from his music teacher mother in Villa Rica, Georgia, where he was born July 1, 1899. After his family moved to Atlanta when he was 11, Dorsey struggled in school and found a haven listening to local black musicians.

After World War I, the Dorseys relocated to Chicago, where they joined Pilgrim Baptist Church. Thomas dropped out of school and began playing piano in speakeasies, later leading Ma Rainey’s jazz band. He and slide guitarist Hudson Whittaker recorded the 1928 hit “It’s Tight Like That,” eventually selling 7 million copies.

But Dorsey’s world came crashing down in 1931 when his wife, Nettie Harper, died giving birth to their first child, Thomas Andrew Jr., who died a day later. In his devastating grief, he wrote “Precious Lord, Take My Hand,” a gospel hymn so powerful it became a favorite of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2007, and was included in the “Songs of the Century” list by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Dorsey often worked alongside Mahalia Jackson, known as the “queen of gospel.” Born in poverty in New Orleans in 1911, Jackson grew up singing in church. At the age of 12, she was baptized by the pastor of Mount Moriah Baptist Church in the Mississippi River. She later moved to Chicago, where she met Dorsey in 1939, and they began touring.

Jackson sang to raise money for the civil rights movement, and in 1950, she became the first gospel singer to perform at Carnegie Hall. Jackson said she hoped her music could “break down some of the hate and fear that divide the white and black people in this country.” “Precious Lord, Take My Hand” became her signature song, which she sang at King’s funeral.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as1rsZenwNc

“I sing God’s music because it makes me feel free,” Jackson once said about her choice of gospel, adding, “It gives me hope. With the blues, when you finish, you still have the blues.”

Dorsey wrote hymns that drew on his background in blues, featuring syncopated notes in an eight-bar blues structure, but his words spoke of despair overcome by faith and hope in the Lord. He established the first black gospel publishing company, Dorsey’s House of Music, in 1932, and founded the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses, still in existence. In March 1982, he was the first black person elected to the Gospel Music Association’s Living Hall of Fame, and in August 1982, the Thomas A. Dorsey Archives were opened at Fisk University.

Summing up his life’s music, Dorsey said it has been “from God, for God, and for his people.”

As with Tindley, many of Dorsey’s hymns were published in hymnals and songbooks as early as the 1930s, crossing denominations and transcending race. White publishers such as Stamps-Baxter and R.E. Winsett, among the top publishers of singing convention songbooks, included these songs by black writers in their widely distributed books.

Cleavant Derricks and His Signature Gospel Music

“The same songs that ministered to impoverished blacks enduring discrimination in the Jim Crow South spoke to the hearts of disadvantaged whites whose lot seemed similarly dismal due to hardships spurned on by the Great Depression and the World War II years,” wrote Don Butler, who chartered the Nashville-based Gospel Music Association.

One of those songs, “Just a Little Talk with Jesus,” published in 1937, “has probably been sung more than any convention by more quartets than any other. The Oak Ridge Boys used to sing it at every one of their programs,” Butler wrote.

The hymn was written by Rev. Cleavant Derricks, born May 13, 1910, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Derricks studied at Cadek Conservatory of Music in Chattanooga and American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville. He was a pastor and choir director at several black Baptist churches and is the father of twin actor sons Cleavant Derricks and Clinton Derricks-Carroll, born in 1953.

“Like Dorsey and Tindley, Derricks would write songs that addressed daily hardships, praised a loving, sustaining God and spoke of the heavenly reward believers would gain following their labour on earth,” Butler wrote.

Like many songwriters of the time, Derricks was compensated for his songs with a small quantity of free songbooks. Just before he died, a record producer found out Derricks had never received a dime for his hymns. He contacted a licensing service and got them to pay royalties for six years, a total of $14,000. Clearly, Derricks wrote for his love of the Lord, knowing he could tell him “all about our troubles” and he would “hear our faintest cry and answer by and by.”

Derricks was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1984, and many artists, both black and white, perform his songs.

The Fairfield Four, founded at Fairfield Baptist Church in Nashville in 1921, recorded their first album in 1946, perform a cappella, and are known for revitalizing and preserving the oldest style of traditional spiritual and gospel singing. Best known for their appearance on the soundtrack and on screen in “O Brother, Where Art Thou?,” The Fairfield Four’s album “Still Rockin’ My Soul,” released in 2015, won the Best Roots Gospel Album. The group sings Derrick’s signature song, “Just a Little Talk with Jesus.”

New PAC Aims To Pick Up Black Support For GOP,"President Donald Trump has wasted no time in celebrating the economy’s historic low in the black unemployment rate in his annual State of the Union address last month.

“The unemployment rate for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels in history,” Trump said proudly before a nationwide audience. “African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time-low. African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.”

Black unemployment has indeed plummeted under the Trump administration due to a roaring economy. While the number has ticked back up to 6 percent, according to the latest government statistics, the rate of unemployment for African-Americans reached a record-low of 5.4 percent in August and hasn’t moved much higher. Trump’s remarks still met little appreciation from House Democrats in the audience, showcasing the polarized nature of our modern political climate.

When asked about the low unemployment rate for black Americans on Fox News last week, the No. 3 Democrat and highest-ranking African-American in the House Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina even condemned the administration’s success, scoffing that African-Americans were actually “fully employed” during slavery.

“I’m saying that the African-American unemployment is not the lowest its ever been unless you count slavery,” Clyburn said. “We were fully employed during slavery. So it all depends how you measure this up.”

Clyburn’s comments are emblematic of Republicans’ inability to garner high percentages of the black vote in the past several decades, despite being black Americans’ party of choice for decades before that because Republicans successfully ended slavery. Democrats, who now consider black Americans a vital part of their base, will condemn any progress made with black Americans under Republican leadership by exhaustingly seeking to stigmatize the GOP has racist.

A new political action committee launched this election cycle seeks to change that. The New Journey PAC, which began operations this year, seeks to bring black voters back into the Republican Party.

“The Republican identity has been successfully demonized by a relentless 50-year campaign to portray it as a party of ‘White supremacists,’ bigots, and compassionless agents of inequality,” the PAC website states. “That changes now. We are embarking on a journey.”

Earlier this month, the new committee launched its first attack ad against Democrats, charging the left-wing party of running “the hood” by propping up failing schools and favoring “hand outs instead of opportunities.”

“For 50 years, one party has been in charge of the ‘hood,” explains a narrator. “They’re against school choice for parents and even vouchers for our children… They side with crime bills and prison, instead of good education and jobs… Gangs don’t run the hood, Democrats do.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWRAcUpfVz8

Autry Pruitt, the group’s CEO, told The Federalist he aims to move 15 percent of the black vote from the blue to red this cycle, with a particular focus on Texas, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida. To do that, Pruitt wants to open up “engagement centers” in each state to facilitate renewed GOP outreach to African-American communities.

The purpose of the centers, Pruitt said, is to provide a lost linkage to “conservative thinking, Republican politics, the right side of the aisle and what’s going on in the community.” Each would “service the community with information” and provide context to statements so often immediately written off as racist such as the president’s tweets.

Pruitt said each center would also act as a kind of safe haven for Republican candidates down the ballot, such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, to go and listen to African-Americans spill their grievances in a civil forum with the implicit agreement that the Republican guest is no racist in the eyes of the audience. Republicans “can’t get to the black vote if you’re scared of black people,” Pruitt argued, noting that Republicans have been absent from minority communities.

How many centers the group will open up is “wholly dependent on the donor base,” Pruitt said, but added that he wants the PAC to open up one in each of the targeted states this summer.

“Once the engagement centers are there, it’s going to engage,” said Pruitt. “It’s going to be there to answer tough questions.”

Building up black support has become a key element of the Trump re-election strategy, made clear earlier this month when the campaign aired an ad touting the president’s efforts on criminal justice reform the same week that Trump made black progress a major component of his State of the Union address.

The president has a steep hill to climb. In 2016, Trump won only 13 percent of black men and 4 percent of black women. While still better than Mitt Romney in 2012, who only won 11 percent of black men and 3 percent of black women, voter turnout among African-Americans was down by 7 percent from President Barack Obama’s re-election year, according to the Pew Research Center.

Despite the low levels of support, many remain optimistic about Trump’s chances to provoke the beginning of realignment. On Thursday, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott predicted that Trump would capture 50 percent more black votes than he received four years ago.

Pruitt said Trump presented a unique opportunity to reclaim African-American support because the president has showcased his ability to listen on issues such as over incarceration. Trump is the “first Republican in a very long time where if there is something with injustice happening, he’s willing to listen,” Pruitt said.

Although a 6 percent rise that Scott predicted won’t be easy and doesn’t sound like much, it could certainly mark a significant shift in several key states for Trump and have a down-ballot effect on other Republican candidatess. Pruitt is still aiming for a 15 percent shift, though that might not happen this fall.

Pruitt emphasized that the new PAC’s goals are not short-term. The New Journey CEO said he is working to build a long-standing organization that will continue to build with each election cycle, and the engagement centers will operate year-round.

“This is not going to be won by one election cycle. It can’t be,” Pruitt said. “We’ve got a long way to go.”

Slanted 1619 Project Meets Competition From Black Academics,"The Bob Woodson Center and Washington Examiner is offering an alternative to The New York Times and Pulitzer Center’s “1619 Project.” Theirs is aptly named “The 1776 Initiative.”

Responses to the 1619 Project are popping up everywhere. Countless conservative scholars have weighed in, both Civil War and founding-era historians have teamed up to cry foul, Hillsdale College is offering an online course to counter the narrative, the Heritage Foundation has compiled a trove of essays titled “1776: A Celebration of America,” and the National Association of Scholars has started a “1620 Project.”

The 1619 Project Is Infiltrating Institutions

Responses can’t come soon enough. Despite criticism, the 1619 Project is barreling ahead. The New York Times purchased ads that ran during the Super Bowl and the Democratic primary debates.

School districts all around the nation are accepting the free 1619 curriculum from the Pulitzer Center to use in classrooms. According to Pulitzer’s Annual Report, it has successfully brought the 1619 curriculum to 3,500 classrooms around the nation. The CEO of Chicago Public Schools has pledged to send every Chicago high school 200-400 copies of the 1619 Project as a supplemental resource.

Four other school districts, including Washington, D.C., have adopted the curriculum district-wide. In most cases, the districts using the 1619 Project are bypassing normal textbook and curriculum review processes, according to RealClearInvestigations.

1619 language and sentiments are also infiltrating our political and popular culture. In an early Democratic primary debate, former Texas Rep. Beto O’ Rourke said Americans should “mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, 1776, but Aug. 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will.”

More recently, on Feb. 13, during a debate on the Equal Rights Amendment, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer mischaracterized the Declaration of Independence in 1619 fashion when he stated, “Our founders declared ‘all men are created equal’ in their Declaration Of Independence. Surely, no founder, if they were writing that document today, would have said ‘men,’ when men meant white, property-owning men.”

Even more recently, Democrats in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson’s home state, changed the name of an annual dinner they host from Jefferson-Jackson Dinner to Blue Commonwealth Gala. Further, the media has embraced Nikole Hannah-Jones, organizer of the 1619 Project and author of the flagship essay. She has appeared on “The Daily Show,” “CBS This Morning,” “PBS Newshour,” and “The View.”

What Is the 1776 Initiative?

The 1776 Initiative is headed by Bob Woodson, a former civil rights activist, head of the National Urban League Department of Criminal Justice, and resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The 1776 Initiative also has a plethora of well-known and respected contributors, such as syndicated columnist Clarence Page, Shelby Steele of the Hoover Institution, Glenn Loury, professor of economics and social science at Brown University, and many more.

The Woodson Center press release describes the contributors as a “consortium of top black academics, columnists, social service providers, business leaders and clergy from across America who are committed to telling the complete history of America and black Americans from 1776 to present.”

The project was announced Feb. 14 at the National Press Club and aims to “uphold our country’s authentic founding virtues and values and challenge those who assert America is forever defined by its past failures, such as slavery.” The initiative represents one of the largest coordinated efforts to challenge the 1619 Project and its attempts to “reframe the country’s history.” The 1776 Initiative authors are also seeking to combat the negative effects they believe the 1619 Project will have on future generations of African Americans.

The Washington Examiner announced the 1776 Initiative in honor of famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass’ birthday, saying the contributors share an aversion to the “infantilization of black America or the denial of blacks’ agency throughout their history” and a distaste for “pseudo scholarship” that reduces American history to a history of racism and that consigns black Americans to the permanent status of victim.

The 1776 Initiative is not a fact-checking endeavor. The group will leave that up to the numerous historians who have been writing to The New York Times such as Gordon S. Wood and Allen Guelzo. Instead, this initiative will be both inspirational, demonstrating the amazing successes African Americans have had in this nation, and aspirational, highlighting ideas for solutions to problems that still plague African American communities.

The 1776 Initiative Defends America’s Founding and Ideals

The primary thrust of the initiative is to counter the narrative that slavery is not just America’s original sin but also defines the nation’s foundational character. By reinforcing the idea that 1776 is the nation’s true founding, this new initiative reiterates that America was founded on the idea that “all men are created equal,” the very principle that eventually led to the abolition of slavery and created the freest nation on Earth. All essays within the 1776 Initiative can be read on the Washington Examiner’s website or at the Woodson Center’s website.

In the initiative’s flagship essay, “The Crucial Voice of ‘1776,’” Woodson writes that the 1619 Project is shaking the moral ground of the nation, threatening to tear it apart. He argues that the 1619 Project is the latest weapon of identity politics proponents, wielded to further racial divisions. The prizes to be won are entitlements and reparations.

Woodson blames the demise of black families today not on racism, but on the propagation of welfare, which detached work from income and thus led to a moral decline. He writes:

Prior to this time — even in the face of Jim Crow laws, legalized discrimination, and a lack of voting rights — the black community did not experience the wide-scale despair and destruction that we witness today. This is because, even in the face of great adversity, those earlier black communities had a Christian moral code of conduct, a conviction of self-determination and mutual assistance, and strong families and communities to fall back on.

In Clarence Page’s article titled “‘A dream as old as the American dream’: Embrace black patriotism over victimization,” he disputes the 1619 Project’s claim that America’s founding ideals were false because they did not immediately apply to everyone residing in the country at the time. He writes that the founders established a tradition of guaranteeing inalienable rights to some and the legal mechanisms to extend those equal protections to others, without, he notes, taking rights away from others. Page goes on to write, “We must disrupt the long-held stereotypes of black people as helpless bystanders in their own history.”

Although the field of responders is getting crowded, such a large volume is necessary and welcomed to combat the 1619 Project’s attack on America and its founding ideals.

Why Social Justice Investing Is A Load Of Politicized Hypocrisy,"As major corporations ditch their goal of maximizing shareholder value for maximizing societal value according to social justice, one wonders: Is woke capital really dedicated to its principles, or is it bowing at the altar of progressivism for PR and profits?

Recent news regarding BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, brings this question to mind. The behemoth firm, which manages almost $7 trillion in assets, recently committed to a slew of environmentalist initiatives that will affect its business, and the businesses in which its clients invest.

Its decisions matter because everyone from mom-and-pop investors to nation-states—representing hundreds of millions of people—through BlackRock collectively own stocks, bonds, and other instruments covering the entire global marketplace. Indeed, you may own shares of one or several of BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds, or have exposure to the company through a retirement plan. If so, you are effectively voting for its political agenda.

BlackRock’s latest efforts include everything from substantially increasing the number of so-called “ESG” (Environmental, Social, and Governance) funds its clients can invest in, to removing investment offerings in companies big in the thermal coal production business, to pushing the companies BlackRock’s clients own to adhere to “UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as Gender Equality and Affordable and Clean Energy.”

Accordingly, BlackRock recently joined the “Climate Action 100+,” which, per the investment manager, “engages with companies to improve climate disclosure and align business strategy with the goals of the Paris Agreement.”

If BlackRock’s initiatives seem at odds with the purpose of a financial services company, they should. It believes it is “on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.” Two statements from CEO Laurence Fink sum up the company’s ethos:

In a letter to chief executive officers, Fink wrote: “We don’t yet know which predictions about the climate will be most accurate, nor what effects we have failed to consider. But there is no denying the direction we are heading. Every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change. ” [Emphasis added]

” [Emphasis added] In a letter to BlackRock clients, Fink wrote: “We believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing.”

In several previous letters too, BlackRock has called for businesses to focus on environmentalism. BlackRock’s actions and words are consistent with the company’s historical focus on the ESG space, which has mushroomed over the last 15 years as woke capital has ascended.

They are consistent with the company serving as one of 181 major signatories to the Business Roundtable’s recast “Principles of Corporate Governance,” which in August 2019 shifted its focus from “shareholder primacy” to serving “all stakeholders,” by in part “protect[ing] the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.”

And they are consistent with the Davos crowd. Indeed, this year, Davos’s main theme was “sustainability” and giving meaning to the concept of “stakeholder capitalism.” That is, the world’s global elite paraded on the leftist bandwagon—one that will run over the little people whose lives they seek to micromanage, and who have been rebelling against them at the ballot box throughout the West.

Left unasked is this: If BlackRock and its sustainability-driven corporate allies are true believers in their principles, how can they square them with their extensive ties to the world’s biggest polluter, China?

BlackRock has been expanding its China investment offerings, mirroring the move by major index providers to increase their weightings toward Chinese companies. Investors therefore are not only helping fund Chinese polluters, but strengthening the economy that underpins the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that permits such pollution in the first place.

Of course, setting aside the cognitive dissonance on matters of “environmental justice,” untold millions of everyday people—through large asset managers and their ESG vehicles—have become unwitting backers of companies like Hikvision. The Hangzhou-based concern produces the cameras that surveil the Uighur Muslims being held in China’s gulags. Still more people fund through their portfolios the American big tech companies that continue to partner with it.

How can the woke sophisticates in the financial services world and beyond who knowingly underwrite China, and nefarious CCP-backed companies, claim to be genuinely progressive ESG devotees, let alone proponents of justice of any kind?

Ties to China are one example of the contradictions inherent to Woke Capital. As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine noted in his “Money Stuff” newsletter, BlackRock’s letter to management:

…will arrive on the desk of the CEO of, I don’t know, giant state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco? A company where, according to Bloomberg data, BlackRock is the largest outside shareholder. A company that did a bond offering last year—after the Saudi government murdered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi, after Fink sent that letter about making society better—in which BlackRock was also a big investor.

Cynicism is merited, and for reasons that go beyond the ability of large companies to, on the one hand, claim fealty to leftist notions of morality and virtue, while on the other doing business with those who survive by flouting those standards.

What makes woke capital even more “problematic” is not just the apparent hypocrisy, but that it may be rigging the game in its favor, morphing into woke crony capital. ESG investments can quickly become “sure things” through government subsidies, tax incentives, and contracts. Remember Solyndra?

And since investment managers like BlackRock serve governments—via pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, or directly—are we to believe these governments plan on making losing bets? Are we to believe they intend to make losing bets in particular when they can tip the balance in favor of their investments? And to whose campaign coffers do we think these businesses will be contributing?

Sure, the leadership of large corporations may truly believe in leftist principles—after all, it is those principles that predominate among our elites. Such leaders might also be paying more than lip service to such principles to appease leftist pressure groups that might otherwise shake them down—or, as in the case of BlackRock, to avoid the ire of skeptical regulatory agencies. If public relations affect a firm’s reputation, and the market ascribes a value to that reputation, PR becomes a legitimate concern—a “cost of doing business.”

But the world’s largest multinational corporations did not grow so big by prioritizing political leftism over profit. The smart money would suggest that today, at very best they are seeking to create the appearance of “doing good” as leftists define it, while in reality investing in government-sponsored sectors with a potentially more attractive risk-reward profile—made all the more attractive should government punish non-ESG-friendly firms. Recall Hillary Clinton’s plans for coal, for example.

Once companies’ interests align with those of government, any related actions deserve substantial scrutiny.

If companies wish to prioritize leftism above all else, that is their prerogative. Clients and shareholders can take their business elsewhere should they take issue with it. But once companies’ interests align with those of government, any related actions deserve substantial scrutiny.

Environmentalist policies in particular demand heightened sensitivity given they are often justified by hysterical predictions that prove false, and require massive economic intervention and the destabilization of daily life on the stated basis of unimpeachable Science (that itself may well be tied to government funding).

Those at the top of the corporate world will no doubt continue to lecture Americans about how they ought to feel and vote on any number of issues, and seek to use their power to impose those views upon us. In the long run, if the twin tandem of Big Government and Big Business are aligned in these efforts, the question will be whether there is anything to prevent non-leftists from being run over roughshod.

In the short run, one might ask whether given the trends of woke capital, our cancel culture, and the erosion of common bonds in our body public, Americans are headed towards self-segregation by political ideology. Maybe in some sense we are already there. But what does it say about the state of our union?

"Letter To Fed: Shareholders Should Drive Investing, Not SJWs","Conservatives are taking on woke capital, calling it out directly for its effort to infuse leftist principles into investment decisions affecting the health and well-being of the U.S. economy and the livelihoods of millions of Americans who make it run.

On April 15, 79 people, including former members of Congress, senior administration officials, leaders in business and finance, representatives of conservative organizations, and the founder of Green Peace, signed a letter calling on the leader of this movement, BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink, to reconsider his position.

The letter is the product of the Back to Neutral Coalition, a new group led by Justin Danhof, Bill Meierling, Steve Soukup, and others, which seeks to counter the left’s weaponization of American business. It comes amid the Federal Reserve’s selection of BlackRock to execute financial market transactions on the Fed’s behalf, and advise the Fed on its open market operations, spurred by the COVID-19 stresses on the economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was copied on the letter.

BlackRock counts $7 trillion in assets under management, making it the world’s largest investment manager. Fink has sought to use BlackRock’s power to promote concepts including “stakeholder capitalism” and “ESG” — environmental, social, and governance-based investing, which has exploded over the last 15 years.

BlackRock Should Work for Shareholders, not SJWs

Per the Business Roundtable’s new “Principles of Corporate Governance,”signed onto by 181 major businesses including BlackRock, stakeholder capitalism is dedicated to reorienting business principles away from “shareholder primacy,” and toward “all stakeholders,” in part by “protect[ing] the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.”

The drafters of the letter to Fink contend, “By opting to enter into a public market, BlackRock received the benefit of outside investment funds with which to operate and grow. However, the bargain of that benefit is that you must act in good faith and with a fiduciary responsibility to maximize returns for those investors” — that is, not for social justice warriors (emphasis added).

They add: “This economic crisis makes it more important than ever that companies like BlackRock focus on helping our nation’s economy recover. BlackRock and others must not add additional hurdles to recovery by supporting unnecessary and harmful environmental, social, and governance (ESG) shareholder proposals.”

With respect to ESG, BlackRock recently committed to a slew of environmentalist initiatives that will affect its business. Its efforts include not only increasing ESG investment offerings, but booting companies in the thermal coal production business from the portfolios into which its clients can invest, and pressuring the firms its clients back to adhere to “UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as Gender Equality and Affordable and Clean Energy.”

In response, the signatories to the Fink letter say:

In light of your influence, we are especially concerned that your support for some ESG shareholder proposals and investor initiatives brings political interests into decisions that should be guided by shareholder interests. Shareholders and society at large benefit when companies are guided by values such as producing quality products and services, having integrity in dealing with customers and vendors, and developing the talents and skills of employees. But when a company’s values become politicized, the interests of the diverse group of shareholders and customers are overshadowed by the narrow interests of activist groups pushing a political agenda.

The letter goes on to say that activist groups — such as “environmental nonprofits, labor unions, left-leaning pension funds, [and] ESG-focused asset managers” — sponsor the majority of ESG shareholder proposals, meaning their political aims diverge from corporate shareholder interests. It continues:

Furthermore, these ESG proposals will add an extra-regulatory cost on these companies requiring them to spend their shareholder capital. This may harm everyday Americans who are invested in these companies through pension funds and retirement plans. While this won’t affect folks in your income bracket, this may be the difference between affording medication, being able to retire, or supporting a family member’s education for many Americans.

It bears noting that while claiming fealty to leftist principles, BlackRock has been expanding its China investment offerings, mirroring the move by other major index providers to increase their weightings toward Chinese companies. BlackRock is also one of two asset managers responsible for managing the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board’s nearly $600 billion Thrift Savings Plan, which is slated to increasingly channel the savings of federal employees into CCP-backed firms, including those that develop weapons used to threaten the life and limb of our servicemen.

This flow of funds into China from U.S. capital markets strengthens the economy that underpins the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), permitting China to persist as the world’s largest polluter.

Americans Are Unknowingly Backing Woke Capital

Setting aside the cognitive dissonance on “environmental justice,” untold millions of people — through large asset managers like BlackRock and the ESG vehicles they offer — have become unwitting backers of companies like Hikvision, the cameras of which are used to surveil Uighur Muslims in China’s gulags. This is to say nothing of Americans’ investments in the big tech companies that continue to partner with the CCP.

You may well be participating in BlackRock’s campaign, through owning shares of its iShares exchange-traded funds, or a company retirement plan managed by BlackRock. Regardless, BlackRock’s politicization affects nearly everyone, given its reach into stocks, bonds, and other instruments covering the entire global marketplace that make up its $7 trillion in managed assets.

The letter concludes that it is imperative, particularly during these times, to divorce politics from markets:

At this moment especially, all of us — including BlackRock — must be focused on the nation’s economic recovery. Investors, many of whom are terrified that their retirement funds have been lost or are at risk, need to be assured that managers of their assets are focused on those facets of business performance that are likely to produce a sustained return on investment and a return to financial normalcy. Extraneous political considerations serve only to sow confusion and exacerbate instability, when instability can least be tolerated. In unsettled environments such as this, true ‘sustainability’ is demonstrated by robustness and resilience, not by highly politicized trends and fads.

This effort is particularly notable given the extent to which leftists have sought to impose their views on Americans through corporations. A conservative counterweight dedicated to pushing politics out of boardrooms is more than needed.

Spa Workers Making More On Unemployment Upset To Receive Small Business Loan,"One small business owner in Washington state thought her employees would be thrilled at the news her company became one of the lucky few to receive federal assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

Jamie Black-Lewis, who operates two spas in the state received two loans for her shuttered businesses, totalling $177,000 and $43,800, according to CNBC, while thousands of other closed enterprises were out of luck as funds for the federal relief program exhausted by the end of last week.

Black-Lewis will now be able to keep her 35 employees on payroll at Oasis Medspa & Salon in Woodville and Amai Day Spa in Bothell after being forced by the state to layoff staff and forgo a paycheck herself.

Much to Black-Lewis’ surprise however, her employees were not so pleased.

“It was a firestorm of hatred about the situation” Black-Lewis told CNBC.

To have the low-interest loans forgiven under the PPP established in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, much of the money must go to paying employees to keep staff on payroll and maintaining the same number workers. Businesses that receive aid under the program have until June 30 to bring back those who have been laid off or furloughed.

Black-Lewis had intended to adhere to those conditions to avoid sinking into further debt that could jeopardize her business. Her employees however, had discovered they could rake in more money on unemployment rather remaining on payroll after Congress beefed up benefits with an added $600 a week on top of whatever states provided in the CARES Act.

“I couldn’t believe it. On what planet am I competing with unemployment?” Black-Lewis told CNBC.

The $2.2 trillion stimulus package passed in March also extended the duration of benefits for those out of work. Lawmakers rushed through the legislation however despite the consequences to get relief to people faster and included direct payments of $1,200 to all individuals who earned less than $75,000, regardless of employment on top of the increased unemployment benefits.

That has led to many low-wage workers bringing in more money on unemployment than they would working their regular jobs, such as those working at Black-Lewis’ spas.

“They were pissed I’d take this opportunity away from them to make more for my own selfish greed to pay rent,” Black-Lewis said to CNBC,

New unemployment data released from the Department of Labor Thursday morning shows more than 26 million Americans have filed new jobless claims within the last five weeks. More people have now filed for unemployment than the entire populations of Mississippi, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Idaho, West Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Washington D.C., Vermont, and Wyoming combined.

Congress is expected to replenish the PPP with $310 billion in fresh funds on Thursday after congressional Democrats blocked funding to sustain the program for two weeks.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/23/spa-workers-making-more-on-unemployment-upset-to-receive-small-business-loan/,2020-04-23
Dear GOP: Stop Cowering Before Bad-Faith Race Card Attacks,"“Dear Mitch McConnell,” wrote Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr., last week. “Why don’t you just go ahead and call Barack Obama the n-word? You know you want to.”

What led to this over-the-top racial attack from Pitts? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had the audacity to disagree with an approach taken by former President Barack Obama, who leaked audio of himself critiquing the Trump administration after new revelations about his involvement spying on the incoming Trump administration. McConnell thought it an unwise deviation from norms.

The political media used to agree about the importance of this norm. In 2007, former President Jimmy Carter “incited a tsk-tsking tsunami in the capital,” wrote The New York Times’ Mark Leibovich, for the offense of “failing to observe the protocol that former presidents should speak respectfully of their successors, or at least with some measure of restraint.”

In 2013, CNN ran an article on President George W. Bush headlined, “Bush, like most predecessors, holds tongue on successor.” It’s a norm that most presidents have violated privately and several publicly, but a norm nonetheless. While it might seem a relic of a previous time, McConnell certainly wasn’t out of the ordinary in supporting this norm. And nothing McConnell said suggested he was racist in any way.

Everything Is Racist

Obama also gave a rather political commencement speech last week in which he further criticized current political leaders. That drew the attention of former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove, who said, “It is so unseemly for a former president to take the virtual commencement ceremony for a series of historically black colleges and universities and turn it into a political drive-by shooting.”

The term “drive-by shooting” is common parlance in politics. To take one recent and high-profile example, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway both used the phrase to describe what the media and other partisans were doing to Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation by deploying last-minute, unsubstantiated accusations against him.

The Washington Post’s Eugene Scott even wrote a column headlined, “Has ‘drive-by shooting’ replaced ‘high-tech lynching’?” to discuss the phenomenon. He noted the phrase was “obviously absent of the racial implications” that he noted regarding Clarence Thomas’s description of his ordeal as a “high-tech lynching.”

But now, we are told by partisans, such language is verboten. Far-left websites pounced and blue checkmarks followed, denouncing Rove as racist for using the common metaphor. Staff writer Jon Lee Anderson at The New Yorker said Rove “just happens to wear a suit instead of a white sheet.” Subtle!

Tried and True Political Messaging

This schtick of calling Republicans racist when they do, well, anything is not new. And it ramps up in election years.

The Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart said opposition to a coordinated campaign of political spying and leaking is the same exact thing as “birtherism,” a dodge that deserves to go in the annals of partisan excuse-making. Democratic nominee Joe Biden began his campaign last year, in the midst of a thriving economy, by making false but oft-repeated accusations against Trump regarding Charlottesville.

In 2012, then-Vice President Joe Biden told a black crowd in Virginia that the Republican Party was planning to “put you all back in chains.” In 2000, a Democratic group ran an ad saying that then-Gov. George W. Bush’s stance on hate crimes legislation was equivalent to killing James Byrd, the black man dragged to his death by three white supremacists in a truck in Texas. Policy proposals to ensure the integrity of ballots are routinely presented by Democrats as not just racist but as having no function other than racism.

Although Democrats have a near-monopoly on the black vote, the welfare, busing, and affirmative action programs they passed have failed to produce the promised results. And let’s not forget Democrats remain completely hostage to the demands of teachers unions, which resist basic educational reforms and have made trapping kids in underperforming schools the “civil rights issue of our time.” Because unions demanded it, one of Obama’s first acts as president was to kill off D.C.’s school vouchers program — which disproportionately helped poor black kids.

Democrats have done a lot of grandstanding but very little to revise, improve, or get rid of these expensive programs. Republicans have done next to nothing as well, and without even the political grandstanding.

Unfortunately, Republicans are too often tone-deaf to the concerns of black Americans. Republicans also support what they call “free trade,” which in practice is frequently a complex framework of rules and regulations to pick winners and losers among international corporations. This has hollowed out domestic industries and destroyed key jobs for African Americans.

Democrats remember that they need black voters every few years, so they whip up support with over-the-top rhetoric tarring Republicans as racist. Oddly, though, the Republican response has been to either limply respond or to join in by calling the more populist among them the same names. When Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was the victim of Joe Biden’s drive-by shooting, his response was to meekly assert that such rhetoric was “unacceptable.” That’ll learn ’em, Mitt!

And some Republicans have shamefully joined in the practice of calling people they disagree with on policy racist. Some spent years branding their co-partisans as racist when they support populist policies such as real borders and immigration controls. They even put forth a “Republican Autopsy” that accepted the left’s arguments that such views were racist and needed to be renounced.

In this regard, President Trump may have been the first and only Republican able to withstand this, as much as he’s been able.

Go On Offense

Republicans might consider stepping out of their long-term defensive crouch. If they’re not racist, they shouldn’t be so afraid of being called it by partisans. They should denounce vicious rhetoric and not be afraid to advocate for their political philosophy and the policies that philosophy produces.

They should speak against the messages of The New York Times’ 1619 Project and in defense of the United States, her founding, and her Constitution. They should loudly note that they feel no need to apologize for the country, and to praise it for being the place — despite its many faults — with the most opportunity in the world for all its people. They should be unafraid to note the problems with viewing everything through a divisive, racialist lens and to dismiss racists of all stripes.

Republican establishment figures have fallen for the claim that suburban mothers can be turned Democrat by attacks on Republicans as racist. They haven’t figured out that not only does cowering in the face of media and partisan bullies make you appear weak and unworthy of political alignment, but a lot of voters resent it. A lot of voters wonder why Republicans aren’t doing a better job of defending the country and its founding principles against leftist rhetoric and attacks.

Democrats need huge percentages of minority voters to continue winning. Republicans should fight hard for black and Hispanic voters by adopting broadly popular proposals on foreign policy, jobs, economics, and social policy. Moving away from unnecessary interventionist wars helps, and the Republican Party finally figured that out after a few decades of being captured by interventionists.

Economic deregulation and trade policy focused on strengthening America’s backbone of industrial jobs and production also helps. A focus on all the ways government overreach has harmed family formation and family strength also helps. Black voters are more amenable to being courted than Republicans realize, and are well aware that Democrats have done very little to improve their prospects even as they take their votes for granted.

However, Republicans will have to do more than talk to earn black votes. They have to deliver. In this respect, Trump and other congressional Republicans have made positive steps by embracing and enacting criminal justice reforms. They also need to make an effort to go into black communities and truly listen to and respond to black voters, as well as recruit more black candidates and send a clear message the Party of Lincoln welcomes them as partners and not just as vote suppliers.

Have Some Self-Respect

In the meantime, Republicans leaders should wake up. Racist attacks are a distraction specifically intended to shut down debate. Even more pathetic are Republicans who accuse Trump and his supporters of being racist because they think it will generate them good press. Quislings are never respected, and the media are all too happy to use spineless Republicans as a cudgel against the entire party and conservative movement.

Instead, Republicans need to drive home the message that accusing others of racism without merit is immoral and dangerously bad for our civic health. Grown adults need to learn how to have policy disagreements without accusing others of racism. McConnell should stop acting like he’s the good Republican and Trump is the bad Republican. To powerful voices in the media and social media mobs on the left, all Republicans are the same. There is no way to virtue signal enough for them, so stop doing it.

So to McConnell and other Republican leaders, the next time a pundit or columnist goes out of his way to attack you with vicious racial rhetoric, have some confidence and stand up for what you believe. Tell them to shut up and make an actual argument in defense of this country and her ideals. You know you want to.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/20/dear-gop-stop-cowering-before-bad-faith-race-card-attacks/,2020-05-20
"Biden Tells Black Voters If They Are Undecided, ‘Then You Ain’t Black’","Former Vice President Joe Biden seems to be taking his black support for granted.

“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re voting for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a Friday morning appearance on The Breakfast Club podcast.

.@JoeBiden: ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black."" @cthagod: ""It don't have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact — I want something for my community."" @breakfastclubam pic.twitter.com/endvWnOIV2 — America Rising (@AmericaRising) May 22, 2020

“It don’t have nothing to do with Trump, it has something to do with the fact I want something for my community,” said the show’s host, Lenard Larry McKlevey, also known as “Charlamagne tha God.”

Thoughout the primary, Biden rode on a wave of black support to carry him through the crowded contest and save his campaign with a game-changing victory in South Carolina where black voters make up more than half the state’s Democratic electorate. Biden carried two-third’s of the black vote on election day landing him a nearly 30-point victory resurrecting a sunken campaign going into Super Tuesday where Biden began to finish up securing the nomination.

Now Biden is expecting this key bloc of reliably Democratic voters to stick with him through November. One way Biden might seek to retain his base for the general includes putting a woman of color on the ticket. Biden has already pledged to pick a female running mate.

“I’m not acknowledging anybody who is being considered, but I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple,” Biden said.

Two of those women likely include former presidential rival and California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris who eviscerated Biden on the June debate stage last year over bussing and imaginary Georgia Gov. Stacey Abrams who is taking a break from her made-up duties running the state to actively campaign for the number two spot.

Abrams however, has never even won a statewide contest casting doubt on her ability to help pull of a nationwide victory let alone run the White House in Biden’s absence, who is 77-years-old.

BET Founder Says Biden Should Spent Rest Of Campaign Apologizing,"Black Entertainment Television (BET) co-founder Robert Johnson condemned former Vice President Joe Biden following comments from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Friday claiming that if black voters are still undecided, then they aren’t black.

“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” Biden said on “The Breakfast Club” podcast.

“VP Biden’s statement today represents the arrogant and out-of-touch attitude of a paternalistic white candidate who has the audacity to tell Black people, the descendants of slaves, that they are not Black unless they vote for him,” Johnson said in a statement to Fox News. “This proves unequivocally that the Democratic nominee believes that Black people owe him their vote without question; even though, we as Black people know it is exactly the opposite. He should spend the rest of his campaign apologizing to every Black person he meets.”

BET is the largest cable network dedicated to a black audience.

Biden’s remarks also drew swift condemnation from conservatives shaming the comments as offensive.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott chastised Biden’s words as “the most arrogant, outrageous comment that I’ve heard in a very long time,” but also said he was unsurprised, given Biden’s hand in crafting the 1994 crime bill as a Delaware senator leading the Judiciary Committee.

Biden, Scott said, sponsored the legislation that “jailed more African-American males than any other legislation.”

“And President Trump comes along, and through his criminal justice reform, corrects the absolute mistakes made by Joe Biden; 1.3 million African-Americans voted for Trump. He’s saying to 1.3 million African-Americans that you are not black? Who in the heck does he think he is?”

Former Utah Republican Congresswoman Mia Love, who now works as a CNN political commentator, also issued a sharp rebuke over Biden’s comments, labeling them as “racist.”

“It’s incredibly offensive to hear this kind of rhetoric from anyone, let alone the presumptive nominee of the Democrat party,” Love wrote on Twitter. “Joe Biden’s comments were racist and an affront to the millions of African Americans who voted Republican in 2016.

Some Democrats, however, came to Biden’s defense, while others claimed the former vice president was just making a “joke.”

"'Joking' Or Not, Biden’s ‘You Ain’t Black’ Remark Reeked Of Identity Politics","In the pages of the Washington Post Friday, writer Jonathan Capehart spent 650 words or so explaining why Biden’s viral comment from only a few hours prior was “clearly a joke.”

The remark Capehart addresses in his article, titled “Come on. Biden’s ‘you ain’t black’ comment was clearly a joke,” occurred on an episode of “The Breakfast Club,” wherein the former vice president and presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee closed out the show with the startling and cringey comment, “I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”

“When heard in the context of the previous 17 minutes and 21 seconds, you know that Biden is joking around,” Capehart writes in Biden’s defense. “Perhaps he got a little too comfortable talking to a community with which he has a strong relationship that spans decades. Add to that being the vice president to the nation’s first black president and you know his affinity with black folks runs deep.”

Biden’s senior adviser Symone Sanders took the same line, insisting the former vice president’s comment was “in jest.”

Period. — Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) May 22, 2020

Biden’s comment, which naturally exploded on Twitter, drew criticism from detractors who said Biden should stay locked away in his basement, away from the cameras. But they also garnered insane defenses from the likes of Nikole Hannah-Jones, who recently secured the Pulitzer Prize for her fallacy-laden 1619 Project for the New York Times.

Twitter is so amazing pic.twitter.com/T3V6joPg92 — Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) May 22, 2020

Biden later apologized for his “cavalier” comments, rendering any defense of them as “clearly a joke” irrelevant.

MORE: ""I shouldn't have been such a wise guy,"" @JoeBiden said later in the call with the @usblackchambers ""I shouldn't have been so cavalier. … No one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background."" — Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) May 22, 2020

But the problem with Biden’s remark was never its being too serious. Conservatives criticizing his comment weren’t concerned about the former vice president being “racist,” at least in the meaningless way today’s left uses the term.

Capehart’s reminder of Biden’s “being vice president to the nation’s first black president” or his “affinity with black folks” was unnecessary, for detractors didn’t take offense to Biden’s utterance out of a persuasion that he hates black people.

Rather, Biden’s remark confirms the Democrat’s unwillingness to see black voters as people, as individuals, rather than as a monolithic voting bloc.

According to progressives like Biden and Hannah-Jones, black people who don’t vote for Biden “ain’t black,” in the same way that women who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 “betrayed their gender.” Republicans are clearly far too sexist, too homophobic, too white, and too Christian to garner support from any woman, gay person, minority, or unbeliever. It’s absurd. People don’t vote with the color of their skin.

But despite Biden’s many gaffes, this wasn’t one. The former vice president didn’t misspeak. This commentary aligns with the same nonsense that escapes his mouth on a regular basis as part of his belief system, such as the idea that being black is synonymous with being poor and uneducated — a comment he tried to walk back quickly after realizing its implications.

https://twitter.com/abigailmarone/status/1263818001591209984

Or his notion that choosing a VP from a higher perch in the intersectional hierarchy is morally superior to selecting someone based on their qualifications, character, or even likability. It’s why in the same “Breakfast Club” interview, he made sure to note for the record that he’s considering not just one, but “multiple” black women — two cheers for identity politics — to be his 2020 running mate. “I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple,” he said.

The same Democrats who so desperately want to win back the portion of the electorate they lost to Donald Trump in 2016 are unwilling to see them as unique and individual voters, continuing ever to view them only as a caricatured group.

Charlamagne Tha God Says Biden’s Presidential Ticket Could Bring ‘Voter Depression’,"During an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid, radio host Charlamagne tha God said should the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden select a moderate vice president such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., it would cause “voter depression” among black voters in the 2020 election.

“On top of possible Russian interference and voter suppression, Dems have to worry about voter depression. That’s people staying home on election day because they just aren’t enthused by the candidate,” he said.

Charlamagne tha God criticized Biden for running a lack-luster campaign from his basement and expecting the black vote to turn out without making specific policy commitments to black voters.

“You can’t act like this is the most important election ever, but run a campaign from your basement and, you know, not make some real policy commitments to the black community. Not listening to some of the demands that the black community are making,” he said.

On Friday, Biden appeared on Charlamagne tha God’s radio show “The Breakfast Club,” where the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said black people aren’t black unless they vote for him.

“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re voting for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” Biden said.

Throughout the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Biden has cited the black vote as his key to victory. In the South Carolina primary, Biden received the endorsement of House Majority Whip James Clyburn who helped propel him to victory among South Carolina’s large population of black voters. Six out of ten black voters voted for Biden in southern states during the Democratic primaries. Biden’s tenure as the vice president to former President Barack Obama also bolsters his recognition among black voters.

During Biden’s interview with Charlamagne tha God, he said he is considering multiple black women including failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and California Sen. Kamala Harris.

“I’m not acknowledging anybody who is being considered, but I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple,” Biden said.

After Biden’s interview on ‘The Breakfast Club,” he was forced to apologize for his racist remarks assuming all black people are Democrats. Biden said he regrets his “cavalier” comments about black voters.

According to Charlamagne tha God and Reid, Democrats and Biden are taking advantage of the black vote and an apology for Biden’s comment is not enough.

“Do you think there’s a risk that not just Joe Biden, but the Democratic Party in general just takes for granted that ‘black people are with us,’ so we don’t have to really give them anything else? They’re going to vote for us regardless,” Reid asked.

“I know that’s the attitude,” he responded. “That’s why I don’t even care about the words and the lip service. The apology is cool, but the best apology is actually a black agenda.”

Charlamagne’s Biden Interview Shows How Old Media Lost Its Way,"If the 2016 election revealed the limitations of old media, laying bare the power of unfiltered media use by Donald Trump paired with the inability of crippled institutions to haul their favored and deeply unpopular candidate over the finish line, 2020 may establish the new gatekeepers to America’s political debate. As a cultural factor, it matters more what Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy has to say about government lockdowns than virtually any politician. Mega-podcaster Joe Rogan’s opinions matter more than anyone on cable news. And as Joe Biden found out this weekend, you do not disrespect Charlamagne Tha God.

Most of the attention focused on Biden’s Friday interview was on his certainly memorable gaffe — first spun as a joke, later followed by an apology — that feels like it will dog him for the rest of this cycle. Here was the exchange:

‘Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.’ Charlamagne responded by saying ‘it has nothing to do with Trump,’ but that rather ‘I want something for my community.’ ‘Take a look at my record, man,’ Biden responded. ‘I extended the Voting Rights Act 25 years. I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP has endorsed me every time I’ve run. Come on, take a look at my record.’

First, the NAACP has actually never endorsed Biden, as they do not endorse candidates. And second, that record he references as “second to none” is exactly what Charlamagne was concerned about, particularly Biden’s 1990s crime bill. These are completely justifiable questions, and Biden’s dismissive attitude toward them, and toward Charlamagne, is the real problem for the candidate and his campaign.

“The Breakfast Club,” Charlamagne’s radio show, became a regular stopping point for 2020 candidates during the Democratic primary not just because of the size of its listenership but because of the intensity of his following and the diversity of his audience. Multiple major Democratic candidates gave Charlamagne time for lengthy interviews where they faced challenging questions, leading to more than one tough back and forth.

Now that he’s the presumptive nominee, Biden’s campaign wasn’t interested in giving Charlamagne any more time than absolutely necessary. Twice an aide tried to cut off the interview, prompting the host to express frustration — which led directly to the gaffe.

An aide tried to cut off the interview after 11 minutes because Jill Biden needed the office to do her own livestreamed event, but Biden agreed to stay on longer. After 18 minutes, the aide interjected again, leading Charlamagne to say jokingly: ‘You can’t do that to black media.’ ‘I do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o’clock,’ Biden said, looking at his watch: ‘Uh oh. I’m in trouble.’ ‘Listen, you’ve got to come see us when you come to New York, V.P. Biden,’ Charlamagne said. ‘It’s a long way until November. We’ve got more questions.’ ‘You’ve got more questions?’ Biden replied. ‘Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.’

Biden’s supporters in old media quickly attempted to spin the “you ain’t black” comment. The Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart as a casual joke, while The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones and The Atlantic’s Jemele Hill both defended Biden’s comment as making a justifiable distinction between people who are “racially black” and “politically black.” As David Marcus notes:

Setting aside the weird rhetorical pirouette [Jones] makes in the response, basically saying “you not understanding my point proves my point,” let’s look at what she has to say about Biden. She is NOT defending him. That is made clear. But then she goes on to say that what he said about black voters is actually true. So, then, why isn’t she defending him? It’s because she is allowed to say it but old white Joe isn’t.

But that spin won’t gain much traction, certainly not with Charlamagne, who joined Joy Reid this weekend to say that should Biden select a white woman as his running mate, it could bring about “voter depression.” “You can’t act like this is the most important election ever, but run a campaign from your basement and, you know, not make some real policy commitments to the black community. Not listening to some of the demands that the black community are making.”

In past elections, politicians could operate under the illusion that by talking to the establishers of The Narrative guiding public opinion at old-guard publications could accomplish their goals. That’s impossible now. You can have all the defenders at The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Atlantic you want. But it really doesn’t matter by comparison to the influence of the new gatekeepers, who, unlike the old and tired media institutions, have a relationship with their audiences built on trust and respect.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/26/charlamagnes-biden-interview-shows-how-old-media-lost-its-way/,2020-05-26
Instagram Blocks GOP Senator’s Children’s Book From Being Promoted,"Instagram blocked a new children’s book from Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn and her daughter, Mary Morgan Ketchel, from being promoted on the platform citing the potential that it might “influence the outcome of an election.”

The book titled, “Camilla Can Vote: Celebrating the Centennial of Women’s Right to Vote,” is about a little girl’s trip to a museum where she is transported back to 1920 when Tennessee became the last state to ratify the 19th Amendment passing women’s suffrage. The project came to be Ketchel said, because she wanted to connect little girls to history to celebrate the upcoming centennial of women’s right to vote, highlighting Tennessee’s role in the process along the way.

“This book is written specifically for little girls to help them feel part of history,” Ketchel told The Federalist. “It’s a little feel good, happy book.”

While the children’s history book has nothing to do with current events, Instagram blocked the title from being advertised anyway.

“Your promotion was not approved,” read an Instagram pop-up on Ketchel’s phone two weeks ago in a screenshot shared exclusively with The Federalist. “Your ad may have been rejected if it mentions politicians, topics that could influence the outcome of an election, or existing or proposed legislation.”

“When I started out writing a children’s book about little girls encouraging them to be active in public service, I did not anticipate it to be controversial,” Ketchel said, adding that she submitted an appeal to advertise the title twice and was denied each time.

A Facebook spokesperson told The Federalist that the ad was rejected in error and is now up and running.

“We have policies in place to ensure ads transparency around political ads and given the senator was a co-author it’s reasonable it was flagged but upon review, political ads authorization is not necessary,” said the company.

“This is something for children,” Blackburn told The Federalist, explaining that nowhere in the book does it even mention President Donald Trump or any other politician for that matter.

The only thing political about the book, Blackburn said, was her name appearing on the cover as a co-author reading “Senator Marsha Blackburn” in text that is smaller than her daughter’s.

“It’s about a little girl making the trip to the museum,” Blackburn added, “to talk about the importance of women’s suffrage.” That’s it.

This is not the first time Blackburn has been subject to unfair censorship from social media tech giants.

In 2017, Twitter blocked a Senate campaign ad it deemed “inflammatory” while she was still a member of the House.

.@Twitter shut down our video ad, claiming it's ""inflammatory"" & ""negative."" Join me in standing up to Silicon Valley → RETWEET our message! pic.twitter.com/K3w4AMgW6i — Marsha Blackburn (@VoteMarsha) October 9, 2017

The next day however, Twitter reinstated the video following conservative backlash.

“After further review, we have made the decision to allow the content in question from Rep. Blackburn’s campaign ad to be promoted on our ads platform,” Twitter said in a statement to Recode. “While we initially determined that a small portion of the video used potentially inflammatory language, after considering the ad in the context of the entire message, we believe that there is room to define our policies around these issues.”

Blackburn’s most recent censorship from Instagram comes as Twitter remains under intense scrutiny from Washington after notably fact-checking President Donald Trump’s tweets for the first time on Tuesday regarding mail-in voting.

“There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,” Trump said. Despite Trump’s claims possessing significant merit over the concerns of nationwide mail-in voting implemented just five months out from election day, Twitter tagged the pair of tweets as misleading.

“Get the facts about mail-in ballots,” Twitter tagged on each.

The White House followed up with an executive order Thursday seeking to strip away social media companies’ liability protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a move long-advocated by Washington policymakers on both sides of the aisle including Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri who has reined as perhaps big tech’s biggest thorn on Capitol Hill.

Blackburn has also been critical of the large tech giants in Silicon Valley amassing unchecked power. When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in 2018, Blackburn accused the Facebook executive who also controls Instagram on whether the company had manipulated its algorithms to censor speech.

“It’s just important to know that this is why so many times people say ‘well why is Trump doing something about this,’ it is because conservative bias from the tech companies exist,” Blackburn said. “This is a great example.”

"To Aid Vulnerable Workers Post-COVID, We Must Fix Our Immigration Law","In our temporary pandemic economy, we haven’t been short on ideas about how to limit the effects of future Black Swan events on the hardest-hit Americans. Unfortunately, the ideas I’ve seen — universal basic income, higher unemployment benefits, a $15 federal minimum wage, nationalizing prescription drug manufacturing, cash payments to illegal immigrants, “COVID reparations” — are either too expensive, too short-term, too complicated, or simply too barmy.

Helping America’s working poor better cushion future economic shocks isn’t all that complex, and there’s plenty from economic history to guide us, including past pandemics.

Take Europe’s Black Death of 1347. It too was a virus originating in China. It spread so rapidly that, in the words of a French physician at the time, “it seemed as if one sick person could infect the whole world.”

Before it abated, it cut the European population in half, wiping out villages, towns, and whole family lines. The burial sites were so large, one Italian chronicler described them as resembling lasagna, with layers of bodies laid side-by-side and stacked on one another, with layers of soil between them.

Inexpressible devastation aside, historians describe the period that followed as a “golden age” of sorts for the surviving lower classes. Due to the laboring peasantry being decimated in England, for instance, unskilled wages there jumped by a third. Surviving peasants could bargain for safer work and better working conditions generally. Serfs across the country broke away from the feudal estates that shackled them in place sometimes for generations, leasing or buying the land they had worked on (farmland had also dropped in price due to the pandemic) or simply leaving to find better opportunities elsewhere.

Studied by historians even to this day, the Black Death and its socioeconomic effects provide one of the best and earliest examples of the iron-clad rule of labor economics: When labor pools are small, workers’ bargaining power increases. Conversely, when there are labor gluts — due, for instance, to years of mass immigration — owners, not workers, get to dictate terms. It’s obvious which type of labor situation the working poor need most post-COVID.

How Immigration Changes the Game

Take our own blue-collar “golden age.” Between the early 1920s and mid-1960s, America experimented with being a low-immigration nation, following a conscious policy of easing the expansion of the domestic labor pool by dramatically slowing down the importation of foreign workers. The results were wildly successful. During this time, millions of struggling people found firmer economic ground, renters became homeowners en masse, and America essentially became the first country in the world to create a middle class. There’s little reason this can’t be done again.

In 1939, right in the middle of this period, black sociologist Horace Cayton wrote a book about the labor-immigration dynamic, focusing particularly on black labor’s ups and downs from the time of emancipation — a focus that’s relevant now, since analysts say black Americans have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus’ economic fallout.

Cayton detailed the vast gains black Americans were making in several industries in the new, post-Civil War economy, most of which were reversed by the immigration wave that came at the end of the century. He observed that the immigrants undercut black workers, pushing them out of their jobs. Native whites experienced similar effects, he wrote.

Regarding the coal industry in particular, he recounted how mine operators in Virginia had originally employed almost all native white people as well as black people who had come from the South. But later, Austro-Hungarians, Italians, and Poles began to displace them.

However, with the passage of the restrictionist Immigration Act of 1924, he wrote, such displacement effects began to reverse:

[N]either the cessation of British immigration nor the moving of the native American and non-English-speaking whites into the ranks of the skilled has necessitated the acceleration of the amount of [black] labor used in coal mining, since, until the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, additional increments of labor could always be obtained from southern Europe.

Cayton concluded in 1939: “Today, American industry cannot tap the foreign sources of a labor supply as it formerly did.” My, would things change.

American Workers Have Been Kicked to the Curb

With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, the floodgates for unskilled, foreign labor would again be thrown open. As a result, much of the gains accrued during the blue-collar golden age ground to a halt. Regarding black Americans in particular, says labor economist Vernon Briggs, the 1965 law worked to “marginalize [what] the civil rights movement and legislation of the 1960s sought to redress.”

With no letup in immigration rates since the act was passed, the pummeling of working people continues to this day. Speaking with restrictionist advocate Carol Swain a few years back, southern black pastor and community leader George Burns characterized our current situation thusly: “Often employers would hire blacks because blacks would work much cheaper than whites. Now Hispanics are displacing blacks in many jobs. Hispanics will work for $7 an hour for a job for which blacks and whites expect.”

Having watched for decades employers grow rich off immigration subsidies, while being unfairly branded as “xenophobes” when they complained about it, American workers have similarly felt kicked to the curb by the economic elite.

Hopefully, as the elite rediscover the importance of national borders and limits of globalism after the pandemic, they also rediscover what a nation-first immigration policy looks like and whom it’s supposed to serve.

The Black Boxes Are A Symbol Of Cultural Confusion,"Blackout Tuesday is the most viral cause since Kony 2012. Taking their cues from our heroic celebrity class, millions of people posted plain black squares to their Instagram accounts on Tuesday, standing in solidarity with protesters demonstrating nationwide over the tragic killing of George Floyd.

Many of those posts came from people with good intentions. That it even came into vogue is a positive indication our culture outwardly rejects racism. But the “vogue” part is also where Blackout Tuesday went wrong.

By day’s end, voices on the Left and Right seemed to agree the trend enabled a hollow performativeness, allowing white people to signal their anti-racist virtue without taking any substantive action, and rewarding them for it too. I think that’s mostly correct, although it’s also not all bad.

Grating as it can be, so-called virtue signaling does have the positive social effect of reinforcing virtuous norms, like anti-racism. That ensures mainstream culture remains intolerant of bigotry. Unfortunately, it also incentivizes rhetoric that’s more sanctimonious than it is meaningful, which becomes ever-present and inescapable on our daily feeds, and consequently breeds resentment.

As the nation’s cities burn night after night, Blackout Tuesday successfully went viral because many white people genuinely do not know what to say right now. The trend exploited that confusion perfectly, providing an easy way for people to signal their solidarity without drafting poignant captions or treading clumsily into problematic territory. It worked because it was easy and it was safe. Or it seemed that way, at least.

Ultimately, of course, nothing is truly safe when the far Left functions as judge and jury, and so it was with Blackout Tuesday, which proved to be an unsatisfactory form of activism, drawing high-profile critiques as it gained steam. Some critics argued silence is the wrong response to Floyd’s killing, others rightfully eye-rolled over the millions of white people wading into the conversation with facile black boxes and shallow promises to listen.

The irony is that Blackout Tuesday caught on partially because people hate racism and want to be on the right side of the discussion, but don’t know what that looks like anymore and are afraid to try finding out. So a black box and a pledge to listen seemed like just the way to help. Raised in a culture of moral relativism, millennials muck through difficult political questions, grasping for clarity and certainty, searching for a place to put their trust and faith.

One benefit of the black box is that, in my experience at least, it prevented a lot of people from actually opining, sparing us some additional sanctimony from former high school classmates who want likes more than whatever form of justice they claim to be promoting. But it still grated.

It’s okay to be confused about what’s happening, and it’s good to fight inequality. But the black box is the ultimate symbol of shallow signaling. It involves 10 seconds of effort and little thought. It makes no specific statement, calls for no specific action. At best, it offers support for beliefs the vast majority of the country supports—racism is a scourge, and Floyd’s death was a grave injustice.

There’s no easy way out of this one. Don’t let media and celebrities steer the car. And don’t let them fool us by promoting vague social queues that do more to make people feel good about themselves than solve any problem.

"America’s Elites Attend The Court Of King Mob, Where There Can Be No Justice, No Peace And No Truth","WASHINGTON, D.C. — For months now, driving through Washington, D.C. has stirred a strange, sad, dystopian feeling. Empty downtown streets lined with shuttered small businesses and wandered by drug addicts, the mentally ill and occasional masked workers. It didn’t seem like it would get worse, but then it did.

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, rioters tore through the city, looting shops, spray painting buildings, vandalizing the monument to the man who ended slavery, defacing the memorial to the actual anti-fascists of World War II, and setting fire to an historic church on one of the holiest days of the year.

To drive through Washington on Monday afternoon was to see black, white and Hispanic workers and owners cleaning up shattered glass, boarding over windows, and scrubbing curses and anti-cop graffiti off the walls and doors of their businesses. As I took pictures of the vandalized facades of an office building a few blocks from the White House, a middle-aged black man power-washing the walls next door walked over to say hello.

“This your place?” he asked, gazing at the 114-year-old Georgian facade now decorated with “fuck cops” and other related slogans.

“No,” I shook my head. “My friend bought it just a few weeks ago.”

“They’ll be back tonight,” he replied, raising his eyebrows and nodding in resignation. A few minutes of conversation later, he went back to cleaning his walls and I continued my tour.

Our city got off lucky, compared with the rest. Before Tuesday’s sun rose in St. Louis, a 77-year-old retired police chief was murdered while checking in on his friend’s shop. He’s just one of a host of the black Americans killed in the riots across the country, including a Homeland Security officer in Oakland, a 22-year old looter in Omaha, a young and peaceful protester trying to get away from an increasingly disordered crowd in Davenport, and a Louisville chef who dreamed of turning his outdoor BBQ stand into a restaurant. They were killed by bullets from rioters, police and frightened, threatened civilians alike. And not a one of them was killed for George Floyd.

In America’s cities, buildings have been burnt to the ground. People’s life work and savings dashed by explosions and destruction. Cars have rammed into police lines. People are afraid. And no amount of further destruction is going to help. The positive message that we once rallied around — that just one week ago held the nation captivated in sorrow — is scattered in the ashes.

“There was a car fire last night just outside my living room window,” one downtown resident told me when I check in. “It lasted three hours with multiple explosions.”

I’ve lived in Washington for half my life now. I’ve worked in its bars and restaurants, attended its churches, fallen in love with my neighborhood and bought a house. Washington is my home. It’s a home for my neighbors too, some with a similar background to mine — in their 30s, college educated and born elsewhere — but others who went straight to work after high school and have lived here from the bad old days through the renaissance of the past 20 years. Not one of my neighbors has expressed anything but disgust at the murder of George Floyd. None that I know are rioting either, and this morning from my porch I could see six American flags, two sports pennants and a rainbow flag with “Black Lives Matter” taped to its face — all waving peacefully in the humid spring breeze.

The same peace was not present here 52 years ago, when the riots of 1968 ripped through our city, burning nearby businesses to the ground, chasing the black middle class and nearly all white and Jewish people from the city, and leaving piles of rubble that would lie undisturbed into the next century. Unlike today’s riots, these were a mass uprising of working American black people, and yet like today’s and tomorrow’s riots, they completely failed to cure the problem of human weakness and sin. How could they?

While we can pray to God to help us exorcise hate, fear, intolerance, pride and wrath from our individual hearts, sin is here to stay. So long as society must charge citizens to enforce order, empowered with authority’s monopoly on the legal use of force, the wicked and the weak will abuse that power. The alternative is no police, and with it the very type of street justice we now see delivering verdict and sentence on our fellow Americans under the cover of darkness.

That doesn’t mean nothing can be done to curb police brutality. The complete lack of a commanding officer on the scene of the Floyd murder, combined with the tacit-to-active agreement of Officer Derek Chauvin’s colleagues, compounded by histories of use-of-force complaints about a number of the involved officers, point to serious breakdowns of discipline, training, supervision and culture in the Minneapolis Police Department.

But local reforms are not the goal of the evening’s riots. A quick survey of the slogans and parting artwork exposes the same radical movement with the same radical demands we saw in 2015 and 2016, pursuing the same suicidal tactics we lived through in 1968, barreling toward the same inevitable end of it all: A majority of both Republicans and Democrats supporting the deployment of the National Guard, and a completely natural decrease in public sympathy and support for the causes espoused.

The radical nature of these disturbances is lost on so many of America’s elite, who lack the requisite five years of memory to recall the last time Black Lives Matter exposed itself as the anti-police, anti-capitalist movement it is, storming Democratic stages, shouting down speakers, and providing name-brand, corporate-sanctioned cover for escalating violence — culminating in the murder of five Dallas Police officers.

And this time, far from its previous confinement to liberal tech companies and the Democratic Party, its righteousness is preached by George W. Bush, Nikki Haley, and a host of other happy travelers eager to signal their own shared virtue before King Mob’s throne.

On Tuesday, after days of renewed and escalating violence, destruction, and Klan-like church desecration, #BlackoutTuesday blocked out Instagram, a social media platform that beats even Twitter in the shallow vanity of its daily offerings. The pressure to join in was immense. “You know the industry,” one woman in entertainment media explained to me. “If I didn’t, they [the social justice warriors] would just descend.”

“Damned if I do, damned if I don’t,” a woman in the beauty industry complained.

The American Right to protest went only one way, though. To defy social protocol and share images of boarded up and smashed windows with patronizing criticism of the latest Instagram fashion was a terrible transgression. “Are you trivializing the legitimate grievances of the protesters,” one longtime family friend asked, “by comparing the vandalism of windows to centuries of systemic racism?”

“Property can be restored and is insured,” a college buddy wrote. “Black lives cannot be replaced… #blm movement is very needed, until such time that things change.”

The fashionable sentiments of its defenders are neither rare nor ill-willed. Citing the collective sin of America to make excuses and provide justification for wanton destruction in an unrelated, plurality black city with a black female mayor, black female police chief and majority black police department, though, is deeply wrongheaded. As is the idea that anything positive can be reaped from this madness — a tragic lesson the King Mob has taught us again and again, and will continue to long into the future.

The “attempt to derive a positive philosophy from this assemblage of negatives leads to absurdity and contradiction at every turn,” the great British philosopher Roger Scruton wrote just months before his February passing. “The problem, however, is that contradiction is not regarded by the mob as an obstacle, but merely as further proof of the great conspiracy by which we are surrounded — the conspiracy enshrined in the old majority culture, which told us that we must accept human nature, find our fulfillment within its bounds, and not engage in a futile metaphysical rebellion.”

The “mob,” he observes, “is by nature innocent: It washes its own conscience in a flow of collective indignation, and by joining it you make yourself safe.”

Both the absurd contradiction and the washed consciousness of this collective indignation reach all the way to the top of Washington’s Catholic clergy, from where Archbishop Wilton Gregory protested the president’s planned trip to the St. John Paul II National Shrine, saying he finds “it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we disagree.”

“Even with whom we disagree.”

Baffling indeed. And hardly a display of courage. When the secular elite are in the court of King Mob, it would take courage to stand outside. Courage like the kind displayed by an elderly black woman who co-owns Brooklyn’s Valentine Deli — a deli that was ransacked in the name of Black Lives Matter. The kind displayed by the members of Minneapolis’s African Americans Heritage Gun Club, who are defending small businesses from the destruction perpetrated in the name of this movement for justice.

On his last day on earth, George Floyd was granted no peace. In Wednesday’s long-due announcement of charges against those involved, there may yet be justice. But on our streets this week, there will be neither justice, nor peace, and from the street’s courtiers in power, no truth. It’s a delicate thing, these three, and one we, a human and therefore imperfect society, have been working toward for 2,000 years. None can exist in the absence of any other — and all are banished from the Kingdom of King Mob.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/04/americas-elites-attend-the-court-of-king-mob-where-there-can-be-no-justice-no-peace-and-no-truth/,2020-06-04
Black Lives Matter DC Chapter Condemns Mayor Bowser’s BLM Mural As A ‘Distraction’,"The official BlackLivesMatter DC chapter recently tweeted their disappointment in response to a mural stating “Black Lives Matter” painted on the street in front of the White House calling it “counter organizing” to their demands.

“This is performative and a distraction from [Mayor Muriel Bowser’s] active counter organizing to our demands to decrease the police budget and invest in the community. Black Lives Matter means Defund the police,” they replied to a tweet by Rachel Chason, a Washington Post reporter.

Mayor Bowser, according to NBC4 Washington, renamed the street “Black Lives Matter Plaza” shortly after D.C. Department of Public Works crews and muralists completed the painting, which stretches across 16th Street.

“We want to call attention today to making sure our nation is more fair and more just and that black lives and that black humanity matter in our nation,” Bowser said.

In a reply to a different tweet by New York Times writer Emily Badger, BLM DC called the mural painting a “distraction from real policy changes,” claiming Bowser just wants to “appease white liberals.”

“This is a performative distraction from real policy changes,” they said. “Bowser has consistently been on the wrong side of BLMDC history. This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.”

Defunding the police is just one of the demands named by the official Black Lives Matter organization in response to George Floyd’s murder. In addition to their new campaign, #DefundThePolice, BLM also called for “an end to the systemic racism that allows this culture of corruption to go unchecked and our lives to be taken” and “investment in our communities and the resources to ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive.”

How Capitalists Enrich Themselves By Co-Opting Social Justice Movements,"From the Black Lives Matter movement to Pride month, corporate America is enriching itself through the appropriation of anti-capitalist cultural leftism. Capitalists have co-opted the causes of anti-capitalists, and neither party is fully aware of the incongruity—least of all the leftists applauding a system they theoretically deplore.

Corporations are at least partially aware. Genuine anti-capitalists understand the incompatibility, as do some cynical corporate CEOs who outwardly pivot to cultural leftism purely for financial purposes. But movie stars and pundits and singers whose wealth, past and future, is made off the capitalist system seem entirely unaware that Black Lives Matter, for instance, is an anti-capitalist movement that would render their lucrative careers obsolete if its economic goals were realized.

To seriously engage the social justice movement is to recognize it is openly and honestly predicated on an anti-capitalist worldview. That applies to its work on race, sex, sexual orientation, immigration, and more. In a document commemorating the four year anniversary of Black Lives Matter, for instance, the group’s organizing director specifically listed “capitalist values” as an obstacle to its progress. BLM’s Portland chapter said part of its mission was to organize against capitalism. Right now, a whole lot of capitalists are currently promoting Black Lives Matter—some presumably with good intentions. (The Women’s March, another mainstream favorite, also exemplified this tension.)

Consider this argument in a recent Jacobin article: “[U]ntil we can build a movement that can defeat racism and capitalism, until working people of all races unite against capitalists and their repressive apparatus, it is a good thing that bosses, government officials, and the police who protect them are sometimes reminded that black lives matter through a little proletarian fury.”

On June 1, Occupy The Port tweeted, “This is about structural racism. That means it is about capitalism.” That same day, the Black Alliance for Peace wrote, “Police violence is only a mechanism used to fulfill capitalism’s main mandate to contain and control the working class—in particular the Black and Brown colonized working-class communities—and to protect private property.”

Writing for KQED, Pendarvis Harshaw said the killing of George Floyd as, “gives further evidence that capitalism and racism are a married couple of mosquitoes, pulling blood from black folks, everyday.” Protesters have graffitied “Capitalism is murder” onto buildings during recent demonstrations.

The people are making the connection between Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and the hundreds of black and brown workers dying everyday from the structural violence of capitalism. And when that connection is made there will be no return to ""normal."" — Ajamu Baraka (@ajamubaraka) May 28, 2020

These are representative encapsulations of the worldview which activists and academics organizing protests over Floyd’s death are actually fighting to promote. They’re honest about it. Yet corporations and millionaires have rushed to convey their “solidarity” with the protests and the BLM movement in the last week. That includes actors like Dylan O’Brien and Sarah Paulson, whose careers depend on the capitalist system, and corporations like Intel and AirBnb, whose business models are predicated on it.

Some leftists who support the social justice movement may genuinely believe themselves to be anti-capitalist, despite their unwillingness to and disinterest in actually dismantling the system that made them rich or comfortable or both. Others are more authentically radical. And some simply don’t realize the movement is led by organizers who categorically do not believe equality is achievable in a capitalist society.

That’s why AirBnb’s Instagram post announcing a donation to BLM earned comments like “YES AIRBNB WE STAN YOU” and “World class.”

The far Left is is not winning the argument on economics, although it’s made some inroads. It has, however, won the argument on culture.

(One interesting consequence of the neoliberal embrace of social justice is the demise of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign which, if you buy the thesis advanced by Michael Tracey and Angela Nagle, stemmed partially from his embrace of cultural leftism, pushed by establishment operatives.)

What’s frustrating for radical leftists, however, is they don’t believe their cultural victories are won without dismantling capitalism. But they’ve actually won cultural victories because the people in newsrooms and boardrooms have been imported from college campuses to the working world, and either run these companies or intimidate the people who do. Cultural leftism is fashionable. Economic leftism, quite literally, is not, no matter how concerned Anna Wintour purports to be.

For these reasons, corporations are partially motivated by a sincere interest in helping the black community by announcing donations and flooding social media with their statements of solidarity. But they also fear losing business for staying silent, and they are increasingly convinced shifts in consumer preferences make their overtures good for business too.

That means their lip service to social causes with anti-capitalist underpinnings are ultimately perpetuating the capitalist system. It also means liking a corporate social justice post on a platform facilitated by Big Tech with your iPhone doesn’t make you the ally you think it does.

Capitalism is an essential tool in the fight against poverty. It should be reformed, not dismantled. That isn’t a subversive argument, because corporations and Hollywood and media outlets aren’t yet willing to go full leftist. Some of them don’t want to, and some of them simply have no idea what that means.

The Left’s Normalization Of Collective Guilt Is Ripping America Apart,"I was nowhere near the intersection of Chicago Avenue and 38th Street when George Floyd tragically lost his life. I wasn’t in Minnesota. I was more than 500 miles away. With the exception of the officers at that heartbreaking scene, there are more than 329 million additional Americans who had no part in that terrible evening.

So why are so many people acting as if it were their knee, not Derek Chauvin’s, that pressed down on George Floyd? The answer lies in the concerted effort of radical leftists and their unwitting accomplices to normalize the collectivization of guilt.

The Great Guilting

It’s nothing entirely new. In 1980, Howard Zinn and his Marxist, ahistorical, and repugnant textbook “A Peoples History of the United States” began mainstreaming the idea that Caucasians bore collective guilt for all of America’s past sins. By securing the blessings of the academic intelligentsia, he had support in the most valuable places.

Thankfully, Zinn didn’t have modern-day social media at his disposal. One shudders to think how wide Zinn’s reach could have been with a few million followers on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. But if you’ve looked around the social media landscape recently, you’ve witnessed the unleashing of a radical movement beyond his wildest dreams.

Leftist influencers have convinced millions of Americans that the only way they will be allowed in polite society, the only way they will be perceived as decent is if they accept culpability for Floyd’s death and the “systemically racist society” they apparently helped create.

The radical left demands Caucasians apologize for their “privilege.” They must read, internalize, and publicly praise books on approved reading lists in order to come to grips with their “unconscious” and deep-seated racism. They must shop at black-owned businesses on sites like WeBuyBlack.com, theblackwallet.com, and shoppeblack.us as further proof of their solidarity. But is there much doubt that if the color was changed from “black” to “white,” that the Southern Poverty Law Center wouldn’t label these sites sources of hate?

On June 2, Instagram was flooded with people posting pictures of black boxes in support of Black Lives Matter activists. Quickly, however, an ever-growing list of “suggestions” muddled the “rules” of who should post and in what manner was pleasing to the Blackout Tuesday folks. Actress and feminist activist Emma Watson was attacked on Twitter for both posting the boxes and for taking so long. You can’t win.

Branded for the Sins of Others

It is always good to remind people not to be racist—though it is doubtful just how much reminding is needed between the legacy media, television, and movies all constantly promoting that message.

What’s sad is that so many good, utterly non-racist Americans feel if they don’t go through the “approved” steps they’ll be roped together with actual white supremacists.

Not to be left out, businesses from coffee chains to game developers also feel they must denounce what we have always known to be evil, namely, the unwarranted taking of another human life.

It would be ridiculous and unjust to blame a 20-year-old Russian for the heinous atrocities committed by Joseph Stalin more than 70 years ago. It would still be unjust to blame a 90-year-old woman who lived in the Soviet Union while Stalin was alive for the millions who died under his tyrannical rule.

According to crime statistics compiled by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice, 2,925 black Americans were murdered in 2018. The details show that 88 percent of the perpetrators of these homicides were black themselves. Yet no logical, honest person would blame all black Americans for these deaths. To do so would throw blood onto innocent hands. The radical left, however, has been attempting this sort of collectivization of guilt with renewed vigor ever since the New York Times published its first “1619 Project” essays in August 2019.

A Natural Extension of the 1619 Project

The 1619 Project isn’t about making you feel contempt and anger for those who brought the first black slaves from Africa to Virginia four centuries ago. It’s about making all Caucasians and all Westerners feel as if they piloted the slave ships themselves. Its main thesis—and heinous lie—is that America is an irredeemably vile nation, conceived in sin.

In a disturbing example of the confluence of the 1619 Project and modern corporate guilt-tripping, Ben & Jerry’s issued a statement that reads like an updated version of the radical Port Huron manifesto—only it’s angrier and more incendiary. What does an ice cream company have to do with any of this? You’re not allowed to ask. Sit down and take your medicine.

“The murder of George Floyd,” the dairy brothers proclaim, “was the result of inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white supremacy. What happened to George Floyd was not the result of a bad apple; it was the predictable consequence of a racist and prejudiced system and culture that has treated Black bodies as the enemy from the beginning.”

Then, to prove their outrage bona fides, they go for the gold and tag 1619 for the finisher: “What happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis is the fruit borne of toxic seeds planted on the shores of our country in Jamestown in 1619, when the first enslaved men and women arrived on this continent.”

The statement closes by calling on “white America” to “collectively acknowledge its privilege” and “take responsibility for its past.”

Of the host of problems with the screed published by Ben & Jerry’s is that even if it were legitimate for Americans to “take responsibility” for all of the nation’s past sins, not only is it functionally impossible to do so, but radical leftists aren’t interested. That’s not the point. The point is to keep the anger machine firing on all cylinders. That’s the only way they get the permanent revolution they’re after.

Unlike the sin that man commits to his fellow man, for the authors of the 1619 Project, there is no hope for forgiveness, no chance for reconciliation, no way to atone.

If, as the 1619 advocates claim, the seeds are toxic and the tree is poisonous, then the only thing left to do is burn it all down. Nikole Hannah-Jones, the author of the lead 1619 essay, recently told CBS News, “Destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.” While all Americans are indeed created equal, Pulitzer Prizes are clearly not.

Rebuilding Brotherhood—One Brother at a Time

Americans want to stand with those peacefully protesting injustice. But the radical Left offers either the choice of self-condemnation for evils Americans had no hand in, or to be silent and stay that way. If the second option is chosen, that very silence is viewed as an indictment of “complicity” often seen by the Left as akin to violence itself. Ultimately, that’s no choice at all.

It now appears that Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin will be charged with second-degree murder. Justice will be served, and Chauvin will be tried by a judge and jury of his peers. If the court finds him guilty, the penalty—40 years in prison—will be harsh but fair.

It is horrible, it is sad, and it is tragic, but George Floyd will not be the last man to die at the hands of law enforcement. The next time a life is lost to an abuse of police power, it must be denounced once again, and the perpetrators subjected to our civilized courts of trial, deliberation, and justice. But we need to start finally viewing each other as individuals responsible for our actions, and our actions alone.

Every day, we each commit personal acts of vice, virtue, and all shades in between. As individual men and women, we bear the guilt and reap the penalties for our own sins and crimes. As individual men and women, we earn praise for righteous behavior.

This nation isn’t just built on freedom and equality. Central to the American experience is the chance for a new life, and with it, redemption. If we surrender that, we’ll be left with far too much anger and hatred. And we won’t like what follows.

"While Defending Rioters, The Media Ignores Slain Black Police Officers","Two terrible things just happened only days apart. In Oakland, during anti-police protests outside of a federal courthouse, federal protective service officer Dave Patrick Underwood was killed in a drive-by shooting that was targeted at the police. Another officer was shot but survived.

The killing of Underwood, a black American, has only appeared in a few national outlets—one of which was the Wall Street Journal. Cable news outlets CNN and MSNBC, meanwhile, appear to have completely ignored Underwood’s killing. At best, they glossed over it.

In Minnesota, just two days later, protestors gathered on an interstate highway bridge they believed to be closed. In a stunning video, they were almost run over by a semi-truck. Fortunately, the driver braked and drove in the middle of the road to make it possible for people to get out of the way. It is amazing that no one was injured. Well, aside from the driver, who was pulled out of his truck and beaten.

The trucker, Bogdan Vechirko, was later released without charges after it was determined that he wasn’t targeting the protesters. As it turns out, the real culprits were state officials, who closed the interstate without putting up a blockade or properly warning drivers.

The media ran videos of the truck moving into the crowd over and over. Admittedly, it was a stunning scene. But they left out the part where the trucker was beaten. There was also little to no national coverage after it was determined Vechirko wasn’t targeting the protestors. And some of the media that did cover the lack of charges made it seem like an injustice was being done.

A quick Google search reveals oodles of national coverage of the initial incident—much more than the killing of Underwood received.

Violence Directed Against Cops Is Being Ignored

Two days after the semi-truck incident, a retired St. Louis police captain, David Dorn, was shot and killed while protecting a friend’s store from rioters and looters. A shocking video, live-streamed on Facebook, shows the 77-year-old black American lying in a pool of blood.

Yet Dorn’s death also appeared in only a few corporate media articles and was hardly covered on cable news at all.

In Alabama, a white American cop was killed, although it is unclear if the killing was related to the George Floyd “protests.” The officer, Stephen Williams, was known for bridging divides in the community.

In Atlanta, a black American officer named Max Brewer is in intensive care after he was run over during protests.

All over the country, police have been run over, shot, or bludgeoned by bricks and other blunt objects. Police officers were hit by cars in the cities of Buffalo and New York. In Florida, an officer had his neck slashed.

While one Las Vegas police officer shot in the head could hang on and survive, he may never be the same again. Officers have also been shot in Virginia, Iowa, and Missouri. Including the 50 secret service officers injured in D.C. by Molotov cocktails, nearly 300 police officers have been killed or injured in the last week.

Do These Black Lives Matter?

At least three other black Americans have been killed aside from Underwood and Dorn. One was Italia Marie Kelly, who was killed in a shooting in Iowa when the crowd of “protestors” became unruly. Chris Beaty was a football star and a real estate broker. He saw thugs stealing purses and tried to stop them. “You don’t need to do this,” he pleaded, “there’s a better way.” Then they shot him.

David McAtee ran a popular outdoor eatery in Louisville. He was shot by police after, at least according to surveillance footage, he appeared to fire on officers. Only McAtee’s death was covered by the national corporate media, and the articles emphasized his barbeque business, not the fact that he had likely fired on police before they returned fire.

These are likely not the only black Americans killed in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing. The race of many dead Americans has not been revealed in the media, and some of the deaths have resulted from recklessness. In Philadelphia, a man died after trying to blow up an ATM. In Minneapolis, a looter was shot by a pawn shop owner.

So many innocent people have died. In Detroit, a man was shot and killed during protests by a drive-by shooter. In Minneapolis and St. Paul, aside from the pawnshop killing, three others are dead. Last week, a man’s body was found in an area that saw rioting and no police presence the night before. A woman’s body was found in the backseat of a car. Her body had suffered “visible trauma,” and the car was in an area “overrun with violence in the overnight hours.” And this week, another woman’s body was found in a car, this time riddled with bullet holes.

The Media Ignores the Lights in the Dark

The national media seems incapable of covering any of the uplifting stories during the chaos. In Minneapolis, people of all colors are coming out during the day to clean up their neighborhoods. Americans—in the absence of police protection—have defended their land, businesses, and families using the utmost restraint.

There’s also been plenty of positive instances of Americans bridging racial divides, and of protestors standing up to looters. In one video, mostly black protestors form a chain to keep looters out of a Target store. In another, thugs dressed in Antifa’s “black bloc” uniform, vandalize and loot while black onlookers yell at them to stop. In a set of pictures from Kentucky, black American men intervened to protect a caucasian police officer who was separated from his squad.

The media is intent on dividing us. They repeat the toxic narrative that police officers are targeting and killing black men when the hard data doesn’t come close to backing up their claims. They are willfully blind when “protestors” commit bad acts—like in Virginia, where firetrucks were blocked from going to a burning house that had a young child inside.

When mob violence is shown, they justify it. When the overall damage is too much to bear, they repeat the total fabrication that the carnage is being carried out by “white supremacists.” They gloss over or ignore Antifa’s role in the chaos, even defending the organization.

The Media Must Start Covering All Innocent Victims

Ultimately, the violence we’ve witnessed has been carried out by criminals of all ethnicities and races. It has, however, occurred disproportionately in Democrat-run states and minority neighborhoods. Yet progressive Democrats like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio have allowed violence to take place. In Minneapolis, cops were ordered to withdraw from areas that became lawless, directly resulting in death. Frey even let the Third Precinct Police Station in his city to be burned without permitting the police to defend it.

Progressive politicians allowed this because they take this part of their base for granted. It was a small but vocal element of their base who was rioting, and their supporters who have a voice (and dollars to donate) don’t live in these neighborhoods. Even so, many leftists from the suburbs or untouched upper-scale pockets of the city took to cable news or posted on social media about how the violence was justified. Frey, whose estimated net worth is $9 million, is a member of that elite.

The anguish of Stephanie Wilford, from Minneapolis, an older black woman who can be seen sobbing while she talks to a local reporter about the destruction in her neighborhood, is part of their “progress.” Unfortunately, she and others like her will never be shown on CNN.

The next logical question is this: Can a democratic-republic function when its media is so dishonest, it’s elite so corrupt, and when one of its major political parties allows street violence? The answer is probably not. God help us.

Hoover Fellow: The Black Lives Matter Movement Is Deeply Unserious,"Shelby Steele, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution said Friday that the contemporary civil rights movement under the banner of “Black Lives Matter” was deeply unserious, catering to an old form of victimization that has accomplished nothing to lift up black people.

“There’s a pathos here. It’s like we’ve done this too many times. We’ve been here too many times, we’ve seen this kind of thing and there’s a big hallabaloo and then it sort of fades away and this is already beginning I think to fade. What was it all about? What was the point? What did these various groups, what did they want?” Steele asked on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier.

“Striking to me is that about this particular one is that there was not even a list of demands. Usually there’s always a long, elaborate list of demands. That wasn’t the case here. There’s nothing that you could come away from, this entire episode, the last two weeks or so that’s meaningful,” he said.

Baier then asked Steele about remarks delivered by Reverend Al Sharpton Thursday at Floyd’s memorial service in Minneapolis.

“George Floyd’s story has been the story of black folks because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our necks,” Sharpton said.

“He went on to say that this is the moment and repeated the systemic racism in this country. Your response to that?” Baier asked.

“Al Sharpton is the master of this old form of politics that comes out of the ’60s where we as blacks cry victimization and demand the larger society give us things of some kind or another,” Steele said.

I don’t take Al Sharpton seriously. I know him, he’s a nice person. I will take his message here seriously when he stands before a congregation like that, a black people in America over a tragic event and says what black Americans can do to get out of the situation that we’re in. No one from the president on down anywhere says what role, what’s going on with black America? Why are they so dependent on white America, on the government. That all they can think of is themselves as victims which of course deflates themselves as human beings, undermines their best energies, their best intentions, and so after 50, 60 years now past the civil rights bill, we’re worse off than many socioeconomic categories than we were.

Steele went on to explain that this African-American dependency emerged out of white Americans desperately seeking to prove themselves as non-racist.

“White Americans live under this accusation that they’re not racist. They need to prove that they’re not racist. In order to prove that you’re not racist, you need to take over the fate of black people and say, go with us, we’ll engineer you into the future. We’ll engineer you into equality,” Steele said. “Life doesn’t work like that. We have to engineer ourselves. Period. There is no other way.”

Baier pushed back on Steele’s assertion about an absence of demands from today’s Black Lives Matter movement, including the destruction of law enforcement and reparation payments to African-American communities.

“Is there a solution out there that politically you can get your head around?” Baier asked.

“I will take those things seriously when I also hear from Sharpton and others the argument that we need within the black community to work on the institution of marriage,” Steele said, citing the fact that 75 percent of black children are born out of wedlock with no father.

“I don’t care how many social programs you have. You’re not going to overcome that.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/06/hoover-fellow-the-black-lives-matter-movement-is-deeply-unserious/,2020-06-06
Let’s Look At The Actual Facts About The Alleged Racism of Police,"This past week, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with the second-degree murder of George Floyd, a black man. Footage and photos of Floyd’s death launched protests and riots across the country. Despite there being no evidence yet that the officer was racist, it is simply assumed that racism motivated the Caucasian cop’s abusive actions.

Law enforcement officers can be careless or abusive without being racist. In Dallas, in 2016, a Caucasian man died after being arrested in the exact same way. The officers joked about the man being asleep, but he had died after pleading for help “more than 30 times.”

On Fox News Sunday this past weekend, host Chris Wallace mentioned a handful of cases that he thought showed a racist pattern. He pointed to Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead by a retired police officer in February while out jogging in Georgia. He also mentioned a recent disturbing incident in New York’s Central Park, where a Caucasian woman who was walking her dog called police to report that she was being threatened by “an African-American man.” The man simply told her that the law requires her to keep her dog on a leash.

It’s worth recalling that following the nationwide riots after the Michael Brown shooting, the “Hands up, don’t shoot” aspect of the story was revealed to be false.

The media have helped create a biased perception that is far from the reality of shootings by police. A study conducted by the Crime Prevention Research Center (where I serve as president) found that when a Caucasian officer kills a suspect, the media usually mention the race of the officer. When the offending officer is black, however, any news coverage rarely mentions race.

Furthermore, there’s ample evidence that black Americans aren’t all that fed up with the police. A July 2017 Quinnipiac University poll in New York City found that black Americans strongly support the cops in their own neighborhoods—62 percent approved compared to just 35 percent who disapproved. That approval rating was 11 percent higher than for the New York City Police Department as a whole. It makes sense that people only know their local cops but rely on media reports to form impressions about the parts of the city they are less familiar with.

More recently, a Monmouth University poll surveyed a national sample of 807 adults between May 28 to June 1, 2020, and found that Americans of all races are largely supportive of their local police departments.

Monmouth poll: How satisfied are you with your local police department (Very or somewhat satisfied/ Somewhat or very dissatisfied): College educated whites: 73% / 9%

Non-college whites: 70% / 14%

Black: 72% / 17%

Hispanic/Asian: 68% / 18% — Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) June 3, 2020

Through our own extensive research, my organization found 2,699 instances of police shootings across the nation from 2013-2015. That’s far more than the FBI found since its data is limited to only 1,366 cases voluntarily provided by police departments.

The FBI data has other problems, as well: It disproportionately includes cases from heavily minority areas, giving a misleading picture of the frequency at which blacks are shot.

Our database keeps track of characteristics of both the suspect and the officer involved in each shooting, local violent crime rates, demographics of the city and police department, and many other factors that help determine what causes police shootings.

Officers kill black Americans at a higher rate than their share of the population: 25 percent of the suspects killed were black, 45 percent Caucasian, and 16 percent Hispanic. But that isn’t true where the highest concentration of deaths occur. Black suspects tend to die in larger cities with populations averaging over 600,000 (overwhelmingly run by Democrats), while Caucasians are killed in smaller cities with an average population of 250,000.

Caucasian suspects were slightly more likely to be holding a firearm than blacks (63 percent to 61 percent). Black and Caucasian suspects where both equally likely to have been involved in violent crime when they lose their lives, though blacks who died were more likely to be involved in drug or property offenses.

It’s important to note, however, that police generally have more challenging jobs in cities where blacks are killed. The average city where blacks are killed had a 61 percent higher violent crime rate and a 126 percent higher murder rate than where the average Caucasian was killed.

After accounting for these and other factors, including the average differences across police departments to deal cultural differences in departments, we found that black officers were at least as likely as their Caucasian peers to kill black suspects, but that black officers were more likely to kill unarmed blacks than were Caucasian officers.

The data offered some advice for reducing these attacks. While it can’t explain all instances such as George Floyd’s case, usually when more police are present at the scene of a confrontation with a civilian, suspects face reduced odds of being killed. For each additional officer, there is about a 14 to 18 percent reduction in the suspect’s chances of being killed.

This makes intuitive sense. Officers feel more vulnerable if they are alone at the scene, making them more likely to resort to deadly force. Also, suspects may be emboldened and resist arrest when fewer officers are present.

It is a dangerous fiction that prejudiced Caucasian officers are going out and disproportionately killing black men. But that doesn’t mean that measures can’t be taken to reduce shootings by police. The most obvious step would be to increase the number of officers, to avoid forcing lone, vulnerable officers to make life-or-death decisions.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/08/look-facts-alleged-racism-police/,2020-06-08
Social Media Activism Is A Sorry Substitute For Real Progress,"#BlackoutTuesday on June 2 was a case study in performance solidarity gone wrong, writes Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah. “Why would a silent black square, with no black people in it, qualify as activism messaging?” she asks. “Many white people expressed that they just didn’t know what to do, they were petrified of posting the wrong thing, and this seemed like the best way to thread the needle,” she further notes. But I’d offer there’s a deeper dynamic at work: Americans have convinced themselves that participation in social media activism absolves them from the hard work of authentic civic responsibility.

Attiah, who is black, writes of her frustration with these zealous social-media warriors:

Black people and other activists also had to spend time dealing with messages from distraught white and non-black friends who were overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety at the thought that they had stumbled and fallen while taking their first baby steps toward making a stand for social justice. Many of us realize we will be asked to spend untold amounts of emotional labor trying to guide, teach, soothe white people in these moments.

Though I’m a white conservative, suspicious of the 1619 Project and data-ignorant claims regarding supposed systemic racist police brutality, and though Attiah’s “woe is me, mentoring those over-sensitive white people” sermonizing is silly and overwrought, I can appreciate her annoyance. Her words accurately describe many of the pseudo-activist posts that have populated my Facebook thread since George Floyd was killed May 25.

Social Media Tokenism Is Counterproductive

Deep within the American psyche is a distractibility that is eager for quick fixes. “The habit of inattention is to be regarded as the greatest defect of the democratic character,” noted French statesman Alexis de Tocqueville in his pivotal 1835 book “Democracy in America.” Social media aggravates this tendency, both because of the accelerated pace of content and because the forum is literally addicting, as numerous books and studies are demonstrating.

The social media post requires little intellectual reflection and even less labor. A “social media warrior” can rattle off Twitter posts expressing solidarity with Black Lives Matter from the safety of his home or while standing in line at Starbucks. One can simply repost what some other person has published and feel that calming, self-congratulatory sense of having done something. Like the absurd song “We’ve Got to Do Something” from the 2008 film “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” it doesn’t really matter what the “something” is.

These token gestures can actually be inimical to democracy because they create a veneer of civic engagement that is both superficial and narcissistic. “I’m not racist or part of the problem, look what I did on Facebook,” the social media warrior asserts. In its performative demonstration of corrective and constructive, penitential acts, it promotes a political dynamic that allows the person posting to leave unexamined and untouched his or her real civic duties.

Whatever one thinks of the specific debates regarding police tactics or allegations of institutional and systemic racism, it’s obvious there is a significant, shameless disparity between blacks and whites in America. Remedying that requires more than self-comforting public gestures expressing solidarity with the black community or BLM protesters.

I agree with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who in a June 4 Washington Post op-ed argues that educational opportunities are “a partial shield against prejudice.” They may not be a perfect shield, but they “give people a fighting chance.”

This is especially the case when the proportion of black children raised in single-parent families is 65 percent, more than double the number of white children. As University of Virginia sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox has often argued, family instability is a direct contributor to child poverty.

Real Change Requires Investment

As a former educator and high-school athletic coach, I’ve been involved in tutoring, mentoring, teaching, and coaching children in underprivileged, minority communities across Virginia — in Fairfax, Lorton, Charlottesville, and the Gum Springs neighborhood of Alexandria, where in July 2019, gunmen opened fire on high school students at a playground.

Many of the children I taught, mentored, or coached came from broken homes, often with no identifiable father figure. Sometimes it was hard to keep track of them when parents didn’t pay the phone bill. Such kids can be emotionally distant and distrustful of authorities, making mentorship no easy task.

One elementary school-aged black student I tutored for three years in Charlottesville was suspended for fighting. Another high school-aged first-generation South Asian kid I tutored for two years in Fairfax was expelled for drug possession. In both cases, much of the problem stemmed from bad-influence peers. And in both circumstances, the continued presence of mentors in their lives, especially amid their failures, was critical to helping them persevere personally and academically. Such investment is needed now more than ever, when the percentage of Americans who donate to charity or volunteer is at historic lows.

Americans can debate what the nation needs to right the wrongs of various social, racial, or economic injustice. What isn’t up for debate are some of the simplest, most straightforward ways citizens can help people in underprivileged communities — mentoring, tutoring, or volunteering at secular or religious community centers. My local mentoring and tutoring organization, for example, never has enough volunteers.

If Americans want to know where to start helping their fellow citizens in need, the answer is not far away. They only have to put away their devices long enough to see it.

Had Enough Of Radical Outrage Mobs? Take the Courage Pledge,"I took the #CouragePledge last week. Not because I am courageous but because despite being 20 years removed from my Asian Studies degree, I know Cultural Revolution tactics when I see them. Incriminating entire classes of citizens, forcing public apology after apology after apology for making reasonable but ideologically impure statements, and leveraging personal relationships to forward political ends sounds a lot like 1970 Shanghai.

It’s not.

It’s 2020 America.

Drafted by Sohrab Ahmari, who believes Americans will be “asked to acquiesce to ever more extreme positions, on penalty of their jobs, livelihoods, family relationships and their presence in the digital public square,” the Courage Pledge includes six tenets.

I believe in the inherent dignity of all people.

I will not submit to outrage mobs.

I will stand for the truth, not your truth or my truth.

I will not hang that sign on my office door, make that symbolic gesture and so on if I don’t believe in its message.

I will not denounce my friend.

I am not ashamed of traditional faith or the American flag.

The Cultural Revolution gives us a sobering picture of a society that abandons these principles. No dignity was afforded the bourgeoisie who were publicly tortured and humiliated. Ordinary citizens lived in fear of roving mobs of Red Guards. Young and old were forced to lie about the government, their neighbors, and even themselves. The policing and denunciation of friends and family were widespread, and despising the “Four Olds,” (any aspect of traditional China) was considered communist dogma. The result? Millions sent to labor camps, purged, and massacred in a bloody tumult that lasted years.

Of course, in the United States today, dissidents aren’t being sent to reeducation camps and intellectuals aren’t publicly flogged in the streets. But total government control doesn’t begin by imposing the death penalty on ideological opponents. It begins by policing the speech, and by extension the thoughts, of ordinary citizens. It calcifies when citizens comply with those tactics.

Jordan Peterson notes of the horrors of the Soviet death machine:

Solzhenitsyn laid at the feet of the Soviet citizenry the burden of the absolute catastrophes that characterized that system because of each individual’s propensity or proclivity within the state to lie and deceive constantly about what they thought and what they said. And to be afraid to speak and to be afraid to think and to be afraid to criticize.

Just as widespread violation of these six principles enabled Stalin and Mao’s tyrannical rule, upholding them is an individual’s best weapon against tyranny. But in today’s political climate, adhering to the Courage Pledge is not going to be easy.

Ahmari is “worried that we are going to see a rising tide of progressive repression engulfing ordinary Americans” and notes that “much of this pressure will come from private actors like corporate employers, against whom there is no constitutional defense.”

So, ask yourself: How are you feeling these days?

In the last week, you’ve likely faced pressure from friends, media, or your employer to submit to the new progressive orthodoxy. You’re driving past looted and boarded-up shops in your neighborhood while watching the media fib about the peaceful nature of some protests. You’re receiving emails from your child’s school district that “demand change to combat 400 years of anti-black racism” in America.

Many major companies have issued corporate statements supporting Black Lives Matter, making it difficult for employees to express support for black lives while rejecting the radical Marxist tenants of the movement. You’ve received pyramids from your HR department identifying phrases such as “why can’t we all just get along” and “there’s two sides to every story” as covert terms of “white supremacy.”

You’re being told “silence is violence” in one breath, and in the next told to shut up and listen. You’re being given handouts on how to raise anti-racist children, presuming Caucasian children are racist by default. You’ve watched people repent in cult-like unison of their “white sin” and seen newscasters resign after drawing ire for tweeting “ALL LIVES MATTER—EVERY SINGLE ONE.”

It’s becoming increasingly clear that resisting the “progressive” conformity being pressed down on ordinary Americans requires courage.

If you want to protest against the horrific violation of George Floyd’s inherent dignity, post a black square on Instagram, and display Black Lives Matter swag in your office because you genuinely believe in everything you’re saying and doing, then the Courage Pledge is for you.

The Courage Pledge is also for you if you refuse to display the Black Lives Matter decal because you reject their goal to dismantle the nuclear family. The Courage Pledge is for you if while recognizing the evils of slavery and Jim Crow you refuse to label America as endemically racist. The Courage Pledge is for you if you believe that police should be held accountable when they unjustly kill or use excessive force against black suspects, but also refuse to agree that white supremacy is the greatest threat to our black countrymen.

You may have already signed the Courage Pledge if you’re a Hall of Fame coach who refuses to pile on Drew Brees for venerating the American flag. You may have already signed the Courage Pledge if you are the Mayor of Minneapolis and, despite being surrounded by vocal protestors, you refuse to submit to their demands to abolish the police. You may already have signed the Courage Pledge if you’re a blockbuster author who refuses to bow to the twitter mob after recognizing that “people who menstruate” are called women.

You may have already signed the Courage Pledge if you’re the lone high school freshman I know who refused to stand during the “Black National Anthem” because you believe the Star-Spangled Banner is an anthem for all Americans.

Those familiar with totalitarian regimes recognize this “progressive” orthodoxy is a regressive movement. Instead of moving us forward, it takes us back to the moments which preceded the greatest human rights abuses of the last century.

If you’re concerned about the similarities between our current cultural moment and historic collectivist evils, I urge you to sign the Courage Pledge too.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/09/had-enough-radical-outrage-mobs-take-courage-pledge/,2020-06-09
UCLA Students Demand Two Professors Be Fired For Doing Their Job,"Students are demanding the firing of two University of California, Los Angeles lecturers for doing their jobs, bringing the quest for conformity and identity politics to an absurd new level.

One of the lecturers is Gordon Klein, who teaches accounting at the Anderson School of Management. A UCLA student emailed Klein recently, telling him that in light of George Floyd’s tragic death, black students “are struggling to focus on their educations when there is massive sociopolitical unrest that concerns both them and the future of their plight in this country.” To show support for black classmates, the student, who is not black, asked Klein to offer a “no-harm” final exam that could only benefit black students’ grades.

Klein questioned the appropriateness of race-based special treatment in his email reply, asking, “Do you know the names of the classmates that are black? How can I identify them since we’ve been having online classes only?” If students should receive special treatment based on race, Klein continued, “are there any students that may be of mixed parentage, such as half black-half Asian? What do you suggest I do with respect to them? A full concession or just half?”

What about students who are from Minneapolis? Klein asked. “I assume that they probably are especially devastated as well. I am thinking that a white student from there might be possibly even more devastated by this, especially because some might think that they’re racist even if they are not.”

Klein went on to request guidance from the student on “how to achieve a no-harm outcome since our sole course grade is from a final exam only?” He closed his email by quoting Martin Luther King Jr.: “[R]emember that MLK famously said that people should not be evaluated based on the ‘color of their skin.’ Do you think that your request would run afoul of MLK’s admonition?”

Students are outraged at both Klein’s refusal and what they perceived as a tone of “mockery” in his email. They started a petition on Change.org to get him fired because they think his “blatant lack of empathy and unwillingness to accommodate his students during a time of protests speaks to his apathetic stance on the matter.” According to the students, Klein’s email response was “extremely insensitive, dismissive, and woefully racist.” The petition has already gathered more than 19,000 signatures.

Klein Aims for Equality

Is Klein’s email offensive and racist? It seems he tried to employ rhetorical questions and lay out absurd scenarios to show his student that despite their good intentions, giving special treatment based on race is unfair to all students. One doesn’t have to appreciate the tone of his email in order to conclude that a race-based special accommodation devalues black students’ college education and does them a disservice.

Such accommodations would undermine black students’ intelligence and hard work, re-enforcing the stigma black students already face when attending an elite college — that somehow they were admitted only because of a lower standard and lower expectations. Such race-based approaches, in the words of Jason Riley at Manhattan Institute, make “black achievement a white allowance and black failure a group stigma.”

Instead of lowering academic requirements, a real game-changer for black students is to improve their graduation rate. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center’s 2017 survey, for all students who attended four-year public universities, black students had the lowest six-year completion rate of 45.9 percent, compared to 67.2 percent of white students and 71.7 percent of Asian students. Lower graduation rates mean fewer good job opportunities, and fewer job opportunities likely contribute to higher student loan default rates for black students.

College Builds Character

Those who accuse Klein of lacking of empathy in the tone of his email neglected to mention that Klein also wrote a second email to the entire class in which he said he understood some students experienced hardship, from “the coronavirus health issue of a loved one to emotional stress of recent social tragedies.”

Klein shared with the students the physical and emotional struggle of his own daughter when she was a student at UCLA. By his telling, she persevered and has become an oncologist. Klein said that while he wished he could take individual circumstances into consideration to modify his syllabus, his understanding was that such action would violate UCLA rules. He closed his email by encouraging his students to “study hard” and persevere like his daughter.

Klein’s second email brought up another good point: A college campus is not only an environment for acquiring knowledge, but also a place for character development. Each of us will face various challenges and obstacles in life. No one can smooth our path to ensure we never fail. A college campus is one place where young people can learn how to overcome obstacles and develop resilience, a character trait from which they will benefit the rest of their lives.

Unfortunately, since Klein’s first email caused a meltdown, nothing else he said matters to those demanding he be fired. Klein is currently on leave while UCLA is investigating his first email “incident.” A spokesman from the Anderson School of Management apologized to the student who received Klein’s first email and “to all those who have been as upset and offended by it as we are ourselves.”

UCLA Students Cry for Comfort Over Facts

Klein is not the only UCLA lecturer whose job is on the line. Students are also demanding the firing of political science lecturer W. Ajax Peris, an Air Force veteran. People who know Peris well consider him a regular liberal, never a controversial type.

When teaching the history of racism recently, Peris read aloud MLK’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” which includes the n-word, and showed a documentary to the class in which lynching was discussed. For students who signed up to “learn” the history of racism against black people, hearing a white lecturer read the n-word from a letter written by a jailed civil rights leader and watching lynching imagery made them feel so “uncomfortable,” they asked Peris to stop. Peris apologized for causing students “discomfort” but continued his teaching, resulting in a great deal of “distress” and “anger” among the students.

Leadership of the Political Science Department quickly condemned Peris in a department-wide email for failing to reassess his “teaching pedagogy to meet the students’ needs.” The same leadership also referred Peris to UCLA’s Discrimination Prevention Office for an investigation. Furthermore, UCLA will host a town hall for students in Peris’ classes to discuss the “controversy” and next steps. Despite Peris’ multiple apologies, students still want him dismissed.

What did Peris do in his class that is so “controversial”? The history of racism against black people is an ugly part of our nation’s history, and the only way to teach it is by presenting the historical truth. Did students who signed up for this class think they wouldn’t actually have to learn about the cruelty and injustice that previous black generations had to endure? How should Peris adjust his teaching pedagogy for students who want to be “safe” from learning historical truth? Should he gloss over black people’s sufferings in the Jim Crow era?

When woke students wouldn’t allow Peris to read aloud one of the most important civil rights documents word-for-word simply because he is white, wasn’t he the one facing discrimination on the basis of his skin color? On what grounds should he be condemned and fired?

Americans can no longer dismiss such absurdity on college campuses. As we learned from the recent “civil war” inside the New York Times after it published an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the social justice warriors and thought police who graduated from these indoctrination camps are now in the workforce. They are using language devoid of meaning or even counterfactual, having a meltdown over facts, and then shouting down and “canceling” people whose words and ideas they don’t like.

The left’s arguments are winning, and their tactics are succeeding in corporate America just like they did on college campuses, because corporate managers, like college administrators, are quick to apologize and bend over backward to comply with the mob. If we don’t push back against this dangerous trend, America will soon become one giant echo chamber with only one voice left because no one will feel safe to think differently.

Monuments Defaced By Riots Is What Teaching Fake History Gets America,"The imagery couldn’t be more direct. Across the nation, rioting and unrest that has killed black Americans and destroyed black neighborhoods has included the defacement of historic monuments, including those to abolitionists.

The last wave of monument destruction, in 2017, largely focused on Confederates and slave holders, erasing all the accomplishments of figures such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson with a scarlet S, for slave-holder. This time, the ignorance has descended even further.

The rioters are now tearing down and defacing memorials wantonly, apparently assuming that if someone is being celebrated that person is “probably a racist,” as the image below says.

https://twitter.com/ellie_bufkin/status/1270856617165312006?s=20

This prejudiced ignorance appears to be widespread, and unchecked by local authorities. Several of the defaced monuments are of abolitionists, including the Great Emancipator Abraham Lincoln, as Tristan Justice reported Thursday. For example:

In the wake of last night's demonstrations, there are numerous instances of vandalism to sites around the National Mall.

“[I]n Boston, demonstrators also vandalized a monument to the 54th Massachusetts regiment, the second all-black volunteer regiment of the Union Army,” Justice writes. “… Add to the growing list of civil rights freedom fighters defaced by social justice protestors a Minnesota memorial to three black men who were lynched in 1920 following false rape accusations from a white woman.”

These mob actions are not the result of accidental ignorance, but of cultivated prejudice. One month ago, I collected just a few pieces of evidence pointing in this direction:

A 2019 poll found… that “more than 80 percent of Americans ages 39 and younger could not say what rights the First Amendment protects, and three-quarters or more couldn’t name any authors of The Federalist Papers.” Another 2019 poll found “just 57 percent of millennials believe the Declaration of Independence ‘better guarantees freedom and equality’ than the Communist Manifesto.” A 2016 Federalist article notes, “40 percent of recent grads were unaware that Congress has the right to declare war and 10 percent think Judge Judy is on the Supreme Court.”

In February, I presented more such evidence:

Today, 4 in 10 Americans who are younger than 39 disagree that the United States “has a history we should be proud of,” according to a 2019 poll by FLAG/YouGov. The poll also found that half of all Americans agree the United States is a sexist and racist country, including two-thirds of millennials. Millennials showed the lowest level of agreement with the statement, “I’m proud to be an American.” Thirty-eight percent of “younger Americans do not agree that ‘America has a history that we should be proud of,’” according to the poll. 2019’s annual poll from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that 37 percent of millennials think the United States is “among the most unequal societies in the world.”

The anti-American group of recent graduates is not a fringe element. It is a substantial and ominously growing group of voting-age adults.

The recent riots have given us many more indications that America’s education institutions do not merely keep kids ignorant, but actively teach them to hate their country. Just refer to any of the emails and website banners you’ve been subjected to from every company you’ve ever purchased from online, detailing about how they’re all “fighting racism” by frantically donating to people and organizations that make a living off heightened racial tensions.

These messages reveal that the nation’s leadership class has all been re-educated extremely successfully to believe a pack of things that just aren’t true about American history and ideals. They are well-catechized in what is billed as anti-racist attitudes and activities that are rooted in false information and more likely to instead increase racial tensions.

Hardly a one of them, or any other American, can tell you much about George Washington besides he was a slave owner. Hardly one of them can identify Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as bona fide, deep-dyed racists. Not one of them know one of the first acts of Congress — the Congress that existed before today’s Congress, the one that pre-dates the Constitution — was to pass a massive document outlawing slavery in territory newly acquired from Great Britain during postwar negotiations.

But they all have heard of Audre Lorde, whose great contribution to society is basically being black and gay. They are all up on movies directed by black women like Ava DuVernay and books by pathos-filled but fact-challenged black writers like Ta-Nehisi Coates. They all know Michael Brown put his hands up and said “Don’t shoot” even though he didn’t. They’re passing around discredited fake history like The New York Times’s 1619 Project as if it were accurate, and using it to justify supporting totalitarian thought policing because a black guy says this will solve racism.

These people’s heads aren’t empty. Their hate isn’t blind. It’s very well-formed. And it’s been deliberately aimed at the very country that has paid for and overseen their indoctrination into political violence.

I’ve now spent about a decade tracking information like this, and have researched and written about it in more detail than most, and therefore can assure you there is much more to find. Entire books have and could be written to detail more. Each generation of American children has learned less real history than the generation before it. Each generation of American children has instead been subject to greater levels of indoctrination in place of genuine education. The alarms have been sounded for decades, even a century, and nothing effective has been done.

So now we have riots and unfettered monument smashing. This is no accident. It is a logical consequence of convincing ourselves, against all evidence, that America’s public education institutions are largely sound outside a few crazies who never happen to be in one’s own school district, and even if they were, one’s own children would of course be impervious. Not like their stupid dupes of classmates, who in just a few short years will go on to vote and tear down monuments to American abolitionists in the name of anti-racism.

This is what happens when conservatives spend 120 years complaining about the left controlling academia while the politicians conservatives vote for and cheerily profile in our publications keep increasing funding for these intellectual enemies of our country. Seventy years later, God and man are still objects of scorn at Yale, and so is our nation, but still we keep sending them our kids and money, hiring their graduates to teach our children and rule us, and funding their students.

The postwar convention of Minnesota niceness in politics has been a disaster. That’s because cowardice ultimately is not nice. It leaves the innocent and the vulnerable defenseless. And, as with Stockholm Syndrome, some of the preyed upon ultimately turn predator themselves after identifying too strongly with their captors.

How many more statues and American minds have to get smashed before people who genuinely love their country gain the courage to start fighting effectively for her restoration before it’s too late? Here’s part of what that would look like: Civil authorities first stopping vandalism and pursuing the vandals to mete out their just, legally determined penalties; second, politicians who claim to love America fighting for her by refusing to send public funds to institutions that fail to prove their graduates honor the country that pays for their education. At this point, that’s just about all of them.

It’s time for a new, non-racist boycott, divest, sanction movement — for taxpayer-funded education. Liberate public funds from these institutions with a century-long record of failure. Return it to families. At least half of them will be delighted to choose pro-America schools. That’s a lot more than pick pro-America schools now. It would give this country a chance to strive toward its ideals once more rather than burn them in chaos.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/12/lincoln-monuments-defaced-by-anti-racism-rioters-is-what-teaching-fake-history-gets-america/,2020-06-12
"To Reduce Disparities, We Must Acknowledge Black Fathers Matter","Americans must confront the injustice of George Floyd’s death and examine issues of police use of force. We should review sentencing guidelines and revisit qualified immunity. We must never dismiss the generational effects of slavery and Jim Crow.

We must also acknowledge that racism is not primarily responsible for the struggles of the black community. Fatherlessness is.

Don’t take our word for it. Here’s what black leaders have to say.

The Top Three Biggest Problems Facing The Black Community 1) Lack of fathers in the home 2) Lack of fathers in the home 3) Lack of fathers in the home But let's talk about the allegedly ""racist"" @realDonaldtrump… — Larry Elder (@larryelder) August 18, 2018

Activist and #Blexit founder Candace Owens declares, “The biggest issue facing black America is father absence.”

Former NAACP president Kweisi Mfume, when asked if white racism or the absence of fathers posed a greater threat to black Americans, replied without hesitation, “The absence of black fathers.”

Given the devastation fatherlessness visits on black children, you would think racial justice activists would sound the alarm. Yet Black Lives Matter openly seeks to “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family,” the only institution that, through marriage, binds children to their fathers.

The BLM core statement of belief mentions black mothers, black families, black parents, and even black trans women. Yet nowhere does it mention black fathers, even though when black fathers have access to their children, they prove to be more involved parents than their white and Hispanic counterparts.

What Kids Need

The three staples of children’s social and emotional diet are their mother’s love, their father’s love, and stability. When children are raised by their married parents, they have daily access to all three. These needs have nothing to do with a child’s race, and the absence of one or more of these critical staples makes children emotionally malnourished and more likely to struggle academically, suffer a host of behavioral and emotional challenges, become a teen parent, and be incarcerated. That’s why marriage is a social justice issue for children.

Today, black children face an overwhelming injustice, being denied en masse the benefits of growing up in a married home. Only 17 percent of black kids make it to their high school graduation living exclusively with their married mother and father. That means 83 percent of black youth are suffering the loss of a parent or the instability of split homes. That’s an emotional starvation rate an order of magnitude greater than any other racial group.

Unsurprisingly, Minnesota, the epicenter of today’s racial unrest, is located in the region of the country with the greatest disparity in racial marriage rates. Fatherless kids are hurting kids. Tupac penned of his childhood spent without a dad,

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight

A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night

Please send me a pops before puberty

The things I wouldn’t do to see a piece of family unity.

Not only does father absence disadvantage kids, it breaks their hearts.

Does Racism Cause Fatherlessness?

Some recognize the problem of father absence in the black community but object, “Racism is causing fatherlessness!” If that were true, the plight of the black family would have been far worse in eras of overt racism. Instead, early 20th-century black women married at higher rates than their white counterparts.

As the nation emerged from Jim Crow, 25 percent of black children were born to unwed mothers. Today that statistic is 72 percent. Instances of racism exist today, but you would be hard-pressed to argue anti-black racism is worse now than in 1900 or 1964.

If racism were the primary problem, Nigerian Americans also would not be among the most successful immigrant groups in our country, but they are. Much of their success can be attributed to strong marriages and strong families. In Nigeria, only 4 percent of children are raised in single-parent households, compared to the overall U.S. rate of 23 percent.

Leftist Policies Feed Poverty

Racism is not primarily responsible for the dissolution of the black family. Leftist policies are. Renowned economist Thomas Sowell explains, “The black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life.” This way of life has kept many black children stuck in cycles of generational poverty.

But because family breakdown, not racism, is overwhelmingly responsible for high rates of child poverty, the solution is found in marriage. The success sequence — 1) get at least a high school degree, 2) get a full-time job, and 3) get married before having any children — lifts 91 percent of youth out of poverty. Marriage is our greatest anti-poverty weapon.

Father Absence Increases Crime

It’s sickeningly obvious that instances of white cops targeting and brutalizing black suspects exist, but racism isn’t the main explanation for the massive numbers of black men in prison.

Regardless of their race, children who grow up without dads, especially boys, are more likely to commit violent crime. Fathers teach children different lessons than mothers do. One of those vital lessons is teaching children to police themselves through rough-and-tumble play, straight talk, and a disciplinary style inclined toward getting kids to take responsibility for their actions.

Fathers provide their sons a role model of what a strong and self-controlled man looks like, and for daughters they model what a father and husband should be. When a father fails, or is flat-out absent, a young man is more likely to encounter his first enforced boundaries at the hands of police. Prisons could be renamed “centers for dad-deprived boys,” and black boys are dad-deprived more than any other demographic.

That’s not to say that children, black or otherwise, who grow up in a broken home are doomed. President Barack Obama is an example of a man who overcame great odds to reach the pinnacle of power and success. He also, by his own admission, suffered from the absence of his father.

Fathers Foster Academic Success

Blaming systemic police racism for the struggles of black Americans is easier than doing the hard work of building and repairing families, but if we seek real change, our energies need to be focused on the hard work — or the home work. As senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution Shelby Steele notes, “You can have the police go to as many sensitivity trainings as you want, it’s not going to read a story to a child at night before he goes to sleep so he’s developing his mind … [and] serious about the academic and educational development [needed] … in order to be successful.”

Steele understands how father absence affects the racial achievement gap. While it’s true that black students are often unfairly disadvantaged by living in districts with poorly performing schools, family plays an often ignored role in school success.

Academically, black students, 65 percent of whom are being raised by single parents, struggle most in school. White students, 24 percent of whom live in single-parent homes, tend to inhabit the middle ground. Asian students, 15 percent of whom have single parents, generally occupy the top-achieving academic strata. The correlation between kids in single-parent homes and academic struggles is glaringly obvious, but it seldom factors into discussions aimed at helping black students succeed.

What happens when fathers, regardless of race, marry the mothers of their children? They raise successful students. A meta-analysis of 30 studies found student success has infinitely more to do with family than with race. The researchers concluded, “The family elements that were most strongly associated with a reduction in the achievement gap were coming from a two-biological-parent family and high levels of parental involvement.”

Even more interesting, when the study factored in the religious faith of an intact family, “The achievement gap totally disappeared” (emphasis added). When their emotional needs are met in the home of their married mother and father, black students are just as capable of academic success as kids from any other racial group.

The Institution Most Black Kids Lack Is Marriage

The shameful time in U.S. history when blacks were excluded from the institutions of education, business, and government has passed. America’s centuries-long systematic segregation has been replaced by targeted searches for minority enrollees and employees in our nation’s most prestigious universities and businesses. African Americans have been elected to the most powerful positions in government and hold the highest offices in many of the cities currently overrun by Black Lives Matter protests.

The only institution to which today’s black children are routinely denied is marriage. Their plight won’t improve until they receive equal access to this foundational institution, which unites the two people to whom children have a natural right — their mother and father — for life.

Welcome To Your New World Order: A Rundown Of Woke Insanity,"America is in the midst of a new cultural civil war that for years has been brewing under the surface as left-wing academics breed aggressively woke children now permeating throughout the nation’s mainstream institutions.

Since the killing of George Floyd at the knees of a Minneapolis police officer sparked the worst outbreak of civil unrest in decades, protests that grew out of demanding justice for Floyd morphed into a dark operation to fundamentally transform the nation’s psyche, convincing the people of their own inherent evil from ancestral wrongs.

Battle lines are clearly being drawn, where the radical left has offered Americans a binary choice in a false dichotomy between total submission or unrelenting exile with those opposed to the new woke world order cast out of society as unrepentant racists refusing to atone for past generations’ sins. No justice, no peace. Silence is violence. You’re either with us, or against us. There is no middle ground. Which side of history are you on?

Of course in reality, (and sanity), it’s clearly not that black and white, but if recent events show us anything, they expose that this mentality is no longer one of a fringe left-wing movement but a central tenet of our mainstream culture of what it means to make “progress.” America, according to the now only acceptable narrative, is an irredeemably racist society that was built for the sole purpose to oppress. It has never been great. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is as guilty as the slaveholders who lived more than 150 years ago.

For as long as the nation continues to go mad, purging books, movies, statues and history in its own cultural revolution launched by woke elites, The Federalist will be chronicling its destruction, updating this list with each new event in its collapse. The Federalist will also be keeping tally of those fired from lack of allegiance to the new woke overlords found here.

Immigrant-Owned Louisville Restaurant Gets Demands Letter From BLM To Improve Diversity

An immigrant-owned business in Louisville, Ky., saw protestors gather in support of the restaurant in early August after a Black Lives Matter group sent them a letter with a list of demands that included filling at least 23 percent of positions with black employees and ensuring at least 23 percent of inventory came from black retailers while providing diversity training at least twice a year.

According to the Courier-Journal, demonstrators told the restaurant owner Fernando Martinez that he “better put [the list of demands] on the door so your business is not f–d with.”

“How can I be called a bigot and a racist when my family is black? When my son is gay?” Martinez said to a crowd of supportive protestors. “I’m the proud father of a gay son, and I’m gonna fight for him against anybody.”

You Must Now Explain Why You Stand For The Anthem

Kneeling for the national anthem at sporting events to protest America as an evil and racist empire was once something a few players did on occasion. Now, it appears those who stand in respect for the nation must explain themselves.

Rather amazing how quickly we went from “people should be able to kneel during the anthem as a form of protest” to “anyone who doesn’t kneel during the anthem must explain themselves”. https://t.co/7UCYRRr1Sc — AG (@AGHamilton29) August 1, 2020

AOC Condemns Sainted Catholic Priest As White Supremacist

Freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York complained about the presence of a statue commemorating Hawaii’s Father Damien in the halls of Capitol Hill as celebrating white supremacy.

“This is what patriarchy and white supremacist culture looks like!” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on a story posted to Instagram story. “It’s not radical or crazy to understand the influence white supremacist culture has historically had in our overall culture & how it impacts the present day.”

Father Damien however, voluntarily spent years caring for exiled patients dying of leprosy until dying of the disease himself.

Since June, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Nashville, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and New Orleans have seen homicides jump 20 percent compared to last year.

“We’re protesting for months, for weeks, saying “black lives matter,'” said John Ayala, who lost his 11-year-old grandson in a Washington D.C. shooting. “Black lives matter, it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a black person. What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

Chris Cillizza Isn’t Actually Following American Politics

In an attempt to discredit President Trump’s patriotic parlance at a pillar of American pride near the peak of Mount Rushmore, CNN’s political editor-at-large, Chris Cillizza went line-by-line of the address and titled his piece, “The 28 most outrageous lines from Donald Trump’s Mount Rushmore speech.”

Among the lines Cillizza took issue with, was of Trump pledging to protect the iconic monument.

“I am here as your President to proclaim before the country and before the world, this monument will never be desecrated,” Trump said.

“Uh, was there some sort of movement to tear down Mount Rushmore I was unaware of or…?”

In fact, monuments to the four presidents enshrined on the mountain have been desecrated or destroyed across the country, and 44 percent of self-identifying liberals have voiced support for blowing up the mountain, an idea seemingly embraced by the Democratic Party.

Bell was one of a handful of celebrities that participated in a Hollywood’s “I take responsibility” video apologizing for their whiteness.

Coronavirus Is Woke-Sensitive

On June 1, dozens of public health experts signed an open letter blaming white supremacy on societal illnesses applauding the protesters for combating the true pandemic without regard for the novel Wuhan coronavirus that shut down the nation causing irreparable damage in the process.

“As public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risk for COVID-19 transmission… This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” they wrote.

In other words, protests are fine as long as they remain in the name of social justice. Any other form of expression however, must be banned, for public health that is. Surely that’s a convincing message to the millions of Americans forced down to food pantries because the government deemed their life’s work as non-essential, or to the families unable to say goodbye to loved ones because funerals of more than 10 people were too dangerous.

So it turns out viruses are woke-sensitive. If you are protesting against racism, you won’t get Covid-19 or spread it to others. However, If you are protesting the lockdown so you can work or open your business, you are a murderer who is selfishly spreading Covid. #science pic.twitter.com/0McBofRGtr — Rachel Campos-Duffy (@RCamposDuffy) June 7, 2020

Why Supporting Black Lives Matter Is Anti-Christian And Anti-Life,"As a Christian pro-life advocate, I often hear the words,“You’re not really Christian unless…” According to thinkers on the left side of the spectrum, what you must support to claim the title “Christian” is extensive. The most common arguments typically boil down to, “You’re not a real Christian unless you solve every social ill known to man.”

One recent derivative of this assertion is, “You can’t be Christian unless you affirm that black lives matter.” On the surface, it seems obvious that to properly represent a position that states all men are created in the image of God you would, indeed, need to affirmatively declare black lives matter.

Our Christian faith requires we believe in the intrinsic value of all life. Love for our fellow man is the motivation for promoting life-affirming culture. If our black brothers and sisters feel they’ve been disenfranchised, addressing this carefully is paramount to getting to the truth and healing wounds. Loving and supporting black people’s goal of equity in opportunity is vital for those who hope to see a universal acceptance of the sanctity of all life. As hashtag advocacy goes, #BlackLivesMatter seems self-evident and as nonpartisan as declaring #MeToo if you’re a sexual assault survivor.

But while BLM the organization declares their movement a “natural phenomenon” and its organization decentralized, the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was intentionally marketed to a specific cause. As such, we must be cautious to clarify that affirming “black lives matter” is different than supporting Black Lives Matter, the 501 (c)(3), its chapters, and its partners.

Christians should limit our use of popular hashtags — primarily #BlackLivesMatter and #HandsUpDontShoot — to share messages regarding equality. Hashtag advocacy leads back to the organizations that create the hashtags. In this case, it means directing friends and family to an overt effort to fundamentally remake the world with socialist ideas—ideas that often directly contradict the message of the gospel.

The Origin of Black Lives Matter

Black Lives Matter began as a social media hashtag intended to bring attention to the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was shot by George Zimmerman. The words were a desperate cry for justice. As arguments regarding white supremacy and gun control policy dominated the airwaves, black women were burying their sons. In a country that believed it had finally broken the race barrier, electing our first black president just a few years before, this contradiction was unacceptable.

In her famous 2013 “Love Letter to Black People,” Black Lives Matter founder and community organizer Alicia Garza wrote: “I continue to be surprised at how little black lives matter.” Her friend and fellow organizer, Patrisse Kahn Cullors, created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. Another organizer friend, Opal Tometi, saw the marketing potential, purchased the domain name, and created a social media presence. The three formed the official Black Lives Matter Network after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

Since July 2013, Black Lives Matter has grown to 40 chapters worldwide, with 16 located in America. Famous faces and influencers like John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, and Beyoncé Knowles openly support and promote BLM. As a movement, it is here to stay. Yet despite its seeming newness, Black Lives Matter is just part of a movement that has been in existence for decades under different names.

BLM Founders Openly Support Socialism

While it’s considered lazy scholarship to declare those who have left politics “socialist,” all three founders of the Black Lives Matter movement have openly shared their desires to end capitalism. In their online articles, videos, and interviews, all three allude to concepts that originate in socialism, communism, or Marxism.

Garza started her organizing career working in abortion advocacy before moving on to groups like NDWA, SOUL, and POWER—which merged with CJJC in 2014, and RTTC—all of which focus on worker and housing activism via anti-capitalist activism.

Cullors works in jail and policing activism as the founder of Dignity and Power Now. Her philosophy rests on the concept of prison abolition and reparations in financial compensation and land redistribution. She promotes BDS—the leftist, antisemitic boycott, divest, and sanction movement—both as a signatory to public statements supporting Palestinians and in articles she’s written. She speaks eloquently about “peoples-led socialist movements” in South America and once was “mentored” by Eric Mann, a former agitator of the Weather Underground domestic terrorism organization.

Opal Tometi focuses almost exclusively on immigration activism. She has spoken at Left Forum events, shared a stage with Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro, and helped oversee “fair” elections in Venezuela in 2015.

Virtually all of the spaces Black Lives Matter and its founders inhabit are associated with leftist or openly socialist worker’s movements. All three women have spoken at Left Forum, a think tank for socialists, which engages high-profile communists, socialists, and Marxists as keynote speakers. Speakers include luminaries such as Marxist Silvia Federici and Frances Fox Piven.

Black Lives Matter has sponsored town hall meetings with leftist extremists even the leftist agitation group Southern Poverty Law Center finds objectionable. They’ve written touching eulogies for mass murderers who brutally suppressed Christianity.

They’ve recreated narratives to characterize a law enforcement officer as inherently aggressive and deceptive, even when forensics have shown their position to be inaccurate. While I agree that criminal justice reforms are needed, BLM’s misleading coverage forced the police officer involved in the Brown shooting to go into hiding due to death threats. Although we’re six years removed from 2014, he remains in hiding.

This Is an Extremist Left Organization

Black Lives Matter’s founders and its political demands are overtly socialist. Socialism is an ideology that has caused the violent political suppression and mass murder of millions.

Thus, if we are not careful in our social media interactions, we may end up inadvertently supporting a repugnant political ideology responsible for mass killing on a scale multiple times that of the Nazis, not to mention some of the worst oppression against Christians we’ve seen in modern times. We would be supporting an overtly pro-abortion movement whose founders previously worked in abortion advocacy. We would be paying homage to women who have stood on stage with political leaders who are starving their citizens to death.

While I understand the desire to promote a consistent life ethic as a Christian, doing so by supporting Black Lives Matters, rather than supporting black people whose lives matter, would be as valueless as joining the ranks of the same leftists we’ve seen on stage for the last 60 years. This is nothing new, and it’s not compatible with Christianity.

Co-opting our goodwill to promote a political agenda regularly happens on both sides of the aisle. This time, the leftist Black Lives Matter controls the narrative. Opinions will shift, and maybe a conservative movement will take the stage next. Whichever way the pendulum swings, protecting the timeless lessons that teach us how to love our neighbor should remain the highest priority of Christians, not irresponsible hashtag activism.

How Socialists Like Black Lives Matter Weaponize Fears Of Loneliness,"Black Lives Matter is a Marxist scam. As with all totalitarian ploys, BLM uses your natural fear of social rejection to force conformity and compliance with its goals. If we buy into it, we have a lot to lose, including all individual liberties—freedom of speech, of thought, and especially the right to a private life and private relationships.

The BLM goal should be obvious by now: conjure up enough blind conformity to create the illusion of unanimous support. Support for what? The uncontroversial slogan that black lives matter is just a tool to draw you in emotionally to its broader and more destructive agenda.

Read the BLM website and you’ll find lots of Marxist agendas like ending constitutional self-governance (under the guise of “sustainable transformation”) and taking over law enforcement to abolish the rule of law (“defund the police”). It’s anti-Christian and anti-free markets. It’s committed to “disrupting” the nuclear family and replacing it with collectivist forms of child-rearing. Its endgame is typical of Marxism: a power grab stoked by the illusion of mass approval through street theater.

When we get sucked in to the vortex of BLM’s mass delusions, whether out of a sense of guilt or ignorance, the results are predictable. Forced confessions. Struggle sessions. The suppression of speech. Stoking of resentments. Accusations of thought crimes. Toppling historical monuments. Civilizational breakdown. Meddling in private life, especially family.

So, what’s the secret of creating enough woke conformity to get to such an anti-thought point? How does a well-organized band of power-craving elitists get people to surrender the right to speak their own minds? To open the door to giving collectivist elites the raw power they crave?

I’ll use the terms socialism and Marxism somewhat interchangeably. Marxists tend to refer to themselves as socialists, even if some socialists claim they aren’t Marxists. All are collectivists, though, with the same patterns and tendencies and agendas, some harder than others, depending on their “state of evolution.”

Weaponizing the Fear of Loneliness

The threat of ostracism is a primal and universal human terror, and thus an extremely powerful weapon, especially when mobs enforce it. Tyrants have always been in the business of cultivating the terror of social rejection in order to control people and amass power. Sadly, most people are not consciously aware of these dynamics, and are therefore vulnerable to succumbing.

The terror of abandonment is built into our social DNA because human beings cannot survive in isolation. What we see today is a psychological operation that plays on that fear through identity politics, peer-modelling, and social contagion.

First, the propaganda media conjures up images of unanimity with a false BLM narrative. Then, anyone who doesn’t buy in is smeared as a racist, at great risk of losing his or her job, status, livelihood, and now even family. It’s designed to induce everyone to cave in to that primal fear of social isolation and submit to the power elites. Once society reaches a tipping point where everyone blindly succumbs, then the power grab begins, and game over.

Emotional Blackmail Is Common to Identity Politics

Emotional blackmail seems to be an inherent tactic of Marxist activists as well as today’s cult of wokeness. We can now see how BLM applies that tool to the daily lives of its “allies.”

The author of a recent New York Times op-ed writes that he fears for his life when he goes out because he’s black. He’s irritated with texts of sympathy he receives from white allies because he finds their support for BLM inadequate.

The essay, titled “I Don’t Need ‘Love’ Texts From My White Friends,” offers a prescription for proving their love: threaten to ostracize any loved ones who don’t get with the program. His exact words: “Text: to your relatives and loved ones telling them you will not be visiting them or answering phone calls until they take significant action in supporting black lives either through protest or financial contributions.”

Here’s a key Twitter thread on it:

https://twitter.com/jonkay/status/1269226833511399426

Repeat After Me… Repeat After Me…

Cult experts have a term for this practice of meddling in relationships: predatory alienation. It’s a form of relational aggression, straight out of Cults 101. BLM offers us other examples of mass compliance reminiscent of Jonestown.

A creepy Maoist-styled struggle session recently took place in the affluent suburb of Bethesda, Maryland where a large crowd theatrically recited a mass confession of collective white guilt. They also promised to proselytize (i.e., “educate”) others, leading likely to performing emotional blackmail when deemed necessary.

We’ve also seen spectacles of police officers, and even uniformed military personnel, “taking the knee” in obedience to mobs. Corporate America from Amazon to Zoom has also drunk the Kool-Aid in fear. Even supposed Republicans like Mitt Romney and George W. Bush publicly support BLM’s false claim that America is a “systemically” racist nation. Maybe you now have family and friends who harangue you, threatening—overtly or tacitly—to shun you if you don’t get with their program.

Americans should have enough sense to know that such shameful acts of submission to mobs are not about race, police brutality, or healing. They are about shifting power from the rule of law to a socialist elite who intend lawless dominion over everyone once in power. Their false narratives exploit George Floyd’s death as a trigger to stir up fear and loathing (in the name of love) in order to gain and consolidate power.

Socialism Weaponizes Loneliness to Control People

The emotional manipulation we’re seeing by Black Lives Matter reflects socialism’s long pattern of isolating individuals and controlling their relationships. We can see it in socialism’s history, in its policies, and especially in its tactics.

Abolishing family and religion are both old socialist rallying cries. A big part of socialism’s history is its war on those primary institutions through which our most intimate relationships and our unique identities are formed. We become isolated and weakened, and more easily controlled, when separated from them. That’s the idea.

Socialist dictators like Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedog, Pol Pot, and Adolf Hitler were dedicated to the destruction of all private life, insisting that loyalty belonged only to them. That’s why the death toll of socialist systems is more than 100 million.

Whatever else socialists say they promote—equality, justice, free stuff—they have one goal: placing too much power in the hands of too few people. To undermine the power of individuals, they undermine their private relationships. That’s exactly what just about every socialist policy has done, including no-fault divorce, welfare dependency, and abortion, which wreak havoc on the family.

The victims of this brokenness naturally feel alienated. Yet they still have a need to belong to something. Socialists feed that appetite with pseudo-communities, such as contrived collectives, mobs, and, yes, its wokeness cult.

Groupthink and Imposed Isolation Are a Vicious Cycle

The mob mindset is a trap, a form of mental solitary confinement, an ironic form of mind rape. Why? Because mobs of wokeness do not allow for anyone to express an original thought to another human being without the risk of being smeared and isolated.

As people invest in groupthink to remain in the herd, they end up spiraling even deeper into the mental isolation, cutting off normal conversation. They soon become “triggered” by other points of view. BLM activists have not only taken full advantage of the fear of loneliness already inherent in our culture. They also seem intent in perpetuating the fear by stoking more divisions within private relationships.

Political correctness and identity politics have long been used as tools of agitation designed to instill groupthink and stir up that threat of loneliness. Political correctness works by inducing self-censorship, cutting off conversation and the exchange of ideas, which might lead to friendship.

People with politically incorrect ideas often confide they feel completely alone. Identity politics works by forcing people to focus only on a collective identity and collective guilt while erasing each of us as unique individuals. Both are alienating. Both empower bad actors.

Most of us have never had a chance to learn the history of how blind conformity breeds terror, and vice versa. Abject conformity led to the hellscapes of Stalin’s reign of terror, of Hitler’s Germany. Those who submit to false confessions of “white guilt” can just as easily submit to such regimes because the psychological mechanism is the same: seeking the social approval they crave and avoiding the social rejection they fear.

How Black Lives Matter’s Antagonism To Family Hurts Black Americans,"Black Lives Matter — the organization, not the irrefutably true statement — has taken center stage in the necessary debate on race today, overshadowing others like the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

All know that BLM’s leadership is strongly calling for the defunding and possible abolishment of local police departments. This proposal has been resisted or dodged by leading Democrats for various reasons. But what about BLM’s view of the family as a resource for black empowerment? Do they even have a position on the family?

They do and they should because of the centrality strong families play in empowering a people, their life prospects, and strengthening their neighborhoods. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. noted, “The group consisting of mother, father and child is the main educational agency of mankind.” King was speaking of the nuclear family.

BLM’s antagonism to the family is glaring. On the organization’s website, Black Lives Matter proclaims, “We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and ‘villages’ that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.”

Beyond the mistaken assumption that the “nuclear family” is unique to the Western world, their position is profoundly concerning. BLM, as an organization, seeks to dismantle the very institution that mountains of published academic research has consistently demonstrated as most likely to strengthen and empower Black Americans and their children: the traditional, nuclear family.

But they don’t stop there. Black Lives Matter also advocates other family redefinitions long at odds with most African Americans’ views, stating, “We foster a queer‐affirming network. When we gather, we do so with the intention of freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking, or rather, the belief that all in the world are heterosexual.”

Seriously, is “freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking” really on the minds of most African Americans when they wake in the morning? Well, it apparently weighs heavy on the minds of BLM — enough to list in their relatively short, official statement “What We Believe.”

The statement continues, “We make space for transgender brothers and sisters to participate and lead. We are self-reflexive and do the work required to dismantle cisgender privilege and uplift black trans folk…” I humbly ask, how many African Americans truly see “heteronormativity” and the “objective reality of gender” as major hurdles to their dreams for justice, respect, economic and social empowerment, or a better life?

Strong Families Empower Black Americans

Over and against what Black Lives Matter officially holds on the family, what do mainstream family scholars say on the matter? Earlier this week, Shelby Steele, a leading black intellectual said in a television interview:

I will take those things seriously when I also hear …[from] … Sharpton and others the argument that we need within the black community to work on the institution of marriage. Our families have fallen to pieces. 75 percent of all black children are born out of wedlock, without a father. … I don’t care how many social programs you have. You’re not going to overcome that. [Programs are] not going to read a story to a child that night before he goes to sleep so he’s developing his mind…

Of course, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan said the same thing back in 1965, backed up with solid data. In what became known as The Moynihan Report, he warned that the hoped-for gains from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would largely be for naught if black Americans did not address the crisis taking place within their families. Moynihan stated:

Those seeking real and lasting solutions to this injustice cannot ignore this other fact, the fundamental problem, in which this is most clearly the case, is that of family structure. The evidence — not final, but powerfully persuasive — is that the Negro family in the urban ghettos is crumbling. … So long as this situation persists, the cycle of poverty and disadvantage will continue to repeat itself.

Sadly, this prediction has largely come to pass. Scholarship on the relationship between race and social well-being over the last 20-plus years has found that marital status has joined employment and education as the dividing line between the “haves” and the “have-nots” of society. This is even more powerfully true for black Americans.

All People Benefit from Married Mothers and Fathers

Only 4 percent of all homes with a married mother and father are on food stamps at any given time. The undeniable advantages of growing up in a married, intact family apply as much to blacks and Hispanics as they do to Caucasians. All other things being equal, married black men enjoy a marriage premium of at least $12,500 in their individual annual income compared to their single peers.

Bill Galston, who served as President Clinton’s domestic policy advisor and is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, explains in crisp language, “It is no exaggeration to say that a stable, two-parent family is an American child’s best protection against poverty.” He explains that to avoid living in poverty in the United States, one has to meet just three primary requirements:

Finish high school. Marry before having children. Marry after the age of 20.

Only 8 percent of people who fulfill these three criteria are poor, while 79 percent of those who fail to do so will be impoverished, regardless of their race. Isabel Sawhill, Galston’s celebrated colleague at Brookings and a tireless advocate for the well-being of inner-city children, makes this bold statement: “The proliferation of single-parent households accounts for virtually all of the increase in child poverty since the early 1970s.”

Black lives do matter, without exception. And they matter as black lives. Indeed, our racial distinctions and heritages matter as well, making the world a more interesting place. But just because an organization chooses an irrefutably true name does not make its agenda irrefutably true or noble.

If BLM’s leaders don’t want to believe the latest empirical studies, if they want to blatantly ignore science, they should simply go to any of the communities they say they represent and ask, “Do you think your neighborhood would benefit from more married mothers and fathers regularly sitting out every evening on stoops watching their children play, or less?” It doesn’t take a social scientist to know what BLM leaders would hear.

What Celebrating A Black ‘Bachelor’ Says About Our Culture,"The distinction of being the first black person to hold a particular position in America has long been buoyed as a pivotal part of our history. In light of George Floyd’s tragic killing, we’ve reached an unprecedented level of pandering from the powers that be, one that makes Hilary Clinton almost look admirable. We now live in a world where a celebrated response to the violence taking place in our country involves ABC hiring the first black man to star in “The Bachelor.”

It was monumental news in 2017 when Rachel Lindsay became the first black “Bachelorette.” Lindsay had been a contestant on “The Bachelor” earlier that same year, finishing in third place. A member of the esteemed Delta Sigma Theta sorority, Lindsay is a lawyer with degrees from both the University of Texas at Austin and Marquette University. While Lindsay deserves our utmost respect, she’s become a figure of the soft-shoe civil rights cabal that placates black people with flash but no substance.

Lindsay predicted last year she would probably be the only black “Bachelorette,” as if it’s some great accomplishment to be the star of a reality TV show. Yet in the post-Obama era, our culture claims black people do meaningfully benefit from a black man holding the vaunted position of “Bachelor.” We have reached the peak of media-induced, commodity-based, social justice platitudes. The arms race for who can make the most money by appearing the most woke continues.

Now more than ever, people can be famous just for being famous. This is what fueled Don Lemon’s call for celebrities to speak up on politics, which Dave Chappelle took to task in his new comedy special. Chappelle also addressed Candace Owens’ viral commentary on black agency in regard to the death of George Floyd. Chappelle clarified that Floyd’s state-sponsored murderers cemented his legacy as a hero, and that his martyrdom was nobody’s choosing but their own.

Imperfect martyrs happen to make a lot of sense sometimes. Owens’ genius is clarified by her ability to generate her own fame, unlike Rachel Lindsey. (Owens, of course, tweeted to say she found Chappelle’s jokes at her expense quite entertaining.) It is interesting to compare Owens and Lindsay as a means of examining our current state of affairs. Significant questions arise about how we make sense of the modern world.

Some have argued we hardly benefitted from having a black president. So what does it really do for me as black man that the Bachelor happens to be black as well? The notion that the first black Bachelor is something to care about or celebrate is just like Chappelle’s recent commentary—so funny that it’s not funny.

"BLM Doesn't Care About All Black Lives, Just The Few Ended By Police","Positing that “Black Lives Matter” is such an obvious fact that repeating it sounds banal. Only an outright racist would question this premise. Therefore, the frequent “All Lives Matter” retort of critics often inflames the sensibilities of activists, with many in the BLM movement find this assertion objectionable on the basis that it misinterprets their message. The phrase “Black Lives Matter” is not a declaration that other lives are unimportant, activists say, but an affirmation that black lives are worth protecting.

Activists usually invoke the controversial killings of black men by the police to argue that black lives are treated as insignificant in America. But while footage depicting black men shot by police may draw raw emotions, such cases are extremely rare.

Although protesting police brutality is entirely legitimate, the BLM movement is built on the specious claim that as a result of systemic racism, black men are disproportionately killed by the police. So, by mischaracterizing the problem as “systemic racism,” the BLM movement will ultimately fail in its pursuit to save black lives.

Let’s Be Honest About ‘Systemic Racism’

The BLM movement could be an effective force for police reform, but activists wrongly direct their anger at eliminating the element of “systemic racism” they say permeates police departments, despite the lack of data implicating its existence. Several studies have shown that the claim of widespread racism in law enforcement is baseless. For instance, a study published by Harvard economist Roland Fryer found that black Americans are less likely to be shot by police when compared to their Caucasian counterparts, even when black Americans wield weapons.

To some skeptics, this may not be enough to disprove systemic racism. Cynics postulate if police officers could get away murdering black Americans without facing the consequences, then they would do so. Yet in the article “The Reverse Racism Effect: Are Cops More Hesitant to Shoot Black Than White Suspects?” researchers show that due to trepidation stemming from possible legal and social consequences, police officers are more circumspect when deciding to shoot black suspects than Caucasians. This, in turn, leads to fewer mistakes and slower response times in a simulated policing environment. If racism is rampant in the police force, why would officers refuse to act on this impulse in real-life situations because they fear the resulting implications, then act on it under simulated conditions when they can kill blacks with impunity?

Yet even if black Americans were disproportionately killed by police, would this be evidence of systemic racism? Contrary to the speculations of activists, research suggests the answer is “no.” In an article published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found “no evidence of anti-black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-white officers.’’

The study, however, further notes that “as the proportion of violent crime committed by black civilians increased, a person fatally shot was more likely to be black.” Similar trends were also reported for Hispanics. It can reasonably be concluded the greater likelihood of black Americans being killed by officers is a result of their higher level of exposure incidents involving police.

Police Killings of Unarmed Black Men Are Extremely Rare

Despite the moral indignation of activists, there is no logical justification for so many of their beliefs. Even when we are discussing the matter of extrajudicial killings, the evidence suggests that American police kill very few unarmed individuals. According to the database of the Washington Post, only 15 unarmed black Americans were killed in 2019. The figure for Caucasians was only slightly higher. Additionally, unarmed does not mean non-violent — even a suspect who physically attacks a police officer is classified as unarmed.

The argument that black Americans are inordinately killed by the police when accounting for their size in the population is also fallacious. Although they are only 13 percent of the population, the fact remains that black Americans are responsible for a much higher percentage of homicides in America relative to their share of the population.

In a recent article, researcher Heather Macdonald aptly describes the extensive involvement of blacks in crime: “Between 2012 and 2015, blacks committed 85.5 percent of all black-white interracial victimizations (excluding interracial homicide, which is also disproportionately black-on-white). That works out to 540,360 felonious assaults on whites. Whites committed 14.4 percent of all interracial violent victimization or 91,470 felonious assaults on blacks.”

If major players in the BLM movement care about black lives, then they ought to focus on reforms that can improve the quality of life for black Americans. Presently, several activists have been recommending that states defund the police force. But the effect of this policy will be the reverse of what lobbyists desire. Defunding or abolishing the police will make it harder for officers to police crime-ridden inner-city communities, mainly occupied by blacks Americans.

Real Criminal Justice Reforms Are Needed

Ending the war on marijuana is a worthwhile alternative to reduce hostile interactions between blacks Americans and the police as well as reducing the black incarceration rate. During 2015-2017, there were more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined. This proposal will not only result in fewer black Americans being imprisoned, but more resources will be devoted to solving and preventing serious crimes; thereby saving the lives of black Americans who are more likely to be victims of violent crimes.

It is good that the BLM movement is working to ensure that black Americans are protected from police brutality. Yet it should also work to eliminate other policies instituted by the American government that can indeed become obstacles to justice. One such policy usually criticized by Libertarians is prosecutorial immunity. As Clark Neily illustrates in his essay “A Libertarian Vision for Criminal Justice”:

Absolute prosecutorial immunity is precisely what it sounds like: a complete bar on suing prosecutors for anything they do within the scope of their job as a prosecutor. Incredibly, that includes deliberate acts of malfeasance, such as knowingly and even vindictively prosecuting an innocent person and even suborning perjury to help secure an unjust conviction.

For the BLM movement to become a serious organization, its adherents must propose sensible policies that can ameliorate the conditions of Black America.

Stable Families Benefit All of Society

Another variable that is often not mentioned in this debate is the role of families in improving outcomes for black Americans. Research has shown that young people raised in stable two-parent homes generate higher incomes than their contemporaries raised by single parents.

Sociologist David Popenoe has spent a career documenting the appalling effects of fatherlessness. Based on the findings of a landmark study, “racial income gaps are smaller when more fathers and married adults are present in a black boy’s community, irrespective of his own personal situation.”

Communities with stronger families are richer in social capital and opportunities; hence the benefits of residing in such neighborhoods, also positively affect children, whose own parents may not be living together. Fixing black families, therefore, will produce a beneficial effect for black Americans overall.

It is incredibly important that leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement take an inward look by examining how blacks Americans can create stronger families. The improved outcomes that will result will, by extension, reduce the negative externalities caused by unstable families which can manifest in criminal activity.

The BLM movement must dismiss hysterical recommendations. It must advocate serious reforms of the criminal justice system that ensure that the application of justice is fair and equitable. Furthermore, activists cannot expect most people to endorse the BLM movement when supporters seem to ignore the facts that black Americans so frequently take the lives of other blacks.

Black Lives Matter will not be a legitimate movement until activists begin to care about all lives — not just those killed by the police. Unless and until the BLM movement accepts the facts of reality, it will always remain a rogue group.

Blackburn Pushes DOJ To Examine Google's Power Over Free Speech,"Republican Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn penned a letter to Attorney General William Barr Monday urging the Department of Justice to conduct a thorough antitrust investigation into Google’s monopolistic power over the internet after the tech giant’s recent attack on The Federalist.

“As your antitrust investigation of Google intensified, I urge you to thoroughly scrutinize how the company’s anticompetitive practices could lead to the crippling of journalistic freedom,” Blackburn wrote. “I also ask that your probe examine abuses in both the online advertising and online search markets, and to take enforcement action swiftly before further economic harm results.”

The letter comes just less than a week after Google threatened to ban The Federalist from profiting on the search engine’s ad revenue based on an NBC report compiled with a foreign left-wing think tank charging Federalist reporting with violating Google’s terms of service. The reporting in question, while not publicly known, likely centers on a piece from Federalist Political Editor John Davidson exposing the legacy media’s dishonest coverage of recent riots engulfing the nation. NBC’s “Verification Unit,” in collusion with the United Kingdom’s “Center for Countering Digital Hate” claimed that Federalist journalism was racially insensitive.

Google later released a statement on the same day NBC News broke the story that The Federalist had been demonetized, clarifying that no action had been taken against the conservative website and instead merely threatened sanctions not for its published content but for information in its comment section which have since been temporarily disabled. Federalist executives have pledged however, that the comment section will come back. Meanwhile, Google-owned YouTube’s infamous comment sections well-known for nefarious content have continued to operate uncensored.

Blackburn, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Tech Task Force praised Barr’s move to ramp up DOJ efforts to curb liability protections to the Silicon Valley tech giants provided in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act in light of Google’s most recent episode of selective censorship but pushed the Justice Department to do more. A Daily Caller analysis of the Justice Department’s current probe into Google published Sunday shows that federal investigators appear to be ignoring bias claims in Google’s search algorithms even as its search engine dominates roughly 90 percent of the entire internet.

“They are not an infant business,” Blackburn said, arguing they no longer need broad government protections. “They are some of the biggest corporations in this country, and they should not be given protections that other businesses or private citizens are not given.”

AOC Faces Twitter Backlash After Claiming ‘Latinos Are Black’,"Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez exclaimed in a recent interview, “I always say Latinos are black!”

.@AOC: “Latinos are black … We have to have conversations around ‘colorism,’ and we have to have conversations around the African and indigenous roots from which we come and how that’s reflected in systems of power.” pic.twitter.com/ki1lDDNhKS — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) June 22, 2020

She continued, “We run an entire racial spectrum so we have to have conversations around ‘colorism,’ and we have to have conversations around the African and indigenous roots from which we come and how that’s reflected in systems of power, wealth inequality, and frankly, our political system.” AOC, however, did not expand on how, ‘wealth inequality’ and ‘the system’, reflect ‘colorism.'”

One Hispanic-American Twitter user found her statement offensive, writing, “Don’t you dare use our brown skin to co-opt the Black experience in America as far as their contributions to our nation’s development & culture. Just because we aren’t white doesn’t mean we are to cling to Black America’s *unique* history!”

NO @AOC! We Hispanics are NOT Black! Don't you dare use our brown skin to co-opt the Black experience in America as far as their contributions to our nation's development & culture. Just because we aren't white doesn't mean we are to cling to Black America's *unique* history! https://t.co/9go7EknG38 — Ruben D. Sanchez Jr (@rdsanchezjr) June 22, 2020

Some laughed at AOC’s claim to be black:

Others who have faced ridicule for appropriating another race include former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, whomPresident Trump mercilessly mocked with the nickname “Pocahontas,” and Rachel Dolezal, the former professor and NAACP president who was, in fact, white.

Last year, in an MSNBC interview, AOC proclaimed she wasn’t black. “My identity is the descendant of many different identities. I am the descendant of African slaves. I am the descendant of indigenous people. I am the descendant of Spanish colonizers… I am a descendant of all sorts of folks. That doesn’t mean I’m black, that doesn’t mean I’m native, but I can tell the story of my ancestors.”

So what’s changed? In the wake of the George Floyd race riots, the left has focused its attention almost exclusively on black Americans. Some Twitter users speculated that the reason media darling AOC was not black a few months ago, but claims to be black now, may have something to do with a competition for victimhood. One user declared AOC “clearly can’t stand the fact she’s not the biggest victim right now.”

Hahahaha @AOC clearly can’t stand the fact that she’s not the biggest victim right now… — 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗣𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗘𝗘 (@RepubRepartee) June 22, 2020

No word yet on whether Black Lives Matter embraces AOC’s blackness, or if they believe it’s another case of opportunism and cultural appropriation.

Celebs Call To Abolish The Police While Hiding Behind Private Security,"The Black Lives Matter movement seeks to counter the systemic racism they believe is foundational in American culture with a systemic solution: defunding the police. The calls to defund the police have reached the ears of every elected official, from local levels up to the federal executive. Now, the cries from the street are being echoed by celebrities.

A group of some of the most notable black artists in America have penned a letter to studios and Hollywood executives demanding the entertainment industry divest from police. But the experience of the wealthy in the absence of police will be far different than that of the average BLM protester.

While many on the left have said that defunding the police does not mean disbanding them entirely, many others have said that abolishing the police force is exactly what they have in mind. A public letter from black artists and thinkers states they are inspired by the protesters, and want to amplify their demands:

[The protesters’s] courage and imagination have inspired us to build on their necessary demands — including, chiefly, the abolition of police, and the complete dismantling of the racist prison-industrial system. Through this statement, we hope to amplify the movement’s work and to call out our own industries for what they are: institutions that promote colonialism, capitalism, and racism, and that function in exploitative and destructive ways.

In echoing the protester’s demands, these celebs claim themselves and their industry as part of the “systemic” alleged problems. Instead of using the clout and platform that accompanies celebrity status to offer leadership or guidance to those marching in the streets, they first offer to dismantle their own workplaces. The letter calls on cultural institutions to act:

…publicly condemn the use of police as a violent force that exists to further class divisions and capitalistic exploitation which harm our communities. Museums, arts foundations, theaters, studios, events venues, festivals, universities, libraries, book stores, publishing houses, schools, and social media companies must break contracts with police departments and reconceive what it means to keep art, audiences, and patrons safe. This is a first and clear step that cultural institutions must take toward the broader call to defund the police nationwide.

This level of self-obsession is so typical of members of the celebrity class. But what would this mean in terms of actionable, real consequences? If there were no police, or a force that had been cut in half or more, what would this look like?

Speaking to The Daily, John Eligan relays his conversation with a Black Lives Matter activist who details her take on what the abolishing of police would be like in practice. “It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need,” she tells Eligan, “We can’t decide that.”

Theoretically, money would be diverted from police departments to community-based programs, where people would decide for their communities what they need. At a studio level or the level of cultural institutions across the board, those organizations and businesses would decide what they need for security.

Many options are not police-based. Facial recognition software could be used to require all visitors, artists, and executives to be vetted via criminal background checks to ensure criminals aren’t coming on set. If everyone could be fingerprinted, these fingerprints could be used to gain entry to these unpoliced spaces. Of course, studios could also hire private security companies for protection.

But while it’s one thing to attempt such reforms at the institutional level where people can consent to give up their privacy or employ cops-for-hire so these spaces stay safe, what about in entire metropolises?

Celebs Can Go Without Police — Regular Americans Can’t

Instead of police responding to homelessness, “homelessness outreach personnel” would respond. Instead of police responding to late-night domestic disputes, social workers would pull up in their Subarus ready to make a new case file. Instead of police responding to violent crime, members of the community would respond in whatever way their neighborhood group saw fit. Instead of police investigating homicides or organized crime, something else would happen — or not. According to the “Defund The Police” activists, police don’t do a great job anyway, so they wouldn’t be missed.

In his interview with the BLM activist, Elgin brought up that, while they were different and distinct cases, self-deputized members of the community took matters into their own hands to end the lives of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery. Her response was, “I know, I get that, and I’ll be really real with you. I don’t have all the answers for that either, I don’t, and I wish I did.”

The celebs who penned this letter don’t have concrete answers either. What they demand and present are platitudes: “to break ties with the police…put their money where their mouths are…advocate for black people…get educated…[and] imagine black freedom.”

If cultural institutions stopped working with the police, they would hire private security companies to do the work instead. Private security companies are not beholden to anything or anyone other than their clients. Celebs who already have bodyguards or security details would be able to retain those services as well. While celebs would be safe and snug behind their walls of wealth, communities across the country would be left vulnerable to dangerous criminals.

When the wealthy call for defunding police, they are speaking from a place of privilege in society that means they can have little to no regard for those who are most affected by the decline in the enforcement of criminal laws.

Calls to ‘Abolish the Police’ Are Wildly Utopian

The narrative against police that tells us crime is a direct result of social inequity, and that should social inequity be destroyed crime would not exist, is driving this conversation that our nation does not need police. But it is a lie.

There is this idea that if there were no police, if that money were redirected at vulnerable communities, there would be no crime in these areas. The claim is that in the absence of systemic problems, there would be no reason for people to commit crimes. Despair and economic injustice leads to crime, goes the claim. A group called MPD150, which advocates for abolishing police in Minneapolis, states:

Crime isn’t random. Most of the time, it happens when someone has been unable to meet their basic needs through other means. So to really ‘fight crime,’ we don’t need more cops’ we need more jobs, more education, opportunities, more arts programs, more community centers, more mental health resources, and more of a say in how communities function.

This concept is not rational or reasoned. It is the eternal attempt of human beings striving for a utopia, a paradise on earth, a perfect commune where everyone has what he needs and wants for no more. It isn’t reality. Material gain does not eliminate the human drive for more; often, it accelerates it.

The black artists and celebrities of “Black Artists for Freedom” have not chosen to display leadership. Instead, they are seeking a way to remain safe within the industry that butters their bread. A group of people requesting the abolition of something they don’t even need is disingenuous at best, and callous at worst.

Every time police lessen their presence in the vulnerable communities of New York, Minneapolis, Seattle, or elsewhere, more death always comes for the downtrodden. In turn, the result is more violence and less accountability for both criminals and police.

In giving their voices to the mob, these artists have done little for liberation. Instead, all they’ve done is provided cover to those who would violate the very communities they claim a desire to protect.

Loyola Professor Faces Dueling Petitions As Students Demand Firing,"Economics Professor Walter Block at Loyola University of New Orleans faces dueling petitions as students try to oust the self-described libertarian academic over what some claim are racist comments in The New York Times six years ago. Block supposedly said slavery was “not so bad – you pick cotton and sing songs,” but his comments were so misconstrued by the Times that the publication settled with him in a defamation lawsuit.

Nevertheless, students dedicated to “social justice” are now demanding the university fire the tenured professor who chairs the school’s economics department. Their petition for his firing has so far garnered only few more than 600 signatures as of this writing. None of those who have signed so far, Block told The Federalist, were ever his students, to his knowledge.

“If Loyola is really wanting to remove racism, they should remove racists from teaching,” the petition states. The students also sent a letter to university administrators with their demands, complaining Block’s alleged statements justified “segregation by saying ‘no one is compelled to associate with people against their will,'” and that “black people and women deserved to be paid less” because “they are considered ‘less productive,'” according to the Loyola Maroon, the university newspaper.

The students’ campaign to oust the professor provoked Anton Chamberlin, a former business student of Block’s, to begin a counter-petition in his favor. It calls on the university to give the professor a raise for putting up with the campus outrage circus. The online petition to “Give Walter Block a Pay Raise” has received more than 2,500 signatures as of this writing Monday evening.

“To call Dr. Block a racist and a sexist is defamatory to the highest level,” Chamberlin’s counter-petition states. “As compensation for being raked over the coals by many over the last decade, we demand that the wonderful Dr. Walter Block not be fired, but given a RAISE.”

While Block’s comments in the Times have been proven to be misquoted, Block told The Federalist he stands by the other statements students accused him of saying. They are merely framing his words to fit a false left-wing narrative, he said.

Block compared his comments defending the freedom of association to the Colorado Masterpiece Cakeshop case, in which the Supreme Court ruled in a 7-2 decision that a religious baker was free to refuse service to a gay wedding.

“No one should be forced to associate with anyone against their will,” Block said.

On the charges of sexism, Block said he was “not rooting for anyone,” and was merely explaining the findings of his research on socioeconomic income gaps. Married women, Block said, simply take on more housekeeping duties than men, which makes them earn less. Among never-married women and never-married men, there is no gap.

While Block comes under fire from students ripping statements out of context, University President Tania Tetlow has signaled no appetite for caving to mob demands to remove the tenured professor.

“The problem with disciplining somebody based on their research and publications is that we have this principle which can at times be heroic, and at times really get in the way of what we want to achieve, of proclaiming our own values of academic freedom,” Tetlow said during a recent student town hall where she defended her university’s economics chair, according to the Maroon. “How do you tell the difference between what is having ideological diversity between your faculty, which is something we want? Right, we don’t want to only be taught by people with whom we agree because that’s not how we learn, versus ideology which we find hateful and destructive and insulting and undermining to our students.”

Block told The Federalist his door is open to any students wishing to speak with him, but so far none sponsoring the petition have even attempted to approach a conversation.

“They don’t want to talk to me because I’m offensive,” Block said, adding the irony that he actually agrees with the students who proclaim “Black Lives Matter.”

“I think black lives matter. I think all lives matter, And I would go as far as to say I think black lives matter particularly since they are most at risk, most in dire straights, of all such groups,” Block said, going on to argue that “black poverty is a function of black families falling apart and black families falling apart is a result of the welfare system.”

If students protesting for “Black Lives Matter” really want to save black lives, Block said, they’d be protesting big government and the war on drugs.

“The reason they’re in trouble is because of government programs, such as welfare, which breaks up the family, drug prohibition which leads to shoot outs over turf, [and] minimum wage laws which create unemployment against them,” Block said. “If we legalized drugs, we’d save a lot of black lives.”

The longtime professor also issued a warning for younger professors whose ideology falls anywhere right of center. He said they should focus on mundane research projects, such as the price elasticity of bananas, to achieve tenure before diving into hot topics: “My advice to young scholars is, ‘Shut up until you get tenure.'”

The Two Very Different Meanings Of ‘Black Lives Matter’,"Vice President Mike Pence found himself in some hot water this week when he refused to say the words, “Black Lives Matter” (BLM). At first glance, it is difficult to understand why anyone would have any reason not to say three words that are so obviously right and true. But in fact, the situation is more complicated and that is because the term has two very distinct, if not contradictory meanings in today’s America. One is a general statement of support for civil rights; the other is a loose Marxist organization with a clear radical agenda.

BLM began as the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in 2013 in wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. That earliest iteration of the term was the general statement of support. But very quickly BLM became the umbrella name for a network of loosely affiliated activist groups with a very far left set of objectives. In fact one of the founders has said on video that the organization was founded by “trained Marxists.”

Like other left-wing activist groups such as Anonymous, and Antifa, Black Lives Matter, the organization, is very decentralized and therefore hard to pin down. This is by design. One product of this decentralization is that it is very hard to know exactly what BLM wants.

Sometimes it is defund the police, sometimes it is demilitarize the police, sometimes it is end capitalism and sometimes it is greater capital investment in black communities. This week Shaun King, an activist journalist associated with BLM suggested that statues depicting Jesus as white should be taken down. It really runs the gamut and with no strict leadership one cannot say they support the organization Black Lives Matter without also supporting some rather off-the-wall stuff, hence Pence’s demurring.

But then there is the other meaning of Black Lives Matter, or perhaps it is the lower case black lives matter. This is a sentiment no sane person can object to. And whether ones believes that the disproportionate amount of police interactions that black Americans have is a result of systemic racism, or horrible government management of black communities, or a combination, we should all be able to admit the disproportionate interactions lead to more police violence and that is an important and legitimate problem.

The general statement “black lives matter” can be used to described approaches to create greater equality for black Americans from both the left and the right, the organization, “Black Lives Matters” demonstrably cannot. This creates a problem with no easy solution.

A new phrase could be chosen for the general statement of support, leaving BLM’s sole definition as the organization. Also, the organization could become more centralized and offer more moderate leadership and policy proposals that majorities of Americans can get behind. The latter seems unlikely though. As we have seen across the country, but especially at Seattle’s Capitol Hill Occupied Zone, that even compared to 10 years ago at Occupy Wall Street, today’s protest leaders have very little ability to control the mobs.

The only option that really leaves is for people to understand the complicated duality that exists within the term. A good answer from Pence would have been, “Of course I support the truth that black lives matter, but I do not support Marxists organizations with that name who I firmly believe will set back the cause of equal and robust opportunity for all Americans.”

Over the past few weeks of protest, violence, and debate over racism in the United States what has been missing has been a shared set of definitions that we can use to talk about the problems and arrive at policy fixes. It’s not just the term BLM, “defund the police,” has also come to take on two meanings, one meaning reform, the other abolition.

Even the term racism itself has no agreed upon meaning. On the left it is a systemic problem imbued in every aspect of life. On the right it is a belief or action of intentional bigotry. This is a rare case where people in a single country and a single society are developing two separate languages incapable of meaningful communication between each other. Until that changes, it is hard to imagine meaningful progress occurring. And unfortunately our confused tongues still seem very far from the shared language we need.

Hillsdale Grad Who Rejected BLM Petition: Actions Trump Words,"Tori Hope Petersen almost signed the petition she went viral for opposing. An alumni letter addressed to Hillsdale College, demanding the school speak out in favor of Black Lives Matter, caught traction in the weeks after George Floyd’s killing. Petersen credits “the hand of God” for inspiring her to pause before signing it.

Written by a white female graduate, the letter to Hillsdale said in part:

Your silence is evidence of your complicity and apathy on matters of racial equity. Your refusal to take a stand against the tyranny of our militarized police force is evidence of your abandonment of your founding principles. Your reticence during this time amounts to erasure. Your lack of a statement admonishing white supremacy is a silent consent. Other major institutions are reckoning with their place in this movement. You have the platform and ability to set a standard for your student body and faculty, Conservatives at large, and anyone who seeks to uphold the Good, True, and Beautiful.

Hillsdale responded by pointing unapologetically to its record on racial equity, methodically dismantling that argument that publishing a statement of solidarity was necessary given the college’s proud history of combating racism.

Petersen, a black woman who went into the foster care system at age 12 after growing up in Ohio with a “single, mentally-ill, abusive mother,” attended the school on a track scholarship and a grant. She’s now a wife, a mother, and an advocate for foster youth living in Minnesota.

In a Monday interview, Petersen reflected on her initial reaction to the petition. “When I first read the letter, instantly I thought ‘Oh she’s right, Hillsdale should be speaking up about this,” Peterson told me. “And as time went on, and then Hillsdale did respond, I thought, ‘What has Hillsdale done for me?” So Petersen pushed back.

“I was very scared of putting it out there,” Petersen said of the thoughtful letter she published on her website, an eloquent rebuttal to the petition and its reliance on the ascendant notion that silence necessarily indicates agreement, or even violence.

Petersen walked through the myriad ways Hillsdale empowered her, financially, emotionally, and academically. From a scholarship to an outpouring of support during an unplanned pregnancy, the school, Petersen emphasized, spoke loudly and clearly. “Hillsdale College doesn’t have to be loud with their words, because they’re bold in their actions and consistent in their education,” she argued.

“I felt it was necessary to write the letter,” Petersen told me, “because Hillsdale’s motto is ‘what is true, what is good, and what is beautiful,’ and I felt like what I was reading wasn’t true. It wasn’t the full picture.”

“I just felt it was so important because I really wanted to encourage the leadership who had encouraged me, and I wanted to shine a light on what is true, and that’s why I tried to give very tangible examples of what Hillsdale and the leadership there have actually done,” she added. Hillsdale “has been saying something all along,” Petersen realized.

People immediately responded to Petersen’s post—including the woman who wrote the original petition. “She thanked me for starting the dialogue, and then she told me that she was going to donate to the Fostering the Good scholarship. She said, ‘I disagree with you, but I thank you for starting a dialogue and I’m going to donate to the scholarship.'” Fostering the Good is a fund Petersen helped start for Hillsdale students.

Asked why she thought a white woman drafted a petition speaking to what the black community needed from Hillsdale, Petersen said, “It does worry me that people who are not of color are claiming the struggle as their own for attention, to build their platform.”

“That’s frightening,” she continued. “I can’t say that I know her heart, but I wish that she would have sought out other minorities.” Another young woman who wrote her own letter to the college told Petersen, “I wish I would have read a letter like yours before I wrote mine.”

So why does she think her fellow Hillsdale alumni signed onto the letter? “It’s so tense, everyone is emotional about this topic. We’re trying to reconcile our faith, and our politics, and our education and the way we’ve been raised with this huge cultural devastation. And we’re thinking, ‘Oh, how can we help? Well, maybe we’ll get this institution that has a national voice to say something.'”

“I think there are people who are just trying to be godly, they’re trying to do the right thing, and so there’s this signature line that’s so easy to sign, and I think they just did it without thinking about the things we were taught because of the school,” she speculated.

Hillsdale’s response, Petersen said, provides a helpful model for the country. “I live in Minnesota. I have friends who look outside and there are buildings burning. So to be prudent, to be slow, to want to help in a way that’s actually helpful. I that’s what we should all be doing. They’re just modeling for us.”

“They embodied the virtue that they teach all of us,” said Petersen, “and that is prudence. The second thing that I’ve tried to keep in mind during all this is that if our nation, if our people do need to change in any capacity, that change takes time.”

She added, “I always think young, vulnerable people who have all this trauma and these triggers, we don’t just expect them to fix what is broken. We give them tools, they go to counseling, and we give them the time to really dig up those roots and re-cultivate what might be wrong so that they can bear good fruit. So I think being prudent is okay, being slow to speak in the midst of all of this is okay.”

In Petersen’s experience, Hillsdale’s efforts to “understand” also reflect efforts that should be emulated on a national scale. “I think that’s one of the biggest cries from the black community and from suffering people right now is just ‘hear my experience.’ And I think that’s what I loved about Hillsdale is that they can never fully know me or understand me because most of them do not have a background anything like me, but they try their very hardest to understand me.”

One of the country’s “core problems,” according to Petersen, “is that we’re not seeing each other as God sees us. We’re not seeing each other fully. And that’s why black men are being killed unjustly. That’s why white men are being judged unfairly. There’s not just one side to this.”

Another step towards healing, as Petersen sees it, is “to stop playing hero and let people be the heroes of their own stories.”

“We can be allies and lovers of our neighbors, and encouragers, but no one wants someone to come and save them. We dance beautifully together if we learn to give and take, but we are depriving people of creating beauty in their own stories if we are only givers or only takers,” she continued.

As an advocate for kids in the foster care system, Petersen is passionate about spreading the word about how others can assist. “When people see the foster care system they think, ‘Oh, I have to be a foster parent to help.’ And foster parents are so needed, especially in this time as the COVID pandemic will bring so many youth into the foster care because abuse and neglect is skyrocketing just as it did in the 2008 recession,” she explained.

“But,” Petersen continued, “if you don’t want to be a foster parent, some influential people in my story were my mentors, it was my track coach. So just being there for vulnerable youth, again, trying to understand their story.”

She uses her website and social media accounts, particularly Instagram, to raise awareness about foster care and adoption, and “hopefully shine light on the gospel.”

“A lot of people have reached out to me,” Petersen told me on Monday, reflecting on the Hillsdale community’s response to her letter. “Before we got on our phone call, I was crying to my husband because I just couldn’t believe all of the messages that I’m getting.”

“I wrote it to be an encouragement, but I didn’t think that I would get a response like this so quickly,” she said.

Christians Don’t Need The Black Lives Matter Movement To Defeat Evil,"As churches across America restart in-person services, Christians and their pastors are feeling the heat. The “heat,” however, is not from the lack of air conditioning in the sanctuary as things get hot and humid — it’s the pressure to “say something” in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Yet just as Christians shouldn’t feel obligated to issue “official church statements” every time sin is committed (there would be little time for anything else), they should oppose demands from Black Lives Matter activists to “take their Christianity further.” Why? The gospel is already sufficient.

Believers living out Christ’s commands to love God and love their neighbors as themselves led the West’s push to abolish slavery. Christians acting out a sincere application of the gospel were at the forefront of the civil rights movement, a movement steeped in the biblical message of neighborly love. We’re already in possession of the ultimate “user’s manual” to bring peace to our nation and defeat evil wherever it lurks — it’s called the Bible.

The Dangerous Retreat from The Word

One of the most emblematic summations of the insidious “say something, the gospel isn’t enough” line of thinking was expressed by author and blogger Kristen Howerton. On Twitter, Howerton implored her fellow believers, “Do not treat the protests as a new mission field. Do not go to ‘love on people’ or to lead people in prayer. Do not go to ‘be a Christian voice in the crowd’ or to share God’s love or to witness to people. Go to fight systemic racism and racial violence. The end.”

This sort of belief is omnipresent right now among American Christians of all ages. I see it in my social media feeds. If you’ve been on social media lately, you’ve likely seen it too. What we need to do is live out the teachings of Jesus Christ to the best of our flawed human ability every day. Yet the idea that Christians need to “do more” than this has permeated the highest, most prominent echelons of Christian ministry.

Brian Houston, a founder of Hillsong Church, called for “radical” and “permanent” change to combat the “systemic issues” facing black Americans, then tweeted his disappointment when a pastor of a U.K. Hillsong Church did not express what Houston considered sufficient solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Houston’s apology on behalf of his British colleague ended with “#BlackLivesMatter” and the three raised fists emoji that symbolizes BLM activism.

It would be disheartening enough if it were just simply that Christians felt pressured to support a dangerous, manifestly anti-Christian movement based on neo-Marxist ideology. It’s worse, however, that by related words and deeds, many of these same Christians appear to insinuate that the BLM movement can provide something that the gospel cannot.

Christians Led the Modern Charge to Peacefully End Injustice

The idea that the gospel is not enough to defeat evil is a belief that could severely hamper the work of the Kingdom. Thankfully, the history of the last two centuries is enough to prove otherwise.

Many of the most influential and successful abolitionists were Christians who used the Bible to soften the hearts of men and win the fight to end the horrible practice of slavery in the West. Picking up where Christian Quaker abolitionists left off, evangelical Anglican William Wilberforce was the driving force behind the British Empire’s ban on the slave trade in 1807. Ultimately, the efforts of Wilberforce and the movement he spearheaded with fellow Anglican Thomas Clarkson led to the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, ending slavery throughout the British Empire.

Deep Christian faith was also at the heart of the work done by John G. Fee, one of the leading Southern abolitionists. In 1855, Fee founded Berea College “in the midst of many privations and persecutions to preach and apply a gospel of impartial love.” Berea was the first non-segregated college in the South to admit black and Caucasian students, and its motto — “God has made of one blood all peoples of the earth” — was lifted directly from the Bible’s Acts 17:26.

In his autobiography, Fee writes the biblical command to “love thy neighbor as thyself” was “pressed upon his conscience.” Throughout his life, he strived to wholly embrace that principle and live it “in honest practice.”

Led by Martin Luther King, Jr. several Christian ministers including Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, and Hosea Williams joined to found the influential Southern Christian Leadership Conference that served as the spiritual and ideological backbone of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and beyond. The gospel’s message of neighborly love was the forefront of their purpose and the centerpiece of their advocacy for non-violence as embodied by Matthew 5:38-40.

Methodist preacher James Lawson was called “the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world” by MLK, Jr. and “the architect” of the civil rights movement by Rep. John Lewis. Lawson helped organize the Freedom Rides and saw the civil rights struggle as much of a spiritual struggle as it was a political one. “The Christian favors the breaking down of racial barriers,” said Lawson, “because the redeemed community of which he is already a citizen recognizes no barriers dividing humanity.”

For both Christian abolitionists and civil rights leaders, the words of the Bible and abiding faith in the Almighty were all they needed to achieve victory and justice for members of God’s family being denied their natural rights as endowed by their Creator. If slavery and government-sponsored Jim Crow legislation could be defeated by the irresistible love the gospel promotes, Christians should take heart that the power of the Word can work the same wonders again and unite a fractious nation.

The Bible Provides All the Guidance We Need

Those who practice authentic Christianity do not need any pointers on how to defeat evil. They especially don’t need to borrow ideas from the Black Lives Matter movement, which, since the tragic death of George Floyd has led to at least 24 new deaths as a result of violent rioting, looting, and chaos. While the true cost of the vandalism and destruction unleashed by the movement may not be fully known for years to come, the latest estimates place property damages at more than $500 million in Minnesota alone.

Of course, much of this could likely have been avoided if instead of encouraging and standing with the BLM movement and other radical leftist neo-Marxists, the more than 210 million self-professed Christians living in America took the text of the New Testament to heart.

Christians don’t need to adopt the positions of BLM movement to spread a message of equality. The instructions on how to live in harmony with our fellow brothers and sisters are right before us. Besides the well-known words of Galatians 3:28-29, in Ephesians 2:14 the Apostle Paul proclaims, “For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us.”

Throughout the New Testament, Christians are reminded that “sin is lawlessness” as written in 1 John 3:4; similarly, in 1 Peter 4:15, “If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other people’s affairs.” We also see in the New Testament that the misinformed nature of many found at riots and scenes of chaos has not changed for thousands of years.

Just as recent rioters destroyed black-owned businesses, while others vandalize statues of abolitionists and rock stars they mistakenly suspect of being Indian hunters or slave traders, Luke relays a similar scene in Acts 19. When angry Ephesians felt Christians slighted their pagan god Artemis, a riot broke out. Anger boiled, “the whole city was filled with confusion,” and, lo and behold, “most of them didn’t even know why they were there.”

The local mayor ordered the rioters to calm down, and — in this case — they listened. Instead of stoking their rage, the mayor appealed to the rule of law. He tells the angry Ephesians to take up the matter with official courts “to be settled in a legal assembly.”

Paul shows the choice is neither to dismiss the cries of the angry nor to condone mob violence or vigilante justice. The Christian solution is to empathize with those who are hurting and then to have faith in the fixtures of civilized society to discharge justice as best as possible, knowing God will deliver the final justice in the end.

The Way to Healing

As stated in James 1:16-20, “the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.” Indeed, James warns against being carried away by earthly movements. The only cause we should be following whole-heartedly is the cause of the gospel of Jesus Christ:

Don’t be misled, my dear brothers and sisters. Whatever is good and perfect is a gift coming down to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens. He never changes or casts a shifting shadow. … You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires.

All Christians can, with confidence, emphatically say the words “black lives matter,” a statement that is resoundingly true. What they should not condone, however, is the BLM movement that removes the forgiveness, hope, and peace of the gospel and replaces those core values with continual protest, fear, and anger. As Paul reminds us in Romans 12:19, “Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, ‘I will take revenge; I will pay them back,’ says the Lord.”

The God-inspired words of the New Testament are already sufficient. The words and deeds of Jesus Christ are already sufficient. When before His last breath Christ proclaimed, “it is finished,” His mission was complete.

We’ll never know perfect human equality here on earth. But until our Lord returns, Christians can take comfort that the Bible app on their phone, the Holy Scripture resting on the shelf, and the Word in front of them in the church pew all contain the only guide needed to heal our broken world.

"Fox News Contributor Jessica Tarlov Says Black Lives Matter’s Marxist Roots, ‘Doesn’t Concern Me’","In a discussion on a potential federal police reform bill in the Senate on Thursday, FOX News contributor Lisa Boothe, fired at fellow contributor, Jessica Tarlov, for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, despite it’s Marxist ideology.

Tarlov argued, “[Black Lives Matter is] advocating for a platform that is based on the importance of treating black people in this country equally… All lives matter cannot occur until black lives matter equally.” Boothe interjected saying, “But do the Marxist tactics not concern you?” to which Jessica said, “No, it doesn’t concern me that there are roots in Marxism.”

Boothe cited a 2015 interview with BLM co founder, Patrisse Cullors, in which Cullors described herself and fellow founders as “trained Marxists”

Boothe articulated the BLM transition from a radical group to a nationwide movement, “What I think is frightening is you have Americans and American companies endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement…”

The list of big companies in support of BLM is extensive, and includes Google, Amazon, Facebook, Walmart, Target, and Home Depot to name a few, and these companies, explained Boothe helping to bankroll the Marxist movement.

Boothe pointed out that it wasn’t very long ago that Democrats agreed with Republicans about the radical nature of BLM, “In 2015 the D triple C was actually warning democrats not to embrace [BLM], saying that the organization is too radical.” In a leaked 2015 memo the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wrote to Democratic candidates “Don’t offer support” for the “concrete policy positions” of Black Lives Matter protesters.

Boothe expressed her dismay at the conflation of racial justice and the radical Marxist agenda of BLM.

I don’t understand why everyone is either too afraid or too dumb to realize what is blantently obvious, which is you can unequivocally believe that black lives matter in this country, while unequivocally denouncing a Marxist organization who is employing violent tactics out in the street, and I don’t understand why so many people aren’t making that case or why it is not being discussed. You see so many people cowering to this group that has roots in Marxism, which is so against what Americans stand for!

Boothe seems to be channeling the anger of many conservatives and Republican voters who are upset by the lack of leadership, clarity, and conviction from GOP representatives and party officials. Some members are even seen openly supporting Black Lives Matter.



Despite the incontrovertible video evidence of BLM’s Marxist leadership and political goals, the left-leaning FOX News contributor, Tarlov, insisted it “doesn’t concern me”. Her response may be an indication of just how much the Democrat Party has changed since 2015.

Watch BLM Protesters Insult And Attack Black Cops,"After police thwarted their attempt to topple the Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Square, using chemical irritants to push the crowd back, Black Lives Matter demonstrators spent the rainy night of June 23 agitating outside the White House, screaming obscenities at officers, setting fires, and more.

Law enforcement later removed the “Black House Autonomous Zone” encampment from St. John’s Church, where antifascists and others had set up tents and attempted to recreate the CHAZ territory in Seattle.

Protesters in Black Lives Matter Plaza, a strip of 16th Street just north of the White House, clashed with police again the next day, returning to taunt and shout at them, sometimes with a face mask, sometimes not. A white woman in Lululemon leggings mocked a black female police officer. A black office stood stoically for minutes while protesters yelled directly in his face.

This is a compilation of footage I captured while covering the events over the course of those two days.

"‘Woke’ White Woman Verbally Assaults Black Police, Claims Officer With Black Wife ‘Could Still Be Racist’","A white woman Black Lives Matter protestor in Washington D.C. argued white and black police officers over privilege and racism, a viral video posted to Twitter shows. The woman accuses one of the officers of racism after he says he was going to call his black wife.

“That doesn’t mean that you’re not racist, sir. Just because you have one black friend or a black wife,” she tells the cop. “You can still be racist. It has nothing to do with your acquaintances.”

She then begins to verbally taunt the group of police as they begin walking while waving around her “drawing.” One of the black officers in the group responded to her taunts about the officers being “intimidating.”

“It’s just we’re trying to have a conversation. You have a one-track mind,” he said. “There’s no point in having a conversation anymore. You have to be able to open both sides of the story.”

The woman, who clearly asserts her belief that only white people can be “systemically” racist, ignores the black cop and refuses his attempt to continue the conversation.

“If it doesn’t fit your agenda, you don’t want to hear it,” he exclaimed.

The woman then continues her verbal assault on the white officer asking him to show pictures of his black wife and kids in order to “believe him.”

“Why would you assume that because he’s white, he can’t have a black wife?” asks another black officer in the group.

The woman responds by backing away and claiming that it’s because he’s not wearing a mask and she doesn’t “want to get COVID.” The officer then begins to talk over her exasperated yells and begins to explain where racism’s roots lie.

“America has a sin problem. The world has a sin problem ma’am. Jesus said ‘I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me’,” the black officer said. “America and the world has a sin problem. You understand me? That’s where racism, injustice, and hate and anger and violence come from. It’s not about racism. Read the Bible.”

This isn’t the first time a white woman has abused her privilege. Here are seven other examples of times woke white women took things too far, even resorting to violence, in the name of protesting racism.

While Rao and Turner have clearly found a niche for their ideas among the wealthy elite who want to luxuriate in evenings of fine wine and self-flagellation, executives at Penguin Random House believe there is much wider appetite for books that point the finger at readers. In April they signed the pair to write “White Women: Everything You Already Know About Your Own Racism and How to Get Better.”

Their book joins a relatively new but growing genre of works – both fiction and nonfiction, by authors of all races – that aim to educate whites about the deep racism that supports their privileged lives. These woke beach reads infuse the best-selling template of white-bread chick lit with the consciousness of social justice warriors.

This spring brought “A Good Neighborhood” by New York Times best-selling author Therese Anne Fowler. It centers on Xavier, a polite, smart, classical guitar-playing black teenager in North Carolina, who starts dating a rich white neighbor and is falsely accused of raping her by her racist, sexist, pervert, tree-killing (yes, really) stepfather.

The boy’s lawyer tells him: “You are a black man accused of raping an underage white girl. If you put yourself in front of a jury, you’ve got twelve strangers who’ll be literally sitting in judgment of you. … Some of those jurors will be women. Some of them will be white. White fathers of teenage girls if the prosecution can manage it.”

At various points, Fowler, who is white, pauses to have characters lecture readers about the racist criminal justice system and the “talk” that many black parents have with their children about how the police won’t give them the benefit of the doubt. The novel adds class concerns to the racial mix. At Xavier’s bail hearing, his mother asks, “So if I happen to have a quarter mill laying around I lose nothing. But if I’m one of the ninety-nine percent who don’t, I forfeit twenty-five grand. That’s a fair system?”

Extended lectures about structural racism have become a regular feature of books that would be placed on a list of “beach reads.” In “Privilege,” the recently published campus novel by Mary Adkins, who is white, a biracial character named Bea recalls staying with the family of a white friend when a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer who killed Michael Brown.

“The conversation had left Bea frustrated – mostly with herself for not speaking up. … Was it really that hard for [her friend’s father] to understand that you’re treated differently based on race? Or did he just not want to know it? Was it that hard to know … that racial bias could be subconscious?”

The eponymous protagonist of the novel “Queenie,” a Jamaican British 20-something, makes it her mission to publish articles about police shootings in America and attend Black Lives Matter protests in London. “Another black man died in America today,” Queenie tells Darcy, a self-described “liberal” friend and co-worker. “Police killed him.”

“Oh no, what was he doing?” she asked absentmindedly. “What do you mean, ‘What was he doing?’ He wasn’t doing anything, he was driving.” The words burst forth from me. “And even if he was doing something, doesn’t mean he should be killed for it. … You asked a stupid question. … That sort of attitude is the problem. … I’m not calling you a racist, I’m saying that if the thinking is that someone should be killed for doing something wrong, that thinking is dangerous.”

None of these novels mentions the disproportionate rates of crime committed by blacks, which might account for the more frequent than average encounters that black people have with the police; or the number of black people murdered by other black people, which dwarfs the number shot by police; or the number of black lives that have been saved by supposedly racist police tactics.

The point of these books is that even well-meaning white people don’t really grasp how bad the system is and how, through their “unconscious bias,” they are at least in part to blame.

These works reflect the larger “Great Awokening” that has taken hold since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. This phrase is shorthand for the powerful mixture of virtue and guilt that informs many well-educated liberal white Americans.

Zach Goldberg reported in Tablet that surveys show white liberals are now more pessimistic about race relations than African Americans. They are the only demographic group in America to display a “pro-outgroup” bias – meaning that among all the different groups surveyed, white liberals were the only ones who expressed a preference for other racial and ethnic communities above their own.

So do the white women reading these novels enjoy being accused of racism? Joseph Bottum, who edited the Weekly Standard’s book reviews for many years and is the author most recently of “The Decline of the Novel,” says he’s “not sure they are enjoying it.” But it is serving a purpose. He compares these didactic novels to Lutheran hymns, which other Protestants used to joke were “catechism reduced to song.” It’s just a slightly easier way to digest a highhanded lecture.

It’s easy to see why these messages have so easily lent themselves to Young Adult fiction too. Angie Thomas’ “The Hate U Give,” which spent almost an entire year on the New York Times bestseller list, follows Starr Carter, a 16-year-old black girl growing up in a working-class family in the inner city while attending a private mostly white school in the suburbs.

Her friend Khalil is shot in the back by a police officer and Starr is the sole witness. The book follows the Black Lives Matter narrative — that innocent, unarmed black teenage boys are regularly murdered by racist officers and no one is held accountable when they do.

Kyla Schuller, a white professor of women’s gender and sexuality studies at Rutgers University, applauds this trend. She especially credits the work of “black feminist writing online for the last 10 years or so” at websites such as Jezebel and Feminista, whose writers “have made it clear that a discussion of women’s experience that doesn’t interrogate race becomes a part of white supremacy.”

Schuller, who is writing a book called “The Trouble With White Women” about the history of intersectional feminism (which acknowledges “how different forms of discrimination intersect with and amplify gender-based discrimination”), says the “market data suggest that the average woman reader really likes these themes. They’re coming back for more. It suggests that maybe if they’re provoked, it’s in a way that feels useful.” Schuller believes the books that publishers “want from women authors are not about motherhood. Motherhood is over. They want books at intersection of race, gender and sexuality.”

Bottum also believes that these novelists and their readers “have a hunger for a moral purpose” and combating racism “is the only moral purpose our society has on offer.” He compares such novels to the 1930s and ’40s literature of social realism. Authors like John Dos Passos or Upton Sinclair “had to throw in undigested bits of Marxism” in the midst of their stories.

The lectures in these modern novels go well beyond complaints about prejudiced police officers or structural racism to expose the unconscious bias of seemingly well-meaning whites.

In “Such a Fun Age,” Kiley Reid’s widely praised 2019 novel, the protagonist Emira is essentially asked to decide who is more racist – her boyfriend, Kelley, or her employer, Alex (the two used to date in high school). Kelley tells her: “You’re not the first black woman Alex has hired to work for her family, and you probably won’t be the last.”

The fact that Alex wants to befriend Emira, by “accidentally ordering two salads and offering one to Emira, or sending her home with a bag filled with frozen dinners and soups,” seems to be of great importance. “It wasn’t that Emira didn’t understand the racially charged history,” she thinks to herself.

As if having her meals bought weren’t racist enough, it turns out that her boyfriend may be “one of those white guys who not only goes out of his way to date black women but only wants to date black women.” As one of the other characters notes, “People like that think that it says something good about them, that they’re so brave and unique that they would even dare to date black women. Like they’re some kind of martyr.”

This outing of unconscious bias also takes place in reviews of these novels. In her New York Times review of “A Good Neighborhood,” Reid, who is black, criticizes Fowler, who is white, for presenting a cartoon version of prejudice.

She compares Fowler’s unjustly accused protagonist, Xavier, to Uncle Tom – “a nonthreatening fantasy for the book’s white audience” – and writes that “racism is depicted much like death or pregnancy, in that it is an all-or-nothing, binary state of being. The racist characters are brazenly racist: They call biracial children ‘abominations’ and freely use the n-word. The nonracist characters are professional allies; one is actually martyred, in a ludicrous series of events, after storming away from a racist relative.”

Examinations of unconscious bias are also on full display during Race 2 Dinners. As an article in The Guardian described one of the events:

Morgan Richards admits she recently did nothing when someone patronizingly commended her for adopting her two black children, as though she had saved them. ‘What I went through to be a mother, I didn’t care if they were black,’ she says, opening a window for Rao to challenge her: ‘So, you admit it is stooping low to adopt a black child?’ And Richards accepts that the undertone of her statement is racist. As more confessions like this are revealed, Rao and Jackson seem to press those they think can take it, while empathizing with those who can’t. “Well done for recognizing that,” Jackson says, to soothe one woman. “We are all part of the problem. We have to get comfortable with that to become part of the solution.”

Just as part of the problem is white women being too nice to black women who work for them and white men dating black women, so it is also white families adopting black children. And the solution? Well, it seems to be greater racial separation and more acceptance of guilt by white people.

John Wilson, who used to edit the literary magazine Books & Culture, says these novels recall conversations from his college years during the 1960s. “White people would say they’re not racist, but it didn’t matter because others would say that they participated in racist structures. … It made it impossible to carry on a conversation.”

Women are definitely talking about the books. Anna Ford, founder and CEO of Bookclubz (an online organizational tool for 12,000 clubs worldwide), said that racially charged books – including “Such a Fun Age,” “The Hate U Give,” “Nickel Boys” by Colson Whitehead and “The Water Dancer” by Ta-Nehisi Coates – have been among the most popular.

“What we know about all book clubs is that they have this inherent culture of respect,” Ford said. “People come because they want to share their ideas and opinions and want to hear others.” She said these conversations about race may be able to happen more easily because there is a “recognition of other people’s vulnerability.” Book clubs, she notes, “are a safe space.”

But John McWhorter, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University and a frequent commentator on race, said these books seem less intent on sparking discussion than sending a message. “We are constantly told that America remains in some kind of denial about racism, that the lesson never gets through. But this is said so very much, in so many places, and has been for so very long that you start to wonder at what point we might admit that the message has gotten out there.”

McWhorter suggests that “when the woke perspective on race is casually preached even in books like these, it’s one more piece of evidence that people who insist that America is deaf and dumb to the nature of racism are concerned less with public advocacy and social change than in displaying an aggrieved oppositional attitude as a kind of identity, as an end in itself, regardless of reality.”

Shelby Steele, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of “White Guilt: How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era,” suggests this current crop of novels are “what happens when someone writes out of an identity rather than out of their individual selves. They squeeze themselves into really bad ideas — that white males commonly fetishize black women, etc.

“They seem to be satisfying the terms of a Black Lives Matter black identity rather than exploring their experience as individuals. And, as always, their characterizations and story lines arrive at black victimization as eternal truth. They fail to be interesting as writers because actual truth is forbidden.”

Black Lives Matter Opposes Two Huge Forces For Black Success,"It has become, unfortunately, quite undeniable that the Black Lives Matter movement is now a tremendous political force influencing all facets of American life. Although still in its infancy, the movement’s clout is astounding.

No public figure or major corporation can offer mild criticism of the BLM movement without suffering significant backlash. Every day, a growing litany of influential brands pledge unwavering support. The approval also appears to transcend class and race, since approximately two-thirds of American adults endorse the movement, with 38 percent expressing they fervently support it. Truly, the almost universal acceptance of the BLM movement is stunning.

Intuitively, reasonable people oppose indiscriminate killings of black men by the police as well as all forms of racism. So, naturally, a movement purporting to protect black Americans from a combination of institutional violence and oppression has a certain level of “built-in” appeal.

An important distinction must be made, however, between the broader BLM movement and the BLM organization, for the BLM organization’s philosophical roots go far deeper than opposition to extrajudicial killings. The deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown only provided the springboard to launch a more radical agenda aimed at fundamentally transforming American society.

Despite the potency of their voices, there is insufficient evidence to bolster activists’ claim that systemic racism permeates law enforcement. On the contrary, data show that racial disparities in incarceration are attributed to differential involvement in crime. As a result, black Americans are imprisoned because they are the primary perpetrators of violent crimes. Because of the lack of substantive evidence to support the ide that America is dripping with the poison of systemic racism, activists use singular anecdotes of police brutality as a pretext for a larger philosophical campaign.

Never Forget the BLM Organization Is Run By Marxists

Since the BLM organization’s leaders admit they are trained Marxists, they must be understood within the wider patina of Marxist diatribes against the nuclear family, capitalism, and by extension the idea of progress. The official webpage of the BLM organization spells it out quite clearly:

We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.

Those unfamiliar with Marxism may be puzzled at this seemingly random opposition to the nuclear family. Deeper introspection, however, reveals that the BLM organization’s outlook is quite consistent with Marxism.

Marxists view the living arrangement of the “extended family” as more conducive to fostering collectivism, since it requires conformity to successfully facilitate production. On the other hand, the traditional, two-parent nuclear family is depicted as an insidious invention of capitalism, responsible for displacing the communalism of the extended family.

Yet, contrary to BLM’s insitence, the “extended family” cannot substitute for the traditional family. Writing in The Atlantic, leading scholars W. Bradford Wilcox and Hal Boyd make a compelling case for the superiority of the nuclear family over alternatives: “Americans should not presume that society can successfully replace families headed by married parents with models oriented more around kith and kin.” Similarly, Sara McLanahan of Princeton University and Gary Sandefur of the University of Wisconsin found the average child raised by a “mother and grandmother is doing about the same as the average child raised by a single mother.”

In the absence of both parents, children raised by their extended kin, such as an aunt or uncle, are significantly more likely to have, in the words of one study, “higher levels of internalizing problems” including loneliness and sadness when compared to those raised by married parents. Another established finding in sociological research is that fathers play a pivotal role in children’s development.

Yet as a product of identity politics, supporters of BLM believe that Western society, especially America, is inherently sexist, racist, corrupt, and undergirded by nefarious men interested in exerting authority over other groups. Because of this framework, any family type BLM supports must be intrinsically hostile to men, since apparently, they are the cause of all oppression.

BLM Activists Have an Anti-Capitalist Agenda

According to the flawed ideology of the wider BLM movement, American institutions that operate under capitalism are wired to naturally and systematically oppress blacks. Furthermore, BLM claims women experience a greater burden due to their race and sex. But like most assertions from BLM, it is patently untrue.

For example, one reports notes, “black women outperform their white counterparts in terms of individual earnings.” Additional research suggests black men are also succeeding in America, with 57 percent of them occupying middle-class status or higher, up from 38 percent in 1960.

By most accounts, black Americans are thriving in a capitalist system. Nevertheless, BLM activists remain unconvinced. Anti-capitalist sentiments are stated quite lucidly on the website of another group called the “Movement for Black Lives.” They proclaim, “We believe and understand that Black people will never achieve liberation under the current global racialized capitalist system.”

This assumption lacks factual data. In his influential 1964 work, The Economics of the Colour Bar, William Hutt describes the positive effects of capitalism on black people in Africa:

It is difficult to imagine a better illustration than is provided by South Africa of the truth that the fight against color injustice is actually against the consequences of planning on the collectivist model. Every repression of the Africans has, at the same time, been the repression of the free market. … It is profit incentives which have tended powerfully to raise the material standard of Africans … to raise their status and prestige in a multi-racial society, and ultimately to win for them equality of respect and consideration.

More recent findings have corroborated Hutt’s argument. Economist Marian Tupy writes, “Increasing wealth has led to improvements in key indicators of human wellbeing. In 1999, 58 percent of Africans lived on less than $1.90 per person per day. By 2011, 44 percent of Africans lived on that income.” It is free markets — not central planning, or any variant of Marxist economics — that explain the prosperity of black people across the globe.

Despite the broader BLM movement being wrong on several fronts, some reforms do merit consideration. Zoning regulations, for example, have a disparate impact on poorer people and black Americans. Richard D Kahlenberg explains the racist roots of zoning:

Single-family zoning policies have always had a disturbing origin. In 1917, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down policies that explicitly zoned separate residential areas for blacks and whites, many local governments shifted to a new form of exclusionary zoning: policies that made it illegal to build anything other than single-family homes. These policies delivered many of the same results, by a different means—they kept out most black people, and virtually all low-income people.

Quite tellingly, however, the vast majority of BLM activists have remained silent on the issue. This should not be surprising. The BLM organization, in particular, is a revolutionary group not genuinely concerned with reform. So utopian BLM activists instead propose a society without any imperfections.

Of the many problems with this philosophy is that advocates of utopianism almost always end up resorting to deadly force to achieve their ends. Since the desires of the more radical BLM activists are insatiable, such an insurrectionary movement will always demand more extreme policies than those just passed.

Regardless of their politics, Americans must resist the most strident voices of BLM by not allowing the cult of political correctness to silence their voices. The brutality of communist regimes and the French Revolution evidence what is possible when defenders of civility and freedom remain silent. To preserve the republic, Americans must challenge the dangerous aspects of the BLM movement, lest they follow the same fate.

"If You Really Believe Black Lives Matter, Stop Supporting BLM","When people and organizations throw money at identity politics, do they know that the causes they support conflict with their purported goals?

Black Lives Matter (BLM) cloaks itself in garb of justice and morality. By its very name, well-intentioned people are compelled to support it. After all, who does not think the lives of black people matter? Uninformed yet impassioned Americans are unaware that the organization’s name is a rhetorical facade that masks a Marxist core.

The truth is that the three people who founded BLM include two avowed Marxist organizers and an activist sympathizer. Beyond supporting more “mainstream” leftist positions, such as socialized health care and dramatically increased taxes, BLM’s platform has historically called for more radical policies. These include creating collective ownership in black communities, instituting reparations including for illegal aliens, defunding the police, and “disrupt[ing] the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.”

The Evil Underpinnings of BLM

BLM, like the Women’s March, has from its start been ardently antisemitic. Members of BLM carried out a pogrom in the Los Angeles area in May during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. You probably never heard about it because in the intersectional left-wing milieu, Ashkenazi Jews sit at or near the apex of the privilege pyramid.

That is, the descendants of Eastern European Jews, 6 million of whom were massacred during the Holocaust, are considered by BLM and its ideological cohorts to be the world’s greatest victimizers. For the like-minded media, covering such atrocities would only undermine the narrative and hurt the cause, so they remain silent. For BLM, antisemitism is not a cancellable offense.

As we have seen across America these past weeks, like other left-wing, antisemitic movements, BLM justifies violence and resorts to it. Marxists using race as a cover for revolution ought to be condemned for cynically exploiting the deaths of Americans. They are not condemned, however, as too many people consider it politically unacceptable to do so. Meanwhile, the “antiracist” ideology, rooted in a concept of “white fragility,” further dupes the ignorant but impassioned.

BLM poses a cleverly designed dichotomy and demands people choose a side. It defines the world as bifurcated between racists and antiracists, and commands that you must stand with the latter and attack the former. But the antiracists are themselves racists. People like Robin DiAngelo cast whites as evil on the basis of their skin color, and call for them to spend their lives atoning for their inherent sins as determined by their pigmentation.

This is to say nothing of the fact that their proposed “remedies” for societal racism — namely compensating for past discrimination with present retributive discrimination — would destroy any notion of true liberty, equality, or justice. This is intentional, as their objective is to heighten racial strife. It has devolved almost to the point of parody: White women are paying nonwhite women to browbeat them over dinner about their alleged transgressions.

People of good faith who reflexively support Black Lives Matter and “antiracism” should know they are affirming movements collectively rooted in and devoted to Marxism, Jew hatred, violence, racism, social discord, and the undermining of our founding values and principles.

Fake Corporate Courage and Virtue

To what can we attribute the fact that businesses that have historically run from radical movements are now falling over themselves to subsidize BLM? Beyond the true-believing, often white, woke elites who head many of these firms, fear drives corporations to lavish money on BLM for “protection.” Corporate contributions to leftist movements more broadly, and the BLM and “white fragility” racket in particular, seem to be part of a social justice shakedown. It has proved effective on a smaller scale before.

That corporations would pay for such protection is both cowardly and shortsighted. In the short run, these concerns are merely funding continued violence and antisocial behavior by those who wish harm to our broader society. In the long run, they will find themselves no more secure, as the radical left wishes to destroy the economic and political system from which corporate America has so richly benefited. Feeding the communist crocodile in hopes it will spare you in the end is a losing bet.

Moreover, contrary to popular perception, throwing money at left-wing agitators, posting black boxes on social media, or literally prostrating oneself in the public square requires no courage and demonstrates no virtue. It does nothing to ameliorate the problems ailing blacks in American inner cities, let alone people of all colors across the country.

If the underwriters of wokedom actually want to improve America, what should they do instead?

How to Do the Most Good

Consider first what not to do. The leaders of major urban areas across the country have failed their black constituents for decades by imposing less radical versions of the same policies BLM wishes to institute, which will only perpetuate poverty and misery.

More socialism will weaken personal initiative, thwart entrepreneurship, and stunt opportunity. Fewer police cannot possibly protect all innocent Americans, who are already being stripped of their Second Amendment rights. Ideologically driven public education will continue leaving kids confused and underserved. And expanded statist policies will further erode the family.

The reality is that if the left is trying to make a case for systemic racism, little could better describe it than the policies that have prevailed under Democratic rule in America’s inner cities for nearly 60 years, self-evidently contributing to their destruction. The only beneficiaries of such policies are the purported representatives of such districts, who foster increasing dependence on the state they control, therefore accruing ever-greater power. This is what supporters of the woke are funding.

Breaking the leftist stranglehold on America’s cities would be a worthwhile societal project. Nothing could be further from what has transpired.

Since most everything begins with education, I propose one simple task for those who truly wish to support their fellow man. In honor of Thomas Sowell, who just celebrated his 90th birthday, let us devise a plan to get “Charter Schools and Their Enemies” into the hands of every American.

This should be wed to a national campaign for excellence in education — real education, not social justice indoctrination — through school choice. Arguably no single public policy could more effectively reverse leftist ruin and empower the country’s most vulnerable, too many of whom are watching the academy compromise their potentiality.

Finally, those acting as woke white saviors ought to drop this corrosive superiority complex. Such a mentality reflects a soft bigotry of low expectations that is infantilizing, dehumanizing, and ultimately destructive to the human spirit of those who are ostensibly being helped. We should all strive to treat each other as equals and to judge others on their merits.

This ideal is the heart and soul of our country, which is why the woke are explicitly targeting it. Americans of good faith must stop aiding, abetting, and enabling them.

Marcellus Wiley: Painting 'Black Lives Matter' On NBA Courts Is A Bad Idea,"When the 2019-2020 National Basketball Associate (NBA) season resumes next month, all three arenas at the Walt Disney World Resort will have the words “Black Lives Matter” painted on the sidelines. The decision, made by the NBA and National Basketball Players Association, is also being considered by the WNBA when their season resumes at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.

But not everyone thinks it’s a good idea. On the FOX Sports 1 show, “Speak for Yourself,” former NFL all-pro defensive end Marcellus Wiley, said identity politics is a slippery slope.

“There’s a problem with when you start to go down this road of the freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and how much social space is allowed for those who don’t support in that same space, and that’s where I wonder where this is going to go in terms of identity politics. We know what identity politics does: it divides and it polarizes,” he said.



.@MarcellusWiley breaks down why the NBA’s plan to paint ‘Black Lives Matter’ on courts is a bad idea. pic.twitter.com/EoCJNf7ho1 — Speak For Yourself (@SFY) June 30, 2020

Wiley also pointed to concerns over Black Lives Matter’s mission statement, which states its goal to “dismantle the patriarchy” and “disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.” Wiley claims people have not taken time to read or understand BLM saying, “I don’t know how many people really look into the mission statement of Black Lives Matter, but I did, and when you look at it, there’s a couple things that jump out to me.”

Two things. My family structure is vital (sic) important to me. Not only the one I grew up in, but the one I’m trying to create right now. Being a father and a husband- that’s my mission in life right now. How do I reconcile that with what I just told you with this mission statement that says ‘we dismantle the patriarchal practice we disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement’?

Wiley went on to explain why BLM is detrimental to Black families and personal success. He said that growing up, he observed friends who didn’t have intact family structures and they “found themselves outside of their dreams and goals and aspirations.” Wiley cited data backing up his observations about children raised in a single-parent home: “[They] are 5 times more likely to commit suicide, 6 times more likely to be in poverty, 9 times more likely to drop out of high school, 10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances, 14 times more likely to commit rape, 20 times more likely to end up in prison, 32 times more likely to run away from home.”

Wiley also questioned BLM’s priorities. “It makes me scratch my head,” he said. “I see their mission is to eradicate white supremacy. In 2020 white supremacy is the mission?” Wiley asked in disbelief.

Wiley used his personal success as a black man in America as a testimony against the notion that white supremacy was a pressing issue in America today, “I am on a show. I’m hosting along with another black guy, who is hosting with me, who replaced a black guy, and that’s just one example of it.”

Seemingly anticipating the backlash he will receive for challenging BLM, Wiley noted, “I’m a black man who’s been black and my life has mattered since 1974 and this organization was founded in 2013, and I’m proud of you but I been fighting this fight for me and for others a lot longer.”

Wiley did show admiration for the efforts made by the players and BLM to advance racial justice. “I do want to give the players credit for their flex to even get this to be more than just an idea but something that’s going to be in reality,” he said.

He then challenged BLM to offer him the respect he offers their opposing perspective. “So, I understand I respect your space, I respect what you’re protesting for, but will you respect others who don’t support the same protest?”

We Can't Have 'National Dialogues' If People Get Fired For Talking,"“While we write and print millions of words about race in America, why is it still so hard to have a truly respectful, decent, and humble dialogue about perhaps the most complicated and contentious issue in American life?” asks David French in his Dispatch article “American Racism: We’ve Got So Very Far to Go.” Yet he does not mention in his story of personal change the elephant in the room: the Black Lives Matter movement’s radical cultural hegemony.

Establishment Republicans made the same mistake by ignoring the movement’s radical premise: that at its core, America is rotten and systemically racist, and thus woke Americans must rebuild and reimagine the country from the ground up.

Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney marched with the Black Lives Matter movement, and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley tweeted, “It’s important to understand that the death of George Floyd was personal and painful for many. In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.”

Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell admirably tweeted, “Our republic can survive a pandemic. It can survive civil unrest. But ideas and deliberation are our foundation. America cannot be America if civil disagreement becomes a contradiction in terms. Anti-speech silencing tactics are a cancer in a free and open society.” But aside from McConnell and Sen. Josh Hawley, few Republican leaders denounced BLM’s central claim.

Maybe many Americans are willing to have a productive conversation about race. Maybe they want to respectfully question the merits of workplace diversity training programs, for example. But the risk in participating far outweighs any reward.

Bow or Be Canceled

A Vermont school principal was placed on administrative leave for writing on Facebook, “I firmly believe that Black Lives Matter, but I DO NOT agree with the coercive measures taken to get to this point across; some of which are falsified in an attempt to prove a point.” Tim Gordon, a Catholic high school theology teacher, was fired for comparing Black Lives Matter to a terrorist organization. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology Catholic chaplain was forced to resign after sending an email in which he said Floyd had “not lived a virtuous life.”

Paul Krugman and a number of prominent academics called for the firing of University of Chicago professor of economics Harald Uhlig. On Twitter, Uhlig criticized Black Lives Matter, saying, “Too bad, but #blacklivesmatter per its core organization @Blklivesmatter just torpedoed itself, with is full-fledge support of #defundthepolice.” Krugman fired back, “Yet another privileged white man who evidently can’t control his urge to belittle the concerns of those less fortunate.”

No one outside conservative media can criticize Black Lives Matter without being fired or ostracized, so how can we expect the average American to chime in for a productive dialogue?

Furthermore, American corporations reinforce BLM’s cultural sway, driving conversation in one direction. The biggest corporations have donated millions to Black Lives Matter and related organizations. Diversity consulting has become fashionable.

Nike released a solemn advertisement morally blackmailing citizens who do not stand up for, or kneel to, Black Lives Matter. MTV changed its logo for LGBT Pride Month and Black Lives Matter. Even the children’s network Nickelodeon interrupted broadcasting to air a social justice message. Indoctrination doesn’t begin on college campuses with activist professors; it begins with “SpongeBob Squarepants” reruns.

Hollywood celebrities also play their part. Like corporations, celebrities donate millions of dollars and share videos of infamous antisemite Louis Farrakhan with their countless social media followers. Black filmmaker and producer Ava DuVernay, who directed “Selma,” warned white men in Hollywood that questioning social justice dogma could result in unemployment. “Kindly remember,” she wrote, “bias can go both ways.”

Polite Conversation Is Impossible

It’s baffling that any Republican leaders or conservative voices could think it is time to have a chat with Democrats about race relations. That discussion would never include conservatives or anyone else who dissents. Black Lives Matter is not interested in making fact-based arguments. Its activists win arguments through social coercion.

Meanwhile, the most important institutions driving American culture already picked a side. Their leaders kowtowed to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Maybe conservatives should be asking ourselves: How do we defeat identity politics and multiculturalism with the legal and political mechanisms at our disposal, and how do we erect our own cultural institutions to push back against corporate America and Hollywood’s influence?

Contra French, polite conversation cannot exist while powerful cultural forces erode the bedrock upon which this country was founded: the Constitution and the rights enshrined therein. When we form a strategy to defeat these forces and succeed, then we can talk about race relations without capitulating to radicals. Otherwise, no humble, decent, and respectful conversation about any contentious political issue will ever occur again in this country.

Citizens are targeted for their political views. Our American founding has been slandered. The last thing we should do is turn the other cheek.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/03/we-cant-have-national-dialogues-if-people-get-fired-for-talking-honestly/,2020-07-03
Grieving Families Of Killed Children Call On ‘Black Lives Matter’ To Address Community Violence,"As the Fourth of July weekend saw at least five children shot and killed, many of their grieving families have pleaded with the Black Lives Matter movement to address violence within communities, not just deaths at the hands of police.

Eleven-year-old Davon McNeal was shot and killed in Washington, D.C. on the Fourth of July. His grandfather is calling for protesters to acknowledge violence that has nothing to do with police.

“We’re protesting for months, for weeks, saying black lives matter,” said John Ayala, who identified himself as McNeal’s paternal grandfather. “Black lives matter, it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a black person. What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

John Ayala, tells @fox5dc he’s 11-year-old Davon McNeal’s paternal grandfather. Ayala says his grandson dreamed of being in the NFL & that everyone’s just tired of shootings in the community. He also mentions the Black Lives Matter protests in part of his interview. @fox5dc pic.twitter.com/ajrX7q5YkO — Stephanie Ramirez (@RamirezReports) July 5, 2020

According to his family, McNeal had stopped to pick up a phone charger before heading to a cookout when he was shot at by a group of five males. It’s not known whether the suspects have been identified.

Secoriea Turner, an 8-year-old girl from Atlanta, was also killed Saturday. She was shot across the street from the Wendy’s restaurant where a police officer shot Rayshard Brooks last month. Turner was in the car with her mother and a friend when they pulled into a parking lot and were met by a “group of armed individuals” at the entrance. Police reported that a crowd had set up barricades in the area after police had previously taken them down, and that someone from the group shot Turner’s car multiple times after the driver tried to get around the roadblocks.

Turner’s parents spoke out against the violent demonstrators after her death. “They say black lives matter,” said her father, Secoriya Williamson. “You killed your own this time.”

“We understand the frustration of Rayshard Brooks,” added Turner’s mother, Charmaine Turner. “We didn’t have anything to do with that. We’re innocent.”

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also criticized those anti-police protests which had turned deadly.

“These aren’t police officers shooting people on the streets of Atlanta, these are members of the community shooting each other,” Bottoms said. “We’re fighting the enemy within when we are shooting each other up on the streets.”

“You shot and killed a baby,” she continued. “If you want people to take us seriously, and you don’t want us to lose this movement, then we can’t lose each other.”

Bottoms has also been suggested as a potential vice presidential candidate for Joe Biden.

Natalia Wallace, age seven, was shot and killed while playing with other children in the yard in Chicago over the holiday weekend. Three suspects got out of a car and opened fire at the group, striking Wallace in the head.

Her father, Nathan Wallace, told local news media that he wants more police, not less, in Chicago. “Kids outside playing, they shouldn’t have to worry about guns and people shooting,” he added.

Natalie Wallace, Natalia’s aunt, also pointed out the disconnect between the Black Lives Matter movement and the realities of community violence. “We talk about Black Lives Matter,” she said, “but at the end of the day, we’re killing each other off. We’re killing our babies.”

Eight-year-old Royta De’Marco Giles was shot and killed in a Hoover, Alabama mall, when several men got into a fight and started shooting at each other. Giles was “caught in the crossfire,” according to a Hoover Police Department news release.

A six-year-old boy in San Francisco was shot and killed while watching fireworks. He has yet to be formally identified, but family says his name is Jace Young.

In a press briefing on Monday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out the media for failing to address the weekend’s shootings. “I’m a little dismayed that I didn’t receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend,” McEnany said at the end of the briefing, after reporters asked about the Confederate flag and the Coronavirus pandemic. “I didn’t receive one question about five children who were killed.”

Watch CNN’s Don Lemon Whitewash ‘Black Lives Matter’,"Actor Terry Crews sparked controversy this week with a tweet that appeared to be critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, in which Crews has the gall to suggest that white people and black people actually need to work together to defeat racism. Reaction to Crews was swift, accusing him of hurting the cause.

Defeating White supremacy without White people creates Black supremacy. Equality is the truth. Like it or not, we are all in this together. — terry crews (@terrycrews) June 7, 2020

Monday night Crews appeared on CNN anchor Don Lemon’s primetime show to defend his perfectly reasonable sentiment. The conversation turned to what Black Lives Matter stands for and that is where Lemon reverted to absolute gaslighting regarding the movement’s Marxist ideologies and goals.

Don Lemon says black lives don’t matter unless they’re being taken by cops and that you should start your own movement if you want to make black-on-black violence an issue. pic.twitter.com/NVHRc9rpO9 — Ian Miles Cheong @ stillgray.substack.com (@stillgray) July 7, 2020

After a condescending statement to Crews that he should grow thicker skin, Lemon proceeded to explain that Black Lives Matters originated around the issue of police brutality, not broader issues, and that is all the movement is about. He likens it to an anti-cancer charity being criticized for not battling HIV. But this is nonsense and Crews knows it, and he begins to point out why.

In the critical exchange Crews says, “But when you look at the organization, police brutality is not all they are talking about.” Here Lemon jumps in with “I know that but that’s not what the Black Lives Matter movement is about.” At this point Lemon simply talks over Crews, not allowing him to make his factual point regarded the stated aims of Black Lives Matter.

Lemon’s own statement makes no sense on its face. He says he knows that police brutality is not all that Black Lives Matter is about, but that still police brutality is all that Black Lives Matter is about.

All of this stems from a confusion that I laid out in these pages last month surrounding the dueling definitions of the term Black Lives Matter. Lemon is talking about the general statement of support for black lives and an effort to improve the criminal justice system. Crews is talking about a Marxist organization that, among other things, wants to destroy the primacy of the nuclear family.

The good news is that a discussion of the chasm between these meanings is happening now. It’s even almost happening on CNN. More and more Americans are seeing the disconnect between the laudable but vague meaning of Black Lives Matter and the Marxist meaning. In the black community, the latter Black Lives Matter movement is being called out by some now, including grieving parents, for its willful blindness over the deaths of black Americans as a result of crime.

This is a message that has to be hammered home. When confronted with the motto Black Lives Matter, or when it is painted with government approval on our streets, we must ask which version is being represented? So far this approach is working, more and more we hear the competing definitions discussed and dissected.

When companies adopt the slogan they must be pressed on whether this is general support for civil rights, or a call to fundamentally transform almost every aspect of American life. As long as they are not forced to make this choice they will continue, as Don Lemon did Monday night, to give cover to an organization as anti-American as any in recent history.

"Black Lives Matter Was Violent From The Start, And Media Knew It","The Black Lives Matter protests are radical, they are violent, and they have claimed innocent lives all over the country. This isn’t a surprise: We’ve watched this movement played out before by many of the exact same leaders and even under the exact same name. Now, through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gaslighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t new at all. It’s the same loose collection of good-thinking people concerned over police violence and violent, anti-police and anti-family radicals as it was when it first gained national prominence in 2014.

As a refresher, the group was founded in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s second term and after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It wasn’t until a rash of viral police-related deaths the next year that its national profile began to rise, including protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and then the following year Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It was cheered on at the time by the media for all the same reasons it’s being cheered on today: Some of the viral videos and events convincingly depicted unjustified killings of black suspects by police, and despite the clear and radical politics of the founders, their name conveys an obvious truism. Unfortunately, it quickly showed its violent and intolerant side then, just as it has today.

Americans likely most clearly recall Ferguson’s protests, where for days black-owned businesses were torched and looted. Over the next few years, we watched in horror as Baltimore’s years-long revival was stopped in its tracks, block after block burned, and families attending an afternoon baseball game were set upon by screaming mobs.

As editor in chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation then, I oversaw our broader Baltimore 2015 riot coverage. As two in the morning approached on April 28, I turned off the police scanner, confident our guys were OK and looking forward to a few hours’ sleep before an early workday. Minutes later, our man running the coverage on the ground texted, “We are alright,” which indicated to me that they were not alright at all. Indeed, my friend was in the emergency room with two of our young reporters, who had been beaten and robbed by the rioters.

“When I saw the guy heading our way with a hammer in his hand and a bandanna covering his face, I knew he meant business,” a New York Daily News reporter who ran to their aid and then drove our guys through the mob to safety wrote later that morning. By the time they escaped, Caller reporter Casey Harper was struggling to stay conscious with a severe concussion, broken eye socket, and stolen phone, while his colleague Connor Wolf got off with a broken nose (and managed to hold onto his blood-stained notebook throughout). The two had been targeted for being white. No one slept until after we were back in the newsroom and their story was filed.

The violence and disruption they’d been subject to were tolerated and papered over by Democrats and corporate media, who made excuses for attacks on civilians, police, and media, and blamed outside agitators even while they were shouted down and disrupted by activists demanding “a conversation” but committed to ensuring no one speaks but them.

The following year, 2016, national Black Lives Matter protests broke out against the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dozens of officers were injured with projectiles and threatened by protesters. Then on July 7, just before 9 p.m. CT, a man opened fire on police preparing for one of the protests in Dallas, killing three policemen, wounding three others, and wounding one civilian.

During his retreat, he killed another officer, shooting him in the back after sneaking around a pillar he was taking cover behind during a gunfight. Seeking to fortify an El Centro College building, he opened fire on two campus cops, hitting one in the gut and injuring the other with shattered glass.

Police followed the man’s trail of blood through the school, engaging when they could clearly make him out in the darkness. From a window near where he made his last stand, he was able to kill another police officer who was on the street below. After negotiations broke down, the department killed him with a remote bomb.

Before he was killed, the gunman told a negotiator he was motivated by anger on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. His Facebook page called for people to “KILL EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN.” By the morning of July 8, the murdered men included Officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, former Army Ranger Michael Smith, former U.S. Navy sailor Patrick Zamarripa, and former Marine Brent Thompson.

“Protests are messy,” a Vox writer wrote dismissively a week later. “When thousands or millions of people rise up in very passionate demonstrations, some bad, violent people are going to get caught up in the cause.”

But the pressure was intense, and reluctant cracks began to form in the ranks. “Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,” a New York Times headline lamented, “Then a Sniper Opened Fire.”

Things quieted down. Donald Trump won the presidency, and shell-shocked journalists and Democrats went on a short-lived soul-searching mission, wondering what went wrong and how they could have misread the American public so badly. “Maybe we pushed too far,” President Obama privately reflected. “What if we were wrong?”

The introspection did not last, and by the end of the year — a year five police officers were killed and dozens wounded and hospitalized by Black Lives Matter radicals — BuzzFeed fondly looked back on 2016 as “the year Black Lives Matter went global.”

Just a few short weeks into the summer of 2020, it’s happening again: Seven shot in a Louisville protest park; one week later a protester killed; two dead in Chicago; four shootings in Seattle’s “autonomous zone;” a 77-year-old, black, retired St. Louis Police captain murdered; a 22-year-old, black woman in Davenport shot as she tried to leave.

Once again, politicians and media are defending and gaslighting for the violence. “I want to be clear how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Veshi said while buildings visibly burned in the night sky behind him. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”

“But fires,” he admitted, back-lit by flames, “have been started.”

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., rioters threw frozen bottles, glass, rocks, and bricks at police, then lit a church on fire. Afterward, corporate reporters, Democratic politicians, and even the leader of that church called the protests peaceful and attacked police tactics. The mayor allowed protesters to maintain that space, rename it Black Lives Plaza, and paint “Black Lives Matter” on the street.

“White women are lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen’s,'” Washington Post editor Karen Attiah wrote June 29, “And not calling for revenge.” She listed her reasons for revenge on white women as the deadly racist massacre in Tulsa 99 years ago, the lynching of Emmet Till 70 years ago, liberal feminists making her feel excluded, and white women voting for Donald Trump.

Eight days later, she complained that “The ideas of the elite class is to be protected [sic] and supported at all costs,” but “black people… poor people… [and] uneducated people? We’re supposed to accept our marginalization.” She graduated from Northwestern University, won a Fulbright Scholarship, got a master’s at Columbia University, is now the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, and still has not been fired.

But the charade cannot stand. This past weekend, an eight-year-old black child was shot and killed besides her frightened mother as the driver tried to navigate around illegal barriers Black Lives Matter protesters were guarding near the Atlanta Wendy’s where a black man was killed after scuffling with police and stealing and firing one officer’s Taser. The little girl’s name was Secoriea Turner.

“They say ‘black lives matter,'” her father, hoarse with pain, accused the movement just hours later. “You killed your own. You killed your own this time.”

“You killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody.”

“My baby,” her mother sobbed as family comforted her and helped her walk from the stage.

“At the point that an eight-year-old baby is killed, the discussions have ended,” the mayor announced. Just hours later, another person was killed and two more wounded nearby.

But some aren’t getting the message. “If you want an all-black lives matter movement started … then start that movement,” CNN’s Don Lemon told black actor Terry Crews Monday. “But that’s not what Black Lives Matter is about.”

Lemon was wrong on most things during that segment, but on that one point, he was right. Let’s see how long it takes us to remember.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/08/black-lives-matter-was-violent-from-the-start-and-media-and-politicians-knew-it/,2020-07-08
De Blasio’s ‘Black Lives Matter’ Mural Illustrates His Incompetency,"One of the remarkable things about Bill de Blasio, the worst mayor in the history of cities, is that every time you think he has done the stupidest thing possible he finds a way to outdo himself.

His absurd run for president wasn’t enough, his slashing of police budgets during a surge in shootings wasn’t enough, either. Now, he is painting Black Lives Matter in huge letters on Fifth Avenue in what is nothing short of a huge insult to the diverse men and women of the New York Police Department.

Over the past few weeks, it has been noted by many commenters that Black Lives Matter means different things in different contexts. Presumably the street mural de Blasio has commissioned a few blocks from Trump Tower is meant as the general sentiment of support for black lives that all people share. But the problem is that Black Lives Matter is also a Marxist organization that basically seeks the overthrow of America.

According to a Monmouth Poll 70 percent of Americans say that Black Lives Matters has not improved race relations. Thirty-eight percent say the movement has made things worse. Again, it is unclear whether respondents are referring to the general movement or the specific organization, but what is clear is that there is nowhere near any consensus on whether either are very much good for society.

There is also the matter of the political implications of the message Hizzoner is having painted. It is laughable to suggest that Black Lives Matter is a bipartisan movement, even if Sen. Mitt Romney dons a mask and marches with them. And with the placement of the mural so blatantly close to Trump’s New York residence and offices this might as well be a giant, Vote Democrat sign paid for by the taxpayers.

And what have de Blasio and those Democrats given the city? It was the epicenter of death from coronavirus, its small businesses are still reeling, many still shuttered, food lines stretch for blocks, contact tracing is a ridiculous joke, shootings are occurring at a rate not seen in 25 years, police are retiring at record numbers, and who can blame them? And de Blasio’s response to all of this is to paint a mural that says Black Lives Matter on 5th Avenue? It’s an infuriating joke.

This is nothing short of city funds going to prop up political propaganda and its wrong. While not reflective of the entire movement or organization, because nothing actually is, the haranguing and epithets thrown at police along with bottles and Molotov cocktails at Black Lives Matter rallies are very real. This is just the latest in a long list of creative ways that Bill de Blasio has found to spit in the eye of the NYPD.

New Yorkers, the ones who don’t flee in the next several months because the city no longer has functioning schools or a supported police force, or, you know, indoor dining, need to start making some choices. Our city government is wildly out of step with will of the people.

In the next mayoral election, and in all local elections New Yorkers must look to restore sanity. We need real leadership, not quasi-Marxist slogans painted on streets. If we don’t get it, the “bad old days” are lurking around the corner. And those of us old enough to remember them know how much tragedy and sadness that would bring.

How Selective Reporting Hides The Truth About Race And Crime,"On Saturday, a man drove his car onto a Seattle freeway that had been closed by a Black Lives Matter crowd. The driver killed one person and seriously injured another after going the wrong way up a ramp and then around a barricade. Reports noted that police “don’t believe impairment was a factor.” Over the weekend, news outlets replayed the brutal hit, but there’s one thing you won’t learn from their coverage: The driver was black and his victims were white.

NPR linked this attack to other car-ramming incidents by “right-wing extremists targeting Black Lives Matter protesters.” They quote a researcher about how these right-wingers were “trying to intimidate the most recent wave of BLM protesters, to stop their movement.”

The driver was a Seattle local named Dawit Kelete. But you’ll find scant mention of the driver’s ethnicity in mainstream media coverage. You might have more easily learned that Kelete was black by going to the Australia Broadcasting Corporation. The American national media also doesn’t note that Kelete’s two victims were white. You can find that out over at the U.K.’s Daily Mail.

Among the few U.S. outlets to mention the race of the driver is Heavy.com. The rest of the news media seemingly would rather have people assume that a white driver attacked two black protesters. Acknowledging the driver’s and victims’ ethnicity wouldn’t advance their narrative of oppression, so it apparently isn’t newsworthy.

One case doesn’t prove a pattern. It could just be that while the American media knows almost everything about this killer, including his name, age, and where he lives, they couldn’t find information on his race. Possibly the foreign news outlets were just lucky to discover that information.

Of course, the media outlets might honestly not view race as essential to the story. But their selective reporting of it shows that they think race is important when it involves certain situations. The problem is that this gives readers a biased perspective, inflaming prejudice, and creating stereotypes.

Research conducted by the Crime Prevention Research Center, of which I am president, on all police shootings from 2013 to 2015 found that while local news coverage will often mention the race of the officer and the suspect, the national coverage is much more selective. While the evidence indicates that black officers are no less likely to shoot suspects than white officers, local news coverage of black officers shooting black suspects gets picked up by the national news in just 9 percent of cases. By contrast, 38 percent of the cases in which local news reported on a white officer shooting a black suspect get national coverage.

The selective coverage creates the belief that white officers are the problem — they are the ones shooting blacks, presumably because white officers treat black suspects differently than white ones. Watching the news, you would never guess that the research found that black officers were just as likely as white officers to shoot an unarmed black suspect.

The media’s selective coverage has done real harm. It has heightened racial divides and sown distrust of the police in the communities that need them most. Now, with police sidelined and facing “defunding,” gun violence is rising fast in major cities around the country.

The media similarly seems intent on claiming that mass public shooters are disproportionately white and right-wing when nothing could be further from the truth. While 58 percent of the mass public shooters from 1998 to 2019 were white (excluding people of Middle Eastern descent), about 75 percent of the total U.S. population was white. Middle Eastern Arabs made up just 1 percent of the population but accounted for 8 percent of shooters. Of all the mass killers, 72 percent have no known political affiliation or views — only 3 percent are known to be conservative or Republican.

Race and politics increasingly divide Americans, and selective media reporting is largely to blame. The media, not Trump, is fanning the flames of violence. The destruction and the long-term harm that is being done to heavily minority parts of our cities is their responsibility.

WNBA Players Call For Sen. Kelly Loeffler To Step Down As Team Owner Over ‘Black Lives Matter’ Remarks,"Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) faces calls to step down as co-owner of the Atlanta Dream WNBA franchise after speaking out against the league’s support for the self-proclaimed Marxist organization “Black Lives Matter.”



The Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) announced it will be dedicating its upcoming season to promoting BLM and joining the National Basketball Association in painting the words “Black Lives Matter” on the court sidelines. The league also plans to print the words “Black Lives Matter” and “Say Her Name” on WNBA players’ warm-up uniforms.

Loeffler, who owns 49 percent of the Atlanta Dream, wrote to the league earlier this week, upset that the WNBA is subscribing to a “particular political agenda” which “undermines the potential of the sport and sends a message of exclusion.”

“The truth is, we need less — not more politics in sports.” said Loeffler. “I adamantly oppose the Black Lives Matter political movement, which has advocated for the defunding of police, called for the removal of Jesus from churches and the disruption of the nuclear family structure, harbored anti-Semitic views, and promoted violence and destruction across the country.”

Loeffler suggested that the players display an American flag on their uniforms instead of a politically divisive message.

Whereas most sports franchise owners have rushed to embrace the BLM movement, Loeffler is one of the few people in the sports world who is opposed to the politicization of professional sports.

Following Loeffler’s statement, the league has disavowed her. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told ABC News, “Kelly’s views are not consistent with those of the WNBA and its players.”

The players’ union called for Loeffler to relinquish her ownership. “E-N-O-U-G-H! O-U-T!” the Women’s National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) tweeted.



WNBPA executive director Terri Jackson said the union plans to meet with Engelbert to discuss the next steps and address Loeffler’s role in the league. “This is not about a disagreement,” Jackson said. “What we have right now is a situation which reasonable minds could agree that there is just no room for divisive language.”

Individual players have also taken to social media to say they want her gone, and two outspoken WNBA players, Mystics star Natasha Cloud and Liberty standout Layshia Clarendon, have made media appearances stating why Loeffler needs to go.

Seattle Storm player, Alysha Clark, told ESPN’s “Pardon the Interruption” that Loeffler needs to step down.



“At the WNBA we are about inclusion, we are about equality, and you are constantly seeing WNBA players at the front of social justice causes fighting for what’s right,” Clark said. “And so to have somebody apart of our league owning a team, you know, that opposes the equality of black lives…it doesn’t make sense, and she needs to go.”

ESPN host Stephen A. Smith said removing her from day-to-day operations is not enough when players are asking her to be removed from team ownership.

“I don’t want to hear any politician say politics shouldn’t be part of sports. They have nothing to say when the president comments about sports all the time,” Smith said.

Two-time WNBA champion Renee Montgomery said on TMZ Sports in a message to Loeffler, “Your views don’t mesh with WNBA culture.”

Despite the backlash, Loeffler is not entirely alone in her concern about BLM in particular. On the FOX Sports 1 show, “Speak for Yourself,” former NFL all-pro defensive end Marcellus Wiley explained that BLM’s mission statement says its goals is to end the nuclear family as we know it. Wiley maintains that intact black families lead to personal and economic success for African-Americans and balked at BLM’s claim that white supremacy was the most pressing issue for blacks in America today. “Being a father and a husband — that’s my mission in life right now,” he said.

If all this heat were not enough, Loeffler has a difficult special election ahead of her on Nov. 3, facing off against twenty candidates for her US Senate seat. Despite criticism, and a difficult election, Loeffler insists she will not be stepping down as a co-owner and stands behind her efforts to depoliticize women’s basketball.

“This week they threatened to burn the system down, literally and figuratively if they don’t get what they want,” she said in an interview with Fox News. “This is an organization that looks to destroy American principles and I had to draw the line.”

Nick Cannon Spouts Anti-Semitism With Ousted Public Enemy Rapper,"Nick Cannon, the former host of “America’s Got Talent” and current host of “The Masked Signer,” had Richard Griffin, better known by his rapper name, Professor Griff, on his podcast two weeks ago only to have long stretches of conversation in which they both spout anti-Semitic slurs.

The 90-minute episode of “Cannon’s Class” included severe slurs toward Jewish people, including the claim that they suppress black people, who are the true chosen people of Israel. Cannon also referred to the leader of the Nation Islam Louis Farrakhan, whose anti-Semitism has been widely known and publicized, as the “honorable Minister Farrakhan” and praised his work throughout.

Cannon asked Griff why, given that black people are the “true children of Israel,” is it considered problematic to speak the truth?

“It became a problem for us because of the propaganda machine. But it’s more of a problem for them,” Griff said. “They’ve taken our birthright.”

The two attributed some of the confusion over birthright to others not wanting black people to have what they were naturally given, “Even though we [are] the true Hebrews,” Cannon said.

Others misinterpret the message of their birthright, Griff said, because they’re upset that black people “came back to claim it.” He then likened the situation of fighting for Holy Land to retrieving one’s stolen bicycle after you see the person who stole it flaunting one’s property. Griff also criticized media censorship as part of the propaganda machine in perpetuating the idea that Jews are the natural inhabitants of Israel.

“We can’t even tell the truth now. Not on records, not on television shows. If that’s truly our birthright, there’s no hate involved.”

They further discussed ways in which Jews have exploited the world, including references to the Rothschild family’s legacy. In conjunction with his claims that black people are the real Semitic people, Cannon said he can’t be anti-Semitic because he himself is Semitic.

This is just the most recent example of Professor Griff’s long history of anti-Semitism. The rapper formerly belonged to the group Public Enemy before he was forced out in 1989 for a series of hateful comments, reported by the magazine “Spin.” Griff’s controversial statements included saying, “If the Palestinians took up arms, went into Israel and killed all the Jews, it’d be alright.”

In a 1989 interview with the Washington Times, he argued Jews have caused the majority of the world’s evil. He also put forth the utterly unsubstantiated claims that Jews finance AIDS experiments on black South Africans.

During the show with Cannon, Griffin stood by his anti-Semitic comments made during the Washington Times interview. He said he was only ousted by his group and remains a controversial figure still today because he was brave enough to spread truth.

Cannon’s anti-Semitism has caught fire before, too. In 2013, the Anti-Defamation League publicly criticized Cannon for appearing in a video by a group they consider to be the nation’s largest antisemitic and racist black militant group, the New Black Panther Party.

Cannon filmed the episode last year but posted it again last month in light of the renewed national interest in racism in America. The subject matter of “Cannon’s Class” has been strictly racial in recent months, often supporting the Black Lives Matter movement in America and criticizing police.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told Jewish Insider “anyone seeking a Ph.D in Jew-hatred should watch this ‘interview.’”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/13/nick-cannon-spouts-anti-semitism-with-ousted-public-enemy-rapper/,2020-07-13
"These ‘Fortune 500’ Companies Donated To The Marxist, Anti-Capitalism Black Lives Matter Foundation","At least seven “Fortune 500” companies donated funds to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation despite its Marxist roots and anti-capitalistic views.

According to Axios, “the 100 largest U.S. companies have so far committed $1.63 billion to organizations fighting racism and inequality.” Analysis of social media posts, blogs, and public statements collected, however, shows that Decker’s Uggs, Amazon, Pepsi’s Gatorade, Microsoft, Warner Records, Intel, Bungie of Xbox and Microsoft Games, and Mondelez International’s Nabisco all specifically pledged money to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation following the death of George Floyd.

According to the Black Lives Matter website, their goal is to promote “Freedom, Liberation and Justice” and “to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.” The movement’s ideological roots however, run deeper than bringing justice to victims of police brutality.

One of the BLM co-founders, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, explained the foundation of the movement, inspired by her and co-founders Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, in an interview in 2015.

“We actually do have an ideological frame,” she told The Real News. “Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists.”

One click into the “What We Believe” portion of the BLM website reveals a far broader agenda for the organization. Stated goals include “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.” Another mission statement refers to its members as “comrades” a common moniker used by communists.

In addition, the newest Black Lives Matter campaign, #WhatMatters2020, focuses on highlighting certain political issues such as “racial injustice, police brutality, criminal justice reform, Black immigration, economic injustice, LGBTQIA+ and human rights, environmental injustice, access to healthcare, access to quality education, and voting rights and suppression” as well as “government corruption” and “commonsense gun laws” to emphasize and push in the 2020 election. Using target goals, the organization hopes to increase the black voting demographic, educate and amplify on the previously mentioned political goals, and increase voter registration for younger generations, the black demographic, and “allies.”

Using ActBlue, a platform dedicated to creating fundraising for “Democratic candidates and committees, progressive organizations, and nonprofits that share our values,” Black Lives Matter solicits donations to further their goals.

Although The Federalist reached out to each of the “Fortune 500” companies for comment, asking whether or not financially supporting Black Lives Matter squared away with their capitalistic company values, economic practices, and political views, we received no response.

Black Lives Matter Is Not A Peaceful Protest Group,"Wisconsin police say a Mexican man intentionally drove his truck into a motorcyclist earlier this month for the sole purpose of killing a white person.

According to the criminal complaint reviewed by local Green Bay outlet NBC26 charging Daniel Navarro with a hate crime, “Navarro stated that if Trump and white people are going to create a world like we are living in then he has no choice and people are going to have to die.”

Police say the victim, Philip Thiessen, 55, a former Marine, police officer, special agent, and regular volunteer at a local food pantry, died on the scene.

According to the criminal complaint, Navarro deliberately ran his truck into a motorcyclist as opposed to a car because “he wanted the person to die and not be paralyzed.” The complaint also says Navarro perceived Harley culture as brimming with white supremacists.

Further south in Indianapolis, the downtown canal saw its second homicide within a week after an argument broke out. One group offended over the term “all lives matter” shot and killed the mother of a 3-year-old on Sunday.

In Detroit, new Black Lives Matter protests erupted last week demanding “justice” and taking action against local law enforcement that shot and killed a black man who had opened fire on officers first at point-blank.

“Justice for Hakim Littleton! Fire and jail the killer cop!” shouted hundreds of demonstrators outside the 12th precinct headquarters for police, according to the Detroit News.

It doesn’t seem to matter that bodycam footage showed Littleton first firing at police arresting an associate, because in the eyes of the restless mob under the banner of Black Lives Matter, police are public enemy number one.

Black Lives Matter is not a peaceful protest group. It is a cultural revolutionary Marxist mob pursuing the total transformation of modern society under the new woke world order. In reality, Black Lives Matter don’t actually care about black lives, otherwise there would be more outrage over recent spikes in community violence leaving more black people dead rather than chasing an anarchic quest to “defund police” that will demoralize law enforcement and increase homicides.

“We’re protesting for months, for weeks, saying ‘black lives matter,'” said John Ayala, who lost his granddaughter to a shooting in Washington D.C. “Black lives matter, it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a black person. What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

Since the killing of George Floyd at the knees of Minneapolis police, Black Lives Matter have exposed its true colors as an anarchic movement terrorizing the nation. Within the last three months, mob rioters have burned down minority businesses, destroyed minority neighborhoods, killed a black police chief, desecrated civil rights monuments, launched deadly occupations of downtown centers, and set fire to churches.

“You ain’t seen nothing yet,” said an Atlanta resident said after a murder near his own home, where Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has declared a state of emergency and called up the National Guard to address an epidemic of violence.

While merely exacerbated in the apocalyptical year of 2020, Black Lives Matter has always been violent. Its leaders knew it. Activists knew it. Politicians knew it. And the media knew it, but legacy media wouldn’t dare report it. To the contrary, the media will literally stand in front of a burning police precinct and characterize the demonstrators as “mostly a protest.”

""This mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started."" MSNBC reporter says protests in Minneapolis are not ""generally speaking, unruly"" as buildings burn in the background. pic.twitter.com/IzzEmKgxhM — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 29, 2020

At least he qualified with “mostly.”

While exhaustively rushing to cover protests as peaceful demonstrations of the oppressed courageously standing up to political power which just happen to sometimes result in the combustion of buildings, the disappearance of items from small businesses, and shooting of police, the media was rushing to condemn any who exposed their malicious lies with ill-fated attempts at de-platforming opponents.

Just a few weeks prior to Floyd’s death, after which it would celebrate the protests, corporate media was raising hysteria over lockdown demonstrations calling Americans who protested for their freedoms reckless, suicidal, selfish, racist because they could spread the virus to black people, undeserving of medical attention, irresponsibly spreading the virus, and dangerous.

The coverage of the “social justice” riots also mark a stark contrast from the way Tea Party protests were depicted by Democrats and the media nearly a decade ago.

In 2011, former Vice President Joe Biden said Americans protesting the nation’s troubling high deficit were “acting like terrorists,” and the coverage of Tea Party demonstrations were so mischaracterized a year earlier that Breitbart founder, Andrew Breitbart offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could prove demonstrators had shouted the N-word at the Congressional Black Caucus.

One can easily imagine what the media coverage ought to look like if the Tea Party engaged in the kind of widespread destruction left behind by Black Lives Matter. It’s all proof that America’s corporate media does not report, it attempts to manipulate the public for dangerous partisan gain.

Instagram Blocked GOP Senator's Children's Book On Launch Day,"After blocking a new children’s book from Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn and her daughter, Mary Morgan Ketchel from being promoted on the platform twice, Instagram appeared to ban the book’s promotion again on the day of the launch.

On Tuesday, a third ad posted on the site to kick off the biggest day for the book was pulled down from the site shortly after it was published garnering more than 100 views.

“I posted our launch yesterday morning and they basically paused its viewership,” Ketchel told The Federalist. “There was all of this engagement and all of a sudden after a couple of hours it just dropped off dead. I don’t believe that they let anybody see it after they realized it was me.”

Meanwhile the book, titled “Camila Can Vote: Celebrating the Centennial of Women’s Right to Vote,” enjoyed booming traffic on Amazon maintaining its number one spot for new releases in Children’s 1900s American Historical Fiction as the co-authors promoted their project with online livestreams and interviews throughout the day which likely would have upped the engagement with their ad on Instagram.

Screenshots shared exclusively with The Federalist show the ad review was still “in progress” by 8 p.m. eastern when Ketchel requested an update on her appeal.

“I am advertising a children’s book and I want to be able to utilize social media to do so,” Ketchel said. “I’m able to reach people that I would not ordinarily reach, and that’s why I’m trying to utilize it… With book stores closed across the country, this is really the way I’m able to sell my book.”

To Ketchel and Blackburn’s frustration, Instagram had already twice blocked the book before, and while each time the social media company ultimately approved its promotion, initial censorship impeded progress on its rollout, keeping eyes from seeing the project that otherwise might benefit from its purchase such as parents, schoolteachers or librarians.

Instagram cited the book’s potential to “influence the outcome of an election, or existing proposed legislation,” as reason for prohibiting its first two rounds of ads but granted their approval following Federalist reporting even after denying Ketchel’s appeals multiple times.

The book, however, tells the tale of Tennessee’s role in becoming the final state to pass women’s suffrage through the lens of a schoolgirl’s trip to a museum and has nothing to do with contemporary political events.

“It’s history, and it’s a children’s book. It’s a bright, colorful, exciting children’s format of historical fiction,” Ketchel said. “It’s mean to connect a young reader with the history of the women’s movement.”

A company spokesperson told The Federalist in May that the book was flagged on the platform in error after the first time it was censored.

“We have policies in place to ensure ads transparency around political ads and given the senator was a co-author, it’s reasonable it was flagged but upon review, political ads authorization is not necessary,” the company wrote in a May email.

The company said last week after the second time its promotion was blocked, Facebook, which owns Instagram said it was “taking steps to hopefully prevent another instance of this.”

When the book was first blocked on the platform in May, Instagram approached Blackburn’s office to request Ketchel register her personal account as a political group or influencer as if she were operating as a political action committee or campaign. Ketchel however, who boasts an account with few more than 1,200 followers rejected the idea the she must be registered as a political influencer for merely promoting a children’s book with her mother’s name attached.

“I’m a mom, I’m a blogger, and now I’m a children’s book co-author… I am not a political group.”

Ketchel worried that by registering her personal account as a political group based on her mother’s role in the Senate, she would be subjected to heightened censorship on anything else she were to post.

“I am not going to go through a process to identify myself as a political group and open myself up to this kind of targeting for as long as I should have a social media presence,” Ketchel said.

Given recent attempts by big tech to suppress conservatives online including her mother, it’s a legitimate concern.

In 2017, Twitter pulled down a Blackburn campaign ad as she launched her successful Senate bid while she was still serving in the House after they deemed it “inflammatory.”

Twitter ultimately reinstated the video following conservative backlash.

Last month, Google threatened to demonetize The Federalist over content in its comment sections despite Google-owned YouTube’s comment sections infamous reputation for hosting some of the most nefarious comment sections on the entire internet.

Google’s recent threat of censorship prompted higher scrutiny from Washington lawmakers including Blackburn, a longtime proponent to break up big tech who also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Tech Task Force.

Facebook said the latest round of censorship was also made in error and is “continuing to take steps to hopefully prevent another instance of this.”

Media Attacks Trump For A Factual Statement About Law Enforcement And Race,"The media is famous for its attempts to completely assassinate and misconstrue Trump’s words to benefit its agenda and this week was no exception.

In an interview with CBS, reporter Catherine Herridge asked Trump why black people are still dying at the hands of law enforcement. Trump responded by saying that more white people are actually killed by police every year. He also noted that he thought the question was “terrible.”

President Trump tells @CBS_Herridge that “more White people” are dying at the hands of police than Black people. Watch excerpts on CBSN, more tonight on @CBSEveningNews and tomorrow on @CBSThisMorning https://t.co/NeBLT0LG0p pic.twitter.com/XIwyARJBBl — CBS News (@CBSNews) July 14, 2020

According to Statista, Trump’s statement is true: more white people are killed by police every year in total. In just 2020, 204 white people and 105 black people were fatally shot to death by police in the U.S.

In addition, the FBI data published in the Uniform Crime Report shows that white people are far more likely to be arrested than black people.

“In 2018, 69.0 percent of all individuals arrested were White, 27.4 percent were Black or African American, and 3.6 percent were of other races,” the report reads.

A mathematical breakdown of data collected by multiple sources and published in The Boston Globe shows that the percentage of white people likely to be killed by the police is higher in situations where “white people tend to encounter the police in more grave situations.”

Almost immediately after Trump’s comments aired, reporters and others punched on his statement and began misconstruing it. Many of them mistook the statement and cited the fact that black people are more likely to be killed by police instead of acknowledging that Trump’s statement was referring to totals instead of rates.

“‘What a terrible question to ask,’ Trump says, when asked by ⁦@CBS_Herridge⁩ why Black people are still dying at the hands of law enforcement,” tweeted a CBS reporter.

“The president asserts that ‘more’ White people are killed by police than Black people,” wrote New York Times reporter Maggie Habberman, whose description of the president’s line conveys his statement was not a fact.

Twitter also dedicated a news alert page dedicated to the statements and reaction from journalists to “share data” about the statement.

While one MSNBC reporter even acknowledged that Trump’s statement was true, he still proceeded to criticize him.

“It is true that police in the US also kill a lot of white people which is…not really necessarily a super awesome debating point in the police’s favor?” wrote MSNBC’s Chris Hayes.

Others, however, saw the hypocritical treatment Trump received for the statement from the media right away.

“It’s not merely an assertion; it’s a fact. We’re only surprised by the facts—when someone dares to utter them—because we’ve been brainwashed by the media to believe lies,” one user quipped.

“I’m confused, what’s the problem? That’s factually accurate,” wrote another.

“This is factual. Now—% wise? No. Black people are more likely to be killed than whites based on their population size. But in order to know whether this is disproportionate, you don’t look at population. You look at crime rates and police interactions of whites vs blacks,” another tweeted.

“Trump’s instinct that Americans are tired of the media dividing us into racial groups every 5 minutes is correct. He should stick to it,” quipped David Marcus.

What To Read Instead Of ‘White Fragility’,"“Do the work!” The phrase has become a kind of ritual malediction among activists who seek to weaponize racism.

First, an accusation of racism is made. It goes without saying that it is accurate – how could it not be, when virtually every institution and norm in modern America is an instrument of white supremacy?

At this point, a lot of people merely yield or acquiesce to the will of their accuser out of misplaced guilt or fear of the reputational harm that comes with being branded a racist. If you are foolhardy enough to raise questions of the accuser about the veracity of the complaint, or are merely confused about what’s being alleged, a discussion will not ensue. There will be variations of the same theme: “I AM TIRED. AND EXHAUSTED trying to explain your white privilege to you. DO THE WORK.”

What does “do the work” even mean? Well, if you want to go down the academic rabbit-hole from which this emerged, in neo-Marxian critical theory argot the term of art is “praxis.”

In his late-phase Marxism, Jean Paul Sartre defined “praxis” as the transformation of the world in accordance with a specific ideological end. So when you’re told “do the work,” leftists don’t mean any kind of personal development that would allow for unique circumstances, individual understanding, and personal agency. They have a very specific program in mind for you to follow.

So we get passages like this from a priceless open letter in Portland Monthly where “white people” are addressed en masse and told to “Consider your performative solidarity officially on notice”:

I advise you to check your white guilt and the impulse you may now feel to reach out to the Black folks in your life. DO NOT CALL YOUR BLACK FRIEND RIGHT NOW! This might be a novel concept, but consume content about the Black experience produced by Black creatives and thought leaders—not white non-experts on Blackness you feel safe with. We all have the same internet, and from it you have equal access to books, culturally-specific contemporary publications, podcasts, and other seemingly endless resources that can be the impetus for your own self-examination.

It’s telling that engagement is one-sided – you’re not to be engaged until you’re immersed in a “culturally-specific” and political understanding of their choosing.

To that end, the author above provides a link to a Google doc with a slew of resources to get woke. The suggestions range from relatively benign or helpful (read Toni Morrison novels!) to eye-rolling (follow The New York Times’ Jamelle Bouie on Twitter) to pernicious works influenced by critical race theory that damage race relations and interpersonal relationships (the work of Robin DiAngelo and Ibram X. Kendi, authors of White Fragility and How to Be an Anti-Racist).

By now it should be obvious what’s going on. If you’re aggressively confronted about alleged personal weaknesses, shut out from dealing directly with the supposedly aggrieved party, told you can only begin these failings by engaging with and agreeing to a specific doctrine, and at that point you relent… congratulations! You’ve just joined a cult.

The purging of wrongthink will be total. Last month, The New York Times published an op-ed encouraging people to send texts “to your relatives and loved ones telling them you will not be visiting them or answering phone calls until they take significant action in supporting black lives either through protest or financial contributions.”

The Kafka Trap

While critical race theory is seeping into the culture from a lot of different directions, it’s worth looking at the two most influential books, White Fragility and How to Be an Anti-Racist, which are currently dominating the bestseller lists.

The reach of DiAngelo’s White Fragility is such that she was recently a guest on the Tonight Show, and the book has become almost totemic in its significance. Recently, Robin Broshi, a member of a New York City Community Education Council, got outraged at her fellow councilmember during the group’s public Zoom meeting for bouncing a friend’s nephew on his lap.

His crime? “It hurts people when they see a white man bouncing a brown baby on their lap and they don’t know the context. That is harmful,” she said, in obvious distress. “I would like to know how having my friend’s nephew on my lap was racist,” he asked. “Read a book. Read White Fragility,” she retorted.

Fortunately, the notoriety has been such that at least a few notable people have read White Fragility and finally begun to condemn the insanity it provokes. Matt Taibbi, an avowed liberal who has recently become alarmed by the growing belief that “individual rights, humanism, and the democratic process are all just stalking-horses for white supremacy,” tore the book to pieces in a widely read review, noting, “DiAngelo isn’t the first person to make a buck pushing tricked-up pseudo-intellectual horses–t as corporate wisdom, but she might be the first to do it selling Hitlerian race theory.”

The Hitlerian race theory bit isn’t really hyperbole. The entire book is a peaen to white identity politics, albeit a backhanded one. DiAngelo, who is white, insists that for white people to address racism they have to accept their identity as a white person and constantly be aware of how the mere fact of their skin color defines interactions with others. Once they’ve done that, only then can they begin to shed their racist behaviors but LOL JK you can’t really stop being racist because you’re still white and “anti-blackness is foundational to our very identities.”

Now obviously there are lots of historical examples of why encouraging white people to find solidarity in their skin color could backfire. In that respect, the colorblind attitudes preached by Martin Luther King Jr. and his acolytes were successful in advancing civil rights, and not just because they encouraged white people to see black people as their brothers and sisters made in the image of the same God and therefore deserving of the same personal respect and political rights. Emphasizing the “content of their character” over the color of their skin made it clear just how superficial race-based solidarity of white culture is and why it was worth rejecting. In fact, DiAngelo makes a point of explicitly rejecting the “content of their character” argument, arrogantly oblivious to the hubris involved in a white lady dismissing MLK’s civil rights legacy.

While frustration over perceived lack of racial progress since the MLK era is understandable, it beggars belief that anyone, let alone someone who professes to oppose racism, would look at the last 70 or so years of American history and say, “I think we need to get white people to start thinking about how their skin color unites them.” But here we are.

Taibbi righteously identifies problems with DiAngelo, but skirts around the fact that DiAngelo’s desire to harden racial identities is just a set-up for something even more troubling. Should you resist accepting your white identity or otherwise deny how an accident of your birth makes you complicit in systemic evils regardless of your intent and behavior, well, DiAngelo’s pat response is kind of astonishing: The fact you are insecure and “fragile” when confronted with what your white identity means is just further proof that you are, in fact, racist.

This is a rhetorical device known as a “Kafka trap,” where the more you deny something, the more it’s proof of your guilt. Suffice to say, this is both illogical and manipulative by design. It’s not just that DiAngelo’s book is premised on a fallacy; that fallacy is so prominent it’s explained in the title of the book.

This brings us to Kendi’s How to Be an Anti-Racist, which kicks Kafka-trapping up to a whole new level. Like DiAngelo, Kendi’s vision of being “anti-racist” means coding every interaction with people in terms of some sort of complex hierarchy of identity that you’re supposed to innately understand. (Note that the epistemology of various identarian ideologies are at odds with each other. Skin color may be an observable fact to some extent, but “race” is largely a cultural construct, hence why so many people agree to pretend Shaun King is black.)

Again, Kendi is creating a closed loop. Agree to situate yourself in the hierarchy, or you’re racist. And once you’ve situated yourself in the hierarchy, that’s when “doing the work” begins.

Even if you as an individual have done nothing wrong, you’re still benefitting from a racist system just by virtue of your skin color. Merely not being racist and confronting racist behavior when you see it isn’t enough to dismantle racism. Instead, you have to be “anti-racist.”

That means you are constantly combatting systemic racism by, in effect, attacking and remaking the system itself. What does this look like? Well, I’ll let Kendi explain:

To fix the original sin of racism, Americans should pass an anti-racist amendment to the U.S. Constitution that enshrines two guiding anti-racist principals: Racial inequity is evidence of racist policy and the different racial groups are equals. The amendment would make unconstitutional racial inequity over a certain threshold, as well as racist ideas by public officials (with ‘racist ideas’ and ‘public official’ clearly defined). It would establish and permanently fund the Department of Anti-racism (DOA) comprised of formally trained experts on racism and no political appointees. The DOA would be responsible for preclearing all local, state and federal public policies to ensure they won’t yield racial inequity, monitor those policies, investigate private racist policies when racial inequity surfaces, and monitor public officials for expressions of racist ideas. The DOA would be empowered with disciplinary tools to wield over and against policymakers and public officials who do not voluntarily change their racist policy and ideas.

All we have to do is “clearly define” racism and make it illegal? Why didn’t we think of that earlier! And a federal cabinet agency that goes around investigating “private” accusations of racism and disciplining public officials for expressions of racist ideas? Just ignore the amusing suggestion that this agency be referred to as “DOA,” let’s just call it the federal Department of What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

These ideas are especially insidious because they exploit the goodwill of people and institutions earnestly seeking to not be racist, and who come into these discussions with their guards down and willing to change their behavior if they think it will help make the world a less racist place.

Ironically, the supposed solutions coming from DiAngelo and Kendi in any other context would be called racist. They perpetuate a worldview that asks people to accept that they are forever defined by skin color, and refute attempts to question this understanding with nonfalsifiable logic that requires permanent subjugation. But you are not racist for disagreeing with this stuff — it’s anti-American, and designed to create more unhappiness and racial strife.

The Use and Abuse of History

So how do you fight this? Well, to start you should, in fact, “do the work.” But acquainting yourself with the more current and pernicious stains of thinking on racial politics isn’t enough.

You may have noticed that DiAngelo, Kendi, and most of their fellow travelers are obsessed with history as of late. They justify their urgency and radicalism by citing historical narratives divorced from reality, one where racism and slavery aren’t a betrayal of American ideals, but the fulfillment of them.

This mythmaking bulldozes over historical and present reality. There are plenty of criticisms of this country’s political and cultural handling of race that can and should be made, but it’s frankly embarrassing how ignorant and misleading about history so many of the people leading our national conversation on race really are. The people yelling “do the work!” haven’t actually done the work.

For instance, this past Fourth of July, Kendi tweeted an abbreviated version of Frederick Douglass’s famous speech, “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July.” Written in 1852, it is a scathing indictment of the hypocrisies of American founding ideals at time slavery was still legal.

Douglass, a former slave, abolitionist, and personal friend of Abraham Lincoln, is truly great and underappreciated American. But for all his righteous anger over slavery, he still believed in his country. In the speech, Douglass praises the Constitution as “saving principles,” and he’s quite explicit in his belief that it’s “slander on [the founders’] memory” to believe the foundational document was part of a plan to perpetuate slavery rather than end it.

At a time people are toppling statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, anyone quoting Douglass’s speech should probably not omit where Douglass says, “the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep the corner-stone of the national superstructure” and that he will “unite with you to honor their memory.”

However, if you just read Kendi’s abbreviated version of the speech, you’d get a very different idea of what Douglass actually said. The use and abuse of Douglass is a recurring theme. Last year, Colin Kaepernick quoted the Douglass speech for his own ends; this year he rejected the holiday outright, and simply referred to the Fourth of July as “your celebration of white supremacy.” Surely it says something that a millionaire athlete’s hatred of his country far eclipses that of Douglass, a former slave writing while slavery was still being practiced.

It’s simply becoming impossible to deny that the goal here is to rewrite history. The New York Times’ much-discussed 1619 Project explicitly aims to make America’s true founding date the arrival of the first slave ship in 1619, not 1776. Nikole Hannah-Jones, the leader of the 1619 Project, is a little more than an embarrassing and conspiracy-minded provocateur who has endorsed violence.

Her historical ignorance is such that she recently defended the toppling of a statue of noted racist Ulysses S. Grant and compared him to Hitler and Osama bin Laden because Grant “owned another human being.” For the record, Grant, who abhorred slavery and defeated the Confederate Army, inherited a single slave from his father-in-law and then manumitted him within a year or so because that’s about how long the legal process took.

Despite the fact that Hannah-Jones is a charlatan, The New York Times has had to issue a correction on the 1619 Project, and there have been howls of protests from America’s most eminent historians about the project’s “displacement of historical understanding by ideology,” the 1619 Project won a Pulitzer Prize, is coming to a school curriculum near you, and Oprah Winfrey has a series of film projects planned.

This false narrative that places slavery at the center of American history, rather than our imperfect struggle to realize our founding ideals, will be cemented unless people speak out. In addition to brushing up on the insidious logic behind critical race theory, it’s going to be necessary to improve our historical understanding to fight these attempts to tear the country down.

Doing the Real Work

With that in mind, here’s a list of books and other resources that will help put race and American history in their proper perspective. This list of books will not be comforting to contemporary conservative or Christian worldviews. Even if historical truths generally vindicate American ideals, that doesn’t excuse the blood-soaked betrayal of those ideas that have occurred in the nearly 250 years since. Part of the reason these ahistorical narratives about race are taking hold so swiftly is that most of the country has only confronted the horrors of slavery and racism in the abstract.

As James Baldwin has observed, “the reason for this ignorance is that a knowledge of the role these people [African-Americans] played—and play—in American life would reveal more about America to Americans than Americans wish to know.” Prepare to be uncomfortable and remember that you can handle challenging facts, ideas, and opinions. Remember you’re not the one asking people to join a cult — the goal is to be more empathetic and informed, and you should be prepared to change your mind about some things.

Slavery: Historically, America’s educational system has given the black experience short shrift, and it’s important to understand just how horrifying the practice of chattel slavery was in terms of the torture, abuse, and tearing apart of families. The low-impact book here is Alex Haley’s Roots: The Saga of an American Family, which was a mega-bestseller when it came out in the 1970s, won a Pulitzer, and prompted a hugely successful TV miniseries.

It follows the story of Kunta Kinte, an African kidnapped and sold into slavery and transported to America, and the generations of his family on down to Alex Haley himself. Roots is imperfect, or at the very least the fact a large chunk of it was apparently plagiarized from another novel about the slave experience written by a white guy should provide some interesting fodder for those who think “cultural appropriation” is a legitimate complaint. Still, the historical sweep of Roots puts slavery into perspective, it’s a cultural landmark, and it’s very readable.

It’s more imperative to read the first-hand 19th-century slave narratives. They are amazing documents. The most famous is, of course, the eponymous Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, which should be required reading for all Americans. Just the mere facts recounted about what the slaves were given to eat and wear should shock the conscience, never mind what Douglass has to say about the deliberate denial of slaves’ humanity.

“I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; He must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceases to be a man,” Douglass writes. The Library of America also has an excellent single volume of slave narratives that includes Douglass, as well as writings from Nat Turner, Sojourner Truth, and others.

Finally, Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World The Slaves Made by Eugene D. Genovese is considered a classic history of slavery — the book won the Bancroft Prize when it came out in 1972 — and is fairly unique in that it uses Marxist critiques to show how slaves worked within the oppressive system to find ways to maintain their dignity.

Genovese was a sincere Marxist at the time he wrote it, but by the 1990s identified himself as a social conservative who founded the Historical Society to combat the “totalitarian assault” of political correctness and ideological history coming from the academy. The book’s use of Marxist theories is confounding, and even infuriating, to contemporary left-wing academics.

The Civil War: Since Confederate monuments and the legacy of the Civil War are at the heart of many of the current debates, it’s worth getting familiar with this pivotal event and its causes. A leading contender for best single-volume history of the conflict is James McPherson’s Battle Cry of Freedom, which has been endorsed by Ta-Nehisi Coates for offering “a catalogue of evidence, making it clear not just that the white South went to war for the right to own people, but that it warred for the right to expand the right to own people.”

Relating to the Civil War, it’s important to also get familiar with the rhetoric of the leader who won it. The Portable Lincoln and Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America, the latter by the terrific historian Allen C. Guelzo, make it clear that Lincoln’s political success and his justifications for waging war rested on convincing the country slavery was incompatible with our cherished founding documents. Anyone who’s read The Gettysburg Address knows Lincoln was a brilliant writer, but he’s the rare figure, let alone politician, who only seems to grow in your estimation as you read more of his work.

Frederick Douglass: While Douglass’s autobiography is essential, that doesn’t begin to explain his political and cultural influence — and he was an influential political figure until his death 30 years after the end of the Civil War. The Portable Frederick Douglass, edited by John Stauffer and Henry Louis Gates Jr., provides not just selections from his autobiographical works, but a good selection of his speeches and journalism that show how America was continuing to wrestle with race in the decades following the end of slavery.

Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois: Born in 1856, Booker T. Washington’s 1901 autobiography Up From Slavery tells the story of the famous educator’s life and how he attributes his success to education, self-reliance, and industriousness. He urges this path for his fellow African-Americans.

It’s impossible to overstate the positive impact this book had on the country and race relations. For decades after it came out, Washington’s book was the only touchstone for race relations many white Americans had, and the reaction was overwhelmingly positive. (My grandmother, who was raised in rural Idaho and died pushing 100, used to approvingly quote the book’s nuggets of wisdom for my benefit.)

On the other hand, Washington’s popularity and the simplicity of his message were also resented by other 20th-century black writers who were both in his shadow and still dealing with pronounced racism. In W.E.B. DuBois’ The Souls of Black Folk, published just two years after Up From Slavery, DuBois tackles Washington head-on.

He praises Washington for lifting up the image of black people and engendering sympathy to the plight of black people from whites, but counters that there were plenty of educated and industrious black Americans in Jim Crow America finding that Washington’s prescriptions weren’t enough to overcome racism. DuBois’ thinking eventually lead to the creation of the NAACP and more African-American political engagement.

It’s worth weighing DuBois and Washington’s arguments against each other in light of the ways political engagement has clearly benefited black Americans, versus creating dependencies that have eroded self-reliance and weakened black families and communities. There are points in favor of both arguments, and finding the right balance between the two is key to improving the lives of black Americans.

James Baldwin: Baldwin is just a stunning writer almost in the literal sense of the word, and he’s almost worth reading just to appreciate his mastery of the written word. The two essays contained in The Fire Next Time manage to say as much or more about the problems of race in just 120 pages than almost anyone before or since.

The Fire Next Time contains multitudes; Baldwin speaks of sincerely wanting vengeance for the treatment of black Americans and his thoughts on the potential for improving race relations drip with cynicism. A former preacher in his youth, he excoriates American Christianity for its inadequacies and hypocrisies on race.

But he always manages to leave the door open just enough so hope can creep in, writing of the need for a “love [that] takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.” And he worryingly observes that “glorification of one race and the consequent debasement of another—or others—always has been and always will be a recipe for murder.”

It’s all the more interesting that the book was written in 1963. Baldwin’s asides on communism and imperialism, along with his dismissal of Bobby Kennedy’s surprisingly accurate prediction there would be a black president in 40 years, haven’t aged well.

But it’s also a real indictment so many of his universal observations about racial injustice, including his repeated complaints about the police treatment of black people, remain shockingly relevant. As a bonus, Baldwin astutely dissects the appeal of the Nation of Islam to black Americans — a topic that’s suddenly become relevant again.

Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele: Sowell might be one of the smartest Americans who has ever lived, and his contributions to economics are undeniably momentous. Any other black intellectual of his stature would be much more famous, but Sowell’s conservatism means his extensive writings on race are ignored because they don’t advance the political causes of the left.

But that doesn’t make them any less worthy. Books such as Intellectuals and Race, Discrimination and Disparities, Black Rednecks and White Liberals, and Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality? are all impeccably argued and buttressed with research. (Sowell has also done important work on education, the big civil rights issue that doesn’t get discussed because it indicts the left.)

Similarly, Shelby Steele is another unjustly ignored conservative black intellectual whose writing on race is essential. White Guilt, Shame, The Content of Our Character, and A Dream Deferred all challenge accepted liberal racial and political narratives adroitly.

DiAngelo and Kendi: Yes, it will be painful, but you should absolutely try and read DiAngelo and Kendi’s books, because a lot of the people waving them around as anti-racist talisman might have picked up on a few ideas from an NPR interview, but odds are good they haven’t really read them.

Both books are full of academic jargon are somewhat inscrutable by design. But if you read them, that affords you a powerful opportunity when someone is, oh say, inexplicably offended by you bouncing a child of a different skin color on your lap and yells at you to read White Fragility.

At that point you can say, “Actually, I have read that book. And I think that anyone who actually cares about racism should be very wary of it. Do you really think ‘White people’s moral objection to racism increases their resistance to acknowledging their complicity with it’? Why does DiAngelo encourage white people to be obsessively aware of their racial identity when she also says ‘a positive white identity is an impossible goal’?” If nothing else, the results will be amusing.

James Lindsay and New Discourses: Lindsay and his cohorts at the New Discourses website have emerged as leading and fearless critics of the hordes of critical theorists trying to shove social justice down our throats, particularly as it intersects with real-world occupations and concerns. (See, for instance, this article on how woke politics are making it harder for mental health professionals to do their job.)

If you need a plain English explanation for the latest social justice fad and why it’s corrosive to free speech and other American values, there’s a good chance you’ll find something useful on their comprehensive website. Lindsay is also excellent at exposing just how far gone adherents of “critical social justice” are – see this video where someone tries to explain that determining whether the number of candies in a box is even or odd isn’t just a matter of counting them; it depends on your cultural understanding of “math.”

What’s interesting is that Lindsay is an atheist and a rationalist. Not that long ago, people with Lindsay’s sympathies were predominantly focused on critiquing the religious right. But Lindsay and the New Discourses crew seem to have recognized the seriousness of threat coming from the zealous enforcement of the far-left’s woke doctrines, which have all the problems of religion but offer none of the forgiveness and redemption. To that end, Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose have a book coming out in late August, Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity―and Why This Harms Everybody, which promises to be insightful.

Putting Your Knowledge to Work

If you become acquainted with even a small fraction of the work above, you should be well-equipped to hold your own in a conversation about race. Unfortunately, these days entering into any public fray about race is fraught with the danger for reputational harm, no matter how well-intentioned you are.

Discussing race, particularly as a white person, should always be done cautiously, and emphasize empathy and humility. In that respect, I hardly pretend to know everything about race in America; everything I’ve written here should just be viewed as one concerned man offering his opinions and making an effort. I’m keeping an open mind about police reform and many other topics these days.

However, not that long ago, running around fretting about “cultural Marxism” was a sure way to announce you were a right-wing nut job. Now one glance at the bestsellers list suggests that such concerns are perfectly valid. There’s still plenty of room for the right and earnest liberals to discuss solutions to racial injustice, but ceding the discussion to the new clerisy of “anti-racists” is not really an option when they don’t offer participatory solutions so much as issue demands.

Again, it’s worth repeating Kendi and DiAngelo are not fringe figures — people pay thousands of dollars to attend seminars with them, their bestselling books are being assigned in schools, and corporate H.R. departments are writing diversity policies based on their work. It’s important you be aware of what they’re doing and refuse to let you, your children, or your organization be baited into one of their logical cul-de-sacs.

Sooner or later you’re going to encounter these anti-American ideas about addressing racism in your workplace, on kids’ homework, or in the faculty lounge – and you can’t be fragile when confronting it. You need to have a base of knowledge about race in America that demonstrates an understanding of the enormity of the country’s sins, as well as demonstrating you’ve made an effort to inform yourself about overcoming them. You need to understand that your opponents might be employing manipulative logic to make their arguments – arguments that are fast becoming so pervasive that many people making them might readily revise their opinions once you confront them with your concerns.

Already there are stories circulating that people have successfully challenged the woke racial thought police in the office and at professional organizations by arming themselves with some basic knowledge. But we can’t stop there.

If we inform ourselves about the real history of race in America and engage with the good-faith arguments on both sides, we might be able coalesce around solutions and come together as Americans. It won’t be easy, but if this is what it means to “do the work” rather than simply let ourselves be told what to think, the effort will be worth it.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/15/what-to-read-instead-of-white-fragility/,2020-07-15
ViacomCBS Ignored Nick Cannon Arguing For Whites' ‘Genetic Inferiority’,"Does a remark have to be uttered by a white person for it to be considered racist?

During a June 30 episode of his popular podcast “Cannon’s Class,” Nick Cannon interviewed Richard Griffin, who was known as Professor Griff while with rap group Public Enemy. After making antisemitic comments to the press, Griffin was dismissed from the band in 1989. He joined Cannon to discuss his ouster.

During their discussion, both men made antisemitic remarks. “You’re speaking facts,” Cannon said. “There’s no reason to be scared of anything when you’re speaking the truth.” He referred to Griffin as a “legend” and considered it a “shame” that Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan “had been silenced on Facebook.”

Griffin declared that the six main media outlets in the United States were “controlled by Jewish people.” Cannon equated their power to that of the Rothschilds, the wealthy Jewish banking family who are often the target of antisemitic conspiracy theories.

Cannon declared that blacks are the “true Hebrews. It’s never hate speech, you can’t be antisemitic when we are the Semitic people. When we are the same people who they want to be. That’s our birthright. We are the true Hebrews.”

A ViacomCBS spokeswoman issued the following statement to announce Cannon’s termination:

We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of his podcast ‘Cannon’s Class’ on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.

Fox News has announced that Cannon will continue as host of the network’s competition series, “The Masked Singer.” Fox issued a statement which said: “When we were made aware of Nick Cannon’s interview with Richard Griffin on YouTube, we immediately began a dialogue with Nick. He is clear and remorseful that his words were wrong and lacked both understanding and context, and inadvertently promoted hate. This was important for us to observe. Nick has sincerely apologized, and quickly taken steps to educate himself and make amends.”

Certainly, we can all understand ViacomCBS’ decision. But why does their statement exclude any mention of Cannon’s equally egregious remarks about the “genetic inferiority” of whites?

In the clip below, Cannon discusses “the power of melanated people.” White people fear black people because “of the lack that they have of it [melanin],” he says. He believes melanin gives blacks their soul and compassion. Cannon tells Griffin:

The people that don’t have it – and I’m going to say this carefully – are a little less…and, and, and…cause I’m bringing it all the way around to Minister Farrakhan, to where they may not have the compassion or the, when they were sent to the mountains of Caucasus, when they didn’t have the power of the sun, the sun then started to deteriorate them, so then they’re acting out of fear, they’re acting out of low self-esteem, they’re acting out of a deficiency. So, therefore, the only way they can act is evil…They have to rob, steal, rape, kill, fight in order to survive. So, then these people who didn’t have what we had – when I say we, I am speaking of the melanated people – they had to be savages. They had to be barbaric. They’re in these Nordic mountains, they’re in this rough terrential [sic] environment. And so, they’re acting as animals. So, they’re the ones that are actually closer to animals. They’re the ones that are actually the true savages. And then they built up such this, this – I want to say warrior – but they built up such this, this conquering barbaric mentality.

Yikes… Nick Cannon has gone full black supremacist. This is 100% certified racist. 🤦🏿‍♂️ https://t.co/rGgVATPvNk — ZUBY: (@ZubyMusic) July 14, 2020

Cannon’s comments are so blatantly racist that even rap star Zuby calls him out as the “black supremacist” that he surely is. Zuby wrote, “Yikes… Nick Cannon has gone full black supremacist. This is 100% certified racist.”

Later, Zuby tweeted a GIF of a powerful black man with the caption, “Me learning that my melanin doesn’t just protect me from sunburn, but also grants me psychic powers, heightened compassion, and a neural connection to all other melanated beings…”

We all get why Cannon’s antisemitic remarks were unacceptable, but why has he been given a pass for his truly extraordinary statements about whites? Because, as identity politics leftists everywhere will tell you, racism against white people is impossible.

In the nearly two months since former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, Black Lives Matter has promoted the narrative that white people are evil, and all is fair in the war against the white man. Cannon’s just plain stupid comments about whites being “genetically inferior” and “closer to animals” than blacks would have been front-page news if they had been uttered by a white person about blacks.

Similarly, racist comments made by non-white people have been routinely ignored by the mainstream media. The case of Sarah Jeong, a young journalist hired by The New York Times editorial board two years ago, comes to mind. The paper of record offered the following response to the internet frenzy that ensued when Jeong’s Twitter history was made public.

Our statement in response to criticism of the hiring of Sarah Jeong. pic.twitter.com/WryIgbaoqg — NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) August 2, 2018

For those few who may have missed it, here is a sampling of Jeong’s tweets:

https://twitter.com/ArminNavabi/status/1025015489729196032

In February, a black University of Virginia student stood up at the newly opened campus diversity center to announce that she was uncomfortable because there were “too many white people around her.” She told the white students, “Frankly, there’s the whole university for a lot of y’all to be at, and there’s very few spaces for us, so keep that in mind.”

Journalist Andy Ngo shares a clip of this young woman’s “PSA” in the tweet below.

Person at @UVA makes an “announcement” that she is uncomfortable that there are too many white people around her. She asks white people to go elsewhere. pic.twitter.com/jCct7n4MYL — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) February 12, 2020

In response, Spencer Brown, a spokesman for the Young America’s Foundation, rightly pointed out that “treating people differently based on the color of their skin is wrong.” Brown asked how it could be called a diversity center “when members of their community push for segregation based on skin color. The entirety of the UVA campus is open to everyone.”

Another example of this same phenomenon occurred last month when an estimated 60,000 protestors gathered in Seattle’s Judkins Park to participate in a Black Lives Matter Silent March to receive their “marching orders.” The organizers reminded everyone to respect the “line-up” they had determined in advance. This can be viewed on the group’s website.

March Order : We ask that all march participants respect the following order of procession. We want to ensure this is a Black led march, but we encourage everyone to march with their family and loved ones. Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County

Black youth

Black community

People of Color

Elected and appointed officials, political candidates

White allies

Bikes

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that the “March Order” is segregated by race: Blacks first, followed by people of color — Asian-Americans and Hispanics — and finally their “white allies.” Well, at least whites came before “bikes.”

The separation of participants by race is, well, racist. It seems to me that the organization’s objective is not equality, but superiority.

Cannon’s remarks to Griffin, Jeong’s offensive tweets about white men, the UVA student’s request that her white peers leave the Diversity Center, and the marching order for the Black Lives Matter Silent March all meet the definition of racism. Sadly, these four examples merely scratch the surface. Yet corporate media remains silent. If any of these scenarios were reversed, they would cause a white person to be fired, canceled, or even attacked.

Not only is racism against white people not impossible, it sits at the very core of America’s current cultural revolution. And we need to have a national conversation about it.

The Conversation About Black Lives Must Stop Focusing On White People,"The tragic deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd have led to riots, civil unrest, and protests against police brutality, systemic racism, white supremacy, and what many see as a disregard for black life in America. Many protesters link the deaths of Abrey, Taylor, and Floyd to past injustices, asserting that racist whites and police pose the same threat, or worse, to black Americans today.

These passionate claims have met broad agreement from leftist elected officials, media outlets, and entertainers. The ubiquity of the claims, combined with their general lack of relevant supporting evidence, highlights a distinct peculiarity within black political culture: black leaders fight harder against white supremacy than they do for black progress.

This phenomenon manifests itself in the tendency for the black leadership class to elevate the values, beliefs, and behaviors of white people above those of black people. That is why public discourse about the obstacles facing blacks in America is dominated by things white people must fix — like “systemic racism” or “unconscious bias” — rather than things black people can control, such as their culture and values. This perverse line of thinking gives the impression that black problems only matter when white people cause them, and that white thoughts are more important than black actions.

Dangerous Omissions

By and large, the more a story can be tied to systemic racism or white supremacy, the more it will be amplified in popular culture. For instance, what started as a white woman trying to harness racial stereotypes to get a black birdwatcher in trouble with the police turned into prominent people wildly overreaching and comparing the incident to Emmett Till’s murder. What followed was a predictable chorus of columns, cable news appearances, and Twitter history lessons about how white women pose a critical threat to black men.

Actual threats to black life, by contrast, attract much less national outrage. Shootings and homicides have risen dramatically this year in large urban cities across the country, yet there seems to be more concern for performative public art projects than protecting the lives of the black people being gunned down in the bloody hellhole of Brooklyn.

Probably no one epitomizes everything wrong with the black intelligentsia more perfectly than Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson. A frequent media presence on matters of race, Dyson participated in an MSNBC panel discussion that mocked people who express concern about the impact of absent fathers on young black men, going so far as accusing them of engaging what he called the “magical black father” myth.

As a social scientist, Dyson should be supremely aware of research that shows children raised by their married biological parents do better across numerous social and economic indicators than children raised in other family arrangements. Yet, for some curious reason, he never mentioned that.

Dyson’s appearance on Fox News a few years later showed what he actually believes would improve the condition of black people. He suggested white people could set up individual reparations accounts to offset the systemic injustices they believe blacks still face in America today.

These two appearances embody the essence of this destructive worldview that is rooted this odd brand of white superiority propagated by leftists — any action by whites that appears to expose or address systemic racism, regardless of how trivial, is to be prioritized over any initiative black people take to improve our own lives, regardless of how important.

Analyzing Social Problems With Objective Facts

It may be difficult to determine the exact motivations of the individuals who engage in this behavior, but its effects on the black community are clear. Rhetoric from black leaders about black Americans being hunted down because of their race is unsupported by evidence, but the vicious cycle of misinformation, hyperbole, and social media amplification increases fear, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness.

That is why it is so important to ground any analysis of social problems in objective facts. For instance, the percentage of black-on-white homicides in 2018 was twice as high as white-on-black murders, a statistic that has been consistent for decades.

It’s also easy to debunk claims that “murderous police” and mass incarceration constitute an ongoing genocide against black people. In the past five years, about 25 percent of those shot and killed by police were black, and only 2 percent were unarmed. Yet the truth distortion caused by the media gives the impression that police only shoot unarmed black men.

In reality, nearly half of the people killed by police in the last five years have been white, including whites who have died under the weight of an officer’s knee, during a no-knock warrant operation, shot in the back, shot in their doorway with their hands up, and shot after calling the police to report a crime.

The mass incarceration narrative also crumbles under any scrutiny. Contrary to popular books like The New Jim Crow and documentaries like 13th, racist drug enforcement is not what is behind the large population of black Americans behind bars. The truth is that 61 percent of black inmates in state prisons — by far the largest part of the prison system — are there for violent crimes. Drug possession accounts for just 3 percent of the black prison population, and all drug offenses account for 13 percent of the black prison population, a rate lower than white or Hispanic offenders (16 and 14 percent, respectively).

The power of the white superiority complex held by black leaders doesn’t just come from distorting racism, but also from minimizing any issue that requires self-examination and self-correction within black culture. There is no greater example of this than the reluctance of black leaders to publicly address the decades-long disappearance of the black nuclear family. We black Americans may talk about the importance of family structure amongst ourselves, but any leader who addresses it publicly — including President Obama — is denounced by leftists and accused of engaging in “respectability politics.”

Violent crime against blacks is another issue that only inspires national attention or outrage when a white perpetrator is involved. The sad truth is that, despite being 13 percent of the population, blacks make up more than half of the nation’s homicide victims each year.

Where the race of the offender is known, blacks are also the offenders in more than 90 percent of black murder cases. While intra-racial violence is the rule for every demographic group, the homicide victimization rate for blacks is six times higher than whites, a fact that explains why, at 39 percent, homicide is the leading cause of death for black males ages 15-34.

Rejecting Permanent Victimhood

The prioritization of white beliefs and values over black ones also extends into popular culture. That is why a video of two men being arrested in Starbucks for not buying anything and ill-considered ad campaigns from H&M and Gucci inspire nationwide calls for boycotts, while a hip hop icon like Snoop Dogg can be a brand ambassador even after showing up to an award show with two women on dog leashes, bragging about his time as a pimp, and referring to a veteran black female journalist as a “funky dog head b—-.”

The black intelligentsia should have forcefully denounced these behaviors. Yet degrading black women, much like when black men are killed, is only seen as a problem when white people do it.

A black leadership class that claims to care about black lives should be spending the majority of its time trying to address the issues facing the black family and working to positively shape black culture. A venerable organization like the NAACP should be using its political capital, clout, and moral force to promote the “success sequence” while imploring black artists to stop polluting black culture instead of getting white Hollywood stars to “take responsibility” for racism. Unfortunately, many of the people claiming to care about black lives will dismiss any discussion of black culture and behavior in the black community as a diversion tactic pushed by racists to perpetuate stereotypes about black pathology.

Any political philosophy that says black people are powerless victims of society’s institutions and systems who require white people to use their autonomy, agency, and privilege to uplift blacks is held down by the black intelligentsia’s unique view of white supremacy. Suggesting whites have a greater capacity for moral reasoning, emotional regulation, and reasoned decision-making than blacks is a paternalistic and infantilizing impulse that should be rejected completely.

It doesn’t matter if the people pushing it are grievance grifters targeting guilty white liberals, anointed prophets of anti-racism who promote sophomoric ideas, or people who would trade the solid substance of black self-sufficiency for the thin gruel of white benevolence. Any social, cultural, economic, or political phenomenon that affects other groups can affect black people as well.

If out-of-wedlock births, drug abuse, and violence hurt the life prospects of white people, why wouldn’t the same be true for black people? Black activists and intellectuals frequently criticize whites about their fragility and demand they confront their values and behaviors. It’s time for them to take their own advice.

The Ugly Racism Of The Associated Press Capitalizing ‘Black’,"Before racism can be fought, a goal seemingly shared by everyone, we have to share a definition of the word. As I have outlined before, there are currently two competing definitions in our society. The traditional one is held by most conservatives, and it roughly says racism is making irrational judgments about people based on their skin color. The newer progressive version focuses on systems and redistribution of wealth and power. A new decision by the Associated Press shows why this new definition veers inevitably to pure racism.

The decision in question is to capitalize “black” when it refers to a person or black culture. Curiously, or perhaps not given the nature of Critical Race Theory, the term “white” in the same context will remain lowercase. Before going any further, the allegation I am making is not one of reverse racism for not capitalizing white; it is one of racism against black people for refusing to treat them as individuals.

To that end, let’s take a look at why the AP thought black but not white required this grammatical amendment. It says, “Most notably, people who are Black have strong historical and cultural commonalities, even if they are from different parts of the world.” This is absolutely bizarre. It suggests that people with black skin in Nigeria, the Caribbean, and the United States somehow have more in common culturally than people from Ireland, Poland, and the United States. Of course, this assertion is not backed up with any real evidence because there is none.

Not only is this assertion laughable on its face, but it is also remarkably condescending to the many unique cultures of the world created by black people. For some reason, the AP thinks Irish and Italian culture stand alone, distinct enough to mean that the Irish and the Italians are not really part of a larger cultural group. But for some other reason, Jamaican and Ghanaian cultures are not distinct enough to warrant the same treatment, they just get lumped together as black.

In fact, the AP kind of gives this game away later in the guidance when it writes, “capitalizing the term white, as is done by white supremacists, risks subtly conveying legitimacy to such beliefs.” Clearly, it is insane to give white supremacists a veto on how we use language, but it also basically negates the cultural argument made above, since if that argument were true, they would not need to resort to this one.

What is happening here grammatically is that the word black is being changed from an adjective to a proper noun, while the term white is not. So when the AP refers to a “white person” they are merely noting the color of their skin, not suggesting that their skin color represents any social, cultural, or political meaning. When they now refer to a “Black person,” they are doing the opposite. They are insisting that the person’s skin color tells us important information about them culturally. That is, to put it simply, racist.

Ultimately, this Orwellian linguistic sleight of hand is about power, not giving power to black people mind you, but giving power to those who would seek to divide us by race and to pigeonhole hundreds of millions of black people with different cultures, languages, cuisines, art forms, and religions into a single group. To put it more bluntly, all black people are alike; all white people are not.

One thing that leftists who engage in this racial newspeak are doing is giving white people vastly more latitude to define themselves without appeal to their skin color. Just as Joe Biden believes that nobody who votes for Donald Trump is really black, the AP guidance insists that black people all share cultural traits and ideologies. As usual, the point here is to tell black people who they are and what they believe while leaving white people to make those decisions for themselves.

The good news is that unless you work for the AP or an outlet that adopts the guideline, you are free to ignore it, as you should. As our woke institutions attempt to shove increasingly bizarre racist rules down our throat, we are learning that we are under no obligation to swallow them.

Here at The Federalist, for example, you can trust that we will continue to treat individuals as such, regardless of their skin color. The worst thing the wokesters can do is call us racist, but if people engaged in actual, literal racism are calling you a racist for not capitalizing a letter, you can be pretty sure you are on the right side.

Black Officer Shocked At Racist Things BLM Protestors Scream At Him,"In one black Portland police officer’s frontline experience, the Black Lives Matter protests in his city are not about helping black people attain better lives. What this officer sees is privileged white kids infiltrating communities that don’t belong to them to burn stuff, break things, cause trouble, incite violence, and tell black people what they should do.

This officer, Jakhary Jackson, is a nine-year veteran of the Portland Bureau of Police. After working for Nike for 10 years, Jackson joined law enforcement to “make the most out of my life by helping others.” Both sides of his family have long Portlandian roots. Jackson works where he grew up, and his love for the people of his community is evident.

A Different Kind of Racism

During a Portland press availability, Lt. Tina Jones interviewed Jackson, simply asking him to share his experience working these protests every evening for the last few months.

I’ll say this. I got to see folks that really do want change like the rest of us, that have been impacted by racism. And then I got to see those people get faded out by people who have no idea what racism is all about, that have never experienced racism, that don’t even know that the tactics they are using are the same tactics that were used against my people.

Jackson tells of a young black woman asking him one evening, while he held the line with protesters, why he wouldn’t talk with her and her friends, why he wouldn’t engage them. He explains that young black people often ask him what he thinks of all the unrest. They want to know what he thinks about the injustice, about George Floyd’s death, about the pain resulting from killings of black men.

It isn’t Jackson’s superiors who demand he not speak, it’s the young white protestors — nearly every night. Jackson explains that when “a brother or sister” approaches him, wanting his perspective on things, white protesters jump in like clockwork to tell the inquirer, “F-ck the police. Don’t talk to him.”

“That was the most bizarre thing,” Jackson says, wincing as he tells the story. “Honestly, every time I try to have a conversation with someone that looks like me, someone white comes up and blocks them and tells them not to talk.” Jackson says the very moment he was explaining this to a young black female, “this white girl pops right in front of her” and told her not to speak.

“He just said that was gonna happen!” the black girl said, stunned, is if Jackson were a fortune teller. She looked at the white girl and said, “Why did you do you that?”

Jackson continues, relaying his conversation with the girl, who interrupted: “Then I said, straight up, ‘I’ve been called the N-word. She’s been called the N-word. Why are you talking to me this way? Why do you feel she can’t speak for herself? Why do you feel you need to speak for her when we’re having a conversation?’”

“She couldn’t answer my question,” Jackson says. “All she said was, ‘Someone told me to do it.’”

A Profile of Portland Protesters

When asked about what he and fellow black officers have been subjected to by protesters who are supposedly fighting for racial justice, Jackson tells of protesters regularly threatening his life. He’s taken multiple incoming explosives thrown by rioters, some very powerful with marbles and rocks taped to them, intended to inflict maximum and sustained damage. He saved a female officer from being hit in the head with a massive projectile that he said would certainly have killed her had he not been present.

But to Jackson and his black peers, the most painful thing is white protesters’ words. “It says something when you are at a Black Lives Matter protest, and you have more minorities on the police side than you have in a violent crowd,” Jackson says. “And you have white people screaming at black officers, ‘You have the biggest nose I’ve ever seen.’”

Jackson says he is totally “cool” with people wanting to join efforts to achieve social change. What he’s seen at the Black Lives Matter events, however, “has been very strange to watch” precisely because, as he explains, so-called anti-racism tactics have come full circle: White protesters are telling black people what is best for them. Worse, these white kids are destroying black neighborhoods while they do it.

The first images Jackson saw from the protests were white people, who Jackson says are “not even from here,” burning and looting black businesses. “They don’t even know what they’re doing,” he adds. “So that to me was very angering.”

“The community is not happy with it,” he says. “They asked for the violence to stop.” Jackson tells of his cousin who had attended a Black Lives Matter event but soon left dismayed at the violence perpetrated by white rioters, saying, “This has turned into something else. This is weird.”

Jackson tells another story of a pair of young brothers he met while they were cleaning up the street after the protesters had cleared out. Jackson and a few of his fellow offers went over to shake the boys’ hands, impressed at their efforts to restore the city. “You know,” the boys told the officers, according to Jackson, “We’re from here. This is our city. I don’t understand why people are coming here and destroying it. We want to clean it up.”

An Officer’s Reality

Jackson explains how strange it is for angry white youths to come to his community, claiming they want to help, but telling him to quit his job without knowing anything about him.

Once again, you have a privileged white person telling someone of color what to do with their life. And you don’t even know what I’ve dealt with, what these white officers you’re screaming at have dealt with. You don’t know them. You don’t know anything about them.

Jackson tells how he watches his fellow officers serve the community year after year, risking their lives each day. They do whatever it takes to care for those who have been shot, not afraid to get blood on them. He knows these officers do what they do because they care deeply about all the lives in their community, regardless of skin color.

“You see [the officers], and they are truly trying to help save someone’s life, and then are called racist by people who have never seen anything like that, who have never had to put themselves out there like that. It’s really—” Jackson takes a long pause. “It’s disgusting.”

How To Disprove The 6 Most Outrageous Myths In The 1619 Project,"Nikole-Hannah Jones, the famed conceptualizer of The New York Times’s 1619 Project, is one of the most protected and vaunted leftist personalities in America today. Such is the fascination with her venture that Oprah Winfrey plans to turn her ideas into a series of films and televised programs.

Telling the story of the American people is always a laudable goal. But we must counter attempts to indoctrinate citizens into believing that America is a distinctly callous nation.

The 1619 Project’s fabrications commit a horrific injustice on American history. The project perpetuates dangerous myths about the country’s founding, and by painting its roots as structurally racist and oppressive, it stokes racial tensions.

Yet despite the project’s myriad erroneous claims, they have been widely accepted and even celebrated. This must be countered. So, here are some of the most egregious myths this project foists on the country, along with corrections.

Myth 1: The Revolution Was Fought to Uphold Slavery

On the contrary, objections to slavery featured prominently in colonial America. James Otis, a leading critic of British rule, wrote, “The Colonists are by the law of nature free born, as indeed all men are, white or black.”

Quite early in colonial America, the congregation of Quakers in Germantown, Pennsylvania produced a 1688 document explicitly condemning slavery. By the end of the American Revolution, many Quakers were no longer slave owners. According to William M. Wiecek, an emeritus professor of history and law at Syracuse University, anti-slavery attitudes were prevalent throughout the Revolutionary Era:

Samuel Hopkins in the leading anti-slavery tract of the Revolution, ‘A Dialogue concerning the Slavery of Africans (1776),’ summed up the argument to date and anticipated later themes of American abolition when he equated the moral evils of slavery itself with that of the slave trade…and called on the Continental Congress to abolish slavery throughout the United States.

Furthermore, Historian Leslie Harris strongly rejects the assertion that the revolution was launched to defend slavery. Indeed, he argues it was the opposite:

Far from being fought to preserve slavery, the Revolutionary War became a primary disrupter of slavery in the North American Colonies. Lord Dunmore’s Proclamation, a British military strategy designed to unsettle the Southern Colonies by inviting enslaved people to flee to British lines, propelled hundreds of enslaved people off plantations and turned some Southerners to the patriot side. It also led most of the 13 Colonies to arm and employ free and enslaved black people, with the promise of freedom to those who served in their armies. While neither side fully kept its promises, thousands of enslaved people were freed as a result of these policies.

Myth 2: Slavery Made America Rich

Economist Deirdre McCloskey has convincingly explained that it isn’t slavery that explains modern American economic growth rates, but innovation. Modern research has also corroborated Southern intellectual Hinton Rowan Helper’s criticisms of slavery for halting progress by delaying economic development and industrialization in the South.

Scholar David Meyer debunks the notion that slavery is compatible with civilizational progress:

Although the South had prosperous farms, it had failed to build a deep and broad industrial infrastructure before 1860, because much of its economy rested on a slave agricultural system. In this economy, investments were heavily concentrated in slaves rather than in urban and industrial infrastructure. Local and regional demand remained low across much of the South because slaves were not able to freely express their consumption demands and population densities remained low, except in a few agricultural areas.

Similarly, economist Nathan Nunn has demonstrated that across states and counties within America, there is a direct relationship between past slave use and current income, with areas that engaged in slavery worse off in the aggregate.

Contrary to The 1619 Project, cotton production fueled by slave labor also does not explain America’s prosperity. Consider the shrewd rebuttal by Alan Olmstead and Paul Rhodes in the journal Explorations in Economic History:

Cotton exports were a very small share of the national product – less than 5 percent over much of the antebellum period. More than this cotton was not even the nation’s most important agricultural commodity in terms of value. That distinction belonged to corn. The national values of the small grains (taken together) and of hay also were typically higher than that of cotton.

Likewise, we often forget that slavery kept slaves from commercializing their inventions. Black inventors were prevented from patenting their ideas, thereby discouraging innovation and depriving society of the rewards of human ingenuity. Without the racist policies of slavery, America would be far richer.

Myth 3: All White Americans Benefited Equally from Slavery

Less than 25 percent of Southerners owned slaves, with the majority possessing fewer than five. In the North, slaves represented barely more than 5 percent of the population. Asserting that slavery generated gains for all whites is demonstrably false. Historian Keri Leigh Merritt presents a clearer picture in the book Masterless Men: Poor Whites and Slavery in the Antebellum South:

In the slave society, where laborers competed with brutalized, enslaved labor, the laborers, whether legally free or not, had little to no control over their labor power. The profusion of plantation slave labor consistently reduced the demand for free workers, lowered their wages, and rendered their bargaining power ineffective…they were not truly free laborers, especially when they could be arrested and forced to labor for the state or for individuals.

The prominence of slavery in the South was often leveraged by planters to accumulate benefits at society’s expense, thus making slavery a form of rent-seeking. Vincent Geloso aptly explains how slavery always imposes a cost on ordinary citizens and makes the communities that tolerate it poorer:

Slaveowners need to police their slaves who might run away if the option presents itself. Policing slaves is not inexpensive, and the costs reduce the returns from owning said slaves. However, slaveowners have largely concentrated interests, which is a strong incentive for them to organize. If they organize successfully, they can convince the state to spread the cost of policing onto the broader population…And this does not include the deadweight loss or reallocating workers to tracking down slaves.

Myth 4: Slavery Is a Uniquely American Sin

The Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Africans all pioneered slavery long before Americans participated in it. Arabs enslaved Africans and southeastern Europeans for centuries. Numerous Europeans were captured and enslaved, especially during the apex of the Barbary slave trade. As Murray Gordon notes:

It was not uncommon to find in Africa slaves who were considered as mere chattel and treated as such. European travelers who went to Africa in growing numbers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries reported witnessing or hearing about cruel and inhumane practices that were commonly inflicted on slaves by their owners. In the non-Muslim parts of Africa, there was a widespread custom of burying one or two young slaves with the body of a chief who had died.

Myth 5: African Americans Fought Racism on Their Own

Innumerable white Americans were partners with black Americans in the war to topple slavery and, later, end Jim Crow and protect equal rights for all Americans. In the 18th century, for example, Dr. Benjamin Rush emerged as a forceful critic of slavery. His opinions had a major influence on the Pennsylvania Assembly’s decision to abolish the slave trade in that colony.

We should not forget the story of Joshua Glover, who was freed by scores of white Americans in 1854 after his former owner Bennami Garland captured him from his Wisconsin home. Neither should we dismiss the role of white Americans such as Mary White Ovington and William English Walling in establishing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Even ordinary white citizens were active in the movement to dismantle segregation.

Today, most Caucasian Americans favor initiatives to assist African Americans. For example, leading companies have pledged to eliminate racial inequalities in America. The effort that began with white Americans helping blacks end slavery continues today with the millions of non-black Americans engaged in support of anti-racism efforts.

Myth 6: Systemic Racism Keeps Black Americans Down

From 1997 to 2016, businesses owned by black American women grew at the incredible rate of 518 percent. The economic prospects of black American men are also quite positive. Economist Robert Cherry found the employment rate of black men between the ages of 20-24 surged from 46.9 percent in 2010 to 60.2 percent in 2017.

Academically, black Americans have realized tremendous gains, with more than 4 million of them holding a four-year college degree. Research further suggests that blacks with a doctorate out-earn similarly educated Caucasians.

Highlighting disparities between blacks and whites is not suggestive of systemic racism. Inter-group disparities are ubiquitous and are attributed to a coterie of factors. Intriguingly, psychologists argue that “the leadership attainment gap between East Asians and South Asians was consistently explained by cultural differences in assertiveness, but not prejudice.”

The mantra of systemic racism is invoked to create enmity between blacks and whites. Indeed, leftist activists rarely refer to inequalities among black Americans or publicly ponder how the median annual income of Asian American adults is higher than that of their white contemporaries if the United States is a white supremacist society. So no, despite the rantings of leftists, there is little to indicate that America is suffering from systemic racism.

Radical leftists are rewriting American history to promote a nefarious brand of race-based politics. Americans must not sit and be entertained by malevolent actors destroying our republic. Instead, such efforts must be resisted by citizens interested in preserving the rich culture and heritage of this great country.

"Corporate Media Is Ignoring Riots, But Americans Hurt By Them Aren't","We are now approaching the two-month mark since the riots that erupted across the United States in late May and early June. There is a reasonable argument to be made that these riots were unprecedented in U.S. history — or at the very least, since the 1960s. Yet if one surveyed the national media today, you’d barely even know anything happened. Nor would you likely be aware that those who bore the brunt of the destruction — largely minorities whose sensibilities don’t fit into any neatly-delineated ideological category — are still acutely suffering from the fallout.

Yes, civil unrest has of course occurred before. But the riots of 2020 exhibited features which belie any easy historical parallel. For one thing, consider their enormous geographic scope.

While the most extreme riots in cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and particularly Minneapolis did receive considerable attention — however fleeting, incomplete, and unnecessarily inflected with knee-jerk partisanship — there were also smaller-scale riots in surprisingly far-flung places that you hardly would’ve known about unless you lived in the area, happened to visit, or intentionally sought out what remains of the bare-bones local media coverage.

To take just a small sampling: Atlantic City, NJ, Fort Wayne, IN, Green Bay, WI, and Olympia, WA all underwent significant riots, at least per the normal expectations of life in these relatively low-key cities. Did you hear anything about them? Because I hadn’t, and I’m abnormally attuned to daily media coverage. Only because I personally visited did I learn of the damage.

These riots exploded with such intensity, across so many jurisdictions, and within such a contained period of time — roughly speaking, a one-week stretch beginning May 28, the day the chaos in Minneapolis/St. Paul reached a grisly apex — that no other instance of past civil unrest seems quite analogous. Complicating matters is that the riots occurred in tandem with a protest movement now believed to be the largest ever in U.S. history — one which saw demonstrations, vigils, and general rancor extend even into the most unassuming expanses of suburban and rural America.

This Is a Lot Bigger than the Media Is Letting On

On some level, you can understand why the ramifications of all this are still yet to be fully processed. The sheer volume of information is overwhelming, for one thing. And coupled with a worsening pandemic, along with the daily antics of Donald Trump, sustaining national attention on any given topic might be impossible.

But it’s also clear that the severe ramifications of these riots have been widely ignored — if not consciously obfuscated — by a media class that was near-unanimous in its approval of the accompanying protest movement. That they could have so quickly “moved on,” particularly from the wreckage of Minneapolis/St. Paul — where residents commonly told me that their lives are still in “agony” — is galling.

It doesn’t take some kind of profound journalistic acuity to walk around riot-affected areas, talk to citizens, record their stories and impressions, take some photos and record some video, and compose some tweets. And yet, I heard from hundreds of people across the United States and world who were shocked that they’d have never been aware of what happened in Minneapolis/St. Paul if not for my dinky little Twitter thread.

When I visited a month after the peak of the riots, much of this major American metropolis still lay in ruins. Not that normal life hadn’t mostly resumed; it had. But it’s resumed in the way that war-torn areas configure some ad hoc routine that enables the resumption of semi-normal activity amidst the rubble and despair.

Nobody Amplifying These Underrepresented Voices

In speaking with locals, many of whom have lost their livelihoods or had to plead for their children not to be burned alive, it often seems like the extent of the ruination they’ve experienced was barely ever appreciated in the first place. There are several potential explanations for why.

The media, in its characteristic insularity and myopia, has instead chosen to pathologically fixate on a constant stream of Culture War inanities that stem loosely from this ongoing “movement” — such as the propriety of various statues and monuments, whether various food brands and sports teams are racist, and whether various micro-celebrities need to be “canceled” for some imagined transgression. They are also beset by the various hyper-moralizing staff revolts within their own elite institutions, leading them to adopt an inordinately “inward” editorial disposition on account of their own neurotic personnel issues. Under these narcissistic conditions, real-world human suffering becomes less of a pressing concern. Journalists, editors, and pundits believe — either consciously or subconsciously, probably some half-scandalous combination of the two — that highlighting the harmful after-effects of these historic nationwide riots would somehow redound to the political benefit of Trump, which to them would be the most disastrous outcome of all. This probably isn’t even correct — Trump is currently seizing every opportunity to shoot himself in the foot all on his own — but the media class is nonetheless mortified to even contemplate the possibility that anything they might do could conceivably “help” him. These same media class members are themselves deeply invested in what they regard as “the movement,” however diffuse and ill-defined this “movement” may be, and they are extremely reluctant to produce any coverage which might reflect poorly on said “movement” and potentially undermine its moral and political legitimacy.

I don’t claim to have a complete answer for what explains this dynamic. But what I can do is simply share some of my observations and encounters. Then you can decide for yourself whether there’s been a conspicuous paucity of coverage — and if, say, a “national conversation” is warranted.

Let’s Look at America Outside the News

Numerous establishments were boarded up in Atlantic City, NJ in June. Just off the boardwalk, an Arab grocery store owner told me about how his storefront window was smashed by a rioter wielding a baseball bat as he was working. The riots came just as much of the city was preparing to partially re-open from COVID for the summer beach season.

Fort Wayne, IN doesn’t immediately come to mind as a likely candidate for a riot location, but one nonetheless took place. A coffee shop employee told me that their window was smashed by white kids with skateboards. As in many other places, the resulting plywood has served as a canvas for a city-sanctioned communal art project.

Similarly in Green Bay, WI, residents could not recall anything even approaching a riot ever occurring before. Here, the manager of a small tobacco and convenience shop displays photos of the damage taken for insurance purposes. Nearby, the windows of a Post Office were smashed.

A music shop owner in Olympia, WA told me that while his window was smashed, he also felt moved to put up the plywood boards “in solidarity” with the “movement,” to again provide protesters with a canvas for their art projects.

So many of the people I’ve encountered across the country were perfectly happy to talk about their experiences in the last two months, although many did not want to go on-record for understandable reasons. Still, there would be plenty of fodder here for heartfelt retrospective specials on CNN or in the New York Times magazine about the impact of these historic riots — and yet no such coverage has been forthcoming. It’s quite a puzzle.

“You think you’re getting justice, but you’re just tearing up your own community,” a black woman in her 40s who runs a bakery in a predominantly black part of Milwaukee — in which significant, but conspicuously undercovered riots took place — told me. She added that she would be livid if she found out that her daughter in her early 20s ever participated in such activities, and was generally condemnatory of those responsible for causing the chaos. (Many people online have made it clear that they don’t believe me, but I swear I have not “cherry-picked” any of these interviewees.)

Of the dozens and dozens of randomly-selected black Americans that I have so far spoken to across the United States, only two expressed what one might call a “positive” view of the riots, and they were both young men. Everyone else I have encountered is unabashedly scornful of rioting, and many even express apprehensions about the basic logic of a movement referred to as “Black Lives Matter” which incongruously appears to them to have caused increased suffering in their predominantly black neighborhoods.

Here’s an interview I conducted on video with a black man, Tony in Milwaukee, who describes what it was like to escape from a riotous mob on his way home from work. “It’s crazy man. I really don’t understand it. Cuz they sayin’ Black Lives Matter and all this stuff,” he said. “But man, you’re hurting the black community.”

He, like many others in various places where riots occurred, also expressed confusion about why the wrongful police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis should have necessitated random destruction in their own city — hundreds of miles away — with its own set of localized concerns that don’t necessarily have anything in common with Minneapolis. Here’s a black resident articulating the same sentiment in Philadelphia, and another in The Bronx, both places which underwent major rioting.)

Seldom acknowledged is that a large segment of black residents in urban areas over a certain age — and particularly recent immigrants from the Caribbean and Africa — are more-or-less small “c” conservative in their social and political attitudes. In general, they are far more outwardly repulsed by riots that ravaged their neighborhoods than the activist media liberals and leftists who so eagerly imbued these riots with some kind of coherent, obviously virtuous political meaning — a meaning that was evidently not apparent to many of the people who actually live in the affected areas.

It should be noted that this “small c” conservative reaction by local minority populations doesn’t in any way mean that they would be motivated to support the Republican Party or Donald Trump — as Trump is also widely seen as an agent of chaos in his own right, who exacerbates Culture War animosities rather than alleviates them.

But their baseline aversion toward Trump doesn’t negate that their sentiments diverge extremely sharply from self-appointed left/liberal journalists and activists who often claim to speak on their behalf. (For example, they were almost uniformly supportive of the deployment of National Guard to quell the chaos — unlike journalists and activists, who tend to portray the deployment of military forces to urban areas as an unambiguous sign of fascist terror.)

In Chicago, as with many other cities, small businesses now display signs declaring themselves “Black-owned” or “minority owned” — partially as an expression of pride, but mostly to dissuade further rioting:

Residents of Chicago’s predominantly black South and West sides remarked that the looting appeared to begin at apparel stores like Foot Locker, and then branched out from there. Here’s how one man described the progression.

Opportunistic “looting” should generally be distinguished from the more ideologically-motivated “rioting,” as those who “looted” were generally locals (mostly but not exclusively blacks) who simply took advantage of an unprecedentedly chaotic situation to seize goods. Whereas “riots” motivated by consciously insurrectionist ideology — consisting of arson attacks and other actions intended to maximize chaos — appear to have been largely instigated by left-wing activist whites. You could possibly group both activities under the banner of “rioting,” but it’s worth drawing a distinction between these two different kinds of conduct which arise in a riot context.

Such was the enormity of the scale of the riots all manner of drastic local measures were enacted to preempt or curtail the chaos, many of which received next-to-no attention from national media on account of their preoccupation with other things. In Hammond, IN, which sits on the state border with Illinois, the Democratic mayor went so far as to order large concrete blocks erected in the middle of a public roadway to block off unwanted incoming rioter traffic.

During a recent stop there, I heard locals muse with half-formed rumors about business owners having taken matters into their own hands and heading to the rooftops of their buildings — with rifles in tow — to fend off potential looters. Often, such rumors cannot be verified, and the rumors themselves serve a kind of psychologically-gratifying purpose for those who spread them, as they allow bystanders to construct their own self-affirming narratives out of the chaos.

But everywhere I have gone over the past two months, if there was a hint of unwieldy protest or riot activity, places are awash with rumors. This, along with the pandemic, is clearly the preeminent political issue of Summer 2020 — as opposed to the presidential campaign, which is almost like an afterthought. Joe Biden? Meh. (Although this dynamic seems to be working pretty well for Biden.)

Maybe the media commentators who reflexively glamorized these riots don’t know or don’t care, but the primary victims — meaning those who feared for their safety, suffered severe material losses, and whose lives were upended — are themselves minorities, and were targeted by activist whites.

A deli operated by a Somali man in Minneapolis remained fully boarded up with bullet holes still visible in the partially shattered windows — caused by shots fired from an armed private security force that was summoned to protect businesses during the peak of the riots. (Residents recall with astonishment that Minneapolis Police were essentially nowhere to be found as the destruction unfolded.)

According to this man, who like many others did not want to be formally interviewed, the majority of those who wreaked havoc on his establishment were white. Note that scrawled onto the plywood boarding up the Somali man’s shop is the classic anarchist “A” symbol, popular among white left-wing activists.

Needless to say, with virtually his entire neighborhood boarded up, the street in tatters, and the front entrance to his deli shuttered — one has to go through a semi-hidden backdoor in order to gain entry — business is substantially down.

One of the Somali grocer’s neighbors is a Mexican convenience store owner. He said looters broke in and stole a significant amount of items. Here are the safety precautions he took:

Elsewhere in Minneapolis, a Lao-American community center, having already drastically reduced its operations due to COVID, is boarded up and closed off with yellow police tape:

Minneapolis/St. Paul has a large population of Hmong people. Several suffered inordinately due to the riots. In a recent Wall Street Journal column, I relayed my interactions with a man named Long Her, who’s operated a clothing store in St. Paul for nearly 30 years. In that time, he told me proudly, he never once had to call the police. That changed in late May after the George Floyd killing, when much of his prized inventory was ransacked. (Although the police have been no help.)

At the time we spoke, he didn’t know what insurance would cover. He was also advised by a repair company not to get his exterior door replaced yet, because there could be additional riots throughout the summer. Many small business owners in the area reported a major delay in their orders to get windows fixed, due to a massive backlog. (Mr. Her said his security footage revealed the intruders to be a white woman and a black man.) Here’s his tabulated losses, which he said are a low-ball estimate because they don’t include potential profits from the sale of various clothing items:

Across the street from that Lao community center is a pizza shop at which the majority of the workers are Hispanics. One worker said they’d been told by an ad-hoc activist group to proclaim themselves “black owned” (the owner is, in fact, black) so that people don’t get the wrong impression when they see mostly Hispanics working there.

The shell of what was once an auto repair shop operated by an Ethiopian immigrant still sits burned out and destroyed, leaving the man out of work potentially for months, he said. The man, who like many others did not want to conduct a formal interview, remarked that he now has nothing to do all day. His tools and equipment were also destroyed.

A small Mexican restaurant near the epicenter of the riots in Minneapolis had been forced to close for the first time in 25 years, a worker said — they hadn’t even closed for COVID. When I visited, they’d only recently re-opened — but business was steeply down, as far fewer potential customers are willing to enter the area, which is still strewn with rubble and debris.

The area surrounding the restaurant:

An open question is who initiated the arson attacks in Minneapolis. According to multiple accounts relayed to me, those who instigated these most extreme acts of destruction appeared to be white left-wing activists who were not from the area. This then consumed municipal resources and created a vacuum that enabled a portion of the local, largely black and minority populations to engage in opportunistic looting — hence the distinction I mentioned earlier.

Here’s an account from a young man, Matthew, who took part in the riot at the Third Police Precinct building, which was the Ground Zero for rioting in Minneapolis. Among other observations, he remarks that those who carried out the arson attacks were exclusively white — at least according to his own first-hand observations — and at certain points, says he witnessed non-white business owners warding off white rioters.

Here’s an anarchist “A” scrawled on the burned-out shell of a liquor store across the street from the Police Precinct building. (Taken from a video “tour” I conducted of the Lake Street area.)

The liquor store viewed from the front:

Flora Westbrooks, who I also interviewed for the Wall Street Journal, told me she was convinced that those who burned down the hair salon she’d operated since 1986 couldn’t possibly have been locals because of her reputation in the community.

The former site of Ms. Westbrooks’ salon, which was connected to an Arab-owned cafe.

This structure was formerly an Indian restaurant, among other things.

Does the ubiquity of these types of signs, in which owners declare their ethnic or racial status, seem healthy to you?

A low-income housing project that had been under construction, now effectively destroyed:

One of the early promoters of the former “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone” (CHAZ) in Seattle had triumphantly used an image of the building set ablaze in the person’s Twitter bio:

(I would encourage you to view my full Twitter thread from Minneapolis if you haven’t seen it.)

One of the few booming industries in Minneapolis appears to be heavy-duty disaster-relief workers and construction contractors sifting through wreckage. (See my video tour of Lake Street area for footage of this.) While many of the establishments owned by large corporate chains have begun the recovery process, smaller establishments have not.

(In that video, a local resident, Rick, recalls being told during the riots that there would be no fire or police service available and people needed to fend for themselves. Because the winds were high on the night of the extreme arson attacks, flaming insulation was landing on residential houses, and so he had to fill up barrels of water just in case.)

The status of laundry services in North Minneapolis:

The George Floyd death site was blocked off to traffic and turned into a public memorial zone as of the time of my visit. Police generally do not enter this area, activists say, as it has been declared a “holy ground.” The day I visited, people had traveled there from as far as Florida and Texas.

Prayer circle that I took part in at the George Floyd death site:

Various places in St. Paul:

A school:

I’ll close with this. (Believe me, there’s plenty more. The amount of information and photos is overwhelming.) The owner of a convenience store in North Minneapolis told me he had to take up arms during the peak of the riots to protect his establishment. Here’s the exterior of the store:

The man, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, said the following: “I grew up in a war zone, and I’ve never seen anything like it.” What does it say that these kinds of experiences have barely impinged on the national consciousness?

Despite the incredible amount of destruction that I’ve personally witnessed, it’s only a tiny fraction. If I hadn’t made a point to spend six weeks traveling around the country, I never would’ve gotten this information.

Is a “national conversation” warranted here? I don’t know. That’s a ridiculous cliche, anyway. But I do know the enormity of what transpired over these past two months has not been adequately conveyed.

"NFL To Transform Fields, Player Helmets Into Black Lives Matter Billboards","The NFL will display the slogans “End Racism” and “It Takes All of Us” in all teams’ end zones during their opening games this season. Despite previous rules against decorations on helmets, the league will also now allow players to display the names or initials of “victims of racism.”

“The NFL informed clubs today of plans to amplify its social justice initiatives, including helmet decals and signage in end zones for kickoff games and club home openers,” tweeted NFL reporter Tom Pelissero.

The announcement comes as the NFL continues to promote itself as a platform for “social justice initiatives” such as playing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a spiritual sometimes called the black national anthem, at every first game of the season. The league also continues to promote its “Inspire Change” campaign designed to “support programs and initiatives that reduce barriers to opportunity” in “education and economic advancement, police and community relations, and criminal justice reform.”

“As we continue to amplify and elevate the NFL’s ongoing and long-term commitment to social justice, we will be incorporating several prominent elements on the field, into all broadcasts and across league and club platforms to begin the NFL season and beyond,” read the memo. “In developing these concepts, we have worked directly with players and received input from the NFLPA.”

Commissioner Roger Goodell previously expressed his desire for the NFL to “improve and go forward for a better and more united NFL family” in June.

“We, the National Football League condemn racism and the systematic oppression of black people. We the National Football League admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest. We the National Football League believe black lives matter,” he said in a video posted to the official NFL Twitter.

The NFL joins the ranks of professional sports leagues caving to mob pressure and promoting far-left political campaigns. Just last month, the NBA announced its decision to paint “Black Lives Matter” on the sidelines of its courts “in all three arenas the league will use at the Walt Disney World Resort.” Black Lives Matter as an organization is openly linked with anti-American, Marxist ideology and organizations and has openly declared its desire to destroy the idea of family as well as ruining local police.

While the NBA continues to promote Black Lives Matter, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban still refuses to condemn China’s “communist takeover of Hong Kong” and official NBA custom jerseys are banned from displaying “FreeHongKong.” China currently holds untold thousands of minority citizens in concentration camps.

4 French Revolution Trends That Have Started In The United States,"Many recently celebrated Bastille Day, the day French radical revolutionaries stormed a prison, released its prisoners, and brutally murdered the warden. That fateful day, now more than 200 years ago, set in motion a revolution that led to bloodshed and a devastating loss of liberty in France. It also set the precedent for many future revolutions that took an unbelievable toll on human life.

Contemporary British politician Edmund Burke lamented that French Revolutionaries could have repaired the walls of their government and society instead of tearing them down. In an attempt to found an egalitarian utopia, the French Revolutionaries tore down almost everything that was traditionally French. An eerily similar purge is taking place in America.

To found their society anew, the French Revolutionaries created a new education system, a new calendar, a new system of measurement, and a series of new public symbols and festivals. Most forebodingly, they did their best to cleanse France of religion in all of its forms, opting instead to pay homage to the god of Reason.

1. Taking Control of the Calendar and Holidays

The new “French Calendar” the Revolutionaries used in place of old the Gregorian calendar deliberately left out the Sabbath as well as religious holidays. In a preview of the self-centered nature of modern radical leftists, the French Calendar reset French history to the start of the Revolution — essentially labeling it “Year One.” Today, The New York Times’s 1619 Project attempts to do the same historical trick in rebooting America’s “true founding” to the date the first black slaves arrived in Virginia.

Now, there are calls to cancel Independence Day, change the name of Thanksgiving to “Thanks-taking,” and eliminate Columbus Day. Presidents Day, which is George Washington’s birthday, may also be on life-support, considering the Berkeley Unified School District announced that it will rename schools named after George Washington and Thomas Jefferson because the two former presidents owned slaves. But don’t worry, new holidays such as “Non-Binary Day“ are being ginned up, and Google Calendar now warns us when Black History Month and Women’s History Month begin.

Leftist cancellations haven’t stopped at renaming institutions and holidays, but have also aimed at brand names, theme park rides, classic movies, television shows, and even innocuous titles like “master bedroom.” Recently there was a boycott against Goya foods because its CEO praised President Trump.

2. Tearing Down Statues

All across the country statues of American historical figures have lost their heads. In Boston, a statue of Christopher Columbus was beheaded, as were four Confederate statues in Portsmouth Virginia. A George Washington statue in Washington Park was vandalized and a white hood was placed on his head. Another George Washington statue in Portland, Oregon was toppled with a burning American flag draped over it.

Statue toppling is only the most visible sign of the cultural genocide that has been taking place for decades. Since the 1960s more Americans have rejected our founding principles and replaced them with radical utopian abstractions.

Instead of celebrating a nation built on equality, freedom, self-government, and a limited constitutional government, those on the left have taught an alternative history. In their telling, America has been racist from the start. The insinuation is that since racism is in America’s very DNA, there is no cure. Thus, the need for a new founding based on enigmatic utopian ideals.

3. Seizing Language and Education

It’s a dark omen when language itself starts to be canceled. Classic children’s books are being banned because some on the left don’t like their language. The North American Scrabble Players Association has recently announced it is canceling certain offensive words from the game.

People may not be burning books, but the National Public Radio station has exhorted Americans to “decolonize” their bookshelves. Truly, the current neo-Marxist movement enveloping the nation has done more to attack and stifle freedom of speech than Joseph McCarthy ever did in the height of the Red Scare of the 1950s.

More and more, our public schools are ceasing to be places of genuine learning but are quickly becoming boot camps in activism. Instead of being taught civics, children are learning about “antiracism,” “white privilege,” and political agitation. Likewise, French Revolutionaries took control of schooling and replaced it with their own.

Recently, New York City schools sent out a letter affirming the existence of systemic racism and assuring parents the school district will work to “dismantle institutional racism.” The email goes on to recommend resources that teach children police are targeting nonwhite people and that there is systemic racial bias in education, media, employment government, and the criminal justice system.

A large school district in North Carolina created a website that provides “racial equity” resources for teachers and parents. The site instructs those wishing to be racially affirming allies to first do so by recognizing privilege and how to utilize social capital to promote equity and social justice.

Finally, and most disturbingly, material for the 1619 Project is being taught in at least 3,500 schools nationwide, teaching children America’s founding ideals were a lie when they were written and the United States has never recovered from slavery and racism.

4. Violent Hostility Towards Religion

To say the French Revolution was hostile towards religion is an understatement. Church property was nationalized, tithing was outlawed, church authorities were made employees of the state, and 30,000 priests were exiled. To confuse Christians so they wouldn’t be able to figure out which day was Sunday, a new ten-day week was implemented. In what became known as the September Massacres, three bishops and more than 200 priests were murdered by mobs.

Traditional religion in the United States has also come under attack by the modern radical left. And, while things haven’t yet got to the level of the French Revolution, the current anti-Christian climate does not bode well for the future. During the first weeks of the riots, for example, St. John’s Church, a historic house of worship near the White House, was set on fire. The media erupted in anger when police cleared the streets in front of the church so President Trump could pose in front of it holding a Bible.

In response, the D.C. mayor renamed the area “Black Lives Matter Plaza” and painted the slogan over the road. The area has become a hub for Black Lives Matter activists. There also have been repeated attempts to establish a “Black House Autonomous Zone” in the area. The area has developed its own religious feel, with multiple murals and tributes to George Floyd and others considered martyrs by the group.

Suffering the same fate as many of America’s founders and heroes, religious statues have been torn down as well. Black Lives Matter commentator Shaun King has stated depicting Jesus Christ as a white man is evidence of white supremacy. Churches have been vandalized, a Florida man drove his vehicle into a church, a statue of the Virgin Mary was torched in Boston, and at a Tennessee parish, a statue of Mary was beheaded. Because their pastor spoke out against the rioting in the streets, churchgoers in Troy, New York were verbally harassed by Black Lives Matter protestors as they entered Grace Baptist Church.

We’re Not Down the Drain Yet

In the meantime, despite facing the threat of physical violence, some brave Americans continue to stand up against this neo-Marxist cultural revolution. In Washington D.C., when protestors wanted to tear down the Emancipation Statue, elder black activists showed up to protect it. They stood against the screaming hordes, representing a former generation, one ruled by reason and wisdom instead of rage.

In Ventura, California, a small group of brave Catholics stood against a mob to protect a statue of Saint Junipero Serra. As the small band surrounded the statue, they were surrounded by more than 200 protestors intent on tearing the statue down. The protectors stood strong, prayed the rosary amid taunts, threats, and even acts of violence. When one protestor riled the crowd into a frenzy and led a rush on the statue, Serra’s defenders closed ranks around the pedestal and defended it.

In another instance of bravery, when every player from the Giants and Dodgers knelt before the National Anthem to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement before playing their first game of the season, one player decided to stand. San Francisco Giants pitcher Sam Coonrod refused to kneel because of his faith and because he knows what the Black Lives Matter movement truly represents.

This one player who decided to stand is the one we should focus on, and is the sort of citizen we should praise. His courage and strength show that remnants of an old American spirit still exist, and that hope remains for our great republic.

Americans recklessly wishing to continue following in the footsteps of France should remember Burke’s caution that the abolition of all history and tradition is a recipe for disaster. Future generations will understand what our nation eventually decides to honor by what statues replace the many that have been torn down.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn Shares Guide To Defeating ‘Cancel-Culture Mob’,"Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) leaned into the culture war Tuesday morning when she published an op-ed with Fox News online condemning the cancel culture that has gained so much steam in recent months.

In a piece titled, “Here’s how to stop cancel-culture mob, violent anarchists from remaking our country,” Blackburn called on all Americans to fight the culture war the left has waged in their destruction of statues, violent protests, and removal of history. By “punching through the rhetoric” and reminding fellow Americans what they stand for, she said the right can take back the nation they used to know and still love.

Blackburn provided the illuminating example of the left’s strategy of recent cancellation of a Chattanooga, Tennessee restaurant, Shuford’s Smokehouse. The left wing mob, labeled as “resistance activists,” came for the establishment in June, deeming them unworthy of any business because they fulfilled an order that would be delivered to participants at a pro-police rally. Their efforts were successful — as they have been with so many real people and groups — ruining Shuford’s Smokehouse in one fell swoop.

Shuford’s isn’t alone. The so-called ‘resistance’ decided on an acceptably woke, conveniently fluid narrative long before George Floyd’s brutal murder sent police reform protesters pouring into the streets of Nashville, Washington, D.C., Portland and Chicago; and now, they’ve weaponized those moving goalposts against anyone who steps out of line.

The op-ed came out the same day the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on the Constitution is set to hear how Americans are protecting their First Amendment rights during this time.

“Make no mistake — this is nothing less than an attempt to extort compliance from the American people,” Blackburn writes. “The left wants you to know that all of this violence and unrest is on you. But, if you fall in line, we will go away. If you comply with our demands, we will refrain from confiscating your livelihood.”

Beyond what Blackburn and other Republicans can do in Washington, the job is too big for national leadership to tackle alone. The Tennessee senator not only called on everyday Americans, but specifically local law enforcement and local government. Demanding local leadership stand strong against acts of violence, Blackburn said every American must actively strive to unite their communities.

“This is not a problem Washington can single-handedly solve. The radical left is attacking not only the spirit of the First Amendment, but our very sense of unity, and the spoils of this brewing war will be the right to re-mold the American identity.”

Blackburn’s powerful message could serve as comfort for conservatives who feel scared and abandoned by politicians during the constant destruction and outright rejection of American ideals displayed across the same news platform this summer.

The senator’s call to action may also provide a push for those who have felt helpless or confused about their role throughout all of this. She assured Americans of the urgency to take action.

“An America under siege by the left’s political mob, hell-bent on remaking the world’s shining city on a hill in their own image. It’s the very thing our Constitution is meant to protect against.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/04/sen-marsha-blackburn-shares-guide-to-defeating-cancel-culture-mob/,2020-08-04
Woke Mobs Demand You Must Now Explain Why You Stand For The Anthem,"Kneeling for the national anthem at sporting events used to be the occasional episode of player activism protesting the United States as an evil racist empire. Amid the new 21st century woke revolution however, kneeling has become a key signifier for players and teams to declare which side of the culture wars one sits on.

It’s those who love America versus those who hate it, the latter of which despises the American flag and all that it represents as a relic of white supremacy that must be condemned.

Those who still stand out of respect for the nation’s ideals and the uniformed men and women who protect it are now the outliers forced to defend themselves in a new age of no dissent, because dissent is racist, racism is oppression, oppression is violence, and violence is not to be tolerated, even if it isn’t real.

When several players and coaches decided to stand tall for the national anthem in recent weeks as sports made a limited return, they drew considerable attention online. They were pressured to make statements on their decisions that were still in support of the contemporary civil rights movement under the banner of Black Lives Matter.

“I fully support the social justice movement and everyone who chooses to kneel as a means of peaceful protest,” said NBA referee Brent Bernaky in a statement to ESPN. “For me personally, it’s important I stand for the national anthem, which is what I chose to do this evening. I believe you can be committed to both ideas and I will continue to support the league’s social justice efforts to help bring equality to this country.”

Rather amazing how quickly we went from “people should be able to kneel during the anthem as a form of protest” to “anyone who doesn’t kneel during the anthem must explain themselves”. https://t.co/7UCYRRr1Sc — AG (@AGHamilton29) August 1, 2020

The Orlando Magic’s Jonathan Isaac also refused to kneel on Friday during the national anthem while his teammates wore “Black Lives Matter” t-shirts with one knee on the ground.

“I believe that Black Lives Matter,” Isaac, who is black, told ESPN. “A lot went into my decision and part of it is my thought that kneeling while wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt don’t go hand in hand with supporting black lives.”

Isaac went on to tell ESPN that his faith played a role in the decision after becoming an ordained minister in March.

“I feel like for me black lives are supported through the Gospel,” Isaac said. “All lives are supported through the Gospel… I feel like the Bible tells us we all fall short of God’s glory and at the end of the day whoever will humble themselves and seek God and repent of their sins that we could see it in a different light.”

San Francisco Giants Pitcher Sam Coonrod also cited his Christian faith in his refusal to kneel even as each member of both teams took a knee, though Coonrod issued no support for Black Lives Matter.

“I’m a Christian, like I said, and I just can’t get on board with a couple of things that I have read about Black Lives Matter. How they lean towards Marxism and they’ve said some negative things about the nuclear family. I just can’t get on board with that,” Coonrod told NBC Sports, adding he “can’t kneel before anything besides God.”

As kneeling becomes a universal practice among teams, those who dare remain standing are now the ones who must explain themselves while the legacy of today’s supposed reckoning on race declaring American society as irredeemably racist cements itself in the mainstream culture.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/04/woke-mobs-demand-you-must-now-explain-why-you-stand-for-the-anthem/,2020-08-04
Immigrant Faces Down Black Lives Matter Over Attempted Shakedown,"Fernando Martinez is a Louisville resident, business owner, and former refugee from Communist Cuba who escaped on a raft when he was just 18 years old. His newly opened restaurant, La Bodoguita De Mima, employs more than 30 people, most of whom are immigrants as well.

Last week, he became a target of violent threats by Black Lives Matter activists trying to use locals’ antiracist sympathies to blackmail local businesses.

During a protest in his town that descended into violence, Martinez’s restaurant was approached by a group of the demonstrators. According to him, he and his staff were issued a long list of demands from the group, and were told they had better comply “so your business isn’t f***ed with.”

Included in the list were demands that the immigrant-owned restaurant pay up 1.5 percent of its revenue to affiliates of the protesters, make a minimum of 23 percent of their employees and vendors black, and mandate diversity training for all his staff. He was also ordered to issue a public apology for building on land that used to be a public housing project.

Martinez’s was just one of many businesses in the area targeted. Unlike the others, he had no plans to quietly roll over.

“There comes a time in life that you have to make a stand and you have to really prove your convictions and what you believe in. I didn’t (e)scape tyranny to be intimidated by these people,” he wrote in a statement on Facebook calling out the mob’s mafia tactics. “All good people need to denounce this. How can you justified (sic) injustice with more injustice?”

Needless to say, the want-to-be woke Capones were greatly displeased. Demonstrators swiftly returned to the businesses after the statement, accosting staff and vandalizing the exterior. His business was forced to shut for days in fear for their safety. But as the activists were soon to find out, Martinez had his community behind him.

On Sunday, more than 100 members of the city’s Cuban community gathered in the sun to support him against the attempted intimidation. Carrying signs such as “We Left Cuba Because of Socialism: Be Careful What You Wish For,” and “No 2 Socialism in America,” the peaceful rally-goers listened as Martinez gave an emotional speech. With his mother at his side, the immigrant stated that it was socialist ideas, not black Americans, that he opposes.

“We’re here to work. We’re dreamers. We’re people who love freedom and love this country,” Martinez said about Cuban-Americans. “This is not a race fight. This is an idea fight.”

“How can I be called a bigot and a racist when my family is black? When my son is gay? I’m the proud father of a gay son, and I’m gonna fight for him against anybody.”

Other speakers rose next to stand by Martinez, and the ideas he stood by.

“We came here not because we wanted to come. We fell in love with your city and your country after being here because you welcomed us,” said Berta Weyenberg, the president of the Cuban American Association of Kentucky. “We are here to defend the freedom that you all gave us that we didn’t have.”

Since the community has come together over to defend the owner from those trying to intimidate him, there have been no reports of further violence or threats. Martinez proclaims his business has always welcomed everyone.

“La Bodeguita is open to everybody,” he said to the crowd on Sunday. “If you’re gay, this is your home. If you’re black, this is your home. If you’re white, this is your home. If you’re human, this is your home.”

New Poll Shows Majority Of Black Americans Favor Higher Police Presence,"A Gallup poll released on Wednesday shows that 81 percent of black Americans want the police presence to remain the same or increase in their neighborhood or area. According to the poll, “67 percent of all U.S. adults” also prefer the “status quo” when it comes to local police presence.

“Most Black Americans want the police to spend at least as much time in their area as they currently do, indicating that they value the need for the service that police provide,” the poll concludes.

Eighty-three percent of Hispanic Americans and 88 percent of white Americans share similar attitudes. In contrast, only 72 percent of Asian Americans say they would prefer increased or the same amount of police presence in their neighborhoods.

After an examination of factors such as volume and frequency of police interactions, however, researchers determined that neither were the most significant factor in dictating black Americans’ attitudes towards police presence in their area.

While “exposure comes with more trepidation for Black than White or Hispanic Americans about what they might experience in a police encounter,” poll analysis suggests that “simply having an interaction with the police in the past year has no bearing on black Americans’ preference for local police presence in their area.”

In cases where black Americans see police in their neighborhood, there is a “limited impact” on determining increased, the same, or decreased police appearances in their area.

“The slightly elevated frequency with which Black Americans see police in their neighborhood has limited impact on their preferences for changing the local police presence,” the poll explains. “About a third of Black Americans who say they often see the police in their neighborhood think the police should spend less time there (34%); however, the majority of adults in this group think they should spend the same amount of time (56%) or more time (10%).”

The most significant factor in determining attitudes towards police presence, according to Gallup is the “quality of the interaction.”

While “fewer than one in five Black Americans feel very confident that the police in their area would treat them with courtesy and respect,” only 13 percent of black Americans who were “treated respectfully” favor decreased police presence in their area while 87 percent want the same or increased number and frequency of police.

“Those harboring the least confidence that they will be treated well, or who have had negative encounters in the past, are much more likely to want the police presence curtailed,” the poll concludes.

A previous Gallup poll released in late July showed that only 22 percent of black Americans approved of abolishing police departments, while 90 percent showed great interest in “specific reforms aimed at improving police relations with the communities they serve and preventing or punishing abusive police behavior.”

"Gallup: 81 Percent Of Black Americans Want Police, Some Want More","A new Gallup poll released Wednesday shows an overwhelming majority of black Americans, 81 percent, support either the same amount or an increased police presence in their communities.

The survey, conducted June 23 – July 6, showed 61 percent of black Americans supported police spending the same about of time in their neighborhoods while 20 percent wanted law enforcement to spend more time in their streets. Nineteen percent said police should spend less time in their community.

In contrast, 24 percent of Hispanic Americans wanted more policing compared to 17 percent of white Americans and 9 percent of Asian Americans, who were also most likely to report supporting a decrease in police presence in their neighborhoods at 28 percent.

Black Americans reported the highest levels of seeing officers in their neighborhoods: 32 percent said they saw police either often or very often. Twenty-eight percent of Hispanic Americans said the same compared to 22 percent of white Americans and 21 percent of Asian Americans.

The survey was conducted in English online, taking answers from 36,463 adults aged 18 and older with a +/-1.4 percent margin of error. The poll comes from Gallup’s new Center on Black Voices. Gallup reported that the findings remain consistent with a previous poll showing only 22 percent of black Americans supporting calls to abolish police departments.

Despite contradicting the views of the vast majority of black Americans, demands for defunding police have become a signature of the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement. Fifty-eight percent of Americans said do agree that policing needs “major changes.”

In June, the Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to disband its police department tasked with protecting more than 400,000 residents.

The latest Gallup poll comes amid a crime wave sweeping the nation’s cities as animosity towards police reaches new heights from a vocal minority, demoralizing law enforcement and stripping resources dedicated to ensuring public safety. The cities of Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Nashville, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and New Orleans have reach seen homicides jump more than 20 percent just this year.

How Long Can The Media Cover For Biden’s Racial Gaffes?,"Joe Biden has stepped on another racial landmine. As the country is torn apart by ethnic strife, the former Vice President continues to frustrate his campaign and his loyal supporters in the corporate media by saying goofy things about black people that at least border on abject racism.

Thursday it was a statement, introduced by his classic, “Come on, man!” in which he suggested that unlike Latinos, black Americans do not have diversity of thought and ideas, with “notable exceptions.”

Uhh… did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same? pic.twitter.com/iUgkk2uSJo — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) August 6, 2020

Put once again in the unenviable position of having to defend the Democratic nominee, CNN and MSNBC chose for the most part to ignore the troubling remarks. Others like the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin took a different approach, sidestepping the actual remarks to make a broader point about Biden’s propensity to gaffes.

The latest Biden gaffes reflect: a) the real/perceived risk he poses to himself, anxiety he causes in staff and why so many Dems are thrilled there is no real public campaign b) how much Trump was depending on Biden gaffes & how little land they have to live off of now — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) August 6, 2020

You really have to hand it to Washington Post “Fact Checker” Glenn Kessler who just pretended that Biden didn’t say what Biden literally said. In a just world, Kessler would give himself four Pinocchios for this obvious gaslighting, but don’t hold your breath.

If you listen to the clip, he didn’t actually say this. https://t.co/sU7XeCuHim — Glenn Kessler (@GlennKesslerWP) August 6, 2020

Despite these desperate deflections, the Biden camp itself decided it needed to address the comments. In a series of tweets, Biden said that he was not treating black Americans as a monolith, even though he clearly was. Later in the day he launched into some bizarre remarks about how Latinos come from all over the world “unlike African-American communities,” as if there are not black Americans from Africa, the Caribbean and Europe. These defensive statements were likely a result of President Trump highlighting the gaffe throughout the day.

This is becoming a real problem for Biden who recently insisted in an interview that if a black person, presumably one of those notable exceptions doesn’t vote for him than they “ain’t black.” In 2020, these kinds of comments not only sound tinny to younger Democrats, they come off often as down right racist.

In part, the issue for Biden is that he came of political age at a time when ethnic politics had a more playful and less corrosive feeling about it. This was a time when Bill Clinton was lovingly called the first black president. Even earlier in the 1970s and 1980s, politics was often played in ethnic clubs like the Ancient Order of Hibernians.

Ethnic jokes were more commonplace and acceptable, this first started catching up to Biden in 2008 when he joked that you had to have a slight Indian accent to go to 7-11. Nobody laughed. Another very common aspect late of 20th century racial politics was code switching, using different words or accents when speaking to different groups. We still see Biden do this with his use of “man” and “ain’t” to shall we say “urbanize” his delivery to black voters.

Biden’s antiquated ways of dealing with race may not be racist so to speak, but they are certainly outside the accepted parlance of the current Democratic Party. They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, and Biden, who spent most of his life getting laughs at such remarks, is not likely to be an exception to this rule.

The best Biden’s handlers can do in this situation is try to keep Old Joe in the basement with as few chances to foul up as possible. But with several of the latest polls showing a sharply tightening race, that may not be sustainable in the long run. Meanwhile the best the media can do is try to ignore the gaffes. But here they also have a problem, namely those notable exceptions.

There is no shortage of prominent black conservatives in today’s political landscape. From Harris Faulker, to Sen. Tim Scott, to Deroy Murdock and many others, there are black voices that resent and object to being told they are part of some Democratic monolith. The still mainly white mainstream media cannot ignore these voices; even though they desperately wish to do so.

Do not expect this to be the last time Biden makes a gaffe involving race. But do expect the corporate media to use all their power to protect him when he does. The question is, will that power be enough?

"How Politics Of Black, Jewish Americans Became Their Cultural Identity","In May, presidential candidate Joe Biden was forced to apologize after saying in an interview to African Americans who might think of voting for Trump: “You ain’t black.” Biden was criticized for presuming to tell black voters how they are allowed to think, as well as clumsily pandering.

Yet many share the sentiment Biden expressed. No American ethnic group votes so overwhelmingly partisan as African Americans, with 80 percent or more of black voters identifying with the Democratic Party since the 1960s.

In their new book, Steadfast Democrats: How Social Forces Shape Black Political Behavior, which appeared three months before Biden’s comment, professors Ismail K. White and Cheryl N. Laird observe that “support for the Democratic Party has become closely linked to black identity—so much so that black Americans have come to see black support for the Democratic Party as just something that ‘black people do.’”

Indeed, Democratic Party loyalty among blacks is so strong that it overcomes other factors that usually tilt identification toward the GOP, such as higher economic status, religious faith, and political ideology itself. For instance, around a third of black Americans today identify as politically conservative, and surveys show increasing numbers of blacks who oppose, for example, racial preferences and government wealth redistribution programs.

Yet in one representative 2012 survey cited by White and Laird, 82 percent of self-identified black conservatives considered themselves Democrats, fractionally more than even the percentage (81 percent) of white liberals who did, and in comparison with just 48 percent of conservative Hispanics and 19 percent of conservative whites.

Explanations for this sociologically anomalous behavior tend to emphasize some form of rational self-interest. It is often held, for instance, that black identification with the Democratic Party is a natural result of the Civil Rights era and landmark legislation passed under a Democrat president in the 1960s. However, White and Laird note the black shift to the Democratic Party actually “predates the civil rights gains of the 1960s.” Moreover, this partisanship has persisted even as “black Americans have grown more politically and economically diverse,” making a more than half-century-old loyalty a less than convincing explanation for contemporary group behavior.

The “linked fate” explanation developed by political scientist Michael Dawson in the 1990s attempts to square the partisanship of black Americans with individual self-interest by maintaining that blacks see their individual prospects as tied to the success of the race as a whole, a success best guaranteed by the politicians and policies of the Democratic Party. Nevertheless, White and Laird do not find in their research a strong empirical correlation between “linked fate” beliefs and party identification.

Political Boundaries

I am not a social scientist. I also find it challenging to see rational choice as an obvious explanation for anyone’s political behavior these days. Certainly, politics has taken on for many Americans the force of an identity, a tribal affiliation, in some cases even a kind of religion with accompanying ritual practices.

What I find most intriguing about Steadfast Democrats and, as we will see, why I think it is a book with relevance for observers of Jewish political behavior, is that the authors recognize that politics can become a key component of group identity. It is not that black political solidarity has not historically had crucial benefits for black Americans but that, whether or not those benefits still exist or are cost-effective today, they have become associated over time with black identity itself.

White and Laird’s book uses social science data to begin to understand how the boundaries of that identity are protected and those who violate those boundaries sanctioned. As they put it: “identifying with and voting for the Democratic Party and its candidates have come to be understood by most black Americans as in-group expected behaviors that individual blacks perform in anticipation of social rewards for compliance and sanctions for defection. Enforcement comes through social ties and black institutions.” They name this dynamic “racialized social constraint.”

Such intersections of black political and ethnic identity are familiar; indeed, they have become part of the standard repertoire of sketch comedy and popular culture. White and Laird find that majorities of “black Americans report not only that they are regularly solicited by friends and family to support the Democratic Party but also that they are concerned about the social consequences of friends and family finding out if they were to choose not to support the Democratic Party and its candidates.”

In a 2014 poll the authors created, nearly half of all black Barack Obama voters said that their friends and family would have given them a hard time had they voted for Mitt Romney, while only 20 percent said that neither their friends nor their family would have cared. Percentages for white Obama voters were the reverse of this: half said that neither their friends nor family would have cared, and only 20 percent would have expected repercussions from both friends and family.

More striking are White and Laird’s experiments contrasting black political responses when interviewed by black versus non-black interviewers. They found that, in the presence of black interviewers, black respondents significantly overreported voting for the Democrat candidate, as well as their voting rates in general.

But the most important trend the authors discovered was the suppression of black conservatism, both in the presence of a black interviewer and in black social contexts in general. For instance, when interviewed by a non-black interviewer, political ideology is a key predictor of Democratic Party identification, with black conservatives far less likely to identify as Democrats than black liberals, as one would expect.

This factor all but disappeared in White and Laird’s experiments in the presence of a black interviewer. While only a minority of black respondents supported Republican politicians and policies no matter what, the variations linked to the identity of the interviewer are striking, making black conservative responses “indistinguishable from those of black liberals.” As White and Laird summarize, “racialized social constraint works primarily through its ability to prevent blacks who hold conservative ideological beliefs from identifying as anything other than Democrats.”

Some of this will sound familiar to observers of American Jewish political behavior. Here is the cue to repeat sociologist Milton Himmelfarb’s now offensive-sounding, but statistically sound quip from the 1970s that “Jews earn like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans.” Although Steadfast Democrats mentions Jews but once in passing, they are second only to blacks in the extent to which they similarly defy factors that would in most cases tilt their political identification away from the Democratic Party.

Nor is Jewish support for the Democratic Party only a matter of the vote (around 80 percent since the 1990s). Studies show that three-fourths of the total political donations given by Jews typically go to the Democratic Party – an estimated 95 percent of donations went to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign! – while Jewish political activists are four times as likely to be Democrats as Republicans. As in the case of black Americans, this linkage has long been a popular culture trope.

Also, as with blacks, explanations for Jewish political behavior are plentiful if not terribly convincing. Liberal Jews are frequently wont to cite religious tradition to explain their politics, as in the catchphrase “tikkun olam” (about which I have written). Some Jewish progressives do engage seriously with Jewish tradition as they articulate their social justice politics, yet many invocations of religious tradition by Jewish liberals tend to be misinformed and opportunistic. Survey after survey shows that greater Jewish religious observance correlates with less, not more identification with the Democratic Party and liberal politics.

Parallels to the “linked fate” argument have also been made in the case of American Jewish party identification, sometimes connected with the historical argument that Jews over the last two centuries have naturally gravitated toward liberal rather than conservative parties as being more supportive of full Jewish participation in civic and social life. There is some truth to this, but it fails to explain either Jewish identification with the Democratic Party today or why Jews in other western countries today do not have the same loyalty to their liberal and left-wing parties as American Jews do for the Democrats.

Political Behavior as Cultural Identity

The precise mechanisms by which a mainstream American Jewish political identity is maintained and defended have received little scholarly attention. However, a number of studies have observed, in ways parallel to what White and Laird report, what we’ll call a “Judaized social constraint” operating in American Jewish communities, with, for instance, greater levels of informal Jewish social networks (i.e., having Jewish friends and living in households with other Jews) correlating with greater levels of Democratic Party identification.

Two recent books do emphasize, in different ways, the extent to which mainstream American Jewish political behavior works as a cultural identity. In The Foundations of American Jewish Liberalism, the political scientist Kenneth D. Wald sees this behavior as reflecting a specifically American Jewish political culture that he traces back to the early days of the republic.

In Wald’s explanation, the key factor is the classical liberal separation of church and state afforded by the American political system, and an ongoing recognition by American Jews that they owe it their ability to participate and thrive in the United States. Wald therefore selects a series of episodes from the long history of Jews in America that demonstrate this commitment to church-state separation, and combines it with more recent survey data to suggest a continuity of American Jewish concern for this secular regime and commitment to the Democratic Party as its guarantor.

The result is a narrative that will be very reassuring to Jewish Democrats, as it maintains that their party preference is rational, deeply American, Jewishly traditional (at least in the American context), and threatened only by the “right” enemies: Christian conservatives, Republicans, and orthodox Jews.

In contrast to Wald, the political scientist Herbert F. Weisberg in The Politics of American Jews is less insistent on a single, 200-year narrative of American Jewish liberalism. While there is much in common between the two books, Weisberg makes his central claim more concretely: “most Jews have incorporated being Democratic into their social identity as Jews, making their party identification unusually resistant to change.”

While Wald’s conception of American Jewish politics is highly static, Weisberg’s study, though more focused on contemporary survey data than history, nevertheless offers a more varied and vivid account of how mainstream American Jewish political identity came into being as a product of historical circumstance, community values, minority consciousness, and perceptions of group and individual self-interest.

This interpretive rigidity of Wald’s book becomes more evident as its chronicle nears the current moment. The book’s final pages, which treat the 2016 election, identify closely with the liberal Jewish mindset he analyzes and present Trump as a particularly dangerous enemy of liberal tolerance, rather than its occasional or unpredictable defender in our strange political landscape.

To reinforce his thesis about the dangers of the Republican Party, Wald quotes extensively from several Jewish center-right pundits who joined the “Never Trump” movement in 2016, although he cautions—or perhaps boasts: “I am not privy to the intricacies of politics on the Jewish right.” This is odd to hear coming from a political scientist writing on Jewish politics, although it does remind us that some groups have made politics even more a part of their cultural identity than have blacks or Jews. University professors, for instance.

While Wald primarily emphasizes self-interest as the determining factor in American Jewish political behavior, Weisberg, like White and Laird in their book on black political behavior, focuses not only on group values and group interests but also on the social identities these produce. I would go further, arguing that such politicized identities can take on a life of their own, to the extent that some American Jews use values and interests as post hoc justifications for their social identities as liberal Democrats. In such cases, we might want tools afforded not only by political science and history, but by cultural analysis as well.

Let me give an example. Leading up to and during the Obama administration, the lobbying group AIPAC strongly indicated that preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear capability was its top policy aim. Nevertheless, much of the rank and file membership as well as the leadership of AIPAC enthusiastically supported President Obama, even though his faculty lounge and community activist background made his greater openness toward the Iranian regime quite predictable. I attended a large AIPAC dinner during Obama’s first term in which the keynote speaker assured the audience that the president would be very good for Israel. The speaker’s name was Peter Beinart.

AIPAC pushed back only belatedly and ineffectively on the administration’s 2015 Iran Deal, even as the administration accused its Jewish critics of dual loyalty. A last-minute attempt to oppose the Iran Deal by having thousands of AIPAC supporters come to Washington, D.C. and meet with their Democratic lawmakers not only failed to yield positive results, but failed spectacularly. The Iran Deal passed; moreover, AIPAC subsequently refused to sanction or withdraw support from any of the lawmakers who had brought about, by AIPAC’s own criteria, the most dangerously anti-Israel American policy shift in our lifetime.

Wald does not mention this episode, but would presumably explain it with reference to a Jewish perception that Obama would defend equal Jewish participation in American society, and that America’s and Israel’s interest in keeping Iran from obtaining nuclear strike capability was outweighed for the Jewish members of AIPAC by the danger to church-state separation posed by Israel’s evangelical supporters. Weisberg, who does treat the episode, considers that AIPAC’s apparent failure may involve a longer-term strategy, but that it certainly reflects complicated divisions within the American Jewish community regarding Israel, which he analyzes in some detail in his book.

Either way, if we view AIPAC as a lobbying group, we might be inclined to think it singularly incompetent. Yet what if AIPAC is not primarily a lobbying organization, but a cultural one? Suppose that membership in it and attendance at its galas are not really intended to bring about policy results, but to enact symbolically, as ritual and spectacle, a desired but increasingly uncertain equilibrium between Jewish concern for Israel and loyalty to the Democratic Party.

Seen in this way, the last-minute convergence on D.C. was not an attempt to change votes—social media showed the participants festive and self-congratulatory despite their lack of success—but was instead a pageant, a kind of ritual theater. While it was not successful in lobbying, as a performance of American Jewish liberal culture it was very successful, as evidenced by the enthusiasm of its participants and their likely participation in the overwhelming Jewish support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. True, such performances are expensive—AIPAC’s annual budget is in the millions of dollars—but who can put a price on Jewish identity?

Waiting for Realignment

Neither Wald nor Weisberg believe a partisan realignment among American Jews is likely. For Wald, “the contemporary politics of American Jewry has continued to flow from the values and practices developed during the founding of the American Jewish community.”

Weisberg highlights what he sees as the subcategories of the Jewish electorate most likely to shift toward Republican candidates under the right circumstances (Orthodox, Jews from the FSU, Israeli Americans, libertarians, etc.), but still judges that “waiting for the Jews to realign politically may be as endless as waiting for Godot.”

This makes sense. An identity as deeply political as that of mainstream American Jewry is not going to change its political behavior without becoming unrecognizable to itself, and certainly not without having new frameworks of meaning and behavior to replace the older ones.

There is much now in our field of vision—contemporary populism, the racial identity politics of the Democratic Party since Obama, and cultural shifts within and without the Jewish community—that will undoubtedly affect that mainstream. We may ask what will happen, for instance, as the contemporary left rejects the classical liberalism Wald describes in favor of racial dispensations that have Jews making atonement for their white privilege.

Such shifts are not purely external to the liberal Jewish community, but have become widespread in the synagogues, supplemental schools, and summer camps of mainstream American Judaism. These shifts will no doubt become more pronounced as younger Jews, influenced by left-wing activist networks and products of the K-12 and college institutions that have been hostile to classical liberalism for several generations now, move into leadership positions.

Yet those Jews who defect from the Democratic Party will not constitute a political realignment on the part of the mainstream, because by doing so they will thereby be Jews with an identity different from that mainstream. Politics, as a Jewish activist once said, is downstream from culture.

Returning to White and Laird, they see the future as likely to erode the level of Democratic Party loyalty among black Americans as a result of the weakening social force of black institutions and the increase of social integration. They observe that digital social spaces (e.g., Black Twitter) may reproduce to some extent the sort of sanctioning force of those traditional social relations, but note as well that such virtual spaces also “offer black conservatives a means of expanding their social networks.”

They also express a concern worth attending to, that “if whites’ level of racialized social constraint both within and outside the South reaches anything approximating that of blacks, greater polarization and heightened racial conflict in America will take hold more broadly.” I disagree this is the polarization we are seeing in the Trump era, and would argue that, if anything, Trump is functioning as a scrambler of the politics of racialized social constraint, which becomes a concern for Democrats and white elites more broadly. But time will tell.

Meanwhile, they end by imagining the plight of a black conservative in the voting booth this November. He considers casting his vote for a Republican and then possibly having to admit doing so to his friends and family. Given the “social rewards of conformity,” they write, “supporting the Democratic candidate is almost certainly the least costly option.”

Whitmer's Virtue Signaling Can't Hide That Her Lockdown Has Failed,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has pulled yet another publicity stunt by declaring racism a public health crisis last Wednesday. To address it, she created the “Black Leadership Advisory Council” tasked with a number of goals, including identifying policies that negatively affect black Michiganders.

Additionally, all state employees will now be required to partake in implicit bias training to understand how their unconscious racism can affect others. This move is nothing more than virtue signaling to impress the public by using the latest newsworthy topics to grab their attention: racism and COVID-19. Whitmer is doing it not only to look good, but to distract from her failed coronavirus lockdown strategy.

Quick, Let’s Distract From My Failures

Whitmer’s stated reasoning for this latest executive order is that black people are more than four times as likely to die from COVID-19 in comparison to white people. But her solution isn’t to ensure black citizens are properly equipped to handle viruses with adequate health-care access, it’s to instead force state employees to partake in bias training and identify harmful laws.

It’s unclear how these measures will address the immediate problem of stopping the spread of COVID-19 in black communities, or anywhere in the state. Instead, it seems more likely that she’s pandering to the popular narrative of being proactively anti-racist for the news headlines with her 163rd executive order of the year.

While her focus was on racism, Whitmer failed to mention any good news about her state’s economy. That’s because it’s severely struggling under her leadership. Michigan is among the top ten states with the highest rates of unemployment in the nation, with nearly 14 percent collecting unemployment. The state had plans to finally move to the next phase of re-opening, but now it’s not happening because Whitmer’s plan simply isn’t working.

After announcing her executive order on racism, Whitmer announced that her coronavirus news conferences will switch back to online only. But, of course, only after her major announcement made the cut. She had been allowing two to three reporters, expanded more recently to up to 10, to attend her briefings. But she’s rolling it back, alongside the state’s plan to re-open the economy, which will no doubt continue to hurt Michiganders who are struggling to find employment.

$1,000 Fines Atop Forcibly Unemployed People

Beyond focusing on social issues like racism, Whitmer’s new response plan for COVID-19 takes a more heavy-handed approach to force Michigan residents into compliance via state police. Indeed, she plans to ticket and fine her way into a healthy public by ordering state police to “enforce violations of COVID-19 executive orders and epidemic orders in the same manner as it would enforce any other violation of law, using enforcement discretion as appropriate.” This is after some areas like Detroit have cited more than 2,600 people with $1,000 fines.

In addition to fining the noncompliant, Whitmer is coming for the business licenses of those who don’t follow her orders. She has ordered the state department directors and autonomous agency heads to “consider violations of law, including violations of relevant COVID-19 executive orders and epidemic orders” when determining suitability for licensing.

This means if a “non-essential” business continues to operate safely in order to provide for the owners’ and employees’ families, despite the current legal structure prohibiting them from doing so, the state could shut them down forever. I guess it’s better to shut up and collect unemployment than risk losing your livelihood by continuing to operate, no matter how many safety precautions you take.

More Random Laws Will Disproportionately Hit Blacks

Whitmer’s heavy-handed approach to enforcing COVID-19 violations is antithetical to the racism problem she’s claiming to fight. By passing yet another law restricting people’s freedom, and directing cops to enforce that law heavily, she’s opening another avenue for police involvement in individual’s lives. Based on historical trends, this means black Michiganders will suffer the most from this order.

Evidence of racial disparity in policing and sentencing lies in Michigan’s own jails and prisons, where black people make up 49 percent of the incarcerated population but only 14 percent of the state population. This overrepresentation of black people starts with enforcement on the streets of Michigan.

While hopefully no one is going to prison for violating her COVID rules, Whitmer’s orders will certainly lead to more police interactions, with citations and fines to follow. And if it looks anything like the conviction trends the state has seen, this could mean more black people will be fined, depending on enforcement mechanisms.

For example, the executive order only applies to state police, so it depends where they are primarily concentrated. Many local officers have taken a stand against enforcement, stating they aren’t “mask police” and won’t be enforcing Whitmer’s orders.

If Whitmer Wants To Be Useful, She Should Try This

There’s no denying that racism exists in America. But using it is a way to divide people in a pandemic to push a newsworthy agenda isn’t the right way to make any real change. If Whitmer truly believes racism is an issue in Michigan, there are tangible things she could be doing to address the problem beyond yet another online training protocol for state employees. She could start by addressing the disportionate prison population and committing to commuting sentences of at-risk prisoners who are no longer a threat to citizens’ safety.

Michael Thompson is one of those inmates who now has COVID, and if he isn’t released, he could die behind bars because of something that wouldn’t even land him in prison if he were caught committing the same act today. Thompson is a 69-year-old black man convicted of selling three pounds of marijuana to an undercover cop in 1996. More than 24 years later, he’s still there.

Michigan has legalized recreational and medicinal cannabis, so keeping citizens imprisoned for things that are no longer deemed criminal is reprehensible, especially if they’re part of the high-risk population from the virus.

Whitmer is attempting to position herself as the hero of social justice issues, the warrior of solving racism once and for all. But her flashy order doesn’t actually create reform, it just distracts from the fact that Michigan is failing in its response to COVID-19. Instead of attempting to use more online task forces and trainings to solve a cultural problem, Whitmer should focus on tangible steps to re-open the economy, and stop creating laws that have the potential to devastate the lives of more black people.

Race-Obsessed Media Don't Care About The Brutal Murder Of 5-Year-Old,"Every day, corporate media commit sins of omission and commission. In their current scramble to shine a spotlight on what many leftist journalists deem “systemic racism,” they have elevated the deaths of black Americans at the hands of white people, while turning a blind eye to black-on-black crime as well as white victims of black perpetrators. Today, their grave sin of omission involved the execution of an innocent 5-year-old boy.

Went online to confirm the details of this story- couldnt find a single national media outlet covering it. Not one. Absolutely horrific, nightmarish story. Pure vicious evil. And media silence around it is disgusting and obvious. https://t.co/TJhxvnJJIX — Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) August 11, 2020

On Sunday, 25-year-old Darius Sessoms, a black man, allegedly killed white 5-year-old Cannon Hinnant while the child’s two young sisters looked on. While Hinnant was riding his bike in the front yard of his father’s North Carolina home, Sessoms, his neighbor, reportedly ran across the yard and shot the child in the head point-blank. One neighbor witnessed the incident, as did the boy’s 7- and 8-year-old sisters.

“My first reaction was he’s playing with the kids,” said Doris Lybrand, the neighbor who saw Sessoms run across the lawn and shoot the boy. “For a second, I thought, ‘That couldn’t happen.’ People don’t run across the street and kill kids.”

“We were eating our dinner and heard a bang. We knew it was a gunshot,” Charlene Walburn, another of the boy’s neighbors, described the scene. “So I told him to call 911, and I ran to the door.”

The boy’s father dashed out to his son, screaming and holding his bleeding body. Hinnant was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

After the shooting, Sessoms fled in a black vehicle. The U.S. Marshals Service Carolinas Regional Fugitive Task Force, Goldsboro police, and Wayne County Sheriff’s Office arrested him nearly 24 hours later. Sessoms is being held in the Wilson County jail without bond and has been charged with first-degree murder.

“I just don’t understand why he did it,” Walburn continued. “How can you walk up to a little boy, point blank, and put a gun to his head and just shoot him? How could anyone do that?”

The same neighbor described Hinnant’s sweet demeanor. “He would come over, him and my husband would always talk back and forth and he would ask my husband to put air in his tire,” Walburn said. “If he saw me on the porch with a popsicle, he would always come over and ask me if he could have a popsicle.”

Sessoms reportedly had dinner with Hinnant’s father last week and was seen at the father’s residence earlier in the day Sunday.

Day in and day out, the national media has stoked the coals of racial tension in America, cultivating a blazing inferno of strife — both literally and figuratively. The world has watched as lawless rioters and looters desecrated America’s cities, setting businesses and churches ablaze, coaxed onward by an approving news media. Journalists have run cover for violent actors, lumping them in with peaceful protesters.

WATCH: Federalist Radio Hour: How The Media Exploits Crises, From COVID-19 To Race Relations

Over and over, the media have repeated the story of George Floyd and hurled blanket accusations of police brutality, which has encouraged violence against police officers, all while largely ignoring deaths that aren’t politically expedient. These deaths include that of black police officer David Dorn, who died while protecting a store from violent looters in St. Louis. Now the media is ignoring the death of Hinnant at the hands of a black man.

The media will continue their race framing, as if every act of man is the product of a racial consideration. It doesn’t apply only to crime, either. Everything in American culture and politics in 2020 must be viewed through a racial lens. Brands have been canceled, sports teams renamed, and Black Lives Matter scrawled across basketball courts and end zones. Former Vice President Joe Biden yesterday announced the selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, after activists and party leaders pressured him to choose a woman of color.

As the blaze of manufactured conflict continues, be mindful of the media’s framing. Note not only their sins of commission as they intentionally divide Americans over the color of their skin, but also their sins of omission as they ignore victims that cut against the “America is racist” narrative, such as the many victims of black-on-black crime. Today, the victim they’ve ignored is Cannon Hinnant.

Will the mainstream media say his name?",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/12/black-man-shoots-5-year-old-in-the-head-point-blank-but-the-race-obsessed-media-dont-care/,2020-08-12
CA Blackouts Display The Results Of Kamala's Favored Energy Policy,"It’s hot out West and California’s electricity grid is under tremendous strain. The state’s first intentional rolling blackouts since its 2001 energy crisis hit on Friday. Tuesday’s forecast electricity demand is likely to exceed the record reached in 2006. Also, if it weren’t for substantial imports of electricity from coal- and gas-fired power plants in other Western states, it would be far worse.

California’s energy travails come at an embarrassing time for the Democratic national presidential ticket of former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris.

Biden’s past energy policies were fairly standard fare for old-school Democrats: massive government spending and regulations to pick winners and losers—the $535 million Solyndra collapse is illustrative. His current plan is more of the same, spending $2 trillion, some of which will go to buy the silent acceptance of Big Oil.

By comparison, Harris’ policies are a radical departure, and, as can be seen in California, fail when confronted with the real world. Harris partnered with New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal, an energy plan so ambitious it envisioned a continental network of government-run high-speed trains while grounding America’s commercial air fleet.

Likewise, California’s high-speed rail project has been cut back from the 380-mile San Francisco to Los Angeles route to a 140-mile Bakersfield to Merced run that few will ever ride, as the costs of the project tripled from $33.6 billion to $98.1 billion. The train would run on electricity—if it were available.

California’s electricity problem is simple. Its energy policies demand ever-increasing amounts of wind and solar power, but electricity must be generated the moment it’s consumed. The wind doesn’t always blow—especially when it’s hot—and the sun doesn’t always shine. Therefore, California must import vast amounts of power from the 13 other states (along with Canada and Mexico) in the Western Interconnection whenever that’s required to keep the lights on and the air conditioners running.

In 2018, almost a third of the retail electricity California used was imported—with coal, gas, and nuclear power in the mix. California’s environmental virtues do have a limit. But coal-fired power plants in Arizona, Utah, and Wyoming may not be around much longer to sell power to California during a heat wave. There are two reasons for this.

First, Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a law in 2006 that banned renewing contracts to import coal-fired electricity. This law was later expanded to cover municipal utilities, such as the behemoth L.A. Department of Water and Power.

Second, California’s aggressive subsidies and mandates for solar and wind power have led to frequent surpluses of very cheap (but very unreliable) power flooding the Western grid. Under most states’ public utility rules, the lowest-cost electricity must be purchased first, often idling reliable—but more expensive to operate—coal and gas plants.

This has put significant financial pressure on reliable fossil fuel plants, leading many to close, often decades ahead of their planned decommissioning dates. As these reliable generators of power have shuttered, it has complicated grid operators’ ability to balance the grid.

When an electrical grid becomes unbalanced between power supply and power demand, bad things happen fast. Rolling blackouts can be a way to avoid physical damage to the grid’s components, such as transformers, powerlines, and even generators.

The Green New Deal has been criticized as an unworkable theoretical concept, long on marketing and thin on planning. California has come closer to the Green New Deal in reality than anywhere else, and Harris has been a vocal supporter of both.

The environmental left holds up California as the avatar of America’s energy future. For decades, the Golden State’s elected officials and regulators have been boosting renewable energy. Renewable electricity targets have been accelerated, with the state’s goal of 33 percent of its power from renewable sources, mostly solar and wind, this year, moving to 60 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030. By 2045, all of California’s electricity must come from carbon-free sources.

This effort doesn’t come on the cheap. For the privilege of having electricity when it’s available over the past few days, Californians pay 61 percent above the national average for electricity.

As a preview of national energy policy in Biden-Harris administration, California law makes it a crime to violate its Public Utilities Act while providing that the law’s intent is “…to provide for the evolution of the ISO (California’s Independent System Operator—the entity that manages California’s grid) into a regional organization to promote the development of regional electricity transmission markets in the western states.”

In plain English, this means California will dictate how the Western grid operates, the other 13 states be damned. As California’s electric policies metastasize to its neighbors, keeping the grid energized will become far more difficult.

To try to solve this problem of its own making, California is increasingly turning to batteries to store power. This is especially needed for wind power, which, in most places around the world, generally produces more wind at night when demand is lower. But despite spending billions on batteries, the state can still only store enough power to keep California energized for a few minutes.

Battery proponents always hint at big improvements just around the corner. But unlike computing, which is governed by Moore’s Law, with the capability of computers doubling every two years, batteries are constrained by chemistry and physics. They have to do physical work, whereas computers only manipulate 1s and 0s.

As an example, San Francisco’s 890,000 people would need an $8 billion battery farm weighing about 380,000 tons to avoid frequent blackouts if it were to go 100 percent renewable by 2045, as per California law. The cost would be about $16,000 per household. It’s important to note that after being drained over 12 hours, on a windless, cold winter’s day, power would be then unavailable in subsequent days if the state relied on such batteries.

In the meantime, California is making “cooling centers” available to vulnerable populations (so much for the ban on mass gatherings to prevent COVID transmission) while grid operators are seeking every watt of power they can get their hands on to avoid more widespread blackouts.

This has engendered push-back from Harris’ environmental allies, who complain that older gas-powered plants need to stay offline due to the environmental harm they cause to fish and sea lions. Yet people are in danger here. California’s last big heat wave, in 2006 before the environmental policies really took hold, resulted in some 140 deaths—with no rolling blackouts.

For Harris and the environmental left, fish are for saving and people are for frying.

How Libraries Are Indoctrinating Kids To Think All White People Are Racists,"As he watched Joseph Stalin’s coffin removed from Red Square in 1961, Yevgeny Yevtushenko asked, “But how to remove Stalin from Stalin’s heirs.” For us, in 2020 the question becomes: “How to remove racism from the anti-racists?”

According to Ibram X. Kendi, a rising scholar of the white disorder called racism, there is no such thing as being non-racist. You are either a purposeful anti-racist or a racist. No neutral ground exists. To be “color-blind” is a ruse. Since racism is the original sin of Euro-Americans, to be anti-racist is to be … well, you finish the sentence.

Even the American Library Association has genuflected to the unspoken substructure of the anti-racist meme. Amid protests following the death of George Floyd, the ALA issued a press release heaving with self-accusation. It confessed:

The American Library Association (ALA) accepts and acknowledges its role in upholding unjust systems of racism and discrimination against Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) within the association and the profession. We recognize that the founding of our Association was not built on inclusion and equity, but instead was built on systemic racism and discrimination in many forms. We also recognize the hurt and harm done to BIPOC library workers and communities due to these racist structures.

Penitent librarians rushed to promote “an anti-racist reading list,” a round-up of titles and authors suited to grievance studies seminars and mandatory re-education workshops. The keynote was struck by the collected pensées of former Black Panther and police abolitionist Angela Davis, and Kendi’s instructions to white people on how to disown the racism of good intentions and become anti-racist.

Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility was inevitable, as was Michael Eric Dyson’s Tears We Cannot Stop: a Sermon to White America, and anything by slavery reparations advocate Ta-Nehisi Coates. Layla Saad’s Me and White Supremacy comes straight to the point. It declares all Caucasians “complicit in white supremacy due to their melanin count.”

In June, my local public library published its social justice bona fides on the building’s façade: CHANGE STARTS WITH YOU. BLACK LIVES MATTER. Staff librarians compiled a list of books for children that promoted the anti-racist theme to young readers from toddlers to teens.

Titles suggest what the staff — all white; all-female — consider necessary for youngsters in a predominantly white town: Skin Again; The Skin You Live In; Woke, A Young Poet’s Call to Justice; The Power Book; Let’s Talk About Race; One Person, No Vote: How Not All Voters Are Treated Equally; Rise Up!: The Art of Protest; The Hate U Give; Black Brother, Black Brother; We Rise, We Resist, We Raise Our Voices; The Power Book.

It is not possible to annotate all of them. It is enough to highlight those that epitomize the timbre of the entire venture. Begin with Kendi’s picture book Antiracist Baby, a kindergarten distillation of his bestseller for teens Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You.

Dedicated to all young people “unbound by the imaginations of state violence and white supremacy,” the book is meant to be read by white parents to their potentially racist fledglings. “Antiracist Baby is bred, not born.” Put plainly, white tots must be trained — “bred” — to recognize and denounce their latent racism. As it is never too soon to create a woke child, a newly published board book edition, intended for teething infants to age three, is now on Amazon.

Breanna McDaniel’s picture book Hands Up! preserves the mythology of the 2014 Ferguson riots by insinuating the trademark slogan of Black Lives Matter (Hands up! Don’t Shoot!) into a sequence of childlike vignettes. It begins sweetly: “Greet the sun, bold and bright! / Tiny hands up!” Next page: “Peek-a-boo—hands up!”

The repeated refrain accompanies a little girl’s growth in age and race consciousness: “Together we are mighty. / High fives all around, hands up!” The progression reaches its politicized climax with the girl, older now, at a protest march: “As one we say, ‘HANDS UP!’”

The Black Lives Matter sign tells the rest. What it does not tell is that Michael Brown never did raise his hands in surrender and did not say, “Don’t shoot.”

Another picture book recommended for children aged 3 to 8 is Anastasia Higginbotham’s Not My Idea: A Book About Whiteness. Pulsing with reformist zeal, Higginbotham writes for white parents anxious to inform their young “that white supremacy is a lie; that white innocence is a lie.” Every white child needs prompting to “Question everything you are told about your goodness and your value as a white person.”

Higginbotham’s illustration places Colin Kaepernick on the same principled plane as John Lewis and other lionhearts of the 1960s Civil Rights movement. The moral grandeur of that movement dwindles to her mandate for today’s kids: “Be a spy. Catch whiteness lying to you.”

Kendi’s contempt for his country is in sharper relief in Stamped, a young-adult version of his 2016 National Book Award winner Stamped From The Beginning. Scaled to the lowest common denominator of teen readers in collaboration with Jason Reynolds, it revolves around the axis of denunciation. Kendi reminds us repeatedly that “This is not a history book.” It is a “not history history book.”

Nikole Hannah-Jones, non-historian architect of “The 1619 Project,” follows Kendi’s lead almost verbatim:

“I’ve always said that the ‘1619 Project’ is not a history,” Hannah-Jones said in a series of tweets. “It is a work of journalism that explicitly seeks to challenge the national narrative and, therefore, the national memory. The project has always been as much about the present as it is the past.”

Translation: The project uses prevailing ignorance of the American story, in its fullness and complexity, to dig up old bones in a reductive narrative that turns the nation’s founders into sow’s ears. And stokes black antagonism.

Kendi supplied Hannah-Jones’s dismissal of Lincoln as “the Great Emancipator” — as slaves called him in the 1860s — together with her claim that “black Americans fought back alone.” After informing teen readers that Lincoln “spoke out of three sides of his mouth,” Dr. Kendi adds: “Lincoln was labeled the Great Emancipator, but really, Black people were emancipating themselves.”

School kids will not learn from these two of the 2.2 million Union soldiers who fought to end slavery and 365,000 who died. Kendi cuts the Civil War down to this:

There were now two governments, like rival gangs. And what have gangs always done when one gang feels their turf is being threatened? FIGHT! Welcome to the Civil War.

The wrecking ball swings at “White people” with the same derision aimed at Benjamin Franklin:

Franklin started a club called the American Philosophical Society in 1743 in Philadelphia. It was modeled after the Royal Society in England and served as, basically, a club for smart (White) people. Thinkers. Philosophers. And . . . racists. See, in the Enlightenment era, light was seen as a metaphor for intelligence (think, I see the light) and also whiteness (think, opposite of dark). And this is what Franklin was bringing to America through his club of ingenious fools.

Contemptuous of “assimilationist vomit,” Kendi falsifies the Trayvon Martin case to fit an activist narrative. Despite considerable evidence that George Zimmerman acted in lawful self-defense, Kendi presents the incident that set in motion the Black Lives Matter movement as if no rational grounds existed for not convicting Zimmerman as a racist murderer:

Zimmerman’s racist ideas in 2012 transformed an easy-going Trayvon Martin walking home from a 7-Eleven holding watermelon juice and Skittles into a menace to society holding danger. . . . If not for racist ideas, Trayvon would still be alive. His dreams of becoming a pilot would still be alive.

The crudity of the prose matches the vulgarizations of the historian’s craft. Displacement of real history with the politics of resentment provides a rationale for endless racial preferences. It is a point lost on the ALA, but not on Amy L. Wax:

Under the new dispensation, unconstrained group preferences for blacks would be the order of the day, with other groups pushed aside without delay or ceremony. As Kendi puts it in How to Be an Anti-Racist, ‘Fundamentally, the modern antiracist movement is . . . pro-discrimination [against whites and Asians].’

Ultimately, Kendi’s statement is a quiet admission that antiracism is not benign. It is a rationalized form of genealogical blackmail.

Where Black Lives Matter Rioters Learned To Call Looting ‘Reparations’,"In Chicago this summer, Black Lives Matter protesters have repeatedly called for committing crimes as vengeance for claimed racial injustice. A few days ago, marchers in Millennium Park unfurled huge banners, one of which proclaimed “loot it all back.”

March organizers called for the banner to lead the march, according to Grace Del Vecchio, a local writer onsite who also provided video.

After widespread looting in the city as part of ongoing civil unrest accompanied by a crime wave, on Aug. 11 local Black Lives Matter leader Ariel Atkins openly defended looting as “reparations,” according to local outlets.

After 100 looters were arrested and 13 police officers injured by mobs on a protest-enabled crime spree, she said this: “I don’t care if somebody decides to loot a Gucci’s or a Macy’s or a Nike because that makes sure that that person eats. That makes sure that that person has clothes. That’s a reparation,” Atkins said. “Anything they want to take, take it, because these businesses have insurance.”

In a TV interview after Atkins’s comments, while not openly endorsing property crime, Black Lives Matter Chicago cofounder Aislinn Pulley failed to flatly condemn looting as a part of her group’s tactics. Instead she called discussions about looting a “preoccupation” that “works to distract away from the actual cause of the outrage.”

Pulley also implied that rampant property crimes decimating Democrat-run cities like Chicago during ongoing summer protests are not the fault of those committing them, but the fault of voters and elected officials who don’t do what she wants: “The refusal to enact any meaningful change will mean that we will have continued instances like this…We will continue to have unrest, intercommunal violence and these things until the root causes are resolved.”

In other words, don’t blame the criminals, blame the laws they’re breaking and the people enforcing those laws. Just like this admitted ATM robber and his friends say, we need to focus on “what can be done for this man to feel like he don’t need to loot again.” It’s our fault he tried to loot an ATM, you see. We’re responsible for his feelings and actions, not him.

These ideas are not simply isolated, fringe, and from random rabble-rousers. They were also proclaimed to the world on CNN by New York Times lead 1619 Project writer Nikole Hannah-Jones. An interview with Christine Amanpour included this exchange:

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: You’ve said, among other things, ‘people who have been left out of the social contract find no need to adhere it.’ Somebody, sort of, checked you on that and said, ‘not left out, but excluded from the social contract.’ And you agreed with being term-checked. NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Absolutely. You are asking whose communities have been looted for decades, don’t have proper schools, don’t have proper amenities. When we see someone killed by the police, that is the worse manifestation of police violence, but it doesn’t get to the daily violence that doesn’t end in death, or the daily degradation that black Americans face. The fact that these communities have been prayed upon by predatory lenders, it goes on and on. When we think about someone taking something from some big-box name store, it is symbolic. That one pair of shoes that you stole from Footlocker is not going to change your life, but it is a symbolic taking.

Retired prison psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple points out that a refusal to take responsibiliy for one’s own actions and life is a hallmark of criminals and the underclass, aided and abetted by elites who exploit the poor for lucrative careers managing the downtrodden.

The idea that the existence of evil in the world justifies adding more is enabled by a slew of publicly funded white-collar professionals who make bank stoking racial tensions. What rioters on the street hear as “it’s okay to steal from people who have more stuff than I do” in The New York Times, NPR, and The Atlantic’s offices sound like “The Case for Reparations.”

“The case I make for reparations is, virtually every institution with some degree of history in America, be it public, be it private, has a history of extracting wealth and resources out of the African-American community,” reprised Ta-Nehisi Coates to The New Yorker in 2019 of his 2014 Atlantic essay that brought the idea mainstream among elites. “I think what has often been missing—this is what I was trying to make the point of in 2014—that behind all of that oppression was actually theft. In other words, this is not just mean. This is not just maltreatment. This is the theft of resources out of that community.”

In other words, we can steal from you, because you stole from us first. This spirit of revenge is the sentiment behind much of the recent resurgence in identity politics grievances and anti-American hatred. The United States stole land from Native Americans. Therefore we owe them welfare outlays and so-called sovereignty over reservations in perpetuity, as well as copious white tears.

The United States stole blood, sweat, and tears from enslaved Africans. Therefore, the country owes people it has not enslaved white guilt all the way to the point of undoing all the good things about America. As well as power and money — lots and lots of money, in the form of university and Smithsonian Institution sinecures for the white-collar aggrieved, and a bit of looting for the blue-collar aggrieved to supplement their subsidized housing and groceries.

Reparations are simply legalized looting, dressed up in fancy justifications for TV. The reasons are myriad, starting with the fact that no living American today owned slaves. The vast majority of Americans never owned slaves.

In addition, since the days of slavery, immigrants joined the United States by the tens of millions. Thus the vast majority of Americans living today do not even have ancestors who enslaved anyone. Even that presumes that it is right to punish children for the sins of their fathers, which is an injustice if I ever heard of one.

It also presumes that the death, dismemberment, and economic hardships the Civil War caused are not a sufficient punishment upon the nation for its sin of slavery. These are big presumptions, and they deserve open debate in which they could be fairly proven wrong or at least doubted, not pressuring people to leave them uncontested under pain of being called a racist so we can move on to the looting — excuse me, reparations.

Excusing violence against other people’s person and property is even part of the so-called American justice system in some places using the same rationales, as recent reporting by Empower Wisconsin illustrates. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Everett Mitchell “made headlines as the University of Wisconsin’s director of community relations when he said prosecutors should go easy on shoplifters at ‘big box’ stores.”

“I just don’t think that they should be prosecuting cases … for people who steal from Wal-Mart,” Everett said. “I don’t think Target or all them [sic] other places, the big boxes that have insurance, that they should be using … the fact that people steal from there, justification to start engaging in aggressive police practices.”

Notice that this man, formerly employed in a public institution of supposed higher education and now charged with executing the laws as a judge, voiced the exact same conclusion a Black Lives Matter leader did: It’s okay to steal from people who have more than you do. I’ll give you one guess at which side of the political spectrum both of these individuals would place themselves on.

“As a judge, Mitchell has been a ‘social justice’ activist on the bench, handing out light sentences — or no sentences — to repeat offenders,” Empower Wisconsin reporter Matt Kittle writes.

There is also evidence from other parts of the “social justice” agenda that much of today’s far left, the source of the Democratic Party’s energy today, sees racial grievances as a justification for legalized plunder. Take, for example, the demand of Chicago’s protesters to steal a place to live — i.e., “cancel rents and mortgages.”

The implication is that people should just get things because they want them, and their desires alone justify taking it from other people. As with the looting, there’s no mention of work, reciprocity, or any other form of assuming responsibility for one’s own life.

I’m here at Daley Plaza in the #Loop where protesters have gathered alongside @LTBcoalition with the following demands:

1. Lift the ban on rent control

2. Cancel rents & mortgages

3. Stop all evictions during this pandemic #ChicagoProtests pic.twitter.com/AgWNbRHbbA — Grace Del Vecchio (she/her) (@delvecchiograce) August 17, 2020

Despite the obvious injustice of redistributing wealth and power according to ancestry that reparations entail, support for it is high among influential Americans and growing among the left’s ignorant ground troops. It is fomented by making Americans believe racism is rampant, even though research suggests the United States may be the least racist country in the world.

Against the reality, 56 percent of American voters currently agree “American society is racist,” found a July Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. “In other signs of substantial shifts in views on race, more voters see racial bias as a feature of American society and support protests aimed at addressing it,” the journal said.

The poll uncovered a jump from zero Americans thinking white people are discriminated against in all earlier polls to 15 percent in its latest rendition, in July 2020. While there were big jumps in perceptions of discrimination against all politically potent racial groups, the perception of anti-white racism was by far the largest percentage increase.

As numerous observers have pointed out, pushing Americans to think of themselves in terms of skin color and to allocate resources according to a politicized ethnicity scrum is a very, very dangerous game. Those playing it are currently winning big. But the nation stands to lose everything.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/19/where-black-lives-matter-rioters-learned-to-call-looting-reparations/,2020-08-19
NYU Student Group Advocates For Racially Segregated Housing,"A student task force at New York University who call themselves the Black Violets, are pushing for segregated housing in dormitories. The Black Violets created a petition in July to establish floors specifically for black students in NYU student housing.

The petition, which currently has over 1,000 signatures, reads “We, members of the Black student body, demand that NYU implement Black student housing on campus in the vein of themed engagement floors across first-year and upperclassmen residence halls.” The first demand listed on the petition is to create “floors completely comprised of Black-identifying students with Black Resident Assistants.”

Nai Robinson, co-founder of the Black Violets, told Washington Street News that currently black students are not cared for on NYU’s campus. “There is nothing to protect us,” Robinson said. “Literally no systems in place. What do you do when your professor is racist and wants to take it out on your grades? Microaggressions in classroom discussions?”

The Black Violets outlined other initiatives they are focusing on which include hiring black professors in the political science department and creating a black student lounge on campus.

The university could not be immediately reached for comment but a university spokesperson, John Beckman, told Washington Street News:

“We appreciate the petition authors’ position. Res Life staff have reached out to the authors of the petition to discuss how we might move forward with their goals. Given the COVID-related challenges to the student housing system for 2020-2021, these conversations would be aiming towards 2021-2022.”

NYU is not the first university to see a push towards segregation in housing. In 2016 California State University implemented the Halisi Scholars Black Living-Learning Community. The residential community is “designed to enhance the residential experience for students who are a part of or interested in issues of concern to the black community.”

Recently, the movement to segregate housing in colleges has been reignited with schools seriously considering the move to create black-only residential floors. In 2019 the National Association of Scholars surveyed 173 universities and found that almost half have segregated residence halls and almost three-quarters have segregated graduation ceremonies.

6 Quick Takeaways From First Night Of Republican National Convention,"The Republican National Convention had a better first night than the Democratic National Convention had any night last week. Here are six quick takeaways.

1. DNC’s Problem Was Not That It Was Virtual

Last week’s Democratic National Convention was barely watchable. People assumed that was because the Chinese coronavirus forced the convention to be held virtually. But the Republican National Convention is also being held virtually, and it was full of energy and excitement that was completely lacking at the Democratic convention.

Democrats had celebrity hosts, celebrity appearances, and all the talent of the generally liberal media to work with, yet their convention was an absolute grind to get through. Last night, Republicans moved along at a clipped pace, featured genuinely compelling stories, and the speeches drew contrasts with political opponents.

While some Republican speeches were markedly better than others, the only speech that didn’t land was attorney and television personality Kimberly Guilfoyle’s, which was shouted. Her speech would have benefited dramatically from a live audience.

2. Real People Nearly Stole The Show

Most pundits spent time talking about speeches by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley or current South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Particularly in Scott’s case, the professional politicians did give good speeches. But the most exciting parts of the evening were speeches from everyday Americans.

The best speech of the evening was given by Maximo Alvarez, a Florida businessman who described his family fleeing Communist systems on their way to the United States. “I have seen people like this before,” he said, describing leftist totalitarian movements. When he said, “I’m speaking to you today because my family is done leaving places. There is nowhere left to go,” it was more powerful than a thousand speeches from professional politicians.

Andrew Pollack, the father of Meadow Pollack, who was murdered in the Parkland High School shooting, beautifully memorialized his daughter and talked about the government failures that helped contribute to her death. He condemned the media for focusing on gun control when it was education policy that actually led to his daughter and her classmates being vulnerable.

The only famous person to speak was Herschel Walker, the football star. He talked about his decades-long friendship with President Donald Trump and praised his work on behalf of black Americans. He also told a story about Trump going with his family to Disneyland and riding the “It’s A Small World” ride with him. It was such an unexpected anecdote.

3. How to Do Cross-Partisan Outreach

One of the few continuous themes of the Democratic National Convention was that some Republicans support Joe Biden for president. But the people they had speak could not have been swampier.

Susan Molinari, who took her dad’s seat in Congress, is better known as Google’s former top lobbyist. She made millions lobbying for Russia, too. John Kasich, who lost to Trump in 2016, left Congress for a lucrative job at Lehman Brothers, lasting until it declared bankruptcy as a result of its participation in the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008.

Christine Todd Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey and scion of a wealthy and well-connected family, was also featured. She began speaking against the Republican Party midway through the George W. Bush administration and is known for her support of abortion rights and environmental regulations. An average supposed Republican featured at the Democratic convention turned out to have voted Democrat in four of the last five elections.

By contrast, the Republican convention featured Vernon Jones, a black Democrat Georgia state representative, talking about why he supports Trump. He said when he came out for Trump, “all hell broke loose” and he faced a great deal of criticism.

Walker also talked last night about how he had been raised to be a Democrat but that he doesn’t know what Democrats stand for now. Kimberly Klacik, a black woman running as a Republican for Congress in Baltimore, talked about how her city has a number of black Republicans running to improve the situation for residents of the city. Sen. Tim Scott talked about Biden’s racist comments against black people voting Republican. All discussed how black voters are taken for granted in the Democratic Party.

Unlike a Google lobbyist endorsing Biden, a black Democrat state rep endorsing Trump publicly takes courage. Sean Parnell, running for Congress in Pennsylvania, made an explicit appeal to Democrats considering voting Republican: “In our tent, you are free.”

4. Tackle Democratic Race-Baiting Head On

One major theme of the Democratic convention was that America is a racial hell-hole and Donald Trump is racist. It is quite typical for Democrats and other political groups to incite or exploit racial hatred, prejudice, or tension for political gain around the time of elections. While black voters are some of Democrats’ most reliable supporters, fear of a larger segment of them being recruited by Trump has led to particular hysteria among Democratic strategists this election season.

The typical Republican response is to cower in fear or respond defensively that they are not racist. But the first night of this convention was not that at all. At this convention, Republicans traded defense for offense.

Whether it was Jones or Klacik speaking about their frustrations with how Democrats handle race issues, Haley describing the racism she faced as a little brown girl growing up in South Carolina, Walker talking about how offended he gets when people claim his friend Trump is racist, or Scott describing how his family went from “cotton to Congress in a lifetime,” the speeches and rhetoric weren’t timid or tiptoeing around issues but tackling them head on. It was a surprising change of pace.

5. Embrace, Redefine Trump Criticism

All elections are about choices, and good campaigns will make those choices clear. For Democrats, their monomaniacal focus at their convention was that Bad Orange Man Is Bad. Some speeches accused him of murder, others of destroying democracy, others of being racist.

This was not an unwise choice for them given that unseating Trump has been the one unifying goal of a Democratic Party otherwise in disarray and on the brink of a civil war. In this vein, Biden was mostly a tool to enable this goal rather than a candidate that people genuinely rallied around. However, they worked hard to say Joe would be a nice guy.

But the limitations of that policy were on full display when speaker after speaker dispatched the complaints against Trump with ease. Rep. Matt Gaetz said Trump “raises his voice and a ruckus” because he needs to in order to get patriots fighting on behalf of the country. Pollack said that Trump had no time for “B.S.” Others said he wasn’t “politically correct.” Others said he talked “tough” or told the truth.

And speaker after speaker talked about Trump reaching out to them and showing kindness — a side that is not portrayed by many in the media.

Nobody said the criticisms of Trump were completely without merit. How could they? But they showed not just that there are alternative ways of viewing Trump aside from inside-the-beltway groupthink, but that such alternative ways are far more compelling than the reflexive scorn he receives from the media and other activists.

6. Focus On Policy

One of the many misconceptions about Trump’s victory in 2016 was that he won only because people disliked Hillary Clinton. While she was strongly disliked, so was he. The differences in policy should not be overlooked.

Trump’s 2016 campaign emphasized policy, and his voters had no confusion about where he stood on strong borders, trade with China, lengthy wars, nominating good judges, and other key issues that animate voters. While the first night of the Republican National Convention focused on policy about as much as most Republican conventions do, which is a fair amount, it really did highlight the unforced error by Democrats to leave policy out of their convention in favor of just tearing down Trump.

It remains to be seen whether Republicans can keep the excitement and energy flowing for the remainder of the convention.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/25/6-quick-takeaways-from-the-first-night-of-the-republican-national-convention/,2020-08-25
One In Five Black Male College Students Support Trump In New Poll,"A new Knight Foundation-College Pulse survey out this month shows one in five black male college students said if the election were held today, they would be casting their vote for President Donald Trump.

The poll, conducted Aug. 9-12 and interviewed 4,000 undergraduates in full-time four-year programs at American universities, revealed Trump’s support among black male students is virtually the same among white female college students where 20 percent reported being in favor of Trump with a +/-2 percent margin of error.

Trump’s support among female black students however, is practically absent at 2 percent, within the margin of error for zero and is unlikely to bounce following former Vice President Joe Biden’s pick of a black woman, California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. On the other hand, Trump’s relatively high support among black male college students likely comes in part from the Republican administration’s restoration of funding for Historically Black Colleges.

While the Knight Foundation survey is narrowed in scope to current college students enrolled in four-year programs, the results provide a glimpse into Trump’s support among the next generation of voters that possesses implications for November and future elections.

While Democrats embrace the latest signature call from the contemporary civil rights movement of Black Lives Matter to defund the police, a Gallup poll conducted in late July shows 81 percent of black Americans actually want the same amount or more law enforcement protection in their communities, not less. Democrats in Minneapolis however, voted unanimously to disband the city’s police department in June. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio slashed the department’s budget by $1 billion even as crime skyrockets in the city. On the West Coast, Seattle’s first black female police chief resigned when the city voted to cut department funding and dock her pay 40 percent.

“This was a difficult decision for me, but when it’s time, it’s time,” said Chief Carmen Best.

Trump however, remains deeply underwater with black voters overall, which have historically been a key voting bloc for the Democratic Party for the last five decades. A Washington Post-Ispos poll showed 92 percent of black Americans reported their support for Biden over Trump in a June survey. In 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the black vote with 88 percent to Trump’s 8.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/25/one-in-five-black-male-college-students-support-trump-in-new-poll/,2020-08-25
Racist White Guy At Mother Jones Calls Tim Scott And Herschel Walker Uncle Toms,"Some white guy named Tommy Craggs who is the enterprise editor (whatever that is) at Mother Jones has a message for black conservatives like Sen. Tim Scott, former NFL great Herschel Walker, and congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik. Tommy wants them to know that they are being used by racist Republicans who are just dying to say the N-word.

In a piece subtitled, “Your nightly guide to racism at the Republican National Convention,” Craggs calls the black speakers at last night’s convention the GOP’s “black friends.” See, Tommy knows a lot about racism, he’s probably read at least one book about it and he knows better than a black sitting US Senator from the Deep South about what it is.

What was the evidence for this charge of racism? It was Mark and Patricia McCloskey talking about defending their homes and maintaining the suburbs. For progressives like Tommy, if you oppose putting low income housing in the suburbs, you are a racist because apparently all poor people in the United States are black. And that’s it. That is literally all the alleged racism Craggs could find in the convention and on the basis of that he smeared black people as basically traitors to their race being used by evil white Republicans.

It really is shocking that in this day and age, white progressives still feel free to lecture grown black people about what their politics should be when doing so is exactly what these black people, especially Klacik are specifically saying they reject. It could not prove the point more forcefully. Here is a young black woman trying to make a difference in her community by rejecting decades of incompetent Democratic leadership in Baltimore and Craggs thinks she should shut up, stay in her place, and line up behind Joe Biden and the Democrats.

It is becoming clear that the reason progressives are so obsessed with racism is that they are themselves racist. You are not an individual to them unless you are white. White people can be good (progressive) or bad (conservative) just as people, not as a representative of their race. Tim Scott on the other hand, isn’t just bad; he is a foolish puppet who should know better than being used to obscure the alleged racism of those who do not support the left’s agenda. It is frankly disgusting.

I think a good way to work all of this out would be for Tommy Craggs to meet Herschel Walker in person and explain to him why he is an Uncle Tom giving cover to racists who he thinks are his friends. I’m sure Walker would be very grateful. After all, what black person doesn’t want a white progressive lecturing them about what being black means? That’s what white progressives exist for.

Maybe Craggs could also give Walker some tips on how to find the hole on an off-tackle running play; he’s probably an expert on that too. Being as tone deaf and condescending, as Craggs should be shocking, but isn’t. This is who progressives are and they are absolutely terrified that some black people are seeing through their racist charade.

The Redskins: One More Thing The Wealthy Took From Blue-Collar Locals,"The first Washington Redskins game I remember attending was their November 10, 1991 dismantling of the Atlanta Falcons during their last Super Bowl season. I was not yet eight years old.

Thanks largely to my father, who had been cheering for the Redskins since he was a kid in 1960s Alabama (the owner at the time, George Preston Marshall, had effectively promoted the team on television in the South), I was a diehard fan. Of course, I remember the eight touchdowns the boys in Burgundy and Gold scored that day. My most vivid memory was not athletic, but social — it was the first time in my life I was immersed in black culture.

I grew up in what was at the time one of the outer D.C. suburbs of Virginia. Back then, its rural character was still visible in pockets, but it was increasingly being overrun by suburban sprawl. It was predominantly white. Driving up for the game that day, we sat in a part of old RFK Stadium that was largely patronized by black Americans.

My father seemed to be at home in that setting. Some of his closest friends in Alabama were black. He had lived in predominantly black neighborhoods when attending college in Richmond. And, at a time many medical professionals refused to go into Anacostia, the most violent part of the District, he agreed to make house calls to serve the neighborhood’s mostly black residents. Witnessing my father’s convivial spirit, all of us cheering our home team on together, I felt a deep, communal bond with Washington’s black American fans.

Since the newly christened “Washington Football Team” surrendered to woke capital and agreed to change its name in July, I’ve been reminded of that experience. Certainly, the Washington Post had been urging the name change for decades, alongside many liberal activists who accused the franchise of perpetuating racist, demeaning stereotypes.

The region’s educated elite can also probably be added to that list. Indeed, when the Washington Post in 2013 conducted a poll of D.C. residents, they found that 34 percent of all area college graduates wanted the team to change its name, compared to 21 percent of those with “less formal education.”

Despite the team’s years of mediocrity and failure, the Redskins remained the most popular team among the area’s black residents. That points to an interesting and important divide in the nation’s capital. Indeed, as a 2011 Post article observed, “the Redskins have an unrivaled hold on Washington’s black community.” At that time, two-thirds of black American fans had a favorable view of the team and four in 10 felt that way “strongly.” As the authors noted, black pastors in D.C. dismissed their parishioners to not miss kickoff, while D.C. teachers gave their mostly black students problems that found creative ways to incorporate the Redskins and their arch-rivals, the Cowboys.

Consider, in contrast, the fanbase of the Washington Nationals, the city’s most popular team, which last year brought the city its first World Series title since 1924. Nationals fans are far more likely to be white, as well as middle-class or upper-middle-class. They are the team of the city’s technocratic transplants, exemplified in the viral video of the celebrating Nats fan who, asked how long he’s been cheering for the team responded, “Since today!” As a suburban Virginian friend of mine pointed out to me, Nationals Park (pre-COVID) is typically filled with K Street insiders texting on their phones.

Whereas the Redskins franchise, to its deserved shame, has a penchant for sexual harassment and misogyny, the Nationals play by the rules of woke culture, further earning the support of the city’s changing demographic. When it was discovered that star shortstop Trea Turner was responsible for some “homophobic” tweets while in college, the team quickly forced him to apologize.

“There are no excuses for my insensitive and offensive language on Twitter,” Turner soon admitted, while Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo labeled Turner’s comments “inexcusable” and declared that he had spoken with the shortstop. One of the team’s most dominant relievers, Sean Doolittle, is annoyingly vocal in his liberal politics.

The divide between the Nationals and the Redskins, and their respective fanbases, exemplifies the divisions both of the D.C. area and the nation. The Nationals (who, God bless ‘em, I’ve loved and supported since their first game in 2005), is the team of the globalist, meritocratic, Johnny-come-lately, unprincipled “nowheres.” The Redskins are the team of blue-collar, multi-generational “somewheres,” who are willing to maintain their allegiance to a team that hasn’t been consistently good in 30 years.

Nats fans represent the winners of our globalist, technocratic system; Skins fans embody the losers. Ironically, despite all the burnishing of their woke credentials, the Nationals, and their largely white fanbase have been pilloried by black D.C. natives for gentrification that has priced established black families out of their historic neighborhoods, including the very one where the Nats currently play.

I recently took my car to my local mechanic, like me, a Northern Virginia native who grew up cheering for the Redskins. Discussing the team’s name-change announcement, he shook his head and muttered, “Some people just need to find something to get offended about.”

Although he grew up in Fairfax County, he can no longer afford to live there on his mechanic’s salary and resides more than 20 miles to the south. As the famous “Saturday Night Live” black Jeopardy skit with Tom Hanks demonstrated, blue-collar whites often have more in common with blacks than many realize. The Redskins are yet one more thing leftist transplants have taken from people with real allegiances to a place and its culture.

While we talked, I spotted another mechanic, a Latino, in the garage wearing a dirty, backward Redskins hat (backwards, I suppose the woke mob would say, in more ways than one). Presumably a descendant of Spaniards and indigenous American peoples, he obviously doesn’t take offense to the name or the accompanying image of a proud Native American warrior.

No matter. Everyone who sports Redskins paraphernalia, notably the salt-of-the-earth blue-collar folk who make every city in this country function, must all be bigots, rather than real people trying to identify in meaningful ways with their communities and take pride in their local teams.

The most interesting story in Washington, D.C. sports in 2020 isn’t the football franchise’s name change, nor is it whether its baseball team will be able to repeat the success of 2019 (unlikely at this point, given their many injuries). It’s what the divergence between its two fanbases says about the city and an increasingly divided nation.

6 Quick Takeaways From Third Night Of Republican National Convention,"The third night of the Republican National Convention focused on a theme of “heroes,” and continued to highlight everyday Americans. It ended with Vice President Mike Pence’s speech in the dramatic setting of Fort McHenry, where the “Star-Spangled Banner” flew and inspired the country’s national anthem. Here are a few takeaways from the third night of the Republican National Convention.

1. A Return to Realism In Foreign Policy

At the Democratic convention, Joe Biden and his co-partisans said very little about foreign policy. They mentioned China, the country’s greatest geopolitical foe, only once. Proponents and participants in various failed foreign policy interventions in recent decades did come out to endorse him, and the media presented that as a plus rather than a negative.

At the Republican convention, multiple speakers articulated a Republican foreign policy based on the national interest. Keith Kellogg, the vice president’s national security advisor, gave a wonderful speech. Subtly mocking fired National Security Advisor John Bolton, Kellogg said:

Over the past three and a half years, I have witnessed every major foreign policy and national security decision by the president. I have been in the room where it happened. I saw only one agenda and one guiding question when tough calls had to be made…is this decision right for America?… Ask yourself, has this president kept his promises…to keep us out of needless conflicts and to pursue ending wars without end? Has he defended your interests in renegotiating trade deals that previously hurt Americans and our national security? Has he fulfilled his Commander in Chief role by decisively going after our Nation’s enemies? You and I know, the answer is yes. The choice is clear.

Later, former Ambassador to Germany and former Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grennell gave an impressive speech. Of Trump, he said, “He called America’s endless wars what they were: A disaster. The media was shocked because Donald Trump was running as a Republican. And yet he said out loud what we all knew. That American foreign policy was failing to make Americans safer.”

In four years, Donald Trump didn’t start any new wars. He brought troops home. He rebuilt the military, and signed peace deals that make Americans safer. The Washington elites want you to think this kind of foreign policy is immoral. And so they call it ‘nationalist.’ That tells you all you need to know. The DC crowd thinks when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they’re insulting him. As if the American president isn’t supposed to base foreign policy on America’s national interests!

The interventionism of recent decades was actually an aberration from Republican foreign policy. In addition to being ineffective, expensive, deadly, and leading to tremendously bad foreign policy outcomes, it was also electorally harmful.

Americans want a strong military but one that is extremely cautious about getting involved in war. And when war is called for, Americans want a clear strategy, particular outcomes that are being sought, and an exit strategy that is far shorter than, for example, our 19 years in Afghanistan.

2. Substantive Outreach to Black Voters

Hours after the evening’s events concluded, the Associated Press posted a story about the convention that was so at odds with reality that it seemed to have been written before the convention began. The article by Russ Bynum was headlined “At RNC, GOP echoes racial code of Nixon’s 1968 campaign,” and claimed the Republicans were “manipulating racial divisions to unite white voters.”

In the real world, each night of the Republican Convention has had speaker after speaker make an overt appeal for black voters to join the Republican Party and support President Donald Trump. In years past, Republican conventions have featured a few black people talking about how and why they were voting Republican.

At this convention, white and black speakers have focused on policy achievements that appeal to black voters, such as job gains for black men and women, increased funding for historically black colleges and universities, and criminal justice reform. Black friends of Trump have talked about their friendship with him. And black civil rights leaders have talked about the Republican Party’s history of sustained policy achievements for black people.

For years, the media and other Democratic activists have done what the Associated Press did last night — throw out a claim that the GOP is racist and wait for Republicans to cower in defeat. Concern about the inroads Trump was making with black voters alarmed Democratic leaders, who began race-baiting the election even earlier than usual, hyping racial grievance events in cities across the country.

What’s different about this year’s Republican National Convention and the current Republican Party is that unlike all the previous years, everyone seems eager and ready to fight the slurs from the media and other Democrats.

Last night, former NFL player Jack Brewer said, “I know what racism looks like, I’ve seen it firsthand. In America, it has no resemblance to President Trump and I’m fed up with the way he’s portrayed in the media, who refuse to acknowledge what he’s actually done for the black community.”

He asked, “Are you going to allow the media to lie to you by falsely claiming that he said there are very fine white supremacists in Charlottesville? He didn’t say that, it’s a lie.” Biden has made that lie a centerpiece of his campaign.

Vice President Mike Pence, who gave the keynote address, was smart enough to highlight the unchecked riots and violence raging in Democratic cities across the country, made far easier by the Democrats ignoring the topic at their convention last week and even suggesting support for the violent protests.

“We will have law and order on the streets of America for every American of every race and creed and color!” Pence said, receiving a standing ovation. “The American people know we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with African American neighbors to improve the quality of life in our cities and towns.”

These quotes show that the Associated Press was lying in their hit piece. They also show what a remarkably crappy job Republicans have done with black voter outreach prior to now.

Chuck Todd of MSNBC said recently, “Both campaigns tell me that there is a chance that Donald Trump could overperform with African American men. It’s a concern of the Biden campaign and it’s a focus of the Trump campaign.”

3. Strong Pro-Life Speakers

Two nights ago featured a heavy-hitter lineup of pro-life speakers, but last night did, too. Sister Deidre Byrne, a surgeon, Army colonel, and now sister in the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary spoke about “the largest marginalized group in the world” — “the unborn.”

As followers of Christ, we are called to stand up for life and against the politically correct or fashionable today. We must fight against a legislative agenda that supports and even celebrates destroying life in the womb. In fact, the laws we create define how we see our humanity. And we must ask ourselves, what are we saying when we go into a womb and snuff out an insignificant, powerless, voiceless life… Which brings me to why I’m here tonight. Donald Trump is the most pro-life President that this nation has ever had, defending life at all stages. His belief in the sanctity of life transcends politics. President Trump will stand up against Biden/Harris who are the most anti-life presidential ticket ever, even supporting the horrors of late-term abortion and infanticide.

Tera Lee Myers, who works on school choice issues, spoke of her son with Down syndrome and how doctors tried to get her to kill him in the womb. She told a story of how President Trump invited her son Samuel to the White House.

And retired Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz gave an affectionate speech about Trump. He said that one of the reasons he trusts Trump is because of his commitment to the pro-life cause.

4. Chen Guangcheng

One of the most riveting speeches was given by pro-life hero and Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, who was persecuted for speaking out against China’s “one-child policy,” a policy Biden has publicly countenanced. Reading his speech in Braille, Chen described some of the horrors of the Communist Chinese system:

The CCP is focused on power and control, and acts without regard to the law or to human rights. Countless activists have disappeared or are under house arrest. Just consider the sad plight of the Uyghurs in concentration camps. Outside its borders, the CCP ignores international treaties and norms, whether it is violating the rights of Hong Kong, cheating on trade deals, threatening Taiwan, or exploiting the World Health Organization. The coronavirus pandemic, originating in China—and covered up by the CCP—has caused mass death and social upheaval around the world. In the same way, the virus of the CCP is threatening the people of the world. The policy of appeasement of former administrations—including Obama and Biden—has allowed the CCP to infiltrate and corrode different aspects of the global community. The Chinese Communist Party goes through the dance of diplomacy . . . but it seeks to make the rest of the world bow to its authoritarian vision. The CCP is waiting patiently for the US and other democracies to bend to its will under fear of economic retribution.

It was a far cry from the Democratic Convention, which did not mention China but once. Chen ended by endorsing Trump.

5. Media Spiraling

The media gushed over the Democratic National Convention, even though it was dark and depressing. By contrast, many in the media have lashed out against the Republican Convention, sometimes ridiculously so.

Reporters got upset that Pence accurately described the Wuhan coronavirus as coming from China.

NBC News veteran Andrea Mitchell was upset that Pence fist-bumped a disabled war veteran after his speech. “Social distancing,” she tweeted.

Rachel Maddow of MSNBC broke away from South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s speech because Maddow felt it was “very wrong” to say that cities have been hit hard by crime and looting. She brought on Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan to dispute the claim. Earlier this week, Seattle rioters tried to seal police officers inside a building using quick-dry cement, in order to kill them.

Some reporters were mad that Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York spoke from his own district in, well, New York. He spoke from Westhampton on Long Island, which reporters confused with nicer parts of the area.

Early in the evening, Madison Cawthorn, the Republican candidate for North Carolina’s 11th District, spoke from his wheelchair. Severely injured in a car crash when he was 20, Cawthorn is partially paralyzed. At the end of his speech, he lifted himself out of his wheelchair to deliver his final lines, “Be a radical for our republic. For which I stand. One nation. Under God. With liberty and justice for all.”

Yamiche Alcindor, an activist journalist employed by PBS and MSNBC, was outraged.

6. Stagecraft And Enthusiasm

Conventions in recent years have become much more focused on TV presentations than substantive locations of discussion and debate. This year made that even more pronounced as the coronavirus restrictions killed the lively debate about platforms. But the stagecraft is important and this year it’s been excellent. The setting of Pence’s speech was beautiful. And the evenings have had nice themes that get revisited throughout.

Cawthorn stood up at the end of his speech. Guangcheng repeatedly talked about how difficult it is to “stand up to tyranny.” And when Pence concluded his speech, Trace Adkins came out to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” When he did so, a group of disabled war veterans got up, some with great difficulty, and stood with respect for the country they serve and its symbols.

Democrats pushed a simple theme of “darkness vs. light,” at one point having Biden kind of walk from the dark into the light. Unfortunately, his last moments at his convention were shrouded under a dark mask on a dark stage outside.

Last night, Ari Fleischer commented on how new it was to see large groups of people praising Donald Trump. He said that conventions that repeat platitudes don’t move voters but ones that give people something new to reflect on do.

Because of the media being so hysterically anti-Trump and suppressing the news, this convention is the first time in about four years that non-leftist Americans have seen other Americans reflecting their positive views about Trump and the administration. It’s emboldening for Republican and Independent voters as they prepare for the fall campaign that will surely include many surprises.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/27/6-quick-takeaways-from-third-night-of-republican-national-convention/,2020-08-27
Behind Trump's Pardon To African American Who Helps Prisoners Restart,"Less than 24 hours after Black Lives Matter activists torched Kensoha, Wisconsin, in the name of racial justice, President Donald Trump granted a surprise pardon to Jon Ponder, a black man and convicted bank robber who turned his life around and now devotes his work to helping others do the same.

“Jon, we honor your devotion to showing returning citizens that they are not forgotten,” Trump said from the White House. “I will continue to give all Americans, including former inmates, the best chance to build a new life and achieve their own American dream.”

In 2009, Ponder founded a prisoners’ reentry program called Hope for Prisoners in Las Vegas, Nevada. Upon his release after spending much of his life behind bars, Ponder experienced firsthand the challenges of reentering society and decided to do something to change it.

Hope for Prisoners assists men and women in reentering society after prison by providing them long-term support and services, such as job training, mentorship, and counseling. In 2012, as part of the program, Hope for Prisoners formed an unprecedented partnership with the Las Vegas Police Department. The partnership encourages police officers to engage with and mentor former inmates. Today, it involves more than 60 members of the department.

In the shadows of a national “defund the police” movement, this partnership reflects the important role police play not just in terms of law enforcement, but also in building meaningful relationships in the communities they serve. After speaking with Ponder and graduates of his program for Independent Women’s Forum, I learned how this aspect of the Hope for Prisoners’ program is mutually beneficial for both law enforcement officers and those they serve.

Hope for Prisoners enables former inmates to see police officers as human beings who put their lives on the line to fulfill the promise they made to protect and serve. At the same time, it affords police officers the opportunity to learn more about the long, complex, and painful life circumstances that often lead to arrests and incarceration. The partnership fosters empathy on both sides and is a model this nation desperately needs.

The partnership is so successful, some former inmates and cops have become lifelong friends. In May 2012, for example, after being arrested, Lois Hockersmith woke up in a hospital with three people by her side: a doctor, a police officer, and a priest. An undercover officer had picked her up for drugs and prostitution, and she had to deliver her 25-week-old son with whom she was too high to know she was pregnant. Miraculously, he survived.

Hockersmith, who was 35 at the time, grew up hating the cops and never went to them for help. But after realizing this officer saved not only her life but also her unborn son’s, she decided to enroll in Hope for Prisoners and turn her life around. As part of the healing process, Hockersmith set out to thank the officer who arrested her that night.

“Go figure, he turned out to actually be one of our trainers here at Hope,” Hockersmith said. Today, like Ponder and FBI agent Richard Beasley, who arrested and mentored him, the two remain close friends.

“Him and I actually teach together,” Hockersmith said. “On my son’s birthday, we go out and celebrate his birthday together with him and his kids.”

That’s Nice — But Let’s Still Cancel Him

Ponder’s story of faith, healing, and redemption is one all Americans should be able to rally behind. On cue because he spoke at the RNC, however, the media sought to cancel him.

“JON PONDER’s story is inspirational,” wrote Kenneth P. Vogel, a reporter for the New York Times. “But should he be endorsing a candidate for president while being identified as the founder & CEO of Hope for Prisoners, which — as a 501(c)(3) non-partisan non-profit group — is barred from participating in partisan politics?”

Vogel (@kenvogel) August 26, 2020

Of course, Vogel failed to mention that while federal tax laws do prohibit 501(c)(3) groups from being used for partisan electioneering, they don’t ban individuals who happen to work at them from having political opinions and sharing them publicly. Perhaps Vogel forgot about former President Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea, who ran the Clinton Foundation for years while campaigning for Hillary Clinton, or Michelle Obama, who co-chairs When We All Vote.

Ponder deserved to be pardoned and prominently featured at the RNC. Moreover, it wasn’t about political opportunism. Trump took notice of Ponder far before “defunding the police” and Black Lives Matter became national protests, riots, and debates.

President Trump and Jon Ponder Go Back

Trump first met Ponder two years ago when the latter was a guest on the National Day of Prayer. The president took a liking to Ponder’s story and work and accepted an opportunity to speak at Hope for Prisoners’ graduation ceremony earlier this year. As he mentioned while granting Ponder an emotional, surprise pardon, Trump stayed at the graduation “for an hour and a half because it was so interesting to me,” instead of the five minutes that were originally scheduled. His support of Ponder’s program reflects the president’s genuine interest in criminal justice reform, which in 2018 resulted in a sweeping bipartisan federal prison and sentencing bill.

In pardoning Ponder and featuring him at the RNC, Trump did more than pay lip service to black Americans, who make up more than 38 percent of the inmate population despite representing only 14 percent of the general population. He closed a long, painful chapter in Ponder’s past and honored his role in enabling an estimated 3,000 former inmates to do the same.

Moreover, Trump not only recognized a man that’s giving former inmates a second chance. He shined a spotlight on an effort that’s giving law enforcement a second chance to build meaningful relationships with the communities they serve. If caring about black lives means more than a slogan, let’s hope Ponder’s model is replicated nationwide, with support from both sides.

Marsha Blackburn On The State Of Conservatism In 2020: Can We Shrink Government And Preserve American Values?,"On today’s edition of The Federalist Radio Hour, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) discusses her new book “The Mind of a Conservative Woman: Seeking the Best for Family and Country,” which explains her political philosophy. In an interview with Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky, Blackburn addresses recent outbreaks of leftist violence, the GOP’s culture war-themed RNC, Taylor Swift’s comments about her election to the Senate, GOP spending, and Big Tech monopolies.

Blackburn emphasized the importance of philosophers like Edmund Burke and Milton Friedman, and argued that civic institutions like 4-H are essential to our social fabric. She also addressed whether new GOP proposals to take on China and Big Tech are anti-conservative.

“I think this is the time for conservative women to step up and take their place in leadership because we have seen this culture war grow and grow and conservative women have been pushed aside and have been treated like fourth-class citizens by the mainstream press,” Sen. Blackburn said. “Why is it if you’re pro-life, pro-family, pro-business, pro-military, they will shun you and they will glorify and glamorize liberal women?”

Chadwick Boseman Is Gone But Will Never Be Forgotten,"Being an actor is a hard dollar. It is a litany of rejection, of “no thank you” without the “thank you.” It is waking up every day after having been told no and believing that a yes is coming. There are two types, those who are just delusional and those who just need their chance. Chadwick Boseman was the latter and we should all be grateful that he got his chance because he gave us performances that will not only outlive his too short life, but also all of ours.

I would like to be able to explain why some people sparkle on stage and screen and others don’t. I can’t. It is metaphysical magic; it captures us precisely because we can’t explain it. And Boseman had whatever that that elusive thing is in spades. You had to watch him. You can’t teach that, it’s a natural gift that he exuded in every role he played.

Boseman was best known for playing two superheroes, one real and one imagined. Playing Jackie Robinson in “42” Boseman captured the tortured heroism of the first black man in Major League Baseball. He brought through the silver screen the great triumph that was Robinson’s career, but also the toll that blazing that trail took on him. It is an elegant performance worthy of the Hall of Fame baseball star he portrayed. On its own it would cement him as one of the great actors of his generation.

But of course this is not what the Howard University trained actor is best known for. No. He in fact blazed his own trail not unlike Jackie Robinson as the first black actor to star in a Marvel movie as the stand-alone super hero. Black Panther. How complicated and multi-coded those two words have become. But for millions of kids and movie fans, it means one thing; it means a black super hero that belongs to all of us.

This was a performance of a lifetime from an actor taken from us all to soon. His turn in this role that he will define forever was the epitome of grace. Too nice by far was his portrayal of the king of Wakanda until it had to be dirty, and even then, even having vanquished his foe it returned to his natural posture of humility and profound understanding of the human condition. That is what actors do. They understand what drives us, what lies beneath our actions. Boseman held what Shakespeare called the mirror up to nature.

We will not get to see Chadwick Boseman play King Lear, or explore the intricacies of Chekhov and Ibsen. More the pity. But we can celebrate what he left us. The artist does not measure his worth in money or fame. The artist measures it in the impact he has on his audience. Boseman took our breath away, and while he may breath no longer, his portrayal of Black Panther will live forever.

Eulogists more gifted than I am will extol what his performance meant to young black kids, and yes that is true. But my own son, 10 years old, who is not black, found in his performance a man he wants to emulate. Boseman did not give us a black super hero; he gave a super hero. Full stop.

Life and death are capricious in their devastating ways. This thin line of being and experiencing what we perceive as reality is always taken away too fast. We cannot help but think in Boseman’s case it was too fast, that his enormous gifts should have been granted to us longer. It was not to be.

This is a loss. We must let ourselves feel it. It is unfair, it is ugly, it is wrong. But Chadwick Boseman was a great actor. He lived a dream most see extinguished because he was remarkable. Yes, we must mourn his passing, but we must also celebrate what he gave us. He had chops. Anyone who ever stood upon stage knows it and everyone else does too. This is a tough loss. But let us never forget what he did.

He is literally a super hero and he always will be.

Study: Schools Hide Planned Parenthood's Extermination Of The 'Unfit',"How did you learn about the Progressive Era in school? Did you learn a lot about “social justice” and “political reform”? Chances are that you did not hear much about eugenics, a defining feature of the Progressive movement that took the late 19th and early 20th century by storm.

A recent study by Professor Thomas Cargill, published by the Independent Institute, looked at nine of the most popular high school history books in the country and discovered they “ignore the topic” of eugenics, including the dark history of one of feminism’s most celebrated activists, Margaret Sanger. Sanger’s organization, The American Birth Control League (now named Planned Parenthood), continues to pursue eugenic outcomes to this day.

Progressive eugenics of the early 20th century held there is a scientific ability to classify individuals and groups as “fit” or “unfit,” classifying the “unfit” by race, mental and physical disabilities, country of origin, and poverty. Eugenics was very popular among the intelligentsia and elite class and became a hallmark of the Progressive movement.

Ending Fertility Based on Race, Disability, and Class

To carry out eugenics theory, eugenicists used birth control, restrictions on immigration, and restrictions on interracial marriage. Their birth control measures included voluntary, coerced, and forced sterilization. The majority of states in America implemented involuntary sterilization policies. Cargill says eugenics is one of the greatest and most terrifying examples of the dangers of big government.

Of the nine U.S. history high school textbooks Cargill examined, a few include a “passing reference” to eugenics and sterilization, but do not “identify eugenics as a major part of progressivism,” although the historical evidence shows it clearly was.

According to Cargill, “eugenics sanctified racism.” In Nazi Germany, Jewish people were the main target of eugenicists. In the United States, racial eugenics focused on black people. In both Nazi Germany and the United States, the disabled, the poor, and immigrants were victims of eugenicists seeking to rid the world of “undesirables.”

Before World War II, Cargill told The Federalist, the progressive movement’s laws in America were Germany’s “role model” for Nazi race laws. Adolf Hitler “admired” American eugenics policies and even gave them a shout out in his famous book, “Mein Kampf.” In his review of high school textbooks, Cargill discovered that “eugenics and its influence on public policy in the United States and its relationship to Nazi Germany are ignored and when mentioned are presented as an incidental part of U.S. history.”

According to Cargill, the fall of the Third Reich revealed the logical outcome of eugenics, causing it to disappear “almost overnight” from public discourse. It quickly became an embarrassment to many who had openly supported it. This is what inspired the rebrand of Sanger’s “American Birth Control League” to its new and current name, “Planned Parenthood.”

Planned Parenthood Founder Sought to End Black Lives

Although Sanger is celebrated in schools as a feminist pioneer and a well-meaning advocate for women’s liberation, she was a key champion of eugenics. Her advocacy for birth control was rooted in her belief that society needed to rid itself of the “unfit.”

The American Birth Control League’s journal, the “Birth Control Review,” contains outright racist articles revealing Sanger’s true intentions. Sanger’s famous article, “A Plan for Peace” (1932), explicitly lays out her broad scheme to reduce the number of people classified as “unfit” by “apply[ing] a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation.” Cargill pointed out to The Federalist that Sanger’s “plan” to “segregate” calls to mind the horrors of Nazi concentration camps.

Sanger also instituted a “Negro Project,” which was advertised as a way to make “safe” contraception available to African Americans. However, Cargill told The Federalist it was actually implemented to “target” black Americans and “lower their birth rate.”

Sanger used black leaders to gain access to and trust in the black community. In a 1939 letter, Sanger wrote: “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.”

Sanger is referenced in six out of the nine U.S. high school textbooks. They present her as a “Progressive reformer and advocate of women’s reproductive rights.” Cargill’s research demonstrated that “none of the six textbooks” mention “she was a leading advocate of eugenics or of the racist perspective frequently found in the ‘Birth Control Review.’”

Cargill concludes that high school students reading any of the “widely used” textbooks he reviewed would be unaware of the fact that Sanger played a major role in “popularizing and rationalizing eugenics and eugenics-inspired policies,” and that she targeted African American populations.

Planned Parenthood Still Celebrates Sanger’s Vision

Despite its morally reprehensible legacy, particularly at a time Black Lives Matter and the Democrat Party are calling for a reckoning of America’s racist past and institutions, American schools continuously deny the disturbing and racist origins of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s number one abortion provider. Planned Parenthood continues to tout the fact they prioritize “service” to minorities in low-Caucasian neighborhoods.

Planned Parenthood to this day describes Sanger as “a woman of heroic accomplishments” and “a true visionary.” From 1966- 2015, Planned Parenthood presented an annual “Margaret Sanger Award,” which their website still describes as their “highest honor.” Recipients include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

Of Sanger, Hillary Clinton said, “I admire Margaret Sanger enormously, her courage, her tenacity, her vision… I am really in awe of her.” Even Barack Obama ended an address to an annual Planned Parenthood conference with “God bless” Planned Parenthood, something even some of his supporters found jarring, if not sacrilegious.

Planned Parenthood Funds Democrats, They Ignore Its Past

So why does the American education system ignore the full history of the Progressive movement? Now that Planned Parenthood and abortion are sacrosanct to contemporary leftists, Cargill theorizes, it is vital for “defenders of abortion” to attempt to “repackage” Sanger and get rid of the link between abortion and the eugenics of the Progressive movement.

The history of eugenics is “uncomfortable” for leftists, Cargill told The Federalist. Cargill wrote that progressives “ironically dismiss conservatives as fascists, Nazis, and racists who are insensitive to the weak.” In truth, those characteristics apply to progressives in the first part of the twentieth century.

The reason eugenics and Sanger have been allowed to be memory-holed from American schools is that “Progressives dominate the education system.” Cargill told The Federalist that progressives, “paint a picture of American society that is consistent with their ideology.” The result for unsuspecting students is “nothing short of the indoctrination of America’s youth.” Cargill says that memory-holing eugenics and Sanger gives “an incomplete and misleading view of U.S. history” to young Americans, which “denies them a foundation to participate in the democratic process.”

Abortion Still Overrepresented Among African Americans

Today, the vast majority of Planned Parenthood clinics remain in minority neighborhoods. According to a Centers for Disease Control report, black women undergo 34 percent of abortions in the United States, although they are only 13.4 percent of the U.S. population. According to the Charlotte Lozier Institute, black women in New York City have more abortions than live births.

While leftists and abortion supporters work hard to memory-hole their ideology’s eugenics past, white supremacists and contemporary Nazis are not shy about supporting abortion. The keynote speaker and organizer of the infamous 2017 Charlottesville rally was Richard Spencer, the notorious neo-Nazi, and white supremacist. During his speech, he explained how abortion advances white nationalist goals: “The people who are having abortions are generally very often black or Hispanic or from very poor circumstances.”

Save Money: Kill Kids Who Cost Extra

Eugenics hasn’t disappeared, either. “Advances in genetics,” says Cargill, “increase the probability that abortion will be used to reduce the ‘unfit’ population as defined by the woman and her medical provider.” These grave decisions, he explains, are “influenced by the administrative state through subsidization, information campaigns, and genetic counseling.”

Advancements in the genetic testing of unborn babies have profoundly affected the fate and societal acceptance of the mentally and physically challenged. For example, studies show that babies prenatally diagnosed with Down Syndrome, a genetic abnormality, are aborted at a rate of somewhere around 80- 90 percent.

This normalization of the prenatal extermination of the disabled could lead to a resurgence of the eugenics movement in the United States, particularly if socialized universal health care becomes law. In the name of decreasing costs, the government could force or in some way incentivize mothers to abort “unfit” unborn babies.

Cargill told The Federalist he is very worried about what the future holds now that the history of eugenics is being removed from our national memory. It is hard to deny that eugenics has seeped back into cultural acceptance, which Cargill believes is one consequence of allowing ideological narratives, rather than truth, to fill American history textbooks.

The Pseudo Science Behind Public Library Selection ‘Raising White Kids’,"Is scientific racism making a comeback, this time through social science and in the name of anti-racism? “Raising White Kids: Bringing Up Children In A Racially Unjust America” makes sane-sounding headway into the same lunatic territory.

The author, Jennifer Harvey, is a credentialed apostle of racial awakening, a doyenne of the “problem of whiteness.” Before opening her manual on race-conscious parenting, it is useful to recap the context that brought it to our libraries.

Back in 1967, Stokely Carmichael and political scientist Charles V. Hamilton changed the character of the civil rights movement with the publication of “Black Power.” The racism of today’s anti-racists is built on the fictions of that founding text: “No matter how ‘liberal’ a white person might be, he cannot ultimately escape the overpowering influence — on himself and on black people — of his whiteness in a racist society.”

Now, it appears the American Library Association has embraced the endgame initiated by Carmichael and Hamilton. Led by ALA directives, public libraries promote the same ideological challenge to existing institutions and ethical norms that dominate academia. Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech now draws criticism for ceding too much to bourgeois culture. Among today’s anti-racists, skin color trumps the content of character as a determinant of achievement.

In 1998, ALA leadership committed itself to five Key Action Areas on which to concentrate resources. The first key area was “diversity.” Engaged librarians promise to “decenter power and privilege” by employing “a social justice framework to ensure the inclusion of diverse perspectives.”

The ALA ensures those perspectives it deems ideologically sound. Among these are terms set by critical race theory, the tangled reasoning that informs Black Lives Matter: racism is the fons et origo of America; only whites are guilty of it.

Itself a racist assumption, the indictment has been on simmer since Carmichael and Hamilton set the condemnatory tone: “The goal of black people must not be to assimilate into middle-class America, for that class — as a whole — is without a viable conscience as regards humanity.” In the grip of moral fervor under the protection of the ALA, librarians are poised to bring the toxic brew to a boil.

My local library turned the flame up with Harvey’s “Raising White Kids.” Among anti-racist recommendations for young readers, this was the single entry showcased for parents. The book lends a reassuring patina of high-minded scholarship to Carmichael’s declaration “we must fill ourselves with hate for all things white.”

Harvey’s child-rearing philosophy begins with Ibram X. Kendi’s premise that color-blindness is a non-starter. To correct the failure of a color-blind approach, race-conscious parenting “insists on noticing and naming race early and often. Being race-conscious means thinking about, talking about, acting in response to the recognition or consciousness of race.” It’s race: all the time, every day, and in every way.

Racial wakefulness is crucial to white parents because “the racial identity white children develop is distinct from that of non-white children. . . . Differently raced children thus need different parental responses in search of cultivating their responses to live lives committed to equity and justice.” Young whites “are far, far behind their peers of color. Their racial understanding is underdeveloped, at best, deeply confused at worst.”

A fervid identitarian, Harvey argues for the “development of white racial identity.” A “healthy white racial identity” (a phrase used repeatedly) derives from “honest dialogue about the inherited experience of being white, as well as the history of whiteness.”

You might think that this sounds oddly analogous to the reviled sentiments of white nationalists. But, no, this is different. A “healthy” white child takes no pride in being white. On the contrary, reflection on the experience of “embodied self-awareness of being white” is what empowers white youngsters to escape house arrest in their own skin.

Messages of ethnic pride are good for black children; white ones have to learn their place. Children of non-color can acquire self-esteem but only in spite of being white:

Our radicalized bodies live, move, learn, work, and play, in larger racial scripts. We need to get this deeper dimension of race on the table. It. . . goes beyond language and concepts, and into bodies, habits, and space.

It is not easy having a white kid:

The hopes embedded in a commitment to race-conscious parenting require us to allow our children to be vulnerable and feel the ache and hurt of the harm that injustice causes. We may want to insulate our kids from it, but the humanity of even the youngest of our children is directly related to their ability to identify with that suffering.

This, “in spite of the fact that their hearts may be broken by it.”

Harvey’s veneer of intellectual honesty and scientific objectivity is a latter-day reprise of the “scholarship” of Leonard Jeffries. The former head of the black studies department at City College of New York, Jeffries taught crackpot theories of the “melanin factor” that made blacks superior to whites.

Harvey’s solemn emphasis on “racial scripts” and “racialized bodies,” and solemn reference to Racial Identity Theory, is the language of a newly minted pseudoscience making its way through academia. A White Racial Identity Model, spawn of the larger racial theory, is the brainchild 1990 of black psychologist Janet Helms, created in 1990 specifically for “people who identify as white.”

Harvey states without blushing: “Racism is a white thing.” The dogmas of intersectionality put blinders on those who might otherwise notice that the ideological substructure of anti-racism is eerily reminiscent of Nazi racial theorizing.

Her book’s cover blurb tells us only that Harvey, a professor of religion at Drake University, is an ordained minister in the American Baptist Churches USA. And that she “focuses on racial justice and white anti-racism.”

What it does not reveal is that Harvey shared a marriage license with another woman in 2007 and is equally focused on “queer and LGBT life in contemporary religious contexts.” Her profile at Drake mentions that she is a faculty advisor to programs supporting Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, the selfsame trinity honored by the ALA.

Drake’s bio adds: “Her recent publications include work on contemporary reparations movements in Protestant traditions, queer articulations of Christian traditions, and Native-Colonial dialogues on issues of environmental justice.” The sound of axes grinding is unmistakable. It is against this background hum that the book’s assertion begs to be judged.

Abington Press downplays Harvey’s resumé for good reason. Her fealty to identity politics has deep personal roots. Mainstream parents are unlikely to take lessons in child psychology and child-rearing from a lesbian who uses her own daughter as a test subject in a social engineering experiment.

There is cruelty in this burlesque of responsible parenting. It warps the emotional and psychological well-being of white children. And, if differently, of non-white ones as well. It makes enemies of those who would be friends.

Black Lives Matter Protesters Reviling Trump's Kenosha Visit: 'Riots Work',"When President Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday, Black Lives Matter protesters congregated by the county courthouse, which was gated off and protected by National Guardsmen. The protesters carried signs that said “F-ck the police,” “Dump Trump,” and “F-ck Trump,” but there was not a single sign for or against Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden.

A Black Lives Matter protester and Bernie Sanders supporter who traveled from Grand Rapids, Mich. to protest Trump’s visit told me, “I don’t know who I’m voting for” in the 2020 presidential election. The Bernie bro described the Biden nomination as “blowing.” Although he thinks left-wing activists will ultimately vote for Biden, he said it is going to be “very hard” for him to vote for Biden. “If I don’t vote for Biden it’s going to be for the Green Party,” he said.

Lamar Whitfield, the founder of the No More Foundation, traveled to Kenosha from Chicago to protest. Lamar said, “Right now, I’m not really in support of any of the candidates.” Lamar doesn’t know whether Trump or Biden are “sincere.” “We need someone that is going to come out and make a difference,” said Lamar, who even said he might sit out of the election.

“I’m less pro-Biden and more anti-Trump,” said Rachel Thompson, a BLM protester who also traveled to Kenosha from Chicago. Niko Estwind, who self identifies as a “revolutionary Communist” added he believes Biden is a “war criminal.”

“Biden still represents the Washington establishment in a lot of ways,” explained Thompson. “… he’s pro-fracking… he was the one who wrote the 94’ crime bill.” “There’s a lot that I think is pushed on us, that he’s the most progressive candidate, and I want that to stop, and I want the vote-shaming to stop,” she said. Although Thompson is not enthusiastic about Biden, she affirmed her support for him, stating, “I think when it really comes down to… do we want a fascist regime to continue for another four years?”

Enthusiasm among the BLM protesters centered around “police brutality,” “justice for Jacob Blake,” and their hatred for the “fascist,” Trump. In a tight presidential race, with tensions higher than they have ever been in American politics, one might think left-wing activists, at a protest many of them traveled from out of state to attend, would be more excited about their presidential nominee. He has certainly attempted to win them over by allowing Sanders and fellow socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to write Biden’s policy platforms.

Yet there are many reasons members of the left, especially young voters, aren’t excited about the “pro-fracking” and “establishment” Democrat presidential nominee.

Biden has made blatantly racist statements throughout his career and even during this election cycle. Biden’s own running mate, Kamala Harris, viciously attacked him on the debate stage in prime time, insinuating he was a racist for opposing busing laws in California. Now that Biden has decided to denounce rioting, it is hard to imagine that his popularity is rising among the radical left-wing parts of the Democratic Party, such as the protesters who came to Kenosha.

Although I did not come across a BLM protester who thought looting and destruction of property was necessarily a good thing, many excused the behavior because it “gets attention.” A young woman I spoke with explained the rationale: “Riots work. Burning down buildings works and it gets the attention of people to make real change. That’s what we had to do during the civil rights movement. That’s what we had to do during Stonewall. It’s what we had to do during women’s rights. People that aren’t white cis males wouldn’t have rights if it weren’t for burning down a f-cking building.”

While some left-wing activists, like the young woman I interviewed, see merit in violent and destructive rioting, many Americans are put off by it, especially old school blue-collar Democrats, like the many who live in Kenosha.

Racial minorities in many ways are being hit the hardest by BLM and Antifa rioting across the country this summer, which is taking place in mostly poor black and brown neighborhoods. In Kenosha, an Indian immigrant, who owns a family-run car dealership had his entire lot and American dream destroyed by BLM arsonists. He says insurance will not cover his losses.

Valerie, a 25-year-old African-American former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee, was in Kenosha supporting President Trump. She told us she does not believe Democrats help black people, but use them by exploiting “the pain” in their communities.

Valerie said the welfare state, burning buildings, and defunding the police are not the solutions she wants to see for black people. To Democrats' solutions Valerie said, “I’m good, no thank you.” pic.twitter.com/c31w2IWGxr — The Federalist (@FDRLST) September 2, 2020

Valerie said that the welfare state, burning buildings, and defunding the police are not the kind of solutions black people need. “I’m good, no thank you,” she said to Democrat solutions. “If anything, I see Republicans doing things to help my community. I don’t see Democrats doing things to help my community,” said Valerie.

Thanks to recent polls, Democrats have begun to realize that condoning domestic terrorism is not popular with voters, and they are scrambling to appease undecided voters, classical liberals, and minorities who do not like the destruction and violence BLM and Antifa have brought to their neighborhoods.

Biden has decided to play both sides. He denounces rioting, but still protects violent elements of the radical left, like some BLM rioters and Antifa, by not specifically calling them out and by endorsing policies that distribute government awards and attention based on race. Biden is hoping that blanket-condemning violence will appease both sides of the Democrat vote. However, he risks turning off everyone. The radical left may become more put off by his establishment behavior, and undecided Americans may think he is not done enough to condemn violence.

The question is will “anti-Trump not pro-Biden” be enough to get people out to vote for Biden, or will significant numbers of Democrats sit this election out, write in a candidate, or vote for in a third party.

Time will tell, but Trump certainly doesn’t have the enthusiasm problem Biden has. Trump supporters waited hours in partial rain just to get a glimpse of President Trump’s motorcade. They were pro-Trump, not simply anti-Biden. Unlike the BLM protesters, the Trump supporters showed support for their nominee with Trump flags, signs, hats, T-shirts, cozies, and even “MAGA” cheese heads.

Yes, a woman I met wearing a MAGA cheese head, who has been to seven Trump rallies, said proudly, “the true cheese heads of Wisconsin love our president!”

With only 60 days left until the election, Joe Biden has his work cut out for him.

"To Find The Origins Of Today’s Race Rage, Start In 1960s Academia","If much of the dire rhetoric behind America’s moment of racial reckoning seems from an oppressive world of a half-century ago, that’s because it comes from “critical race theory,” a decades-old philosophy deeply skeptical about the possibility of racial progress.

It turns up in the best-selling book, “White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism,” in which readers are told that “white identity is inherently racist” and that “the white collective fundamentally hates blackness.”

The New York Times’ historically revisionist 1619 Project, published last year and distributed to more than 3,500 K-12 classrooms, similarly instructs that “anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country.”

In Durham, N.C., a racial task force last month issued a 68-page report to city leaders stating that all social structures are designed to subjugate blacks, to privilege “the health of white bodies” and “to indoctrinate all students with the internalized belief that the white race is superior.”

So-called “equity teams” of students and faculty at some high schools in North Carolina’s capital region are reading a primer, “Critical Race Theory: An Introduction,” which says African Americans aren’t only subjugated through hate and terror but also kept down through supposedly white cultural mechanisms of individualism, objectivity, neutrality, meritocracy, and color-blindness.

These are just a few of the examples of how contemporary culture is being shaped by critical race theory, a movement born in law schools in the 1970s, influenced by Marxists, French post-modernists, the Black Power cause, radical feminists, and other disaffected leftist scholars. It quickly spread to throughout the humanities and social sciences, shaping a generation of students who now hold positions of influence in academia, public school systems, corporate HR departments, publishing, the media, and, of course, Black Lives Matter — the latter prominent in current street protests against police abuses and racism.

The Spread of Critical Race Theory

Initially dismissed as an academic sideshow, critical race theory’s assumptions and precepts are now espoused as self-evident, often without awareness that this uprising has a name, a history, a literature, and ambitions to advance ever-new theories of discrimination and demands for reparations.

The vocabulary and concepts of the theory have been disseminated through corporate diversity workshops, social media and mass media, higher education and secondary education, best-selling books, and local church discussion groups. Even the conservative Southern Baptist Convention declared last year that evangelical theologians may rely on critical race theory to understand American social dynamics.

Some of its ideas — on hate speech, white privilege, and implicit bias — are already widely accepted in education and in workplaces. Other concepts — the rejection of a color-blind society, standardized testing, and urban policing cultures — are making headway. Meanwhile, new critical race theory ideas are in the pipeline to expand the boundaries of racism and render customs and practices accepted today as problematic in the future.

“I’ve always laid it at the doorstep of the millennials, who were by and large highly receptive to our message, and maybe, as well, Trump for the opposite reason — because he’s so crude and awful,” said University of Alabama law professor Richard Delgado, one of the founders of the theory and co-author, with his wife, Jean Stefancic, of “Critical Race Theory: An Introduction,” the primer read by the North Carolina equity teams.

“Is it society that has come around to us?” Delgado, who identifies as Chicano, said in a phone interview. “Because the world is so terrible, that they’ve hit upon us and our ways of describing it? Because it rings true?”

Angela Onwuachi-Willig, dean and professor at the Boston University Law School and the daughter of Nigerian immigrant parents, says the country is in the midst of a “generational shift,” and concepts of justice cherished by the Baby Boomers are ceding to new values. She said she is continually surprised by her students’ fluency in the argot of critical race theory.

“You’ve got this open generation that grew up exposed to this language in middle school, high school and certainly in college,” said Onwuachi-Willig, who identifies as black and specializes in critical race theory, gender matters, race and law, and related issues. “It’s not called critical race theory — it’s just something you know.”

A Fundamentally Activist Enterprise

Critical race theory’s foundational precept is the centrality and permanence in society of racism against blacks, rejecting the idea of significant racial progress. Moreover, CRT is an activist enterprise pragmatically focused on outcomes.

It takes “systemic racism” as a given, with racism enmeshed into social institutions and social relations, so that all racial disparities — in life spans, incarceration rates, household wealth, and education levels — serve as proof that the system is rigged. Thus, critical race theory is a renunciation of America’s hyper-competitive, technocratic, capitalistic society, whose lopsided economic outcomes are treated as natural and incontestable by society’s winners as was the divine right of kings in its own day.

CRT has long been denounced as simplistic, dogmatic, fatalistic, and toxic — a cult of victimhood that embraces racial conflict as inevitable. As black Harvard University law professor Randall Kennedy wrote in an early critique in 1989, chief among CRT’s “baneful notions is the belief that race is destiny,” which leads adherents to play up their racial oppression as a coveted badge of moral authority.

A new book, “Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity — and Why This Harms Everybody,” warns that critical race theory, along with similar theories promoting other marginalized identities, is a surefire formula for fomenting balkanization and social conflict.

“Critical race theory’s hallmark paranoid mindset, which assumes racism is everywhere, always, just waiting to be found, is extremely unlikely to be helpful or healthy for those who adopt it,” the book states. “Adherents actively search for hidden and overt racial offenses until they find them, and they allow of no alternative or mitigating explanations.”

”One could be easily forgiven … for thinking that critical race theory sounds rather racist itself, in ascribing profound failures of morals and character to white people,” assert the co-authors, Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay, whose campaign against activist scholarship has published sham research to expose the lax academic standards of what they call grievance studies.

Dangerously Adaptable

Still, the history of this idea shows that CRT, like Marxism and Freudianism before it, proved infinitely adaptable, supplying a novel perspective that led to provocative legal and historical research. Stanford University civil rights historian Clayborne Carson, an African American, said CRT has left its mark on intellectual life, even if the theory calcifies into a pessimistic dead-end when taken too far.

“It’s helped us get beyond the time where a white male person in a privileged position defined the world for the rest of us,” said Carson, who was a senior adviser for the public television series “Eyes on the Prize.” “Any historical reality can be seen from different perspectives. That has led to some new insights.”

Critical race theory arose in the afterglow of the civil rights movement when many white Americans were still congratulating themselves for the end of legal discrimination.

Radical scholars and activists were concerned that civil rights gains had stalled and warned of a looming backlash to dismantle affirmative action, halt integration, and fall back on old habits. In a landmark article in 1978, white legal scholar Alan Freeman laid out a framework of resistance, depicting the United States as a society of “victims” and “perpetrators,” where racist inequalities are glossed over as “matters of fate, having nothing do to with the problem of racial discrimination.”

Of this white-affirming worldview, Freeman declared: “It creates a class of ‘innocents,’ who need not feel any personal responsibility for the conditions associated with discrimination, and who therefore feel great resentment when called upon to bear any burdens in connection with remedying violations.”

Deconstructing the Enlightenment

Critical race theory was initially advanced through articles published in law journals, which serve as the Federalist Papers of the movement. In these legal analyses, critical race theorists deconstruct the legacy of the Western Enlightenment — or what one scholar has called “the falsity of the liberal promise” — as a rationale developed to justify white domination of people of color by imposing European norms as objective and scientific.

The papers show that key CRT concepts, such as microaggressions and intersectionality, which started becoming commonplace in recent years, were fully developed by legal scholars in the 1990s.

The concept of white racial “privilege” as a legal concept was already in use in the 1980s and became popularized by a white academic working outside critical race theory: Wellesley College senior researcher Peggy McIntosh, whose “invisible knapsack,” initially published in 1988, lists 46 examples of unearned privileges favoring whites, such as being able to shop without being followed by a security guard, and being able to “talk with my mouth full and not have people put this down to my color.”

‘A Kind of Counter-Reality’

Even as they published in law journals, critical race theorists flouted the staid conventions of the legal establishment and adopted counter-narratives, fables, parables, allegories — even science fiction — to create what Delgado has called “a kind of counter-reality,” reflecting the perspectives of the downtrodden. The late black Harvard law professor Derrick Bell Jr. wrote four books featuring a fictional character, Geneva Crenshaw, while Delgado invented his own alter-ego, Rodrigo, who was Geneva’s fictional half-brother.

In Bell’s most famous story, “The Space Traders,” published in 1992, white Americans agree to trade black Americans to extraterrestrials in exchange for gold, new energy resources, and environmental cleansing materials. These fictional counter-stories and revisionist histories challenge, displace, or mock the “pernicious narratives and beliefs” of the white majority, Delgado’s CRT primer explains. Just as important, readable stories with a moral wallop bring the theory to the masses.

“We use a number of different voices, but all recognize that the American social order is maintained and perpetuated by racial subordination,” Bell explained in 1995.

The Meeting of the ‘Crits’

The budding movement held its first conference in 1989 at a convent in Wisconsin, attended by 24 activist-scholars. The “crits,” as they called themselves, combined insurgent scholarship with 1960s-style activism, quickly picking up adherents; in 1990, students at more than 40 law schools boycotted classes to protest the underrepresentation of minorities on faculty.

In critical race theory, racism is not a local variant of the ancient practices of caste or slavery, but something new in the world that was born with European imperialism, colonialism, capitalism, and rationalism. Racism is understood not a smattering of intentional acts of bigotry, but as an entire system that runs on auto-pilot and operates imperceptibly to whites who are punch-drunk on the myths of color-blindness and individual achievement.

“People don’t exist solely as individuals,” said Juan F. Perea, a U.S.-born Latino and a professor of law and social justice at Loyola University Chicago. ”We certainly have individual characteristics but many of our outcomes are heavily influenced by how we’re viewed and treated because of our group membership — such as race, such as sex.”

According to CRT, racism is a constantly shape-shifting phenomenon: morphing from slavery to Jim Crow to redlining to the schools-to-prison pipeline to “I Can’t Breathe.” The landmarks along this moral timeline include the New Deal and G.I. Bill, federal social programs offering financial assistance for college tuition and home purchases that helped create the modern American middle class, but which are characterized by race scholars as being structured to largely bypass black Americans.

Neither Created Nor Destroyed

In the social justice paradigm, the protean nature of racism has over time produced the black-white wealth gap, resulting in a 10-to-1 disparity in average household net worth, according to the Brookings Institution. That sense of unchanging gloom is reflected in rock star diversity trainer Robin DiAngelo’s assertion in “White Fragility,” her 2018 manifesto: “In some ways, racism’s adaptations over time are more sinister than concrete rules such as Jim Crow.”

Delgado not only subscribes to this view but is one of its founders, espousing “the law of racial thermodynamics — that racism can neither be created nor destroyed.”

Just as the CRT movement was getting underway, the war on drugs was in full swing, leading to the expansion of a privately-run prison industry and the militarization of local police departments. The nation’s prison population ultimately swelled from some 300,000 to more than 2 million, handing critical race theorists a powerful narrative of a supposedly “post-racial” America’s physical and spiritual destruction of an entire generation of African American males.

Many CRT scholars consider the detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America as part of the same phenomenon.

The early criticisms of critical race theory were imbued with a sense of shock and awe at the crits’ contempt for the legal system and their radical rhetoric. In the 1990s, federal judge Richard Posner reviewed “Beyond All Reason,” the first book-length critique of CRT, concluding that it’s not unusual for an intellectual movement to have a lunatic fringe, but noted that “radical legal egalitarianism is distinguished by having a rational fringe and a lunatic core.”

Raising the Alarm

An early alarm that critical race theory would see the First Amendment and the rule of law itself as tools of capitalist oppression was sounded by Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald in 1995.

“Outside the academy, much of critical race and feminist legal scholarship is unlikely to influence policy,” Mac Donald concluded. ”Critical race theory and feminist jurisprudence thrive in the academic hothouse where they need never confront practical reality.”

Today’s critics treat CRT as agitprop advancing totalitarianism in the guise of research and scholarship. As blatant racism becomes a thing of the past, they contend, leftists are left grasping for flimsy evidence, either by expanding the definition of racism or by making outrageous statements, to keep up their narrative of oppression.

“Their philosophy is in some ways a form of psychosis because it’s not wedded to the real world,” said Jason Hill, a professor of philosophy at DePaul University and author of “We Have Overcome: An Immigrant’s Letter to the American People.”

“They want to recreate a freaking drama that doesn’t exist,” said Hill, a black Jamaican immigrant who has taught CRT and considers himself an independent conservative. “They have to reenact a medieval morality play and cast a set of demonic characters versus iconic innocent characters, and replay the whole thing over and over again.”

Hill and other critics warn that CRT represents a dangerous return to age-old tribal hatreds that are rationalized by self-serving us-versus-them mythologies of moral purity and intellectual superiority. Where critical race theorists depict the Western Enlightenment as the ultimate oppression narrative, CRT’s foes uphold Western values as humanity’s best, if imperfect, hope for progress.

“What bothers me about the talk of white privilege is that it’s used as a kind of leverage to induce shame and guilt in white people,” Hill said. “It’s really a form of white annihilation. It’s really saying to white people: By virtue of your whiteness you need to die a certain kind of social death for me to prosper.”

An All-Out Assault

Without understanding CRT’s assault on liberalism, one might miss the literal significance of the author’s claim in “White Fragility” that “white progressives cause the most daily damage to people of color.” Or the claim in “How to Be an Antiracist” by Ibram X. Kendi, the director of Boston University’s Center for Antiracist Research: “The most threatening racist movement is not the alt right’s unlikely drive for a White ethnostate but the regular American’s drive for a ‘race-neutral’ one.”

Such arguments are no mere rhetorical flourishes; they are meant as indictments of the cultural software running in the background of the American way of life.

“Critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law,” states Delgado’s CRT book, originally published in 2001, updated in 2017 and now in its third edition, with sales approaching 100,000. “Think how that system applauds affording everyone equality of opportunity but resists programs that assure equality of results, such as affirmative action at an elite college or university or efforts to equalize public school funding among districts in a region.”

Many of CRT’s opponents are traditional liberals dismayed that so many progressives are embracing critical race theory as if it were an improved model of liberalism, not its avowed enemy. Some critical race theorists are ready to write off Western Enlightenment traditions for non-white people.

“It may be redeemable for folks who live in Western Europe,” said David Stovall, professor of black studies, and criminology, law and justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of the 2016 book, “Born Out of Struggle: Critical Race Theory, School Creation, and the Politics of Interruption.”

“But in the United States I think we have to continue to ask that question because in many ways it has proven itself to be irredeemable,” said Stovall, who identifies as black and is among those who are concerned the current CRT wave may be mere “window dressing” and virtue signaling that will not lead to radical changes in American society.

One change Stovall would like to see: the elimination of standardized testing and grading, practices targeted by some critical theorists as an example of an “objective” methodology used to maintain a permanent black and Latino underclass.

“It’s a pseudo-science,” Stovall said. “Standardized testing is an extension of eugenics.”

Inserting Intersectionality

No discussion of critical race theory makes sense without understanding that CRT is not a single idea but a clearinghouse for more than a dozen interrelated concepts, some devised by critical race theorists, others adopted and incorporated into CRT.

Key to understanding CRT is grasping the difference between equity, the social justice goal of developing policy to produce equal outcomes, as opposed to equality, the scorned liberal ideal of equal rules and procedures. Microaggressions are smaller racist acts or snubs that go unnoticed or dismissed by whites but have the cumulative effect of death by a thousand pinpricks. In an early use of the word, in 1989, a CRT scholar posited that the American legal system itself functions as a microaggression against black self-esteem.

Another key concept, intersectionality, was introduced by CRT scholar and feminist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989 to describe oppression that’s specific to a black woman but not experienced by either black men or by white women. Crenshaw contended that the absence of a legal category – that is: keeping a form of oppression unnamed – means that “Black women are theoretically erased.”

Thus, naming an oppression dovetails with the social justice emphasis on language — or “discourse” — as a tool of oppression and a strategy of liberation. Intersectionality has since taken off as a description of a social web of interlocking oppressions — from gender to sexual orientation to disability — leading another scholar to theorize about American society as a “matrix of domination.”

CRT also emphasizes “the special voice of color” and the “subjective lived experience” of people of color as the most reliable and truthful sources for what it’s like to live under white supremacy. When applied to journalism, literature, and other endeavors, CRT endorses historical revisionism to relate stories from the perspective of the victims and to “de-center” the perspective of the oppressor.

The Road to Reparations

Critical race theorists were early advocates for reparation payments as a way of compensating black people for the wealth their ancestors were deprived of over the centuries. The crits floated a variety of other ideas, such as “cumulative voting,” in which each voter is allowed as many votes as there are candidates and may give all votes to one candidate.

The concept was proposed in the mid-1990s by Lani Guinier, now a Harvard law professor, as a way of boosting black electoral leverage. Georgetown University law professor Paul Butler, a former federal prosecutor, advocated for black juries to ignore prosecutorial evidence and acquit black defendants charged with non-violent crimes.

“It is the moral responsibility of black jurors to emancipate some guilty black outlaws,” Butler wrote in the Yale Law Review in 1995, saying that the criminal justice system is an instrument of white supremacy.

Among CRT’s triumphs has been the campaign to ban hate speech. Critical theorists began asserting that racial slurs have serious psychological and societal consequences and that such speech should be exempted from First Amendment protections, and instead treated similarly to libel or threats. Today hate speech is prohibited at more than 200 universities, Delgado said, and generally considered taboo in workplaces, to the extent that some courts have deemed hate speech a form of a hostile work environment.

“Thirty years ago, one could reply, ‘So what,’ ‘laugh it off,’ ‘talk back,’ or some other cliched response. Today that’s impossible,” Delgado said. “If someone is guilty of hate speech they almost immediately apologize when it’s called to their attention. The social norm against hate speech is pretty firmly established.”

The decision earlier this year by the Board of Regents of the University of California to phase out the SAT as racist and discriminatory is another example of how CRT’s critique of objectivity has gained traction, critical theorists say. By some counts, more than 1,000 colleges and universities have dropped or disregarded the SAT and ACT, even though defenders say that when used properly standardized tests benefit disadvantaged students.

A ‘Principle-Policy Gap’

Contrary to the critical race theory narrative of relentless racism, opinion polls tell a different story. In 2015, the Gallup organization reported that more than 90 percent of Americans would support a black or female presidential candidate, compared with barely half in 1960. Approval rates for racial intermarriage soared to 87 percent in 2013 compared with just 4 percent in 1958. And a 2019 survey found that white liberals “expressed a preference for other racial and ethnic communities above their own,” an unprecedented display of wokeness.

Critical race theory doesn’t put much stock in this sort of progress. Matthew Hughey, a University of Connecticut professor of sociology who has written extensively on race, said changing attitudes among whites are indeed real and opening a yawning gap between thought and practice that scholars call the “principle-policy gap” — a discrepancy a layperson might understand as hypocrisy.

“If you talk to a lot of white people today, the thing white people are most afraid of is being called a racist,” said Hughey, who is white. “They are not afraid of living in a segregated neighborhood, sending their child to a segregated school, or doing the thing that exacerbates racism, but being called the thing.”

Wilfred Reilly, a CRT critic who is black and teaches political science at the historically black Kentucky State University, said the income gap between blacks and whites nearly disappears when adjusted for such variables as age, region, education level, and home life. Furthermore, the single-bullet theory of systemic racism falls apart because many non-white ethnic groups out-perform whites economically, said Reilly, who is author of “Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War.” Reilly said residual racism is a factor in American society but only one of many factors, not the sole or biggest one determining a person’s fate.

The Never-ending Search

Proponents of critical race theory are perpetually searching for new evidence of racism that is hidden in plain sight. One example Delgado mentioned as holding promise for future adoption is a theory of discrimination developed in 2000 by UCLA law professor Devon Carbado and Mitu Gulati, now at Duke University

They contend that the exhausting machinations required of people of color to overcome racial stereotypes and preempt negative assumptions constitute a kind of employment discrimination in itself. The theory here is that concern about others’ potential racism essentially requires black people to do more work than whites — and that merely working in the presence of white people is a type of oppression.

“We argue that both the nature of the work and the pressure to do it, the ‘working identity’ phenomenon, is a form of employment discrimination,” their paper states. “Heretofore, antidiscrimination law has not identified, let alone addressed, this problem.”

In 2001 Delgado suggested a college admissions policy that would not only reward disadvantaged applicants of color with bonus points but would also penalize privileged white applicants, by reducing their standardized scores to account for their unearned social advantages.

“We’re constantly looking for new topics and issues and problems to examine and critique,” Delgado said. “So, the work we’re doing now will be second nature, part of what everyone knows in 20 or 30 years.”

"What Athletes Should Tell Kids: Don’t Assault Women, Don’t Fight Cops","Suppose you had never heard of Black Lives Matter. And suppose you were in downtown Washington D.C. and saw someone wearing a T-shirt with those three words written on it, standing on a platform and saying through a bullhorn, as a Black Lives Matter leader did Saturday night: “I’m at the point where I want to put these (expletive) cops in their graves. I’m at the point where I want to burn down the (expletive) White House.”

Then suppose you went home and tuned in to watch an NBA game and saw the words “Black Lives Matter” written in giant letters on the basketball court. Would you be wondering why a major professional sports league identifies itself with an organization that wants to put cops in their graves?

That’s what Black Lives Matter leaders are out there saying every night. Every day, pro athletes in all the major sports leagues are doing whatever they can to support the organization.

No decent person in America disagrees with the proposition that black lives matter, but the organization is about so much more than that undeniable proposition. When in Kenosha, Wis., Jacob Blake, an unarmed black man, was shot in the back by a white cop last week, there were team boycotts and canceled games in the NBA and NHL, and MLB and NFL teams canceled practice.

Players took the opportunity to speak out about police brutality and racial injustice. Of course, they spoke out before any of the details of Blake’s shooting were known.

An arrest warrant was out for him on a sexual assault charge. That was the reason for the 911 call that resulted in his confrontation with the cops. A video shows him repeatedly resisting arrest, and the Wisconsin Department of Justice said Blake “admitted to having a knife.”

New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees showed up at practice with Blake’s name taped across the front of his helmet. Blake is on his way to becoming a martyr and LeBron James has used his NBA platform to talk about how black men live in fear because they’re being hunted in the streets. There is not a shred of evidence to support that contention, but who’s going to have the guts to point that out?

Speaking of platforms, have you seen or heard one player, commissioner, or team official mention that Blake has made some seriously bad life choices and only has himself to blame for what happened to him? When people with the kind of following that James has insist on advancing the false narrative that cops are out there looking for young black men to shoot, how does that help?

Instead of using that platform to tell young black men that cops are out to get them and to support an organization that has leaders encouraging people to “put cops in their graves,” wouldn’t it be more helpful to point out that Blake is responsible for the consequences of an alleged sexual assault and resisting arrest when served a warrant? Wouldn’t it be better if all athletes encouraged all kids to never resist arrest?

Have you heard any star athlete mention the stupidity of committing crimes and then making it worse by resisting arrest? I haven’t. Maybe I missed it. If there was an athlete who suggested waiting until an investigation was done into the Blake shooting, I missed that, too.

If we’re to believe that young people, especially young black men, can be influenced by what they hear from superstar black athletes like LeBron James, shouldn’t we be asking why those athletes don’t spend more time talking about the importance of graduating from high school, not having kids before you’re married, and getting a job, and less time demonizing the police?

By constantly feeding young black Americans false information about police killing people who look like them for no reason and elevating bad people like Blake to sainthood, they’re not helping. They’re making things worse. And they may actually be inciting people to riot.

How Refusing To Manage California’s Resources Led To Blackouts,"Journalist H. L. Mencken described the unintended consequences of governance like this: “Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.” In energy and environmental policy, California’s gotten it “good and hard” in recent years. Record wildfires. Rolling blackouts.

Politicians like Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom blame global warming and President Donald Trump for California’s woes. Yet Newsom has cautiously moved to mitigate some of his state’s past policy missteps by increasing efforts to clear forests of fuel and allowing some natural gas power plants to remain open for a few more years to reduce the threat of blackouts caused by an overreliance on unreliable wind and solar power.

Giving policymakers the benefit of the doubt—that they didn’t intend to promote policies that resulted in burned towns, scores of deaths, and widespread power outages—how did they arrive at this point? A brief timeline of key events illuminates how policy is made and how it can go terribly wrong.

The History of California’s Energy Mismanagement

Prehistoric: California’s climate, shaped by cool Pacific currents and mountains, is Mediterranean, with generally low humidity and an average annual rainfall of 18 inches (falling mostly in the winter), leaving much of the state very dry by the late fall. Mountains and cool ocean waters combine to create inversion layers in many of the state’s basins, trapping smoke and dust.

Before the 1840s: Spanish explorers and then Mexican migrants totaling fewer than 10,000 people settle around a string of 21 Catholic missions along the coast from San Diego to just north of San Francisco. Imperial Russia establishes Fort Ross in 1812, about 80 miles up the coast from San Francisco. Most of California’s interior remains the domain of Native American tribes who frequently burn the pine forests to create grassland, which produces more food and game animals.

1849 to 1970: With the discovery of gold in 1849, Americans—and others as far away as Europe and China—rush into California, rapidly increasing the population by 300,000. The fires Native Americans purposefully set are discouraged, as they threaten permanent structures and destroy valuable timber. Fire suppression and timber harvesting gradually become more organized. Through 1990, approximately as much timber is harvested as grows naturally every year.

1959: California’s first air quality law is passed as growing postwar urbanization, combined with persistent inversion layers primarily in the Los Angeles basin, cause frequent smog.

1968: The first major high-voltage line connects California to the Pacific Northwest’s abundant hydroelectric resources. California imports power from the Northwest during the summer and exports power during the winter. In time, California will become the nation’s largest importer of electricity, partly driven by air-quality regulations that discourage the construction of new fossil-fueled power plants in the state.

1976: California enacts a ban on the construction of “new nuclear fission power plants until the California Energy Commission (CEC) has determined that technologies exist for the reprocessing of nuclear fuel rods and the disposal of high-level nuclear waste.”

1994: Due to concerns over the Northern Spotted Owl population, whose habitat ranges from Northern California to Washington, a federal judge rules that President Clinton’s Northwest Forest Plan will stand, dealing a blow to the Western timber industry, from which it never recovers. Forests begin accumulating more fuel than is harvested or burned.

1996: California partially deregulates its electric market, allowing consumer choice and wholesale competition, but regulating retail prices.

2001: California’s partial electric deregulation builds to a crisis with widespread blackouts caused by capped retail prices, delays in the construction of new power plants, and market manipulation by suppliers and energy traders. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the state’s largest utility, declares bankruptcy, a fate narrowly avoided by Southern California Edison.

2002: California adopts its Renewable Portfolio Standard Program, requiring the state to increase its use of renewable generation for electricity to 20 percent by 2017.

2003: The electric crisis and tax increases needed to address a large budget shortfall lead to the recall of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis in November 2003.

2005: California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger supports five government reform ballot measures during a November special election. Labor unions and other interests spend more than $150 million to defeat the measures, often deploying harsh personal attacks on the governor. All five are defeated. Political pundits widely assume that Schwarzenegger’s improbable political career will end in defeat after the 2006 election.

2006: Moving to the left, Schwarzenegger signs a series of environmental energy bills: SB 1, the Million Solar Roofs Initiative, to incentivize mostly upper-class homeowners to install 3,000 megawatts of rooftop solar panels; AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and then reduce them by another 30 percent—leading to 10,000 megawatts of renewable power generation in work by 2010; SB 107, accelerating the Renewable Portfolio Standard by at least 1 percent of retail sales annually to reach 20 percent by 2010 (the Great Recession allowed the target to be met by greatly reducing electrical demand); and SB 1368, banning the renewal of electricity contracts from mostly out-of-state coal power plants.

One argument used in urging the shift away from natural gas power was that North America was running out of natural gas, with the expectation that nine large liquified natural gas import terminals would have to be built along the West Coast from Canada to Mexico to meet demand. Wellhead natural gas prices in California had moved from $1.50 per thousand cubic feet in 1994 to $7.45 in 2005, a 397 percent increase. Modern hydraulic fracturing (fracking) techniques soon upended those projections, reducing the cost of natural gas by 70 percent and unexpectedly reducing the cost to California consumers of the transition to renewable energy.

2006: On July 24, California hits its largest peak demand for electricity, 50,270 megawatts.

Unnecessarily Pitting Energy Against the Environment

2007: A bill (sponsored by this article’s author) to lift California’s ban on new nuclear power plants to meet the state’s ambitious greenhouse gas reduction law fails in committee.

2008: Schwarzenegger signs Executive Order S-14-08, increasing California’s Renewable Portfolio Standard to 33 percent by 2020 and further accelerating the renewable goal from 20 percent by 2017 to 20 percent by 2010. Meanwhile, the deep recession reduces electrical demand, allowing politicians to claim credit for the increased percentage of renewable power even as the total amount of renewable power produced declined.

2012: San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station closes, removing 20 percent of Southern California’s power supply and leaving one remaining nuclear generating station in California—Diablo Canyon Power Plant, which provides about 8 percent of the in-state generation and is due to close in 2024-25.

2012: PG&E, California’s largest electric utility, requests a $4.84 billion rate increase for powerline safety upgrades and maintenance. The request is denied as environmental groups fret that the higher energy costs would undermine public support for renewable energy. The decision leads to the deaths of 85 people six years later in a preventable wildfire.

2015: SB 350, by state Sen. Kevin de León, the leader of the California Senate, passes. The law further increases California’s renewable electricity procurement goal from 33 percent by 2020 to 50 percent by 2030. De León uses the bill in his unsuccessful campaign to unseat California Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 2018, even winning the endorsement of the California Democratic Party.

2018: California again increases its renewable electricity goals with SB 100, hiking them to 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent zero-carbon by 2045.

2018: In November, the powerline-sparked Camp Fire becomes California’s deadliest wildfire, killing 85 people. Politicians widely blame climate change and PG&E for the conflagration. But years of not harvesting and cleaning the forests have led to a dangerous fuel build-up while PG&E, ordered to heavily invest in renewables by politicians and regulators, had little money for powerline safety upgrades.

2019: PG&E cuts power to wide swaths of its Northern California service area to prevent aging powerlines from sparking fires during a high-wind event.

2019: The Navajo Generating Station in Northern Arizona near Page, the West’s largest coal-fired power plant, goes offline in November after reliably providing 2,250 MW of electricity for more than 40 years. Originally intended to be part of a larger system of hydroelectric power plants on the Colorado River, environmentalists briefly pressured for a nuclear power plant to be built instead—the coal plant was a compromise.

With a large source of cleaner-burning coal on the nearby Navajo Nation, the two sites provided about 1,000 high-paying jobs, mostly to Native Americans. Before its decommissioning as a result of California’s policies (cheap solar), the Obama administration’s war on coal, and inexpensive natural gas due to fracking, it provided almost 2 percent of the entire Western Interconnection’s power.

2020: California experiences rolling blackouts due to insufficient electricity supplies for the first time since 2001. Newsom suggests that four aging natural gas powerplants will have to stay operational beyond 2020 to prevent blackouts, saying, “We cannot sacrifice reliability as we move forward in this transition… We failed to predict and plan [for] these shortages…”

Some of us have been predicting these electrical shortages for some time now. Unfortunately for California’s electric ratepayers, something must give.

Physics and economics—not policy and good intentions—dictate that some combination of three things will happen: more blackouts; far higher electric rates to build $300 billion in battery farms and billions more for upgraded power lines to meet the 60 percent by 2030 renewable goal; or the acceptance that reliable power from fossil fuels and nuclear must be in the mix.

"Candace Owens, Cardi B Feud Over Politics And Race On Social Media","Rapper Cardi B and conservative commentator Candace Owens fought over social media on Monday over each other’s politics. Cardi B posted a series of videos criticizing Owens and claiming that she doesn’t actually “give a f-ck about Blacks.”

“She has an identity crisis. Just because she’s Black, doesn’t mean she give a f— about Blacks,” Cardi B said without showing her face.

Owens responded to this accusation on her now-expired Instagram stories, alleging that Cardi B was “hiding” and “reading your DNC script.”

“You’re going to tell me she’s just not going to show her face in all these videos? She shows her face no matter what, no matter what she looks like. So Cardi B, stop hiding. Stop reading your DNC script. You look ridiculous,” said Owens said.

The conflict first kicked off with an interview with Ben Shapiro on “The Ben Shapiro Show” on Sunday when Owens discussed Cardi B’s interview with Joe Biden claiming that it was merely an attempt by the Democratic presidential nominee to pander to black people.

“It is one of the biggest insults. If black Americans are not insulted by the fact that Joe Biden, who has been hiding in his basement, you know, for the entire year, made an appearance to come out because he was going do an interview with Cardi B. Do we have nothing better to offer?” Owens asked.

Since most black people didn’t have the spine to admit that @benshapiro was 100% correct about @iamcardib and how her music and platform contributes to the disintegration of black culture and values…here you go. #WAP #SundaySpecial pic.twitter.com/q5QxxX9G4e — Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) September 6, 2020

She also accused Cardi B of being an “illiterate rapper” who is being used by Biden and previously Bernie Sanders to get the black vote.

“You are pandering,” Owens said referring to Biden. “You look at Cardi B’s Instagram, and you see she has millions of followers, and you think, ‘OK, this is an illiterate person, and if I appeal to this illiterate person’ … ‘They think she’s cool. She’s hip just by sitting here and taking this interview. ‘Black people will vote for me.’ It’s basically saying, ‘Black people, you are stupid, you are dumb, and you are so foolish.'”

Cardi B responded to Owens’s accusations on Twitter claiming that her “#1 song” “WAP” helped her get the interview.

“You wanna know why joe gotta talk to me Candice cause I have the #1 song & yet my sister can’t go to the beach in the Hampton’s wit out trump supporters harassing cause they were by themselves,” she wrote.

“Just like I can make millions of people pop their p-ss- … I can make millions of people go vote,” she said in a video posted to Instagram.

You wanna know why joe gotta talk to me Candice cause I have the #1 song & yet my sister can’t go to the beach in the Hampton’s wit out trump supporters harassing cause they were by themselves & Santa Claus was harassing my sis GF all because they are a Afro/Hispanic gay couple https://t.co/OLQX2mrzbp pic.twitter.com/ISfJStODme — Cardi B (@iamcardib) September 6, 2020

Cardi B also tweeted a picture of President Trump surrounded by black people in prayer, accusing the president of pandering and claiming that she “will never praise no politician…ONLY THE LORD.”

https://twitter.com/iamcardib/status/1303075401544003584?s=20

Owens, however, wasn’t having it, and shot back at the rapper for being “uneducated.”

“You continually keep saying you have a Number One song – it means sh-t,” Owens said.

“Nobody cares about a song about your ‘Wet Ass P-ss-’. That has nothing to do with black America, and whether you’re helping or hurting. Right now, you’re hurting black America.”

https://www.instagram.com/tv/CE0Rtn4FqE7/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

In August, Cardi B acknowledged Shapiro’s opinions on her newest song after he read the lyrics aloud and criticized it for being so explicit.

“This is what feminists fought for. This is what the feminist movement was all about, and if you say anything differently it’s ’cause you’re a misogynist, see?” Shapiro said.

Cardi B responded to Shapiro’s trending review questioning why “conservatives soo mad about WAP.”

I can’t believe conservatives soo mad about WAP. https://t.co/R9vBknfek8 — Cardi B (@iamcardib) August 10, 2020

Owens continued to tweet her disdain for Cardi B’s advocacy of certain policies on Monday and claimed that “Hollywood idols are frauds, leading sheep down paths they never took when they discovered success.”

Never listen to a person that has private security but wants the public police defunded.

Never listen to a millionaire that made it here in America, but trashes our country.

These Hollywood idols are frauds, leading sheep down paths they never took when they discovered success. — Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) September 7, 2020

Left: U.S. Is A Racist Hellhole Where Many More Blacks Should Live,"The lawyer who represents George Floyd’s family in Minnesota and Jacob Blake’s family in Wisconsin is renewing his claims of “black genocide” with a new client in California police shot after they say he punched a police officer and grabbed the officer’s gun.

“This legalized genocide of colored people has to stop,” lawyer Ben Crump said on a Zoom press conference last week, according to NBC4 of Los Angeles.

The wild claim of “black genocide” has been screamed all over American streets this summer during the still ongoing rioting and looting on the pretext of “racial justice.” Just last weekend in Philadelphia, “protesters” also used the word “genocide” to describe the Kenosha, Wisc. police shooting of a black man after he fought with them, threw off two Tasers, and was reaching into his car for or while carrying what turned out to be a knife.

“It’s genocide. We’re losing lives and we’re here to protest that…White supremacy is at the core of everything,” Philadelphia protester Jess Conda said, according to the local CBS News affiliate, which labeled the protests “peaceful” while noting they included a police car vandalized with spray paint. “The rally was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation,” CBS Philly reported.

In the wake of the Blake incident a few weeks ago, NBA and other highly paid sports teams boycotted games on behalf of a man police had been attempting to arrest on a warrant for sexual assault. So did tennis star Naomi Osaka, the world’s highest-paid female athlete.

“Watching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach,” she told her 1.3 million Instagram followers.

Genocide is a strong term and its victims deserve for it to remain that way, to retain its truth as a description of what they endured. The United Nations defines “genocide” as “the deliberate intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.” The accusation is that in the United States, agents of the state are systematically hunting down black people and executing them for no reason other than their skin color.

This charge is being deliberately tied to U.S. history with the implicit accusation that America always has been a genocidal country, and remains so. Protesters explicitly connect slavery and instances in which the U.S. government fought or mistreated some indigenous tribes with the rare instances of police shooting people with darker skin today.

This accusation that America has always been murderously racist is both implicit and explicit in leftist education propaganda such as Howard Zinn’s bestselling “textbook,” “A People’s History of the United States.” It is implicit in the College Board’s revised U.S. and European history courses and the entry-level college history classes they are meant to replace and reflect. And it is both openly and implicitly stated in the notorious New York Times 1619 Project.

In other words, these protesters are not making this connection out of nothing. The government “education” system the left controls has taught millions of Americans to hate their country, and some of them believe their hatred justifies violence. Thus we have protesters in the streets screaming that the disproportionately few instances in which police shoot unarmed but usually violent black people prove the United States is as racist and homicidally evil today as it was when the national government allowed states to legalize chattel slavery.

Frighteningly large numbers of Americans agree with this general view of their own country. It’s tens of millions. Earlier this year, I discussed just a few of the many polls showing this:

Today, 4 in 10 Americans who are younger than 39 disagree that the United States ‘has a history we should be proud of,’ according to a 2019 poll by FLAG/YouGov. The poll also found that half of all Americans agree the United States is a sexist and racist country, including two-thirds of millennials. Millennials showed the lowest level of agreement with the statement, ‘I’m proud to be an American.’ Thirty-eight percent of ‘younger Americans do not agree that “America has a history that we should be proud of,”’ according to the poll. 2019’s annual poll from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that 37 percent of millennials think the United States is ‘among the most unequal societies in the world.’

Polls continue to show that millions of Americans believe, against the evidence, their entire country is racist. A July Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found 56 percent of American voters currently agree “American society is racist.” Eighty-two percent of Democrat voters in the poll agreed “American society is racist,” as did 30 percent of Republicans.

Against this belief strong enough to generate months of riots decimating numerous minority neighborhoods, we have the curious reality that millions of the world’s “people of color” would love to immigrate into the United States. In fact, some of them die trying to do so.

Democrats want to let many, if not all, of them in. Recall that during their presidential primary debates every Democrat candidate supported open borders. To not do so opens one to the charge of racism. But if you really loved black and brown people, why would you want to get them into a country that might commit genocide, or at the very least systematically discriminates, against them?

In 2018, Gallup found that 158 million foreigners would move to the United States if they could, and most of them were from Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. If it’s hell to be black in America, why do tens of millions of Africans want to get into America? Are the millions of black and brown people who want to immigrate to the United States stupid?

Another piece of evidence contradicting the widely held view that America is a racist nation is the choice of some Americans to pretend they are members of politically favored ethnic groups when they are not. Obviously, if America were a comprehensively racist country against blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics, people like Elizabeth Warren, Rachel Dolezal, and now Jessica Krug would probably not pretend to be black and Native American.

When many more Americans were racist against our black brothers and sisters, the phenomenon of “passing” was seen as a sign of racism. Now that people are trying to “pass” the other way, is it still a sign of racism?

If the United States were a racist country committing black genocide, you would expect to see black and Hispanic Americans leaving, not trying to get in. When people are targeted for genocide, they flee. But no Americans of any ancestry are fleeing this country en masse. We are a country that has to put up walls to keep people out, unlike the nations with actual gulags that put up walls to keep people in.

Not even rich black Americans with the means to live in numerous other countries are leaving for the safety of what they imply are non-genocidal shores. No NBA players are renouncing their citizenship and moving to China, or even to Canada. NFL players could live anywhere they want in the world, and they’re staying in a country in which they claim agents of the state kill people based on a skin color that matches many of theirs. Either these people are crazy, they believe lies, or they are lying to us.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/09/the-left-the-united-states-is-a-racist-hellhole-where-many-more-black-and-brown-people-should-live/,2020-09-09
Inside An Elite Cancel Culture Session To Silence A Dissenting Critic,"There have been many strange scenes in this era of coronavirus pandemic, anti-racism unrest, and woke recriminations, but perhaps none have been stranger than one that took place on Zoom late last month, when 115 people, appearing in little squares on computer screens, held a kind of trial, a somewhat secret one at that, closed to the press, its participants barred from talking about it to outsiders afterwards. The episode illustrates the tense workings of cancel culture preoccupying an American institution.

In the dock, and visible in his own little square, was Carlin Romano, a writer, philosopher, book critic and, off and on for 35 years, a member of the executive board and former president of the National Book Critics Circle, known for the prestigious literary prizes it gives every year.

The Zoom meeting’s purpose was not to award Romano a lifetime achievement award; it was to debate and vote on a motion to expel him from the critics’s board.

Dissenting from a New Orthodoxy

Eighteen people spoke over the course of the two-hour Zoom meeting. Twelve of them argued that Romano should be ousted from his elected position because he lacked “collegiality”; his behavior was “intimidating”; he’d threatened to sue; he made people “uncomfortable.” Romano said his personality and “blunt” manner of debate have been known for decades, and weren’t the real reason he was under attack.

In fact, the attacks on Romano went back to some criticisms he forcefully expressed three months earlier of some parts of an anti-racism pledge drawn up for the critics circle to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. In a series of private emails among board members, Romano said the pledge went too far in finding the entire publishing industry, and the critics group itself, deeply implicated in the American system of “white supremacy and institutional racism.”

In other words, what Romano did was offer some criticism, which is what critics in an organization of critics are generally expected to do, and what he was being asked to do as the draft of the anti-racism pledge was circulated for members’ comment. The fact that he was soon raked over the coals for “racism” led many people to bemoan an especially blatant incident of “culture cancelation.”

Even though the vote fell just short of the two-thirds majority needed to expel a person from the board, 62 percent of the voting members did favor ousting Romano, who, for the three months preceding the Zoom event, had been subject to a steady barrage of attacks — for “blatant racism” and “misogyny” — all because he dissented from a certain orthodoxy on the trinity of race, class, and gender.

Hunting for ‘Microaggressions’

The funny thing about the affair, but also telling, is that the 66-year-old Romano has for his long professional life been a quintessential liberal intellectual. He’s critic-at-large for the Chronicle of Higher Education and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. He was book critic at the Philadelphia Inquirer for 28 years and wrote “America the Philosophical,” a maverick interpretation of American thought noted for its breadth and inclusiveness — the Wall Street Journal called it “a roll call for identity politics.”

So the vilification of Carlin Romano is a useful case study in the galloping and enforced intolerance on the left for dissenting points of view. In fact, it shows several things.

One of them is the trend, originating in the academic world but now spreading to the other elite institutions of American life, to ferret out “microaggressions” — the unintentional impression left by words and actions that offend a member or members of an underrepresented group (at least one person invoked that word to criticize Romano during the Zoom trial).

The episode also signaled the repudiation of an honored and admired intellectual archetype — the curmudgeon. I’m not a close friend, but, as a book writer and former critic myself, I’ve encountered Romano over the years, and I’d describe him as something of a throwback to an earlier era, when a crusty, Socratic, erudite style carried with it a certain charm. But that’s one of the ways Romano seems no longer to fit in.

One critics circle board member, Columbia University professor John McWhorter, an African American, agreed with him on the substance of the anti-racism pledge but told the website Vulture that Romano’s way of expressing his dissent was a bit tone-deaf. He “was not being a modern person in the way he responded” to the anti-racism pledge, McWhorter said, perhaps referring to Romano’s charge that some of the arguments of the anti-racism pledge were “absolute nonsense.”

But the Romano incident also highlighted another, perhaps more far-reaching, aspect of the ongoing culture wars, namely how the “woke” left seems to be devouring old school liberals. While liberals and conservatives still battle on the largest political stage, the Critics Circle fight illustrates the arcane factional struggle within the left, in which the radical faction takes on comparatively easy targets like Romano because they are accessible and vulnerable in a way that actual racists and other non-insiders are not.

An ‘Anti-racism’ Pledge

Here’s what happened: After the death of George Floyd on May 25 while in police custody, the critics circle’s board of directors created a committee to draft an anti-racism pledge, headed by Hope Wabuke, a Ugandan-American poet, essayist, and assistant professor of English and creative writing at the University of Nebraska.

“White gatekeeping stifles black voices at every level of our industry,” said a draft, circulated internally to the board members, and asking for their comment. “We [members of the critics group] admit our culpability in this system of erasure of BIPOC [Black, Indigenous People of Color] voices in the cultural and intellectual conversation.”

The statement cited a 2019 survey that found just 5 percent of the staff in the entire publishing industry to be black and only 4 percent of on-staff reviewers. “This is a system of white supremacy and institutional racism,” the statement said.

There were a number of comments on the draft, but Romano seems to have been alone among the board’s 24 members to object to phrases like “system of white supremacy” to characterize the whole publishing industry or to accept the notion of critics’ “culpability in the system of erasure of BIPOC voices.”

In an email to other members that was supposed to be internal and confidential, he wrote, “Equating American book publishing with American police departments, as this claim suggests, is ridiculous.” He supported Black Lives Matter, he said, but the draft statement was unfair to the “white publishers that have been working to elevate Black writers, and Black voices, for years.”

Dangerous Backlash

The response was furious. Wabuke posted Romano’s email on Twitter even as she announced her resignation from the board because, as she put it, “it is not possible to change these organizations from within, and the backlash will be too dangerous for me to remain.”

Soon thereafter, 15 of the board’s members resigned, some out of solidarity with Wabuke, but others apparently did so because of their disillusionment with what seemed to be the organization’s unstoppable descent into acrimony, and to the fact that Wabuke had herself violated the group’s customary procedures by making the emails public.

Soon emails began calling for Romano’s resignation. Twitter went wild with accusations of racism and bigotry against him. A change.org petition was started by a freelance writer, Emma Eisenberg, who cited Romano’s “racist remarks” and his “sustained campaign of targeting black people and women” at the Critics Circle, demanding that he be fired from his Annenberg School of Communication teaching job at the University of Pennsylvania.

All of this might suggest Romano is more a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan than simply a dissenter to portions of the anti-racism pledge. What he found to be “nonsense” wasn’t the pledge’s citing of surveys showing the dominance of whites in publishing; it was the suggestion that these whites are exemplars of “white supremacy,” when, in fact, American publishing has been a traditionally liberal institution, and over the decades, many editors have been in the forefront of efforts to find, publish, and promote black writers.

“I once spent a day with James Baldwin in which he endlessly praised his old friend, first editor, and high-school buddy Sol Stein, and subsequent editor Jim Silberman, for all they’d done for him,” Romano wrote in an “open letter” to the Critics Circle before his “trial.” “I watched as Toni Morrison took her ‘white gatekeeper’ John Leonard to the Nobel Prize ceremony, and appreciated her white gatekeeper editor Robert Gottlieb at Knopf.”

“It seemed to me,” he continued, explaining his reasons for his criticism of the anti-racism pledge, “that a few Board members drafting these claims remained too ignorant of real-world publishing history to get their generalizations right.”

A Supremely Chilling Effect

Complaints about cancel culture tend to focus on the idea of freedom of speech, the John Stuart Mill idea that nobody should be silenced for their views, no matter what they are. But the Romano matter shows that the real harm is to the suppression of ideas and arguments that might actually be true.

For example, the anti-racism pledge cited a survey showing only 5 percent of the staff in the publishing industry to be black, but it ignores the fact that an additional 19 percent of jobs are held by Asians, Latinos, and other people of color.

As for the National Book Critics Circle, actual facts and statistics show something more subtle than simple “culpability in the system of erasure of BIPOC voices.” The anti-racism pledge itself acknowledges that last year 30 percent of the finalists and winners of the six critics circle book prizes were minorities, up from 22 percent in 2008.

In the seven years since it began awarding the John Leonard Prize for best first book, five winners have been people of color — two black women, two Latinas, and one Native American man.

Perhaps this is not enough, and some board members, disappointed over the reaction to the anti-racism pledge, have tried to explain the way subtle biases are at work inside the group. The writer Yahdon Israel, who resigned from the board well before the Romano furor, told the website Lit Hub that during the group’s book prize deliberations, “any time race became the central focus of a book, it became the very thing that undermined the integrity of the book itself.”

The End of Debate

But once the charge of racism is leveled, civil debate is over, which is what happened once Romano’s comments had been made public and the inevitable outrage emerged. Almost immediately, a move to expel him from the board gathered momentum, and that led to the Zoom meeting to consider the ouster motion.

At the direction of a lawyer hired by the group (reportedly paid $10,500 in fees), the meeting was closed to the press and a gag order on discussing it with outsiders afterwards was imposed. When Romano asked the lawyer, Steven Hunter of the Chicago firm Quarles & Brady, before the meeting why an organization dedicated to the free exchange of ideas should adopt such restrictions, Hunter responded by asking Romano where he went to law school. When Romano repeated his question, Hunter repeated his response.

I was provided access by a source on condition that this person not be identified, and was under none of the secrecy strictures imposed on members. Though a former book critic myself, I have never been a member of the NBCC.

A few people at the meeting defended Romano and defined the issue as one of free speech. One of them, Dan Cryer, a former book critic for Newsday, said, “I’m very much concerned with the party line being established by the NBCC.” Philip Kopper, publisher of Posterity Press and a book reviewer for the Washington Times, said, “The organization should stand for open differences of opinion.”

Surprisingly, none of the anti-Romano speakers, who included all of the younger members, even mentioned the anti-racism pledge. Instead, their main focus was complaints that Romano was “not collegial,” that he was “intimidating,” or that he made people “uncomfortable.”

It seemed at times as if the demand made on college campuses for “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings” to protect people from hearing views that might offend them had spread to an organization of literary critics, whose very stock in trade, as Romano pointed out, was to be critical.

‘Cause for Removal’

Several also argued that Romano should be expelled for saying he might sue the board if it dismissed him. “Threats of lawsuits to nonprofit volunteer board members are egregious,” said Lisa Von Drasek, the curator of children’s literature at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. “This is certainly cause for removal.”

Romano countered by saying, “People go to a court to make sure that rules are observed. … People do that when they feel others are attacking them, or treating them unfairly.” Indeed, one Romano supporter noted that when women have sued organizations over unequal treatment, they too might have made people “uncomfortable,” but they were right to do what they did.

Many of the statements made at the meeting were convoluted and hard to follow, but there seemed to be among some members an assumption that the Twitter vitriol about Romano’s alleged racism was based in truth, or even if it wasn’t true, keeping him on the board would tarnish both the Critics Circle’s reputation and the reputations of its members.

One speaker, Letitia Montgomery-Rodgers, who does book reviews for several publications, said that Romano’s “position as director to deliver personal remarks about political and cultural issues … directly threatens my ability to do my work and be part of that cultural conversation as a book critic.” The poet Rebecca Morgan Frank said, “How can I convince my diverse young people to come to this organization when we have leadership like this?”

“The main bad stuff,” Romano said in response, speaking of the consequences if he were expelled, “would be the stigma on the NBCC as a censorious organization that cannot bear a dissenting voice.” In the actual voting at the meeting, 72 percent of the 115 attending voted to remove him from the board. But Romano had collected proxy ballots from other members before the meeting and carried the day, by just a few percentage points. Romano will remain on the board for the duration of the current term, until 2022.

Some people on Twitter and other forums were pleased that the expulsion vote failed, but the loudest opinions were of anger and outrage. Some members declared their intention of resigning from the organization because Romano would remain in it. “Carlin Romano is racist garbage” read a tweet from writer Julia Cohen: “Wow,” she wrote. “What does the award mean to anybody if we know a blatant racist is on the board?”

A Victory for Cancel Culture

The irony here is that supposed efforts to “intimidate” the board were one of the chief reasons cited by Romano’s detractors for favoring his ouster. But the accusations of racism and misogyny so freely and casually bandied about seemed pretty intimidating in themselves, and suggest that, whatever the outcome of the vote, the cancel culture won this battle.

Certainly, it will be more difficult for people in the liberal press, universities, and the nonprofit world to express doubts about what has emerged as the mandatory view on racism — that it is “systemic,” that it is the abiding and chief feature of all American history and life, that we are all culpable in it, and that to deny that culpability is itself racist.

“What struck me as distinctive about this, as opposed to other cancel culture incidents, is the NBCC is an organization of critics,” Romano said in a phone interview with RCI. “This is not a friendly book club whose members only say nice things to each other. We’re critics. We’re supposed, by definition to say, ‘That’s not true; that’s not good.’ If you can’t have criticism in a critics’ organization, where can you have it?”

"FLASHBACK: BLM Was Violent From The Start, And Media Knew It","Two officers were shot at close range while they sat in their cruiser Saturday night in Los Angeles. The victims, who were hit multiple times and in critical condition Sunday (but are now are expected to survive) are a 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman, whose six-year-old child stayed home while her husband came to her side in the hospital.

Outside, Black Lives Matter protesters blocked the emergency entrance to St. Francis Hospital, chanting “We hope they die” and “Y’all gonna die one by one.”

It was a murderous terrorist attack, within hours claimed, if not perpetrated, by Black Lives Matter. The shooter is still at large.

These two officers graduated the academy 14 months ago, before Democrat and other leftist politicians once again abandoned them to the mob. Since George Floyd died under arrest, these politicians have chanted Black Lives Matter’s anti-police lies alongside the crowds.

It wasn’t surprising it came to this. For more than half a decade, Black Lives Matter has used a nice-sounding name to shroud a terrorist agenda. “Now,” I wrote July 8, “through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.”

And in the months since, we’ve seen roads and bridges blocked, young and old attacked, and a civilian murdered — all in its name.

In a sane world, Black Lives Matter blocking entrance of a hospital to cheer for the death of a 31 year old mother of a 6 year old boy would be the end of a movement. pic.twitter.com/V4bOV3LJ0K

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, in the meantime, condemned the shooting Sunday, but still refused to name the organization behind the violence on our streets. And why would he? On Wednesday, he attacked the president for even criticizing them. Campaign staffers donated money to bail out rioters in Minneapolis, then bragged about it online. His running mate tweeted a link so her supporters could follow suit. The Democratic Party thinks they’re on its side.

July 8, The Federalist — The Black Lives Matter protests are radical, they are violent, and they have claimed innocent lives all over the country. This isn’t a surprise: We’ve watched this movement played out before by many of the exact same leaders and even under the exact same name. Now, through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t new at all. It’s the same loose collection of good-thinking people concerned over police violence and violent, anti-police and anti-family radicals as it was when it first gained national prominence in 2014.

As a refresher, the group was founded in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s second term and after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It wasn’t until a rash of viral police-related deaths the next year that its national profile began to rise, including protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and then the following year Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It was cheered on at the time by the media for all the same reasons it’s being cheered on today: Some of the viral videos and events convincingly depicted unjustified killings of black suspects by police, and despite the clear and radical politics of the founders, their name conveys an obvious truism. Unfortunately, it quickly showed its violent and intolerant side then, just as it has today.

Americans likely most clearly recall Ferguson’s protests, where for days black-owned businesses were torched and looted. Over the next few years, we watched in horror as Baltimore’s years-long revival was stopped in its tracks, block after block burned, and families attending an afternoon baseball game were set upon by screaming mobs.

As editor in chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation then, I oversaw our broader Baltimore 2015 riot coverage. As two in the morning approached on April 28, I turned off the police scanner, confident our guys were OK and looking forward to a few hours’ sleep before an early workday. Minutes later, our man running the coverage on the ground texted, “We are alright,” which indicated to me that they were not alright at all. Indeed, my friend was in the emergency room with two of our young reporters, who had been beaten and robbed by the rioters.

“When I saw the guy heading our way with a hammer in his hand and a bandanna covering his face, I knew he meant business,” a New York Daily News reporter who ran to their aid and then drove our guys through the mob to safety wrote later that morning. By the time they escaped, Caller reporter Casey Harper was struggling to stay conscious with a severe concussion, broken eye socket, and stolen phone, while his colleague Connor Wolf got off with a broken nose (and managed to hold onto his blood-stained notebook throughout). The two had been targeted for being white. No one slept until after we were back in the newsroom and their story was filed.

The violence and disruption they’d been subject to were tolerated and papered over by Democrats and corporate media, who made excuses for attacks on civilians, police, and media, and blamed outside agitators even while they were shouted down and disrupted by activists demanding “a conversation” but committed to ensuring no one speaks but them.

The following year, 2016, national Black Lives Matter protests broke out against the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dozens of officers were injured with projectiles and threatened by protesters. Then on July 7, just before 9 p.m. CT, a man opened fire on police preparing for one of the protests in Dallas, killing three policemen, wounding three others, and wounding one civilian.

During his retreat, he killed another officer, shooting him in the back after sneaking around a pillar he was taking cover behind during a gunfight. Seeking to fortify an El Centro College building, he opened fire on two campus cops, hitting one in the gut and injuring the other with shattered glass.

Police followed the man’s trail of blood through the school, engaging when they could clearly make him out in the darkness. From a window near where he made his last stand, he was able to kill another police officer who was on the street below. After negotiations broke down, the department killed him with a remote bomb.

Before he was killed, the gunman told a negotiator he was motivated by anger on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. His Facebook page called for people to “KILL EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN.” By the morning of July 8, the murdered men included Officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, former Army Ranger Michael Smith, former U.S. Navy sailor Patrick Zamarripa, and former Marine Brent Thompson.

“Protests are messy,” a Vox writer wrote dismissively a week later. “When thousands or millions of people rise up in very passionate demonstrations, some bad, violent people are going to get caught up in the cause.”

But the pressure was intense, and reluctant cracks began to form in the ranks. “Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,” a New York Times headline lamented, “Then a Sniper Opened Fire.”

Things quieted down. Donald Trump won the presidency, and shell-shocked journalists and Democrats went on a short-lived soul-searching mission, wondering what went wrong and how they could have misread the American public so badly. “Maybe we pushed too far,” President Obama privately reflected. “What if we were wrong?”

The introspection did not last, and by the end of the year — a year five police officers were killed and dozens wounded and hospitalized by Black Lives Matter radicals — BuzzFeed fondly looked back on 2016 as “the year Black Lives Matter went global.”

Just a few short weeks into the summer of 2020, it’s happening again: Seven shot in a Louisville protest park; one week later a protester killed; two dead in Chicago; four shootings in Seattle’s “autonomous zone;” a 77-year-old, black, retired St. Louis Police captain murdered; a 22-year-old, black woman in Davenport shot as she tried to leave.

Once again, politicians and media are defending and gaslighting for the violence. “I want to be clear how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Veshi said while buildings visibly burned in the night sky behind him. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”

“But fires,” he admitted, back-lit by flames, “have been started.”

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., rioters threw frozen bottles, glass, rocks, and bricks at police, then lit a church on fire. Afterward, corporate reporters, Democratic politicians, and even the leader of that church called the protests peaceful and attacked police tactics. The mayor allowed protesters to maintain that space, rename it Black Lives Plaza, and paint “Black Lives Matter” on the street.

“White women are lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen’s,'” Washington Post editor Karen Attiah wrote June 29, “And not calling for revenge.” She listed her reasons for revenge on white women as the deadly racist massacre in Tulsa 99 years ago, the lynching of Emmet Till 70 years ago, liberal feminists making her feel excluded, and white women voting for Donald Trump.

Eight days later, she complained that “The ideas of the elite class is to be protected [sic] and supported at all costs,” but “black people… poor people… [and] uneducated people? We’re supposed to accept our marginalization.” She graduated from Northwestern University, won a Fulbright Scholarship, got a master’s at Columbia University, is now the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, and still has not been fired.

But the charade cannot stand. This past weekend, an eight-year-old black child was shot and killed besides her frightened mother as the driver tried to navigate around illegal barriers Black Lives Matter protesters were guarding near the Atlanta Wendy’s where a black man was killed after scuffling with police and stealing and firing one officer’s Taser. The little girl’s name was Secoriea Turner.

“They say ‘black lives matter,'” her father, hoarse with pain, accused the movement just hours later. “You killed your own. You killed your own this time.”

“You killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody.”

“My baby,” her mother sobbed as family comforted her and helped her walk from the stage.

“At the point that an eight-year-old baby is killed, the discussions have ended,” the mayor announced. Just hours later, another person was killed and two more wounded nearby.

But some aren’t getting the message. “If you want an all-black lives matter movement started … then start that movement,” CNN’s Don Lemon told black actor Terry Crews Monday. “But that’s not what Black Lives Matter is about.”

Lemon was wrong on most things during that segment, but on that one point, he was right. Let’s see how long it takes us to remember.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/14/flashback-black-lives-matter-was-violent-from-the-start-and-media-and-politicians-knew-it/,2020-09-14
1960s Riots Foreshadow Today's Communist Weaponization Of Black Pain,"Leaving the White House grounds recently, I knew I would encounter protestors. You could hear them throughout the evening, trying to disrupt.

Most of the protestors were to the east and north of the White House, so staff directed us to exit out the west gate. A security guard offered to accompany me and my husband south to Constitution Avenue to meet our Uber driver, and we went safely home.

We heard numerous stories the next morning of guests who had been threatened and endangered. One friend with whom we had walked out of that west gate actually decked a foul-mouthed biker. The biker had veered too close to our friend’s wife while shouting threats and obscenities, and the husband then acted as a man might reasonably be expected to — he punched the guy.

Elsewhere, dozens of angry protestors surrounded Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his wife Kelley as they left the White House grounds. Eventually, more police officers arrived and escorted the couple to the safety of their hotel.

Sen. Paul later reported: “After we got back to our hotel room and some safety we heard something frightening. The ‘protesters’ were staying on our floor — including the room next door to us. They were talking about their mob activities and even saying they thought we were here on this floor. We had to develop a 3 a.m. plan with the Capitol Police to get to safety.”

Paul asks, “Who are these people? Who paid for their hotel rooms? Who flew them in?” What he saw that night led him to conclude, “It’s organized. It’s paid for. It’s violent.”

Several days later, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the organization and funding of the violent protests that have wracked cities across America for months. On Sept. 10, 50 members of Congress signed a letter, calling on Attorney General William Barr to investigate the groups responsible for the ongoing attacks against our republic.

How Do Communists Start a Riot?

This calls to mind a similar moment 60 years ago. President Dwight Eisenhower had planned a state visit to Tokyo in August 1960, but a series of demonstrations and riots by Japanese communists against the visit led the president’s security team to cancel. DeWitt Wallace, founding editor-in-chief of The Reader’s Digest, asked two pivotal questions: “All the newspapers say these are communist-inspired riots. How do we know? If you’re a communist, how do you start a riot?”

Wallace’s questions ended up on the desk of a 26-year-old journalist from Georgia named Eugene Methvin. Starting his research at the Library of Congress, Methvin looked up books on riots. He could find only one — a U.S. Army field manual from 1882 that had been written in response to the 1879 C&O railroad strikes.

In 1960, there were no riots in the United States, only in foreign countries. But that quickly changed. By 1965, America’s cities were imploding. By 1968, there had been more than 150 riots or major disorders. In 1967 alone, rioting left 83 people dead and 1,800 injured.

Methvin did come across a pamphlet published by The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee entitled, “Communist Mob Violence Around the World.” It had been written by the committee’s research director, Ben Mandel. Methvin described it as “the first published study of Communist techniques of ‘riot diplomacy.’”

Mandel knew about the topic because he had been a card-carrying member of the Communist Party. Indeed, he had been the one who handed Whitaker Chambers his Communist-Party card in the 1920s. Mandel referred Methvin to Steve Posony, who had fled Austria when the Nazis took over in 1938. Posony taught history at Georgetown and advised the deputy director for intelligence in the U.S. Air Force.

With Posony and Mandel as guides and mentors, Methvin spent the next 10 years trying to answer Wallace’s questions. They are essentially the same questions we should pose today.

How To Turn Civil Unrest Into Riots

How do we know those are Marxist riots in our streets? That one’s easy: because the organizers tell us they are. In a 2015 interview, Patrice Cullors said she and Alicia Garza, co-founders of Black Lives Matter, are “trained Marxists.”

The second question is more challenging: If you are a Marxist, how do you start a riot? Or, as Methvin posed the question: “What turns an ordinarily trivial city street arrest incident into a gargantuan explosion of mass violence?” After 10 years of research, Methvin found the answer, and he published it in “The Riotmakers.”

He opens with the Newark riots of 1967, which were eerily similar to the riots following George Floyd’s death. From the windows of two public housing buildings on the evening of July 12, 1967, police were seen dragging a struggling man upstairs into the police station. Rumors quickly flew that the police had beaten and killed the prisoner.

Protests began and soon erupted into riots. Over the next four days, 26 people were killed as a result and many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. Within 10 days, riots had broken out in 43 cities across the United States.

Methvin dug deep to understand the cause. One factor he identified was the “Tractor Revolution,” the mechanization of agriculture after World War II that pushed poor blacks and whites into northern cities. While many of those poor whites were able to transition into industrial jobs, Methvin saw that blacks faced numerous obstacles such as poor education, union racism, and housing discrimination, which kept them out of the suburbs and thus out of reach of the industrial jobs.

Other factors playing a role were: the welfare policies of the 1960s, which had started to erode the black family; rampant corruption in Newark’s government, and epic overcrowding. Newark was a tinderbox. Tens of thousands of black Americans were underemployed, undereducated, alienated, exploited, and resentful.

Spontaneous or Incited?

Methvin asked: Would Newark have erupted into violence spontaneously, or did someone light a spark? He found multiple sparks.

Three years prior to the summer riots of 1967, Tom Hayden had arrived in Newark. White, bored, and unhappy, the 25-year-old from Royal Oak, Michigan was on a mission to upend the comfortable world he had been born into.

Hayden was a leader of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). He had co-authored the manifesto that lifted them out of obscurity, the 1964 Port Huron statement, which begins: “We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.”

Methvin describes the statement as “warmed-over Marxist analysis of American society, with a pinch of Lenin’s Imperialism, the Last Stage of Capitalism, and a heavy flavoring of anarchistic utopian idealism.” The statement called for a new left which “must include liberals and socialists,” and which would “start controversy across the land.”

‘We Are Actively Organizing Sedition’

What exactly was SDS’s work in Newark? While it might have been ennobled with the aspiration of rectifying the unjust and inequitable treatment of Newark’s black population, in essence, it sought to foment war. The immediate goal was revolution.

Three months before the Newark riot, Hayden took a local protégé, Jesse Allen, to Puerto Rico to meet with members of the pro-Castro “Movement for Independence.” While there, according to Methvin, Hayden denounced the Newark slum as a colonial possession of the United States. Just weeks before the Newark riot, SDS National Secretary Gregory Calvert revealed: “We are working to build a guerilla force in an urban environment. We are actively organizing sedition.”

To lead their guerilla force, SDS brought in Hassan Jeru Ahmed, a militant activist with a long criminal record who formed a battalion of “Black Beret” mercenaries and organized a campaign of agitation. Newark was flooded with anti-police propaganda and instructions for making Molotov cocktails, which included this directive: “Light rag and throw at some white person or white person’s property.”

The SDS spent three years exacerbating grievances, heightening tensions between black and white, demonizing the police and local government officials. They provided the training, the tools, and the weapons for violence. The riots that ensued, killing 26 and causing millions of dollars in damage, were in no way spontaneous.

The month after the riots had finally ended and the buildings had stopped smoldering, The New York Times Review of Books published an article by Hayden, in which he wrote:

The role of organized violence is now being carefully considered. During a riot, for instance, a conscious guerilla can participate in pulling police away from the path of people engaged in attacking stores. He can create disorder in new areas the police think are secure. He can carry the torch, if not all the people [sic], to white neighborhoods and downtown business districts. If necessary, he can successfully shoot to kill.

Communist Incitement Buried

Methven cites the numerous investigations and court cases that found similar patterns of deliberate instigation in riots across the United States: in Rochester, Cincinnati, Baltimore, San Jose, Toledo, Philadelphia, Watts, Detroit, Chicago.

Young, bored, white college students decided to conduct their revolutionary experiment using black people as the trigger.

In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, including Hayden’s well-publicized admission of SDS’s tactics and the open calls for violence by Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, appointed by President Johnson, concluded in what is known as the Kerner Report that racism was the primary cause of the riots.

Historian Sean Wilentz calls out the profound bias in that conclusion. The experts and analysts who made up the Kerner Commission were not unified in their conclusions.

Those who ultimately held sway justified the riots “not as signs of oppressive poverty and social breakdown but as righteous political protests against racist institutions, in particular the police. The events in Watts, Detroit, and elsewhere were not riots…they were rebellions; instead of seeking to quell the outrage in the nation’s inner cities, responsible government officials needed to awaken to the racism so deeply and systematically embedded in American life, and then attack it head-on.” Sound familiar?

Young, bored, white college students, seduced in their ignorance by the dysfunctional dream of Marxism, decided to conduct their revolutionary experiment using black people as the trigger. But at tremendous cost. The riots of the 1960s had a long-term negative impact on both the value of black-owned properties and on black income and employment.

Riots ‘Unambiguously’ Hurt Black People Most

Robert Margo, a professor of economics at Boston University, and William Collins, of Vanderbilt University, concluded: “the riots were unambiguously negative. They reduced incomes of African Americans’ employment, and they reduced housing values. In the case of housing values, it was broader; it actually affects overall housing values in cities, but the impact is primarily felt by African Americans.”

The Kerner Commission spent seven months looking into the cause of the riots and concluded, simply, it was racism. Methvin spent 10 years looking into the same question and came to a very different conclusion.

He fully acknowledged an array of negative factors affecting blacks in many American cities, but Methvin also demonstrated, incontestably, that the explosion of discontent into violence and rioting was not spontaneous. Indeed it was the direct result of planning and interference by white college students under the sway of Marxism.

Their meddling not only did nothing to help black people, it set many of them years back. As Margo concludes, “whatever was done afterwards was not enough to compensate for the damage and whatever economic consequences came after that.”

These Riots Are Not Random Or Spontaneous

Many of today’s leaders and mainstream media outlets would have us believe that the riots and violence sweeping across America’s cities this year are spontaneous. But history and current evidence tell us otherwise.

As Lora Ries and Charles Stimson of The Heritage Foundation pointed out in a recent report, “Video evidence and arrest records demonstrate that some rioters…have moved from city to city to cause violence using repeated tactics. Their movement and the places they go are not random. Rather, this appears to be part of an organized effort to cause chaos and destruction across the country…”

Similarly, Mike Gonzalez recently wrote in City Journal:

The protests that sprang up in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis seemed like spontaneous outpourings of grief and anger. They weren’t entirely. Though many who joined their ranks may have been moved by outrage at the images of Floyd’s death, those operating behind the scenes have prepared for this moment for a long time.

Gonzalez cites Melina Abdullah, of BLM’s Los Angeles chapter, who told an interviewer that the demonstrations in that city had been strategically planned: “We built kind of an organizing strategy that said, build black community [to] disrupt white supremacy.”

The New York Times also cites the role of Black Lives Matter: “One of the reasons there have been protests in so many places in the United States is the backing of organizations like Black Lives Matter. While the group isn’t necessarily directing each protest, it provides materials, guidance and a framework for new activists.”

Not Just Parallels, But Direct Links

Not only are there strong parallels between the riots of 2020 and the riots of the 1960s, but there is a direct link between the organizers. As Gonzalez points out, one of the three BLM founders, Patrice Cullors, spent a decade working as a radical organizer in the Labor/Community Strategy Center, which was established and run by Eric Mann, a former member of the Weather Underground.

They bombed the State Department, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the California attorney general’s office, and a New York City police station.

The Weather Underground was formed in 1969 as a militant wing of the Students for a Democratic Society. They sought “the destruction of U.S. imperialism and [to] form a classless communist world.” In seeking those ends, they bombed the State Department, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the California attorney general’s office, and a New York City police station.

Andrew McCarthy recently documented ties between the BLM Global Network and the Weather Underground. Kyle Shideler has also exposed the ideological roots of BLM’s obsession with white privilege, which can be traced directly to the terrorists of the Weather Underground.

As the United States now finally embarks on a serious effort to uncover whether, as Rand Paul charges, the current rioting is planned and organized, they would do well to rediscover the ground-breaking work of Methvin. He exposed the very real injustices faced by black Americans, but he also exposed the way those injustices were exploited by those who had been seduced by the lies of Marxist utopia.

Through painstaking research, Methven was able to uncover exactly how those radical organizers turned despair and frustration into violence. We can also now see, with the benefit of hindsight, that the social demolition of the revolutionaries only hurt those it aspired to help.

To Truly Help Black People, Reject BLM

Why is this all of this so vitally important? Because right now, many well-intentioned Americans believe they are helping black people by putting Black Lives Matter signs in their front yards. A number of corporations believe they are helping stamp out racism by donating millions of dollars to Black Lives Matter. Middle schools and high schools across the country are using a curriculum developed by Black Lives Matter to teach children that America is riddled with systemic racism.

But in fact, Black Lives Matter is not about helping black people. It is about using black people to achieve the co-founders’ revolutionary, ideological aims.

BLM wants to overthrow the American system of deliberative democracy and ordered liberty and replace it with their Marxist hell. The sooner Americans wake up to that reality, the less black people will suffer as a result of their current exploitation by the radical left.

Organization With Chinese Communist Party Ties Funds BLM Ventures,"The Black Futures Lab, a venture of Black Lives Matter founder Alicia Garza, is sponsored by the Chinese Progressive Association (CPA), an organization that works with China’s communist government to push its agenda in the United States, according to an investigation by the Heritage Foundation’s Mike Gonzalez.

Gonzalez discovered that the Black Futures Lab donation page explicitly states they are “a fiscally sponsored project of the Chinese Progressive Association,” explaining where donations to Black Futures Lab are funneled.

Gonzalez explains the history of the CPA in the United States, documenting the activities the group sponsors on behalf of the Chinese government, including one instance in which the People’s Republic of China flag was flown over Boston’s City Hall to honor the takeover of China by the Chinese Communist Party. The CPA is routinely praised for its work in the U.S. by China’s official mouthpiece, China Daily.

“It is clear, then, that CPA works with China’s communist government, pushes its agenda here in the United States, and is regularly praised by China’s state-owned mouthpieces,” Gonzalez writes. “It is clear, too, from, this perspective, why the CPA would sponsor a new enterprise by Garza: They espouse the same desire for world communism.”

Garza, the founder of Black Futures Lab, is also the founder of the openly Marxist, global organization Black Lives Matter and the numerous domestic organizations, such as the Movement For Black Lives, that are related to it. The BLM organization sponsors and proposes Marxist public policy such as socialized ownership of resources, banks, and businesses, a highly unequal income tax, putting everyone on welfare through a “minimum income,” and government jobs. In 2015, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said she and her fellow organizers are “trained Marxists.”

Garza’s organization that the Chinese Progressive Association funds, Black Futures Lab, appears to be a lobbying group advocating for “local-, state- and federal-level policies that make Black communities stronger,” and goals which presumably fall in line with Garza’s Marxist ideology.

The prominence of Black Lives Matter’s role in heightening racial strife in American recent years cannot be understated. As Ben Weingarten writes at The Federalist, BLM is “collectively rooted in and devoted to Marxism, Jew-hatred, violence, racism, social discord, and the undermining of our founding values and principles.” Of course, China would see value in funding such an organization.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/16/chinese-organization-with-communist-party-ties-funds-black-lives-matter-ventures/,2020-09-16
Leftist Hostility Makes U-Chicago's Intellectual Diversity Pledge A Joke,"A July statement by the University of Chicago English Department faculty announced “For the 2020-2021 graduate admissions cycle, the University of Chicago English Department is accepting only applicants interested in working in and with Black studies.”

The English Department’s move to block other areas of intellectual exploration was picked up this week by major news outlets, creating a lot of negative press for the university. While many were shocked by the English Department’s statement, as a third-year student at the University of Chicago, I was not.

Ironically, the University of Chicago prides itself on what they call the “Chicago Principles,” a mission statement claiming a commitment to protecting free speech and encouraging open debate. The publication of the Chicago Principles garnered the university a lot of media attention, kudos from parents concerned with leftist orthodoxy, and set the University of Chicago apart from other elite universities in its efforts to create an environment of political and ideological tolerance on campus. The principles have even been adopted by other schools.

Unfortunately, in practice, the University of Chicago is hardly a bastion of free speech and political tolerance. It socially and academically rewards groupthink. This summer university departments and administration officials have imposed their politics on the campus community, further emboldening a left-wing mob of students who routinely bully conservatives into silence.

Using University Resources to Push False Leftist Narratives

The faculty letter from the Graduate English Department is akin to a June email from the Physics Department Chair, Young-Kee Kim, sent after the death of George Floyd, a man who died in police custody while resisting arrest with a “fatal level” of fentanyl in his system, according to the Minnesota Judicial Branch.

Kim wrote that the “Physics Department is deeply committed to diversity, inclusion, and racial justice.” Kim continued, writing, “each of us needs to learn about the Black experience, study the systemic barriers, examine implicit biases, and take concrete actions to eliminate those barriers and biases.”

Kim then asks members of the Physics Department to join her and the EDI (Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) Committee in dedicating June 10 to support the “#Strike4BlackLives,” “#ShutDownAcademia,” and “#ShutDownSTEM.” The June 10th “strike” website Kim directs students to, “Particles for Justice,” asks “non-Black scientists” to choose from a list of “suggested actions” to take during the strike.

In June, Emilio Kourí, the chair of the History Department, sent a different email, proclaiming the University of Chicago History Department stands in “solidarity with the ongoing protests, grief, and righteous rage being voiced across the country…” The email pledged allegiance and support to the self-proclaimed Marxist group, reading, “We collectively affirm that Black Lives Matter.” The capitalization “Black Lives Matter” points to the organization Black Lives Matter.

BLM goes far beyond supporting “mainstream” leftist positions, such as socialized health care and dramatically increased taxes. BLM’s platform calls for much more radical policies. These include creating socialism in black communities, instituting reparations (including to people residing in the United States illegally), defunding the police, and perhaps most disturbing is “disrupt[ing] the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.”

Not only is the highly political email inappropriate, but it is also insensitive to the thousands who have lost their livelihoods and lives at the hands of BLM riots that have roiled America’s cities, big and small, all summer. As a University of Chicago history major, I am troubled that the History Department’s chair feels emboldened enough to make divisive and political statements on behalf of the entire department. I am not alone.

Professor Rachel Fulton Brown, a university associate professor of medieval history, told The Federalist that the email on behalf of the History Department in June 2020 violated the statement senior members of the department put out in September 2017. The 2017 History Department statement affirms, “As a faculty body, the Department of History does not endorse or defend the scholarly, political or personal views expressed by any of its members.”

“I expressed to Professor Kourí my discomfort with the June 2020 statement being issued without signatures and with the implication that it spoke for the department as a whole,” Fulton Brown said. “I myself do not see how the June 2020 statement is congruent either with the senior faculty’s previous position nor with the Chicago Principles to which we as an institution have previously adhered.”

Constant Politicization of Study

The English, physics, and history Departments are not outliers. I also received a slew of highly political and divisive emails from top members of the university administration following the death of George Floyd and the eruption of Black Lives Matter riots across the country.

Here is another email I received, this time from the dean of students, Jay Ellison. In addition to proclaiming a trend of violence against “people of color,” the dean dubbed the death of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor “murder,” even though none of these cases have yet been decided as comprising murder in a court of law.

Ka Yee C. Lee, the university Provost, claimed in another unprofessional email that Floyd’s death was “racially motivated.” She also affirmed, “These recent examples represent a small fraction of the bias and violence that occurs across the U.S. and around the world each day.”

This email from former university president Robert J. Zimmer and Lee stated that “the recent killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and too many others” show there is no “true freedom and equality” in America. They continued writing that “The promise of freedom remains out of reach for many unless we as individuals and a society act to make it so for everyone.”

These are not neutral takes from the university administration. Many people in the United States still believe that America is the land of opportunity and freedom, not racism and oppression.

As The Federalist’s Joy Pullmann puts it, “If the United States were a racist country committing black genocide, you would expect to see black and Hispanic Americans leaving, not trying to get in. When people are targeted for genocide, they flee. But no Americans of any ancestry are fleeing this country en masse. We are a country that has to put up walls to keep people out, unlike the nations with actual gulags that put up walls to keep people in.”

Opposing Socialism Generates Death Threat

In March, I participated in a University of Chicago’s “nonpartisan” Institute of Politics (IOP) digital initiative, called “I vote because…,” where students pose with a small whiteboard stating their personal reasons for voting. I wrote, “I vote because the coronavirus won’t destroy America, but socialism will.”

I was naïvely unprepared for the onslaught of online hate and threats of violence I received. Fellow students attacked my character, intellect, family, and appearance using foul and offensive language. I was called a racist and a xenophobe. Some compared me to animals. Others declared I deserved to be bullied and that I don’t belong at the University of Chicago on account of my beliefs. I was told I was the most hated person on campus.

For days, I pored over vile posts and comments. I was in shock and emotional distress. I didn’t defend myself. In fact, I didn’t respond to a single comment or post about me online, whether it was negative or positive. It wasn’t until I received a death threat from one of my classmates that I made the decision to write an op-ed, sharing my side of the story and defending what I wrote on my whiteboard.

Following the publication of my op-ed, David Axelrod released a statement on behalf of the Institute of Politics condemning the violence and personal attacks I received. Although I was grateful for Axelrod’s statement, it, unfortunately, validated the defamation of character students employed in calling me xenophobic and racist.

Axelrod wrote, “While the author is right when she proclaims that the virus will ‘not destroy America,’ the minimization of it was offensive to those who have loved ones here and overseas who have been infected or whose lives have been disrupted — which may very quickly include all of us — in large ways and small.”

What happened to me is exactly why university imposed politics is so damaging. I hoped that my experience would have inspired students, faculty, and the administration to reexamine campus culture and recommit to the Chicago Principles. Instead, the administration and department heads at the University of Chicago created a hyper-partisan culture through emails and other official means, sending an implied message that silences debate on important issues.

By using my tuition dollars to cast themselves as moral arbiters, dissenters are automatically categorized as racist or anti-justice. This emboldens leftists on campus, who already wield an outsized voice and power. In short, it inspires a mob mentality. Unfortunately, dissenting students, who saw what happened to me, are more scared than ever to speak their minds on campus.

Needless to say, lending the official imprimatur of the university to one political side creates a culture of intolerance and active exclusion of students and professors with opposing points of view. This is contrary to the University of Chicago’s stated mission and it is, sadly, making an already hostile political climate on campus even worse.

Study: Up To 95 Percent Of 2020 U.S. Riots Linked To Black Lives Matter,"Contrary to corporate media narratives, up to 95 percent of this summer’s riots are linked to Black Lives Matter activism, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). The data also show that nearly 6 percent — or more than 1 in 20 — of U.S. protests between May 26 and Sept. 5 involved rioting, looting, and similar violence, including 47 fatalities.

ACLED is a nonprofit organization that tracks conflict across the globe. Its U.S. project that collected the summer protest data is supported by Princeton University. The project’s spreadsheet collating tens of thousands of data points documents 12,045 incidents of U.S. civil unrest from May 26, 2020 to Sept. 5, 2020. May 26 is the day after George Floyd’s death in police custody with enough fentanyl in his system to have died of an overdose if police had never touched him.

Of the 633 incidents coded as riots, 88 percent are recorded as involving Black Lives Matter activists. Data for 51 incidents lack information about the perpetrators’ identities. BLM activists were involved in 95 percent of the riots for which there is information about the perpetrators’ affiliation.

Early estimates from insurance agencies say the cost of this summer’s rioting will set a record surpassing that of the 1992 Rodney King riots, which cost an inflation-adjusted $1.2 billion. Much of that will be paid by taxpayers in the form of overtime and hazard pay for police and EMTs, emergency room visits, destruction of public property, and more. Of course, rioters are inflicting these costs during a time governments, and the people who fund them, have fewer resources due to coronavirus shutdowns and pent-up entitlement obligations.

A look at an interactive map illustrating the data shows just how widespread the summer BLM-linked rioting has been. It has not been limited merely to anarchist strongholds such as Portland, Oregon, or locales that saw media-spotlighted violent interactions between police and suspects, but has stretched across both major and minor U.S. cities and included dozens of locales with no violent police incidents this summer.

Here are some screenshots of the map. The circle size indicates the number of riots.

According to this record, rioting occurred in the United States this summer not just in Portland, New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, and other large U.S. cities, but in small and midsize cities such as Fort Collins, Co. (population 170,000), Cottonwood Heights, Utah (population 33,800), Gilbert, Ariz. (population 258,900), Wichita, Kan. (population 388,800), and Davenport, Iowa (population 382,600). Forty-seven states have seen riots this summer.

A report accompanying the data project, however, reads like an upscale attempt to blame the police for criminals’ decision to steal, kill, and destroy. Several times the report explicitly does so, such as here: “Although federal authorities were purportedly deployed to keep the peace, the move appears to have re-escalated tensions. Prior to the deployment, over 83% of demonstrations in Oregon were non-violent. Post-deployment, the percentage of violent demonstrations has risen from under 17% to over 42% (see graph below), suggesting that the federal response has only aggravated unrest.”

This is a logical fallacy called post hoc, ergo propter hoc: Because one thing happened after another, the first thing caused the second. It’s just plain false. In science, this error is described as the difference between correlation and causation. Social scientists ought to be aware of and refrain from employing it, yet these did not.

The cause of violence is not the police. It is not poverty. It is not one’s race. To say so is in fact a smear against poor people and people of the racial group identified. The cause of violence is the people who have chosen to be violent.

Rather than assigning responsibility for violence to those who engage in it, the report constantly pushes the criminal victimization narrative that the rioters are not to blame for their rioting. This is abuser psychology 101: The abuser is never responsible for his or her abuse. The people who might object to it are. This is also false and manipulative.

The report also attempts to downplay the wave of BLM-linked violence sweeping the nation this summer, even while documenting it.

“The vast majority of demonstration events associated with the BLM movement are non-violent (see map below). In more than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement, demonstrators have not engaged in violence or destructive activity,” it states. “Peaceful protests are reported in over 2,400 distinct locations around the country. Violent demonstrations, meanwhile, have been limited to fewer than 220 locations — under 10% of the areas that experienced peaceful protests.”

I’m sure it is comforting to those whose businesses have been burned down and insurance won’t cover it to hear that the movement that ruined their livelihoods protests peacefully in most other cities.

When unarmed black people comprise 1.2 percent (or less) of annual police shootings, it is alleged to be a gross injustice that may legitimize, or at least excuse, murder, and theft. Yet when an activist movement is linked with riots approximately 6 percent of the time it engages in public protest, we are to see that movement as “non-violent.”

ACLED labels a 5 percent rate of police use of “force” — such as rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray, and other crowd dispersal techniques — as “heavy handed.” Thus ACLED both claims a 6 percent rate of rioting is “peaceful” and “non-violent” and that a 5 percent rate of police response to such riots is “heavy handed.”

“Over 5% of all events linked to the BLM movement have been met with force by authorities, compared to under 1% of all other demonstrations,” its report says. Elsewhere, it says: “ACLED conducted a pilot data collection program for the US last summer, allowing for comparison of the current moment with the same time period last year. In July of this year alone, ACLED records nearly 2,000 demonstrations — an increase of 42% from the 1,400 demonstrations recorded in July 2019.”

The violence is not limited to the extreme of rioting. It is pervasive in the summer 2020 protests. Of the 12,045 incidents recorded by ACLED, 1,143 — or nearly 1 in 10 — involved violence of some sort: rioting, looting, clashes with police, cars rammed into crowds, bystanders pepper-sprayed, armed attacks. Of these violent incidents, 84 percent involved BLM.

These statistics could be interpreted as indicating BLM is unusually violent among U.S. political movements, but ACLED interprets it in a way that enables resentment against police. Widespread U.S. political demonstrations such as the Tea Party, however, almost never featured violence despite holding thousands of events. Tea Partiers were even known for cleaning up the public areas where they demonstrated.

The report goes on amazingly to suggest that police standing behind barricades using tear gas and rubber bullets is a disproportionate use of force against rioting in Portland that has included the use of blinding lasers, rushes at barricades with clubs, destruction of public buildings, bomb-throwing, arson, and murder: “In some contexts, like Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon (see below), the heavy-handed police response appears to have inflamed tensions and increased the risk of violent escalation,” the ACLED report says.

Judge for yourself whether police use of force and riot-dispersal techniques often seems justified by reading the project’s summaries of some of these riots based on largely local news reports. I picked incidents from smaller cities to avoid the most sensational and nationally publicized instances, in an effort to fairly illustrate what police were responding to. The italicized material below is all quoted directly from the project. The bold is added.

On 28 May 2020, about 200-400 people demonstrated in Columbus, Ohio in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and the death of George Floyd. The demonstration turned violent when businesses and the Ohio Statehouse were damaged. Some people threw water bottles, smoke bombs, and other items at police. Police used tear gas on the demonstrators.

On 28 May 2020, around 400 people held a demonstration in Albuquerque, New Mexico over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. At night, the demonstration turned violent when a group of rioters were approaching vehicles and trying to damage them. Also, several shots were fired from a car and 4 people were arrested. Another man took a baseball bat and started smashing police car’s windows. Police used gas to disperse the crowd and control the area.

On 29 May 2020, hundreds of people attended a demonstration in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against the death of George Floyd. The demonstration was initially peaceful until conflicts broke out between the demonstrators and the police. A demonstrator was pepper-sprayed twice in the face. Another demonstrator was shoved to the ground. Vandalism was reported. 29 people were arrested. Clashes continued until the next morning.

On 29 May 2020, over 1000 demonstrations [sic] were held in Des Moines, Iowa over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Police vehicles and buildings were damaged. Police used pepper spray and tear gas and made 12 arrests.

On 30 May 2020, people demonstrated in Grand Rapids (Michigan) in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Rioters smashed windows and lit fires. A non-violent demonstrator was pepper-sprayed and shot in the face with a ‘Spede-Heat’ round by a police officer.

According to many innocent victims of this wave of injustice, the police response is not robust enough. They want to know why the police are not protecting them and their property. They pay taxes. They contribute to the common good rather than attempt to destroy it. What’s the point of mayors and governors if they don’t ensure their police protect innocent people and their property when rioters come to town?",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/16/study-up-to-95-percent-of-2020-u-s-riots-are-linked-to-black-lives-matter/,2020-09-16
"Barr: BLM Uses Black Americans As ‘Props,’ Calls Out DOJ ‘Bureaucracy’","U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the “law has broken down” in the hands of prosecutors and that DOJ heads, checked by the American people, should oversee these unelected prosecutors to uphold law and order in the nation.

The executive branch has virtually unchecked power in bringing charges, Barr noted. “That means discretion is vested in the executive to determine when to exercise prosecution power,” Barr said to a “legal-sized” crowd at Hillsdale College’s Constitution Day Celebration on Wednesday evening,

The only question is: When should the branch use its prosecutorial power? The answer is left in the hands of prosecutors who, according to Barr, prioritize cases that they “can get,” meaning win, instead of the most important ones to prosecute.

“Federal prosecutors possess tremendous power,” Barr said. “Power that is necessary to enforce our laws and punish wrongdoing…but power that carries inherent potential for abuse.”

Such abuse is commonplace and usually takes shape in politically targeted prosecutions, he said.

“I’d like to be able to say that we don’t see headhunting in the Department of Justice,” he said. “That would not be truthful. I see it every day.”

The power of prosecutors is immense—merely opening an investigation can ruin companies and lives, he said. Barr cited Arthur Andersen LLP as an example, once one of the “Big Five” accounting firms until it was all but ruined after its reputation took a massive hit from a guilty verdict in an auditing case. The guilty conviction was ultimately reversed by the Supreme Court in 2005 due to errors by the original trial judge, but the company never recovered, and neither did the tens of thousands of jobs it once provided.

This was a result of great power in the prosecution’s hands. And as a part of the bureaucracy, these prosecutors don’t face accountability for their actions, so they must be “carefully calibrated” and “carefully supervised” because, “left unchecked, it [prosecutorial discretion] has the power to inflict far more harm than it prevents,” Barr warned.

The most basic and essential check on this power, Barr argues, is political accountability.

“Political accountability, politics, is what ultimately ensures our system does its work fairly,” Barr said. “Government power completely divorced from political accountability is tyranny.”

Black Lives Matter Uses Americans as ‘Props’

Barr also remarked on pressing legal matters of the day, including coronavirus shutdowns and Black Lives Matter protests and riots blanketing the country this summer. Barr said the Black Lives Matter movement is “not interested in black lives.” He said the idea of black lives mattering is not debatable; of course they do. But, he said, the group itself doesn’t actually care about black lives, as evidenced by their own statements and behavior.

“They’re interested in props, a small number of blacks who are killed by police during conflicts with police — usually less than a dozen a year — who they can use as props to achieve a much broader political agenda,” he said. Bar, instead views the priorities for black American lives as “not only keeping people alive, but also having prosperity and flourishing their communities.”

“Most deaths in the inner city of young black males below the age of 44…is being shot by another black person,” he noted. The left likes to talk about “root causes,” Barr said, hinting at claims of systemic racism. But all the political changes the BLM movement demands “depend on peaceful streets at the end of the day.”

Education, after-school activities, and other solutions to inner-city violence depend on peace, he said. Gangs can’t run schools, he noted. Instead, “the foundation of all human progress is the rule of law,” Barr said to a loud round of applause.

COVID Lockdowns ‘Treat Free Citizens as Babies’

Barr also spoke on the COVID lockdowns and the drastic effects from shutting states down.

“Putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,” Barr told the crowd. Calling the lockdowns “draconian,” Barr slammed governors across the country who have shut their states down indefinitely, even as case counts drop.

“Most of the governors do what bureaucrats always do, which is… defy common sense,” Barr argued. “They treat free citizens as babies that can’t take responsibility for themselves and others.”

He stressed the importance of businesses across the country making their own decisions for safely operating, saying that governors have to “give business people an opportunity.”

“Let them try to adapt their business to that and you’ll have ingenuity and people will at least have the freedom to try to earn a living,” he said.

Appointed Officials Must Be Accountable to Elected Leaders

Barr flipped a common left-wing complaint about his tenure on its head. “William Barr, Trump’s Sword and Shield” and “How William Barr is Weaponizing the Justice Department to Help Trump Win” are just two recent headlines promoting this frequent attack against Barr’s Justice Department: it’s politicized and bent on helping President Trump win.

Of course, his role is political, as his decisions play a factor in whether he keeps his job, but this accountability forces good decisions to be made, Barr said. Political pressure is placed on the attorney general and senior DOJ officials, thus making them political, but “in a good and necessary sense,” he said.

“Because the attorney general is ultimately politically accountable for every decision that the department makes, I and my predecessors have had an obligation to ensure that we make the correct decision,” Barr said, calling his role in the DOJ similar to that of a supervisor.

Those in the Justice Department with ultimate authority are given that responsibility by elected officials. Those under him, career prosecutors, cannot have the final say in matters nor make hard decisions since they won’t face public repercussions for their decisions. Barr challenged the group to “name one successful company where the lowest members are deemed sacrosanct.” You can’t, he answered, except perhaps “in a Montessori preschool.”

For this reason, the attorney general is vital to a successful judiciary system. There is a reason there are 93 United States attorneys but only one attorney general: “The buck stops at the top,” Barr said.

Referencing the many accusations of “interference” by him and his team, Barr questioned the charge, as overseeing cases is the job of the attorney general. On the contrary, Barr said, his active engagement in cases is “essential to the rule of law.”

“We must strive for consistency, and that is yet another reason why centralized senior leadership exists to harmonize the disparate views of our many prosecutors in a consistent policy,” he said.

Relying on the attorney general for final decisions and uniformity allows for the rule of law to reign in the department, he argued. Barr cited former attorney general and Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson’s statement that even when “the government technically loses its case, it has really won if justice has been done.”

The attorney general’s speech met standing ovations and cheers from the audience.

New Documentary Examines The Death Of Michael Brown And Race In America,"Shelby Steele, a conservative author and Robert J. and Marion E. Oster Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote and narrated a new documentary, “What Killed Michael Brown?”, exploring race and violence in America.

Directed by Eli Steele and set to premiere on streaming platforms on October 16, “What Killed Michael Brown?” is meant to examine race relations in the United States and the reactions to the deaths of young black men such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

“America’s original sin is not slavery. It is simply the use of race, as a means to power,” the trailer states. “Was it really racism that killed Michael Brown?”

Steele believes it is the culture of black victimization and the rise of “white guilt” that plays a role in the increasing amount of attention and outrage at these events.

“One of the things we hope comes out of this film is that you, the viewer, sees that over and over we’ll go down that road. ‘We’ll make race count here. We’ll make it right. We’ll use race to do the good thing to uplift people.’ That’s the worst thing you can ever hear. Then you know corruption will follow,” Steele explained.

While Steele claims that growing up as a black man during segregation and the civil rights movement showed him the importance of the black advocacy craved by many of the people in Ferguson and other cities, he claims that many black leaders such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson “exploit these situations” for political gain.

In the film, Steele said he avoided political and partisan and instead chose to dig into the “fictions” of race that contributed to these shootings and events.

According to Steele education and broken homes are areas that black people are ignoring in exchange for targeting racism.

“We use racism and white racism as an avoid, as an escape from the real work,” Steele said

“One thing that burns me up with black relatives is that they believe in whites being the agent of black fate. They believe more in whites than they do in blacks. They believe we’re weak. They believe we’re inferior and that we’re not gonna do anything,” Steele added. “That’s what black people, very often, too, believe. That’s what that has to be changed.”

Moving forward, Steele said he believes that black people need to embrace the freedom that they have as Americans to embrace that change.

“Freedom is a frightening thing. And when the responsibility for your life is put back into your own hands, that makes us all nervous. But let’s face that. Let’s deal with that,” he said.

In June, Steele told The Federalist that today’s racial tensions are caused by the explosion of a racial change during the civil rights movement and the development of “redemptive liberalism.”

“The left has discovered that there’s enormous power in claiming to be redemptive, claiming and putting yourself on the side of the good. And so the left always is a constant scream of political correctness and do-gooders in one kind or another and claiming the mantle of power in order to say ‘We will redeem America. We will be the ones who make America achieve its dreams of equity for all,’” Steele said.

Why Black Lives Matter Only Empowers Racist White Leftists,"Black Lives Matter is the operational arm of “critical race theory,” the postmodern philosophy of “critical theory” applied to race. Critical theory suffers an inescapable epistemological conundrum. It’s the Liar’s Paradox: If a Cretan says all Cretans are liars, is he to be believed?

Or, in the case of critical theory: If a theory denies objective or universal truths, claiming that the powers-that-be subconsciously construct “reality” by projecting their will to power onto the transcendent screen of axiomatic certainty, all to perpetuate structures of power in which they’re on top, then does not critical theory itself fall under that same dynamic?

Put another way, how on earth do critical theorists exempt themselves from what they say are forces at work determining what everyone else does? How on earth is critical theory itself not a quest for power by those who came up with the theory?

Dead White Men Strike Again

So, who came up with critical theory? You got it: white men. Or do you not recognize in Immanuel Kant, Karl Marx, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, Ferdinand de Saussure, George Herbert Mead, Noam Chomsky, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Derrida, a whiteness the lilies themselves would envy. Should we not add critical theory to the list of oppressive systems dead white men came up with to advance white power?

But, you say, theorists of critical race theory are black. Right, but this proves nothing. Doesn’t critical race theory say whites need “Uncle Toms” so they can tell themselves nice bedtime stories about how wonderful they are?

Doesn’t the current system of “white privilege” need its black capitalists, black police officers, and black Republicans so whites can feel good about the system? Why wouldn’t the same dynamic be at work with critical theory regarding critical race theory?

Recently deceased black social critic Stanley Crouch recognized the game when he called the black theorists of critical race theory “trickle-down Negro Marxists.” Indeed, that trickle flows straight down from a sudsy cauldron of White Id.

Or, put in the terms of critical race theory, white men are the “epistemological plantation masters” for the obedient “house negroes” coming up with critical race theory. These ideas didn’t originate in Nigeria — which might explain why Nigerians love America, love President Trump, and want to move here.

Leftism Needs to Keep Blacks Down

According to its own terms, critical race theory must be racist. Furthermore, Black Lives Matter, the political movement based on its theories, must also be racist—and not black racism, but white racism. At a deep, subconscious level, it serves the purpose of advancing and enhancing “white privilege.”

How else do you explain rich white kids screeching venom at black police officers and business owners? Or how else do you explain that the theorist who’s been most empowered by critical race theory is white author Robin DiAngelo?

Ruminate on the sad indisputability of this statement for a moment: Something in the leftists’ minds needs to keep minorities from finding hope and advancing in existent American “systems.”

Meanwhile, of necessity by the terms of critical race theory, the flip side of this dynamic is going on. Leftists feel the new world order will advance their wills to power. Now, at the subconscious level, leftists don’t know they’re doing this. They may reject they’re doing this — because they have white fragility. Or, more accurately, they are projecting onto others what they themselves are.

They are truly the racists, as they always have been. And here’s sort of an obvious point: They’re telling everyone this now. This is exactly what they’re currently saying: “We’re all racist.” To which I say, “Speak for yourself, but interesting what you’re saying.”

Whites Gonna White

Consider: ten years from now, does anyone doubt things will be essentially the same as they are now, with some tweaks here and there in the bureaucratic apparatus of civil rights law gumming everything up (particularly for minority entrepreneurs at the lower rungs of the ladder to success), but by and large the same disparities between black and white will continue?

Or, will things, unfortunately, become worse? If things stay on the current track, urban areas will be gutted by riots, black-on-black crime will continue to surge, and as the victimology inherent in critical race theory convinces black Americans they have no hope of advancement in our nation, despair and poverty will increase as well.

Whites, meanwhile, will have felt cathartically purified with their “We Believe” signs proudly displayed behind their white picket fences. A host of rich, white graduates of some “studies” degree — who, normally, would have no power, to say nothing of a job, under healthy circumstances — will populate government bureaucracies and human resources departments with comfortable six-figure incomes.

Who do you suppose will benefit most from that new regime of civil rights law? Sounds like a nice system if you’re an upper-middle-class white leftist. That’s because it is. It’s exactly as critical race theory proposes. “Whites gonna white,” says the theory, so how can the theory itself be anything other than the latest vehicle for whites to empower themselves?

The evidence bears this out. The left has had decades of power and control of our cities, academia, and media. They’ve had ample opportunities to demonstrate the wonders of their ideas. Yet all we see is the perpetuation of the very things they decry, while they gain more and more power.

For decades, we’ve been told all the violence and ugliness spawned by leftism are merely the birth pangs of a new system. Well, how long do you leftists need to give birth? Enough already! Give us a taste of the glories of the New World in your urban microcosms!

Or maybe, as Maya Angelou said, “When someone shows you who he is, believe him.” Leftists are outing themselves as racists complicit in perpetuating systems of oppression. Maybe we should believe them.

The Dangers of Critical Race Theory

Perhaps an honest appraisal of critical race theory is in order, so we can liberate ourselves from the sticky epistemological tentacles of a nonsensical theory. Unfortunately, writ into the DNA of its axioms is the deconstruction of rational dialogue — that too, you see, is just another tool of white privilege. Leftism can’t have room for questions.

We could extol what is by and large a just system for the advancement of anyone who applies himself and works hard — the American system. Individuals in that system could be spending their days in hope and personal achievement using the liberties available to them in this country. Or we could have a healthy discussion about race as it relates to traditional American principles.

Yet instead, we’ll just have to wait for the virus of critical race theory to work its nihilistic destruction on the black community, while whites sit on the sidelines with their shut, masked mouths, on bended knee, advancing their privilege.

"Chris Wallace, We Were In Kenosha. White Supremacists Didn't Cause Violence","If Chris Wallace’s goal during Tuesday night’s debate was to deflect from the months of left-wing violence from Black Lives Matter extremists and Antifa and instead blame it on President Donald Trump and his supporters, he did an excellent job.

“You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups,” Wallace, the debate moderator, said to Trump. “But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland?”

Ignoring for a moment that Trump’s criticism of Joe Biden was absolutely warranted and that Wallace asked Trump to condemn white supremacists but did not ask Biden to condemn Black Lives Matter arsonists and looters, the question itself was specious. The violence in Kenosha was spurred by left-wing extremist groups, not white supremacists. We know — because we were there.

It Was Left-Wing Groups that Trashed Kenosha

Kenosha was up in flames, reduced to the same lawlessness that swept Minneapolis, Portland, Atlanta, and now this small Midwest town. Monday night in Kenosha, a day after law enforcement shot Jacob Blake, men and women stood with baseball bats and guns in front of their businesses and homes, trying to defend themselves against the extremist violence of the Black Lives Matter left. Since there weren’t enough police to control the situation, officers focused on defending public buildings, such as the courthouse, while leaving citizens to fend for themselves.

A woman, who said she had lived in Kenosha for more than 40 years, broke down in tears, saying her city felt like a “war zone” and she was “terrified.”

According to locals and reporting, the violence was caused by out-of-state agitators. On Thursday, local and federal law enforcement officials stopped an out-of-state caravan of vehicles filled with fuel cans and illegal fireworks. “The vehicles contained various items, including helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks, and suspected controlled substances,” according to police, who arrested nine people for disorderly conduct.

The vehicles were reportedly connected to the Seattle-based Riot Kitchen, a group of radical-left protesters. While several mainstream media accounts portrayed the group as friendly helpers, the stories couldn’t explain why they were loading up so many cans of gas and why the Riot Kitchen crew fled from police.

Sam, an Indian immigrant who owns a family-run car dealership downtown, lost “every dime” he had, and the 20 people Sam employed have all lost their jobs “for nothing.” Sam said his family had been “in tears” for days after rioters burned his lot two nights in a row, destroying all the cars, and looting his office before burning that as well.

“I’m a taxpayer,” said Sam, distraught that law enforcement did nothing to protect his business, which was left to the mercy of the mob. “This is not the America I came into. … What did we do to deserve all this?” he asked. “I’m a minority too. I’m a brown person. I have nothing to do with this.”

Contrary to what Wallace implied, neither did white supremacists or militia groups. Black Lives Matter rioters were in fact proud to take credit. Sam told The Federalist that more than a week after the Blake shooting, Black Lives Matter rioters came back to his shop in broad daylight to make “music videos” in the wreckage of his business “like they were so proud of it,” taunting him with, “this is what you get.”

Desperate pleas for mercy from the rioters confirmed who was instigating the violence. If business owners were trying to avoid losing everything to white supremacists, they wouldn’t have displayed placards signaling support for BLM and signs reading “minority-owned” in their storefronts — yet that’s exactly what they did.

Kyle Rittenhouse Wasn’t a White Supremacist

Like many other media figures and Democrats, Wallace seemed to be cherry-picking one instance of violence from a demonstrator linked to the political right, at the expense of accurately covering the rampant lawlessness instigated by leftist extremists. Kyle Rittenhouse became the face of so-called right-wing violence in Kenosha.

Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Hispanic boy who worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha, saw the destruction and violence and picked up his AR-15 to patrol the streets. In a video shot around 10 p.m., Rittenhouse explained his purpose, saying, “People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If there’s somebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.”

Later that night, things escalated when three shootings left two people dead and another injured. Police apprehended Rittenhouse, the alleged shooter. Videos capturing the shootings suggest Rittenhouse might have been justified in self-defense.

Whether Rittenhouse, an Illinois native, belonged in Kenosha in the first place is debatable, but nothing suggests the boy was motivated by white supremacy or was part of a larger militia group. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League found no evidence he was or is connected to any extremist movements.

Yet Democrats and their friends in the corporate media, such as Wallace, have tried to paint Rittenhouse as a “white supremacist” in order to deflect all blame from the real agitators, left-wing groups such as BLM and Antifa.

The Right Didn’t Start the Kenosha Violence

Rittenhouse’s guilt has not been confirmed in a court of law, yet Wallace defamed him with gross charges of racism on national television with 29 million people watching.

Biden did the same on social media in a wholly inappropriate smear. On Monday, Biden tweeted a video featuring Rittenhouse, with the caption, “There’s no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night.”

Wednesday it was announced Rittenhouse is pursuing a libel case against Biden and his campaign for the advertisement suggesting he is a white supremacist. Rittenhouse’s attorney, Lin Wood, said he plans to “rip Joe into shreds.”

Not only was Wallace’s debate tactic dirty, but it is factually wrong to say the violence and destruction that consumed Kenosha was spawned by “white supremacists,” given that the overwhelming majority of arrests were of left-wing rioters.

Trump pointed out that the majority of violence in places like Kenosha is coming from “the left-wing, not from the right-wing.” Democrats’ “right-wing extremists” narrative has become increasingly difficult to defend, with accounts from on-the-ground reporters shattering their talking points. A recent study found that 95 percent of riots in the United States this year have been tied to Black Lives Matter.

Taking his cues from Wallace, Biden shouted at Trump to denounce Proud Boys, a right-wing group. The only instance of Proud Boys in Kenosha, however, wasn’t during the nights of violence, but during the day. Two demonstrators sporting Proud Boys paraphernalia engaged in a verbal confrontation with three dozen BLM demonstrators, who were present to protest Trump’s visit.

Reporters said the two demonstrators did not appear to be armed and were being followed by the large group of BLM protesters. When the clash appeared volatile, law enforcement encircled the two Proud Boys demonstrators, who “appeared to be frightened,” walked them to nearby squad cars, and removed them from the area. It’s safe to say the duo didn’t “add to the violence,” to use Wallace’s words.

Democrats Keep Pushing Lies on Americans

Despite the endless accounts this summer of violence instigated by left-wing groups — which have left police officers dead, businesses and homes reduced to ashes, and communities in anarchic disarray — Democrats and the media keep pushing their “white supremacist” talking point.

Many voters and residents of these torn cities aren’t buying it. “You’re telling me you’re going to burn down my neighborhood?” Valerie, a 25-year-old black woman and former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee, told the Federalist in Kenosha of Black Lives Matter. “No, I don’t want to be a Democrat anymore.”

So MSNBC can keep standing in front of burning cities and calling them “mostly peaceful” protests, and Chris Wallace can keep pretending the right is to blame for the violence. But we were in Kenosha. We talked to people on the ground. Voters know who the peaceful protesters are and who the rioters are.

George Soros Attempts To Unseat L.A. County’s First Black Female DA,"Billionaire and Democrat mega-donor Geroge Soros recently gave $1.5 million to George Gascon’s campaign for Los Angeles district attorney. Gascon is a Black Lives Matter-endorsed prosecutor who has promises to lock up fewer criminals, running against incumbent L.A. DA Jackie Lacey.

Soros has a long history of funding radical international and domestic movements to advance the left’s agenda. Since 2015, he has been investing in local district attorney elections because DAs who are soft on crime will increase crime rates and enable rioting. The resulting social instability and fear play into the left’s desires for bigger government. Naturally, he has been quite successful, given that candidates in these races typically spend in the low five figures.

The left-wing activist has pumped tens of millions of dollars into local races in Texas, Colorado, California, Oregon, Washington, Florida, and New York, as well as swing states such as Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Arizona. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2018 that Soros spent $2,700,000 on California DA races alone, and another $16 million on 17 DA races in other states.

The money Soros is pouring into the L.A. County race aims to remove Lacey, who is the county’s first black district attorney and is seeking a third term. According to The Daily Wire, social justice advocacy groups, including Black Lives Matter, recruited Gascon to come to L.A. He was previously DA in San Francisco, which has become nationally notorious for its refusal to enforce drug, violence, theft, and other basic safety and decency laws, resulting in unsafe and poop-filled streets where women and children are terrorized by vagrants.

Gascon has met with the co-founder and key strategist of the Black Lives Matter global network, Patrisse Cullors. Cullors has publicly proclaimed herself a “trained Marxist.”

One would think that a group like Black Lives Matter would not be interested in unseating a black woman and replacing her with a white man. However, Lacey has become a target of leftists like Soros and groups like BLM because the left doesn’t truly care about people’s identities, it just uses identity politics when useful to gain power. Since Lacey’s sex and race are not useful to the left’s goals in this case, they don’t care that she’s black woman. She must go.

“No matter who you have in this job, they still have to follow California law,” Lacey said in a CNN interview. In contrast, Gascon has made a name for himself by crafting two state measures, Proposition 47 and Proposition 57, both of which benefit hardcore criminals. Proposition 47 decriminalizes drug and theft offenses, reducing the felonies to misdemeanors. Proposition 57 gives serious criminals such as rapists, human traffickers, child molesters, and drive-by-shooters early release from prison.

Michele Hanisee, president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys (ADDA), a professional group of deputy prosecutors in L.A. County, said on their website, “Special interest groups, funded by George Soros, pumped millions of dollars into district attorney races across the county.” “In Los Angeles County, we can expect big money to be spent on the District Attorney’s race,” warned Hanisee, “George Gascon will attract Soros PAC money by promising not to enforce the laws that voters enacted.”

The ADDA endorsed Lacey, stating she is an “experienced, career prosecutor with a record of reforming the justice system while keeping crime at historically low rates.” “She has kept politics out of the DA’s office and respected the rule of law,” the group affirmed. “Gascon, on the other hand,” wrote Hanisee, “is running on a promise of ‘turning our court system upside down.’”

Rioting Hits Another Wisconsin Suburb Over Black Officer Returning Fire,"Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa Wednesday night, with some of the “peaceful” demonstrators smashing windows of homes and businesses and clashing with law enforcement and the National Guard.

“What started as a protest has become a large disturbance of public order that has caused property damage and is threatening to cause injury to persons,” the Wauwatosa Police Department tweeted just before 10 p.m. Wednesday.

The protests followed Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm’s announcement that his office “could not meet the burden required to charge” Wauwatosa officer Joseph Mensah in the fatal shooting of a black teen. Mensah, also black, shot Alvin Cole, 17, in February at Wauwatosa’s Mayfair Mall after Cole fired his stolen 9 mm pistol at officers, according to the investigation summary.

It was Mensah’s third fatal shooting of a suspect in five years. He was found to have acted in self-defense in the others.

Black Lives Matter protesters have made Mensah the face of police brutality and social injustice in suburban Milwaukee, demanding the black police officer be fired and charged with homicide. They’ve received the backing of most members of Wauwatosa’s city council.

Radical leftists “targeted” Mensah, vandalized his girlfriend’s home, and fired a shotgun at the back door during a riotous demonstration in August.

“Officer Mensah attempted to establish a dialogue with the group but was ultimately physically assaulted outside his home,” the police report stated, adding that the group was estimated to consist of 60 to 70 people. Two men were arrested on felony charges.

State Rep. Rob Hutton and state Sen. Dale Kooyenga, both Brookfield Republicans, practically had to beg Wauwatosa’s far-left mayor to ask Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to keep the Wisconsin Army National Guard on standby in case things got out of hand. They finally — if begrudgingly — heeded the advice, with Evers sending in Guard members Wednesday.

Things started to get out of hand about 9 p.m., when Wauwatosa police reported “windows being broken at businesses along North Ave. between Wauwatosa Avenue (N. 76 St) and Swan Bl (N 96 St.).” Townhall reporter Julio Rosas captured the vandalism on video.

“On the ground in Wauwatosa for @townhallcom and some in the Black Lives Matter crowd are smashing storefront windows,” the reporter tweeted. Some earlier on Twitter had asked why Wauwatosa businesses would board up their windows.

In one video report, a business’s front window that apparently did not have a Black Lives Matter sign was smashed. An adjacent window with a Black Lives Matter sign was spared.

Police deployed tear gas and nonlethal weapons as protesters attempted to bust through the security lines, according to reporters on the ground. Like many Black Lives Matter protests that turned disorderly and violent, demonstrators were out past the city-imposed curfew, between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. The curfew is in effect through 6 a.m. Monday.

Wauwatosa City Hall and the city’s library announced early closings Wednesday out of concern that “civil unrest” would follow the district attorney’s decision. Schools went all-online for the day.

Wauwatosa residents watched anxiously, hoping the Milwaukee suburb wouldn’t turn into the next Kenosha, which was ravaged by three days of riots after a police officer shot a black man during a domestic incident in August. One video showed the bold line between sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement and their violent tactics.

“Do you know how many Democrats, how many [Milwaukee Public Schools] teachers, union members, other people that would support you live on this street, and you’re going to let him ride through my yard? Show some respect,” a Wauwatosa man shouted at rioters on a motorcycle.

“The cops pushed us this way, just so you know,” one of the demonstrators informed the frustrated man.

“So they pushed you into my yard?” he said, incredulously.

U-Chicago Hides Demand For Grad Students To Focus On Identity Politics,"The University of Chicago’s English Department deleted a portion of its July 2020 “Faculty Statement,” which announced the department was only accepting graduate “applicants interested in working in and with Black Studies” for the 2020-2021 academic year.

Even though the department deleted the line, it is apparently still committed to the July statement. During the most recent application cycle, the department admissions page indicates they indeed only accepted students who will work in and with Black Studies.

Here is the original statement:

Here is the revised version:

After noticing that the sentence had been deleted with no note of an update, the Chicago Thinker, a student publication, reached out to the English Department. The Chicago Thinker asked whether the department only accepted graduate applicants interested in working “in and with Black Studies.”

The department’s public affairs office directed the Chicago Thinker to the graduate admissions page, where the original line appears: “For the 2020-2021 graduate admissions cycle, the University of Chicago English Department is accepting only applicants interested in working in and with Black Studies.”

Under “Frequently Asked Questions about the Ph.D. Application,” the English Department’s admissions page clarifies that the “focus on Black Studies applies only to the 2020-21 Ph.D. admissions cycle.” The admissions page also says admitted Black Studies Ph.D. students are “encouraged to take advantage of the wide variety of courses, not restricted to Black Studies, offered by the Department and the Division.”

It is unclear whether the admissions page comments were added after the department deleted them from its July faculty statement, or if the comments were always available on the admissions page. What is clear is that the department never changed its mind about its decision to only accept “Black Studies” students.

A possible explanation for the English Department’s decision to delete part of the faculty statement could be that the department’s move to block other areas of intellectual exploration was picked up by major news outlets, creating a lot of negative press for the university. The decision has been criticized by many who see it as exclusionary and contrary to the University of Chicago’s “Chicago Principles,” and “Kalven Report.”

The Chicago Principles represent the university’s public commitment to protecting free speech and encouraging open debate. The Kalven Report is a faculty committee report, which warns that the very taking of a position by the university might chill the environment for free expression and academic freedom. The report establishes that it is essential for the university to remain a place where individuals can explore and possess whatever intellectual positions they wish.

Columnist Benjamin Schwarz wrote in Spiked that the English Department’s decision “violates the university’s long-held and hard-won principles of freedom of expression and academic freedom.” Schwarz explained that the statement is “plainly a manifesto expressing political commitment,” and that the first sentence “explicitly aligns the English Department to a political movement, Black Lives Matter, that adheres to a specific ideology, built on premises that range from the undisputed to the debatable to the dubious, in pursuit of radical societal goals that are hardly uncontested.”

Schwarz continued, writing, “the manifesto next commits the department and all its members to ‘the struggle of Black and Indigenous people, and all racialised and dispossessed people’ – a struggle that, however laudable some might find it, is certainly far from politically neutral.” Finally, Schwarz pointed to the last paragraph of the faculty statement. According to him, the statement gives “an explicit declaration of social advocacy,” by writing, “[p]art of our commitment to the struggle for Black lives entails… activism.”

Some critics took to Twitter to express their displeasure over the decision. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a black human rights activist, wrote, “[t]his is all too idiotic. Most of us don’t know whether to laugh or cry. By the logic of their creed, wouldn’t English be the oppressor’s language?”

“I am obviously interested in black literature. But being strong-armed into studying it??” asked cultural critic Thomas Chatterton Williams.

Samantha Harris, a free speech and due process attorney, told The College Fix her “concern with the announcement is that it effectively imposes a political litmus test on applicants to the graduate program.”

“It sets forth the English Department’s very specific views on contested political issues and effectively says ‘those who disagree need not apply,’” she stated. “[The university] may certainly have the right to do that, but it’s a sad commentary on the state of American higher education when a major department at one of the nation’s top universities explicitly chooses to embrace a political agenda to the point of excluding students who disagree.”

In a statement issued last Monday, University President Robert Zimmer addressed the English Department controversy and other criticisms of the administration and department heads, writing, “I have received several comments recently raising the question whether certain actions within the University were consistent with the Kalven Report and the Chicago Principles, or whether the actions were inconsistent with these principles.” Zimmer cited the English Department controversy as “[r]epresentative of these actions.”

Zimmer insisted that it is important that “the University and its units take full cognizance of [the Kalven Report and Chicago Principles’] importance so actions that might be seen as in conflict with them are explained carefully and are implemented in such a way as not to diverge from these core principles of our University.”

Zimmer also addressed the “competing views” on the English Department controversy. “[S]ome members of the University community have expressed concern that the exclusive disciplinary commitment effectively represents a political test for admission,” wrote Zimmer. He conceded that the department’s decision would stand in direct opposition to both the Kalven Report and the Chicago Principles “[t]o the extent [a political test for admission] was the intent of adopting this policy, or to the extent it is implemented in such a manner, or to the extent it is reasonably perceived by students and faculty as having this purpose.”

According to Zimmer, “[t]he idea or even implication that there would be a political criterion applied to admission to our doctoral program would be incompatible with the fundamental principles of our University.”

However, Zimmer did not disclose any future plans to rectify the actions of university departments or the administration, who have been charged with using their power to silence debate, restrict intellectual diversity, and endorse mob mentality on campus. Zimmer also did not say whether the administration and department heads were in fact guilty of violating the Chicago Principles and the Kalven Report. Instead, he simply wrote that “we” (presumably the university community) would “consider these issues.”

The Chicago Thinker welcomes further clarification from the English Department to explain why the original faculty statement was altered — hopefully more than a link to the department’s admissions page. The Chicago Thinker is also happy to hear from Zimmer about any decisions or conclusions the administration come to as it “consider[s] these issues.”

Kamala Harris's Skin And Sex Don't Uniquely Qualify Her For Office,"The most important thing for voters to know when considering Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris isn’t her extreme, pro-abortion positions. Nor is it her record of anti-Catholic bigotry, manifested in her attacks on the Knights of Columbus club and harassment of public, Catholic organizations. Nor is it that her voting record is one of the most liberal of any current U.S. senator. Rather, if prominent media and pundits are to be believed, it’s that she’s a black woman.

Following Harris’s Oct. 7 debate with Vice President Mike Pence, the Washington Post published two separate articles, both by black female writers, focusing on the fact that Harris is a black woman. Michele Norris argued that Harris’s “smirk” is “black women’s superpower.” Karen Attiah claimed, “America hates to let Black women speak.”

Attiah added: “For Black women, this was, in prime time, like watching Whiteness and the patriarchy at work. … I yearn for an America where non-White women don’t have to battle for the bare minimum: to be allowed to speak.”

There were plenty more. The Los Angeles Times featured an op-ed by Erika D. Smith titled, “Harris showed Black women how to be ‘angry’ and handle a condescending white man.” Smith opined, “Harris reset the notion of what is acceptable behavior for Black women interacting with white men in power,” while “exposing Pence for the overconfident, condescending, weak and scared white man that he really is.”

USA Today’s Alia E. Dastagir declared that “Pence’s treatment of Harris during VP debate shows challenges Black women in politics face.” These challenges include “mansplaining” and “repeated interruptions.” Maggie Astor at The New York Times explained that Harris faced a racist and sexist “double standard” during the debate.

The Left Is Delusional About Harris

There is another double standard at work in all of this commentary on the vice presidential debate and American politics in 2020. While Harris’s race and sex — both biological realities a person has absolutely no control over — are praised as wonderful and inspiring, Pence’s race and sex are considered political liabilities. Pundits celebrate Harris as black and female. They deride Pence as white and male. Who exactly are the racists here?

Of course, exploiting the language of identity politics to label Harris a victim and an embodiment of all the terrible injustices other “women of color” face is politically clever. Applying this optic, any criticisms leveled against Harris can simply be shrugged off, if not maligned, as racist or sexist. When Harris employs smirks and righteous indignation, they are black female superpowers. If Pence attempts them, they are emblematic of the white, racist patriarchy — checkmate.

This is false and ridiculous. Harris has had an extremely successful professional career as both an attorney and a politician, and she comes from success: Her mother was a biologist and her father an economics professor. No one can claim with a straight face that she has been the victim of an oppressive, patriarchal American system.

Rather, while her life may have seen some race-related setbacks and slights, she has also clearly taken great advantage of the many remarkable freedoms and opportunities available to her in this great nation. Any instances of racism have not held her back. If she has faced discrimination in her life, no one has successfully silenced her. No one has stopped her from pursuing excellence.

Many other black women in America indicate the untruth of this broad narrative. In the last presidential administration, the first lady was a widely acclaimed black female who generated and guided her own political projects, including combating childhood obesity. Susan Rice, another black woman, served as both U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser, one of the most important foreign policy positions in the U.S. government.

In the administration before that, Condoleezza Rice served as secretary of state, a senior-level position multiple people have used as a stepping stone to run for president, including Thomas Jefferson and Hillary Clinton.

Nor is the claim even true of the people making it. Norris, Attiah, and Smith are writing from the commanding, elite heights of mainstream media. Thousands upon thousands of Americans read every single word they put to print. Yet we’re expected to believe some canard about how their voices are being silenced?

Didn’t black female journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones win the Pulitzer Prize last year for her 1619 Project in The New York Times? Are not the major arguments of the 1619 Project being disseminated not only across the media but throughout national grade-school and university curricula? The very life stories of such women disprove the victimhood too many of these same women proclaim.

Race and Sex Rhetoric Destroys America’s Discourse

The problem with this trope isn’t just that it’s false. It also further erodes America’s already fragile public discourse. It transforms every exchange in the public square into an ideological minefield of race and gender theory aimed at demonizing their opponents right out of the gate.

Rather than attempt good-faith discussion or debate, victimization narratives enable their users to outflank interlocutors by accusing them of racism or sexism. Even to call the objects of this ersatz tour-de-force “interlocutors” is imprecise — they’re more like hapless scapegoats.

The end result of all this is a toxic, destructive, winner-take-all culture that denigrates one’s ideological enemies into silence and subservience. It is, as Rod Dreher notes in his new book “Live Not By Lies,” a form of totalitarianism that subverts democratic norms of respect and civility. We know what happens to those accused of racism and sexism. They are mocked, scorned, and, if sufficient pressure is applied, canceled out of polite society and even their jobs.

Certainly, many incredible black women worth celebrating have not indulged in toxic identity politics propaganda. Besides Rice, one might also consider Vanderbilt emeritus professor and Tennessee politician Carol M. Swain, writer Chloé Simone Valdary, and author Zora Neale Hurston of “Their Eyes Were Watching God” fame.

Such examples aside, we should celebrate or criticize people not primarily because of their race or sex, but based on their ability to exemplify excellence and virtue. Harris obviously has some admirable qualities, for no one can achieve what she has in 55 years of life without brains and determination. Is any reasonable person on the right arguing otherwise?

Harris has also, however, endorsed and promoted policies worthy of careful consideration and critique. It would be for the national good if pundits could stop reducing the senator to her pigmentation and biology and discuss the issues that will tangibly affect the American electorate she aims to serve.

Black Voter Asks Biden Reason To Vote For Him Besides 'You Ain't Black',"Cedric Humphrey, a black voter from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, asked Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden what reason he could give to young black voters to cast a ballot for him instead of staying home on Election Day.

“Many people believe the true swing demographic in this election under the age of 30, not because they will be voting for Trump, but because they won’t be voting at all,” Humphrey said. “So my question for you is, besides ‘you ain’t black,’ what do you have to say to young black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to protect them?”

Biden cited the need to ensure black Americans can generate wealth, and promised he would “provide $70 billion for HBCUs for them to be able to have the wherewithal to do what other universities can do because they don’t have the kind of foundational support they need.”

ABC Moderator George Stephanopoulos did not interrupt to mention the fact that President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill in 2019 to permanently provide more than $250 million in annual funding to the nation’s historically black colleges and universities.

Biden also answered Humphrey’s question by touting his passion for the criminal justice system, to “make it fair and make it more decent.”

The Biden campaign’s criminal justice platform is part of a major effort to distance the Democratic candidate from the 1994 crime bill he sponsored as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 2019, Democratic rival Sen. Cory Booker called Biden the “architect of mass incarceration.”

“We have 5 percent of the global population but 25 percent of the world’s prison population,” Booker said to the Washington Examiner. “For [Biden] to not have a more comprehensive, bold plan to deal with this is unacceptable to me, especially because he is partly responsible for the crisis that we have.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/16/black-voter-drags-biden-at-town-hall-asks-reason-to-vote-for-him-besides-you-aint-black/,2020-10-16
Why The Left Needs Us All To Believe The United States Is Racist Forever,"That America is a racist country is the great self-evident truth of the left and of the ruling class whose moral opinions are shaped by it. This truth is self-evident in the sense of being readily apparent to them, as evidenced by the countless disparities in life outcomes between blacks and whites. No explanation for these disparities is ever required. Their mere existence is proof of racism.

The disparities between Asians and whites, between Indians and whites, and between Nigerian immigrants and whites all go studiously ignored since these groups generally outperform whites in income and educational attainment. Also ignored is the role that the pathologies of inner-city black culture — fatherlessness, crime, nihilistic alienation, and the exaltation of thuggery — play in producing and sustaining disparities.

America’s racist nature is also self-evident in the philosophical sense. It is an axiomatic truth: the predicate (racism) is contained in the subject (America). In the same way that all bachelors are, by definition, single, so is America, by definition, racist.

Formulated as such, the self-evident truth of American racism cannot be refuted. It is impervious to counterarguments, data, and historical developments. Believers in American racism don’t care about your facts. In 1991, Derrick Bell, one of the founders of critical race theory, declared that blacks had made no progress in America since 1865. He made this claim with a straight face at Harvard University, where he had been a tenured professor for two decades. In 1865, Harvard did not admit black students.

In 2020, the claim that America is fundamentally racist is a lie. But it is a lie tenaciously defended by those on the left who most benefit from it: the Democratic Party, its progressive allies in the academy, the intelligentsia and the media, and black political leadership. As the ultimate arbiters of all racial controversies, the left have positioned themselves to occupy the moral high ground in America — the most important strategic position in any political conflict.

Using Racism as a Smokescreen

The accusation of racism is their most powerful political weapon. Playing the race card allows them to detract attention from their own corruption and the radical ideas they espouse. Whatever faults they have, at least they’re not racists like Donald Trump, the Republicans, and their base of deplorables. The right is thus constrained to fight the enemy on the enemy’s own terms. Republican claims that “Democrats are the real racists” inevitably fall flat.

The national obsession with racism is also obviously beneficial to those who work in the diversity and grievance industries. It is perhaps most useful for corporate and financial elites, who use it to distract Americans and direct their ire away from urban oligarchs like themselves toward the nebulous forces of racism. Corporate America is afraid of socialism, not of Black Lives Matter. The anti-capitalists hate the rich and corporations. The anti-racists do not; they can readily be bought off with performative wokeness and a sprinkling of diversity hires in the C-Suite.

Well-intentioned Americans of all races must understand that these powerful constituencies have a vested interest in keeping America “racist” forever. No set of attainable conditions would ever lead them to admit that America is no longer racist. No sooner would the reparations checks be issued than new demands would arise.

None of this is to deny that America was racist for centuries, that the legacy of racism is still with us, and that some racism endures to this day. But the Constitution of the United States is colorblind, and America’s Declaration of Independence proclaims that “all men are created equal.” There are no racist laws or regulations on the books anywhere in America — not at the federal level, not in any of the 50 states, and not in any of the 19,502 incorporated cities, towns, and villages.

The Actual Reality of ‘Racist’ Police

Since 1964, America has also had a Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in both the public and private sectors. In explicit violation of the legislative history and text of the law, the act has been interpreted by the highest court of the land to countenance so-called “affirmative action,” i.e. racial preferences to benefit blacks (and to a lesser extent, Hispanics). America thus finds itself in the paradoxical position of being a purportedly white supremacist nation that officially sanctions and practices discrimination against whites.

Well, a critic might say, the laws may not be racist, but don’t police enforce them in a racist way? The overpublicized deaths of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, James Blake, and others before them supposedly prove that a “legalized genocide of colored people” is taking place.

Yet none of the major studies of lethal shootings by police officers find evidence of racial bias. In fact, controlling for the very high black crime rate — African-Americans make up 13 percent of the population but commit more than 50 percent of homicides and about 60 percent of robberies — and the higher rate at which black suspects resist arrest, the share of blacks killed by cops is lower than one would expect.

Somehow, America remains a racist country even as elected officials in both parties openly pander to racial minorities, blacks in particular, while paying no attention to whites as a group. The Republican Party studiously ignores whites, busy as it is courting the “naturally conservative” Hispanic vote, while the Democratic Party increasingly adopts the anti-white animus of Black Lives Matter and the rest of the woke left. Because the demand for racism so completely outstrips the actual supply, we are left with unfalsifiable accusations of “dog-whistling” — non-racist statements that supposedly send covert racist messages.

Once every few years, it is true, a Republican will put his foot in his mouth and speak indelicately about race. Whenever this happens, the offender is universally condemned, with the loudest denunciations coming from the Republican Party and the conservative establishment, and the offender promptly apologizes. Such is the odd nature of “systemic” American racism, that racists are immediately denounced and eager to repent.

The New Unforgivable Sin

African-Americans occupy a larger place in the country’s collective imagination than any other group. They exert enormous cultural influence not just in America, but across the globe. At home, no group is more honored for its accomplishments, real or fake (no, a black man did not invent the lightbulb). The closest thing America has to a secular saint is Martin Luther King, Jr. Even the recent allegations that he may have been a serial philanderer who laughed as a woman was raped in front of him did not dent his reputation.

In the public square, at school, and at work, Americans are also increasingly compelled to profess devotion to the creed of Anti-Racism. The thought police are everywhere. No one gets canceled for abandoning their children, betraying the country, or committing any number of immoral, indecent, or criminal acts. There is only one unforgivable sin: to deviate from the accepted script when speaking of African-Americans — and to a lesser extent, any of the other protected identity groups.

Amid widespread sympathy for blacks, affirmative action policies, and the absence of racist laws, we are told that racism is nonetheless institutionalized — though there are no institutions of any significance in America committed to racism, let alone to white supremacy.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, an alarmist fundraising machine for its now disgraced founder Morris Dees, keeps track of about 940 hate groups operating within our borders (more than a quarter of which are black separatists). By focusing on the number of groups, the SPLC can ignore their insignificant size, lack of funds, and complete marginalization in American life.

By the SPLC’s count, there are 47 Ku Klux Klan groups in America — but their total membership is between 5,000 and 8,000 (the Anti-Defamation League puts the total at 3,000). At its peak in the mid-1920s, the Klan had 6 million members (in a country with a third of our current population).

So much for the institutions of hate. Meanwhile, corporate America, the media, Hollywood, professional sports, philanthropic foundations, nonprofits, churches, the academy, the arts, and the military all vociferously denounce racism. All eagerly embrace the diversity agenda. All are obsessed with hiring and promoting people of color.

The Mind is the Last Frontier

And this brings us to perhaps the strangest feature of America’s purportedly racist society: the growing phenomenon of whites passing as nonwhites. Elizabeth Warren claims to be Cherokee, BLM’s Shaun King claims to be biracial, and a Jewish professor of African history at George Washington University is the new Rachel Dolezal. Needless to say, no Afrikaner ever pretended to be “colored” under apartheid.

Where, then, is racism to be found in America, if it is not in its law, its public rhetoric, and its institutions? Polls make it hard to find, too. Eighty-seven percent of Americans approve of black-white marriage, up from 4 percent in 1954. Gallup calls it “one of the largest shifts of public opinion in Gallup history.” When researchers asked teenagers to name the most famous Americans in history (excluding presidents), their top three picks were MLK, Rosa Parks, and Harriet Tubman.

The last frontier is now the subconscious. Because the quantity of racism is held to be constant throughout American history, the absence of racist sentiments in people can only mean that racism is hiding deep in the recesses of their minds.

With the help of Harvard University’s widely touted Implicit Association Test, everyone’s latent racism can now be brought to the fore. The test, of course, reveals no such thing. A peer-reviewed study found “little evidence to support [its] more provocative claim: that people possess unconscious racist attitudes.” Even Vox had to admit that “it might not work at all.”

In the end, all we are left with as the definitive proof of American racism today is “systemic racism,” the meaning of which boils down to: America is racist because, well, it just is. Racism somehow suffuses the whole even though it is not visible in any of its major parts. Whereas all other racist regimes in history openly proclaimed their racism, America has pulled off the amazing feat of purging its laws, institutions, and culture of racism — all in the interest, of course, of perpetuating racism.

Junior Scholastic Tells Middle Schoolers America Is ‘Systemically Racist’,"A “black lives matter” article that recently appeared in a children’s magazine popular in elementary schools, Junior Scholastic, is inflammatory, racist, and wholly unfit for students of any age.

Of course, there’s an enormous gulf between Black Lives Matter the organization, and “black lives matter” the concept and statement. Every decent human agrees with the latter. The former, however, is an explicitly neo-Marxist, racist, violent organization that, in the words of its own leaders, seeks to destroy American society as well as the core ideas on which this nation was founded.

To be sure, all Americans should learn about America’s complicated history with racism, slavery, Jim Crow, and the Civil Rights movement. The study of these issues is not a problem — Black Lives Matter the organization is. It is currently forcing highly unscientific, racist propaganda into our public schools, and Junior Scholastic’s article “Uniting For Black Lives” assisted.

Reversing the Good Work of MLK

Black Lives Matter is an organization steeped in an ideology — “critical race theory” — that reduces individuals to a racial essence based on skin color and, after assigning them a group identity, segregates them to be judged. This is racism. Both Black Lives Matter and critical race theory ignore what really matters: individual character, action, and merit. They turn the wise words of Martin Luther King, Jr. completely on their head.

The Junior Scholastic article based on these ideas therefore makes multiple, hatefully wrong claims. To begin with, it states:

Systemic racism is embedded in all aspects of American society, including our laws, policies, industries, schools, and culture – and is something all of us are a part of.

It also claims that Black Lives Matter has “grown into a movement to end white supremacy.” Then there’s the claim that white people have “advantages at the expense of people from other races and backgrounds.”

It’s noteworthy that throughout the article, when differentiating between white and black Americans, a lower case “w” is used for “white,” while an upper case “B” is used for “black.” It’s unclear what this is designed to signify. It’s also equally unclear how this signaling will help protect or provide for anyone’s individual rights, or, really, benefit the lives of any American in any meaningful way.

To the point, consider the article’s claims that “systemic racism is embedded in all aspects of American society,” and that the United States is a font of “white supremacy.” These terms, and others like them, are meaninglessly unscientific. There is no way to test such claims in the way actual scientists test hypotheses.

Where is “systemic racism” codified in American law? It’s not. Short of explicit individual acts of racism, how can anyone judge what’s in another’s heart? One can’t.

Where is it codified that white people be “advantaged”? Even if such “advantages” did exist, why would they necessarily come at the expense of people of “other races”? The article provides no data to back the claims that any disparity or inequality between individuals is due to racism. This false premise is based on another false premise, that inequality automatically equals inequity.

Using ‘Racism’ to Attack Capitalism

Modern American society is not a zero-sum game. In this great country, one’s does not necessarily come at another’s expense. Why? Because of the American dedication to individual rights and equality before the law, such rights and equality include the protection of one’s person and property, as well as the ability to keep the hard-earned fruits of one’s labor.

Individual rights and capitalism to not require taking from Peter to pay Paul. Rather, they imply voluntary exchange and giving. They’re the rising tide that lifts all boats.

Recent data indicates the Black Lives Matter organization is responsible for 95 percent of the violent riots that have engulfed this nation for over four months. The toll of the destruction includes thousands of lost lives, thousands of lost businesses, and billions of dollars in destruction — often from the very communities the group claims it wants to help. But the chaos and destruction should come as no surprise, given the leadership of Black Lives Matter’s very own words.

“If this country doesn’t give us what we want,” says Hawk Newsome, the president of the Greater New York chapter of Black Lives Matter, “then we will burn down this system and replace it. All right? And I could be speaking figuratively. I could be speaking literally. It’s a matter of interpretation.”

Then, there’s Black Lives Matter Co-founder Patrisse Cullors who states: “…we are trained Marxists. We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories.” Ariel Atkins, a Chicago Black Lives Matter organizer believes, “I don’t care if somebody decides to loot a Gucci’s or a Macy’s or a Nike… That’s a reparation. Anything they want to take, take it because these businesses have insurance.”

One Black Lives Matter community organizer from Washington, D.C. went a whole lot further, proclaiming, “I’m at the point where I’m about to put these police in a f-cking grave. I’m at the point where I want to burn the f-cking White House down.”

America, a White Supremacist Nation?

Given that the majority of the nation’s top-paid athletes and entertainers are black, we twice-elected a black president who appointed two black attorney generals, it strains credulity to claim the United States is currently a “white supremacist” nation.

Then there’s what Black Lives Matter hopes you don’t realize, such as how some of Baltimore’s most violence-plagued years took place when the city had a black mayor, black school superintendent, black police chief, a black-majority police force, and a city council that was two-thirds black.

Furthermore, it’s important to point out that the majority of violence-plagued cities share the same political party in power: Democrats. If the United States is indeed a “racist” nation, and given that Democrats and people who identify as “liberals” essentially control the bureaucratic levers of the federal government, Hollywood, the wider entertainment industry, higher academia, public schools, and the greater culture-at-large, what does this say about Democrats and liberals?

One lesson we all must learn is that treating racism this way primarily serves to breed resentment and grievances among those designated as its victims based solely on the color of their skin, and guilt for those who allegedly “benefit” based solely on the color of their skin. As many of the article’s claims hinge on the assumption that black individuals lack agency, are incapable of self-determination, and cannot succeed without white help, there’s an insidious sort of soft bigotry at play here. It’s as repugnant as it’s untrue.

The other great lesson is that this obsession with race is a distraction from any discussion of policy mechanisms that can foster and facilitate disparities and inequalities between people, regardless of the intent of the policies, and regardless of the skin color of the individual disadvantaged by the policies.

This country is not perfect. No country is. But many of the real problems we have are because we’ve moved away from the principles of individual rights. At root, that’s what so many legitimate peaceful protests are about: individual rights. If it’s not about individual rights, it’s not about peace.

So, how should we conduct ourselves in all of our relations, with all of our brothers and sisters, of all colors and creeds? It turns out it’s a simple answer after all: the Golden Rule—The Law of Love. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. If we truly seek peace and prosperity for all people, the Golden Rule is not only the best way, it’s the only way.

MSNBC’s Joy Reid: Black Lives Matter Never Advocated For Violence,"MSNBC’S Joy Reid says there is “zero evidence” that the Black Lives Matter movement ever advocated for violence.

“There is absolutely zero, none, zero evidence that Black Lives Matter has ever pushed for anything violent, pushed for anything violent to happen to police,” she said Thursday night after the final presidential debate of 2020.

“They have never advocated violence against police,” she added.

There are tens of thousands of data points that say otherwise from this leftist conflict monitor: https://t.co/L45HNGF52k https://t.co/qwB2diRYmU — Joy Pullmann (@JoyPullmann) October 23, 2020

Instead, Reid attempted to defend the movement by claiming they simply want racial justice, failing to mention the violent and reckless means by which some people have advocated for it.

“Black Lives Matter is about one thing: stop killing black people just because you pulled them over for parking or moving violation,” she said. “Just stop killing black people.”

“For [Trump] to traffic that again tonight was not only desperate, it was also stupid because he also wants black men to vote for him,” Reid said.

Studies and video footage from the period after George Floyd died in Minneapolis, which sparked hundreds of protests and riots across the nation, however, show that Reid may have been living under a rock over the last six months and that her perception of the movement is completely wrong.

Not only do reports from September suggest that up to 95 percent of this summer’s riots across the country are linked to BLM activism, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), but included in this data was the fact that more than 1 in 20 of U.S. protests between May 26 and Sept. 5 involved violent actions such as rioting and looting.

At least 47 people have died in riot-related circumstances, stemming from the actions of a movement which “has never pushed for anything violent,” according to Reid.

Over the last six months, rioters, posing under the guise of racial justice and change, “have burned down minority businesses, destroyed minority neighborhoods, killed a black police chief, desecrated civil rights monuments, launched deadly occupations of downtown centers, and set fire to churches” in multiple cities across the nation.

The damage inflicted by these riots is estimated to cost an inflation-adjusted $1.2 billion, much of which will come from taxpayer dollars “in the form of overtime and hazard pay for police and EMTs, emergency room visits, destruction of public property, and more.”

In California, members of the so-called “peaceful” movement which Reid claims “never advocated violence against police” blocked the emergency entrance of St. Francis hospital where two wounded police officers who were ambushed while on a patrol were recovering, chanting “We hope they die” and “Y’all gonna die one by one.”

Rioters were often caught on camera harassing police officers, throwing projectiles at them, and wishing for their death.

Reid’s claim that the people involved in BLM are peaceful is also a narrative often peddled by the mainstream media including her employer MSNBC. When riots erupted following Floyd’s death, MSNBC reported it was “mostly a protest” as buildings burned in the background.

“This mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started,” said one MSNBC reporter during a riot in Minneapolis.

Chelsea Handler: Black People Like 50 Cent Can't Vote For Trump,"It’s become clear that when leftist media obsess about any incident involving a white, conservative-leaning individual and a minority, the white conservative will be dubbed guilty of some type of racism. From a high school boy being torn apart by the media after a Native American beat his drum in his face to Tucker Carlson being called racist for mispronouncing Kamala Harris’s name, right-wingers are frequently in danger of being crucified for racism they never intended.

Yet when white liberals make statements about minorities that suggest they ought to fall in line with stereotypes about their race instead of thinking and reasoning as intelligent individuals, leftists don’t bat an eye. A Democratic presidential candidate, for example, informs black individuals that if they haven’t resolved to vote for him, they’re unworthy of their own skin color.

Chelsea Handler appeared on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon and declared that when her ex-boyfriend, 50 Cent, publicly announced his plan to vote for Trump, she “had to remind him that he was a black person so he can’t vote for Donald Trump.”

50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, recently tweeted that due to Joe Biden’s high-tax plan, he was aligning with Trump. Handler responded by tweeting that she would pay his taxes “in exchange for you coming to your senses.”

Before 50 Cent replied, Handler made her “Tonight Show” appearance, emphatically stating that she saw it as her duty to set her ex straight on account of his skin color: “He shouldn’t be influencing an entire swath of people who may listen to him because he’s worried about his own personal pocketbook.”

To put things in the kindest construction for Handler, let’s assume she wants her ex to influence his fans who are black and poverty-stricken to vote for the candidate she believes will more effectively look out for their welfare. But even in that case, she’s dead wrong. In his four years as a politician, Trump has done more for impoverished black communities than Biden has in his almost half-century political career.

For example, back in 2017, Trump signed an executive order to renew White House contributions to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Prior to his presidency, little had been done to ensure these universities received the funding necessary to properly educate and comfortably house their primarily African-American student bodies.

Then there’s an executive order he signed pushing federal agencies to build their infrastructure in opportunity zones. These zones comprise low-income, inner-city, historically black areas. As a result, about half a million new jobs were created for those citizens.

The list goes on. It’s unfortunate that the left continues to push its narrative that Trump is a white supremacist, despite innumerable instances in which he’s proven otherwise. But what’s even more unfortunate is when Democrats like Handler turn a blind eye to the bigotry of Biden’s administration, and tell black Americans they are race traitors if they don’t vote the way she wants.

But black Americans are not stupid and, despite efforts by people like Handler to tell them how to think, they’re able to decide for themselves which candidate will more effectively serve their country. More and more black Americans are concluding that Trump is the better candidate, especially as black celebrities publicize their support for him and his efforts in their communities.

It’s up to black Americans and their God-given ability to think for themselves to decide how to cast their ballots. Voting for Biden is certainly a freedom they have. But voting for Trump is, too, and it’s disgusting when individuals, especially high-profile influencers like Handler, reprimand them for coming to their own conclusions.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/02/chelsea-handler-black-people-like-50-cent-arent-allowed-to-vote-for-trump/,2020-11-02
I Am Now A Trained Anarchist Ready To Punch Nazis On Election Night,"With the election coming just 24 hours from now, I am ready to fight fascism with fascism no matter the outcome. I will join my comrades in the nation’s capital on election night to make sure the fat Cheeto man in the White House leaves office once and for all.

In the last week, I participated in a series of online seminars with Shut Down DC on implementing our “Strategic framework for action following the 2020 election.” During the training on de-escalation, I learned in what circumstances it is permissible to “punch a Nazi in the face.”

“If a black woman in a wheelchair wants to punch a Nazi in the face,” the training coordinator said, “It is not your job to stop her. It is her God-given right to punch a Nazi in the face.”

“Nazi” is just another term for “Trump supporter,” by the way.

Our instructor continued, emphasizing that even under adverse circumstances, it was our duty to protect a black woman in a wheelchair’s right to punch Nazis.

“If a black woman in a wheelchair wants to punch a Nazi in the face, and the Nazi has a whole bunch of friends who are going to attack all of the black people in the area,” the teacher said:

You will want to, like, let the other people know that ‘Hey, this situation is escalating. If you don’t want to be involved you should probably leave’ and try to create like, physical space around. Again, the black woman in the wheel chair, the best thing we can do is protect her autonomy, which means if she decides to punch a Nazi in the face, we do not stop her from doing that. Stopping her from doing that, it gets into white saviorism.

Got it. Protect the right of a black woman in a wheelchair to punch a Nazi (Trump supporter) in the face at all costs. Nothing is more important than protecting the “God-given right” of a black woman in a wheelchair who wants to punch a Nazi in the face.

If “a white guy is surrounded by a bunch of trans-sex workers and he decides to punch a Nazi in the face,” however, “that’s when you go, ‘hey, hey, hey, hey buddy, I know it’s really really tempting to punch Nazis in the face but think about the other people you are putting in danger.'”

During the seminar, we were also instructed to “respect the diversity of tactics” if we didn’t believe in the violence set to erupt.

“While we may disagree with certain people’s tactics or how they handle certain situations, at the end of the day what matters most is fighting back against our violent society,” the instructor said. “A commitment to non-violence isn’t necessary of the de-escalation tactics we are teaching.”

Following the trainings, I also now fully understand that “law enforcement is inherently violent,” and “the only way to avoid getting harmed by law enforcement is to not be out protesting.” Even if that means I’m in the middle of burning down a black-owned business in the name of social justice, because we must “acknowledge we live on stolen land.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/02/i-am-now-a-trained-anarchist-ready-to-punch-nazis-on-election-night/,2020-11-02
"Maxine Waters Says She ‘Will Never, Ever Forgive’ Black Voters Who Don’t Do What She Says","Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters says she can’t forgive black voters, especially “black young men” who are voting for President Donald Trump because he is “a racist.”

“For those black young men who think somehow they can align themselves with Trump, not only are they terrible mistaken, any of them showing their face, I will never, ever forgive them for undermining the possibility to help their own people and their own communities,” Waters said in an interview with “The Joe Madison Show” on SiriusXM.

“He’s a racist. He does not have any appreciation for black people and black women in particular,” she added. “He has no respect for us. He is not doing anything for us.”

Waters went on to claim black people who vote for Trump are “shameful,” expressing that she couldn’t fathom why they didn’t understand “how they would be able to help us in this struggle.”

“It just hurts me so bad to see blacks talking about supporting Trump,” she said. “I don’t know why they would be doing it. I don’t know why it is on their minds.”

In addition to declaring him a racist, Waters also accused Trump of stoking and fueling white supremacy groups throughout the country.

“The divisiveness that this deplorable human being has caused, the confrontation, the dog-whistling to the right-wing, the white supremacists, the KKK, and they are coming alive,” Waters said. “They are emboldened because they have a leader.”

Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden made similar comments in May during an interview with a black man, saying “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re voting for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”

The host of the podcast Lenard Larry McKelvey, also known as “Charlamagne Tha God” pushed back on Biden’s comments, saying “It don’t have nothing to do with Trump, it has something to do with the fact I want something for my community.”

Black Lives Matter: We ‘Invested Heavily In This Election’ And ‘We Want Something For Our Vote’,"Black Lives Matter has a political agenda and its leaders now demand that as payback for supporting the potential Biden-Harris Administration throughout the election, Democrats use the White House to do the Marxist organization’s bidding.

BLM Co-founder Patrisse Cullors sent a letter to former vice president Joe Biden and his Vice Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris congratulating them on winning the presidential election and demanding a meeting to discuss BLM’s “expectations” for their administration.

“A well-thought-out, community-driven, fully resourced agenda that addresses the particular challenges faced by Black people must be the priority,” she wrote.

According to Cullors, a Democratic victory would not have happened “without the resounding support of Black people.”

“In short, Black people won this election,” she said, noting the group’s efforts to “vote and organize.” “Alongside Black-led organizations around the nation, Black Lives Matter invested heavily in this election.”

Despite an entire summer of violent protests, riots, and police reform in cities and states all around the nation in the name of racial justice and BLM, Cullors claimed the “United States has refused to directly reckon with the way that it devalues Black people and devastates our lives,” calling for even more progressive action.

“This cannot continue. Black people can neither afford to live through the vitriol of a Trump-like Presidency nor through the indifference of a Democrat-controlled government that refuses to wrestle with its most egregious and damnable shame,” she said.

Cullors claimed that Biden and Harris, who both ran on a platform that mentioned addressing systemic racism, owed it to the movement to act on their rhetoric and further the work of “Black liberation.”

“We want something for our vote,” she said. “We want to be heard and our agenda to be prioritized.”

“We issue these expectations not just because Black people are the most consistent and reliable voters for Democrats, but also because Black people are truly living in crisis in a nation that was built on our subjugation,” Cullors added.

While many have defended BLM as a movement meant to draw attention to racial inequality in the United States and around the world, the group has been an anti-capitalist political movement from the start. In 2015, Cullors explained the foundation for the BLM movement was Marxism.

“We actually do have an ideological frame,” she told The Real News. “Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists.”

Until September of this year when it was scrubbed from the BLM website, the organization used Marxist language and ideology in describing their intentions to “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and ‘villages’ that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.”

Blackburn To Mark Zuckerberg: We Want To See Facebook's Lists,"Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennesee accused Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey of abusing their power, silencing conservatives, and fueling cancel culture with their companies’ constant censoring of users.

Blackburn explained during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday that federal law, specifically Section 230, has enabled social media companies to grow without facing lawsuits or legal ramifications.

“You have used this power to run amok. You have used it to silence conservatives. You have used it to build your list. You have used this power to act like you hold all the power that you can make these decisions,” Blackburn said. “You have driven this canceled culture because you have not called to account your moderators. You have refused to take responsibility for your employees and their actions.”

Blackburn lectured Zuckerberg on the dangers of blacklists targeting certain groups of people.

“Mr. Zuckerberg, do you think there is something wrong with an un-American blacklist tarring people from future employment, simply because they belong to a different political party?” Blackburn asked.

“Senator, I generally agree that people should not be discriminated against because of political beliefs,” he replied.

Blackburn quickly pointed out that, despite Zuckerberg’s reported feelings on political discrimination and hit lists, Facebook regularly censors conservatives.

“You say you don’t keep a list. Obviously, you have a list, because there are some of us who are regularly censored and called down by your content moderators,” she said, noting that one of her recent Facebook posts discussing the Trump Accountability Project which is creating a blacklist of people who staffed for, donated to, or even endorsed President Donald Trump and his administration, was slapped with an “elections flag sticker.”

Blackburn continued to echo her colleagues Sens. Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley in requesting that Facebook release its formulated censorship lists.

“Do we want to see this list? Yes,” Blackburn said. “How have you built these lists? We want to know.”

“You have refused to take responsibility for your employees and their actions so thereby reining you in on the issues of privacy, data security, content moderation, liability protections, defining who is a publisher in the virtual space, that is up to us because you have proven you do not have the will, the strength, the ability, and you will not accept the responsibility to do it for yourselves,” she continued.

How Douglass Went From Wanting America Destroyed To Making It Better,"Mark Twain copied a friend’s remark into his notebook: “I am not an American; I am the American.” To be the American, the exemplary or representative American, is a claim very few Americans could plausibly make. Twain could. Benjamin Franklin could and did. Abraham Lincoln could but didn’t, although admirers made the claim for him. Surely some number of others could, too. But among all Americans past or present, no one could make such a claim more compellingly than Frederick Douglass.

Like his country, Douglass rose from a low beginning to a great height. Like his country again, he won his freedom in a revolutionary struggle, by his own virtue, and against great odds, and he matured into an exemplar of universal liberty, admired the world over. Also like his country, Douglass the individual was divided by race.

Unlike America, Douglass could hardly think of himself as “conceived in liberty.” But even in this respect — especially in this respect — he represents a larger American promise. The son of a white slaveholder and a black slave, Douglass became, along with Lincoln, post-Founding America’s most important exponent of the natural-rights argument summarized in the Declaration of Independence. Pursuant to the same principles, he became America’s most prominent representative of the aspiration toward racial integration, reconciliation, and uplift.

One must emphasize: he became that. It didn’t come naturally to him. To become the great apostle of those aspirations, Douglass had to overcome a sentiment about and among black Americans that is recurrently present in U.S. history, powerful in his day and again in ours — the feeling or conviction that to be black is to bear an identity antagonistic to American identity.

This sentiment received its most memorable expression from W. E. B. Du Bois, now a larger presence in the minds of many educated Americans than Douglass. In the most famous passage in his book “The Souls of Black Folk,” Du Bois wrote that as a black American, “one ever feels his two-ness, — an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body.” In his younger years, Douglass felt that psychic dividedness every bit as acutely and painfully as Du Bois did.

‘I Have No Country’

In an 1847 speech, Douglass asked a troubling question and provided a dispiriting answer. Speaking for black Americans as a class, he asked: “What country have I?” He answered: “I have no patriotism. I have no country.” Then 29 years old, for nearly his entire life recognized in American laws only as an article of property, Douglass here lamented that even as a legally free man, he had no country that honored and protected him, no country to which he belonged and none that belonged to him.

He made that speech at a meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society, an association founded by America’s leading abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison. In 1847, Douglass was a faithful Garrisonian. When he declared his profound alienation from the country of his birth, he was rendering a personalized expression of standard Garrisonian doctrine.

What alienated the Garrisonians from America most of all was their opinion that the U.S. Constitution was decisively pro-slavery. Garrison near the beginning of his career called the Constitution “the most bloody and heaven-daring arrangement ever made by men for the continuance and protection of a system of the most atrocious villainy ever exhibited on earth.” From that premise, he drew what seemed to him the necessary inference. “Henceforth,” he announced in 1845, “the watchword” of abolitionists must be disunion: “NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!”

According to Garrison, then, the destruction of slavery required the destruction of America — of the American constitutional union. In 1847, that was Douglass’s position, too.

Given Douglass’s life experience, there is nothing very surprising in this. What is surprising, though, is how quickly and decisively he came to reject the Garrisonian position. Douglass launched his own abolitionist newspaper in early 1848, and after spending a few years reading and rethinking, he announced that he had come to reject the Garrisonian doctrines of disunion and the pro-slavery Constitution.

His turnabout came partly for prudential reasons. First was the realization, as he put it in his speech on the U.S. Supreme Court’s infamous Dred Scott ruling, that “it would be difficult to hit upon any plan less likely to abolish slavery than the dissolution of the Union.” The disunion strategy would strengthen, not weaken the forces of despotism in America. Again from the Dred Scott speech:

If I were on board of a pirate ship, with a company of men and women whose lives and liberties I had put in jeopardy, I would not clear my soul of their blood by jumping in the longboat and singing out no union with pirates. My business would be to remain on board. Even among slavery’s adversaries, the Garrisonians were not alone in wanting to jump ship.

The Complexity of Douglass’s Fourth of July Oration

The counterparts to Garrisonian advocates of disunion were black advocates of emigration, led in the 1850s by Douglass’s sometime friend, colleague, and rival, Martin Delany. Emigrationists were never a majority of black Americans, but their arguments gained influence in those periods when the prospects for freedom and equal rights appeared especially bleak.

The decade of the 1850s was such a period. So Douglass felt the need to respond to the Garrisonians and the emigrationists, and an invitation from the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society provided the opportunity. The occasion was the commemoration of Independence Day in 1852. Douglass’s Fourth of July oration, which has been called the greatest of all abolitionist speeches, presents his fullest reflections on the meaning of America and on the question Du Bois would pose a half-century later — the question of black identity in relation to America.

It’s a very complex speech. Douglass biographer David W. Blight aptly compares it to a symphony in three movements. One way Douglass divides the speech is temporally, as its sections move from past to present to future. Another way is by sentiment: he begins with a somewhat cautious, reserved expression of hope, then shifts to outrage mixed with something approaching despair, and concludes with a more confident expression of hope. A third mode of division appears in his adoption of three distinct perspectives: he considers the Fourth as it appears to white Americans, then as it appears to black Americans, and finally from a universal or fully integrated perspective.

For much of the speech, the reader could be forgiven for thinking that Douglass had joined Delany in the black-nationalist camp. First addressing the white members of the audience, he told them, in effect, this is how your national holiday appears to you. He addresses them in a chain of second-person pronouns: not our but “your national independence”; “your political freedom”; “your fathers”; “your nation.” The driving spirit seems little different from what animated his 1847 renunciation of patriotism. While admiring the “revolutionary fathers,” he yet declared: “This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine.”

Coming to the present, he excoriated post-Founding America: “There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.”

Perhaps the worst of the nation’s crimes, to that point, was the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 — “that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees,” Douglass called it, a law that “stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation.” For free black Americans, the effect was essentially to legalize kidnapping, leaving many to conclude that there was no protection by law for them anywhere in the U.S. What followed were upsurges in pro-emigration sentiment and in actual emigration.

Douglass fully understood that sentiment, but he believed it to be self-destructive and rejected it repeatedly over the course of his career. He understood, too, however, that the case against emigration, like the case against disunion, had to be buttressed by a case for America. He concluded the July Fourth oration, as he concluded virtually all his speeches, with an expression of hopefulness.

This was not mere wishfulness. Douglass thought hopefulness in America was rational — grounded in evidence and reason — in part because of America’s Founding. America’s revolutionary fathers were “brave men,” he remarked. They were “great men”; they dedicated the country to eternal principles. Against the Garrisonians, also against those debauched (as Lincoln put it) by John Calhoun, he maintained that the Founders’ Constitution was not pro-slavery; it was “a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT.”

The case for hopefulness required that and more. At the conclusion of the Fourth of July speech, Douglass said something particularly interesting about the further grounds of his hopefulness. “A change has now come over the affairs of mankind,” he said. Developments in the modern world, crucially enabled by modern philosophy, were making slavery increasingly impossible.

“The arm of commerce,” he continued, “has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe.” We are living in an age of commerce and enlightenment, he believed, and those developments were closely related.

‘The All-Pervading Light’

So monstrous an injustice as slavery could only survive in a condition of seclusion, and in the modern world, the seclusion it needed was becoming impossible. “No abuse,” said Douglass, “no outrage … can now hide itself from the all-pervading light.” Douglass believed what Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine believed: the principles of natural right held irresistible power for minds uncorrupted by interest, and freedom of speech, if properly protected, would propagate those principles throughout the world.

Douglass was a strong believer in the power of speech. This was a man who almost literally talked his way from the bottom to near the top of American society. But he didn’t think speech was all-powerful, and he didn’t think that the fostering of a healthy sense of American identity was merely a matter of persuading people, white or black, to believe in American principles.

To cultivate a genuine sense of American identity requires more than agreement with its principles. It requires a sense of belonging and affection. It requires a love of America as one’s own. On this point and others, Douglass was a good American disciple of John Locke.

In Locke’s well-known reasoning, we own our own labor, and we own what we make. This can apply, however, not only to material property but also to political and patriotic affiliation. What Douglass wanted to teach his fellow citizens, his black fellow citizens, in particular, was that we can build America, and in building or rebuilding it, we can make it our own.

We can improve it by our labor, he argued, culturally and morally no less than materially. To do this, we need first to improve ourselves. We need to cultivate what he called the “staying qualities,” fostering a faith in ourselves and our country. This is why hopefulness is a moral imperative, for Douglass, and why a spirit of alienation is so dangerous.

We are now just more than 200 years from Douglass’s birth. In remembering him, we must certainly say today what he said in 1852: Our business is with the present. Republics, he liked to say, are proverbially forgetful — most importantly, forgetful of their own first principles. We live, as Douglass lived, in a period when the first principles of American republicanism are increasingly neglected and even maligned.

We live in a time when many Americans have forgotten our principles, or never learned them, or learned to revile them; when many young people, young men especially, grow up in the belief that they have no grounds for hope for their future and no reason to identify with their country; when many of our educational institutions have become purveyors of alienation and disintegration, teaching that America is an evil, hateful society and that speech to the contrary must be vilified and suppressed.

At such a time, as we search for models of understanding and inspiration, it is a vital imperative for us to recover the moral and political vision of Douglass. In the long history of African-American political thought, there is no more forceful proponent of the cause of integration, and there is no more insightful analyst of the varieties and dangers of national and racial disintegration.

“No people can prosper,” Douglass reiterated late in life, “unless they have a home, or the hope of a home” — and “to have a home,” one “must have a country.” America, in Douglass’s abiding vision, was black Americans’s proper home, their only realistic alternative, and the locus of their highest ideals.

By its white and black citizens together, America must be cherished and perfected as a genuine home for all, not merely by the accident and force of necessity but as an object of rational and sentimental identification. For Douglass as for Lincoln, their common country was, through it all, the last best hope of earth.

"I’ll Give Up Black Friday When You Pry It From My Cold, Bargain-Grabbing Hands","Black Friday is my favorite day of the year and my favorite extreme sport, but when events and gatherings began disappearing from the calendar back in March, I thought surely Black Friday would be safe. Now here we are, more than eight months later. The mask Karens are still breathing down our necks, governors are trying to kill Thanksgiving, and Black Friday is canceled.

The fliers are still arriving in the mail and the festive doorbuster commercials are rolling, but Black Friday this year just isn’t the same. A Black Friday that takes place mostly online, the whole week of Thanksgiving or the entire month of November, and only when the sun is up is no Black Friday at all.

Now, people make a host of arguments about why Black Friday is bad — it’s horrible for employees, it fuels greed, or it promotes consumerism — and I’m sympathetic to them. For my family and for many others, however, Black Friday is truly a time-honored tradition.

Black Friday Is Rich with Family Traditions

I remember the years before I was allowed to go along Black Friday shopping. My cousin and I begged to go with my mom and aunt year after year, but the answer was always no. They left us with a babysitter instead, knowing we wouldn’t be pleasant company — and they were right. The hours of standing in line in the Wisconsin November cold mixed with the limited amount of sleep would make for some crabby kids. Black Friday in our family was largely Christmas shopping day, and that was back when gifts were from the toy department and were a huge secret, another reason the moms didn’t want us tagging along. The year we were finally old enough to go was the time of my life.

Some of my best family bonding experiences occurred in the wee hours of the morning on Black Friday, an extension of our Thanksgiving traditions. We consume way too much turkey for lunch, eat pie for supper, and then the boys go out to hunt for deer, and the girls go out to hunt for deals. Two years ago, we broke our record and shopped 20 hours straight, and last year we were just shy with only 19 hours. We take our shopping very seriously, yet 90 percent of the time is laughter.

More than the stuff we’ve accumulated on Black Friday over the years, we’ve racked up abundantly more memories. One year, my mom got hit in the side of the face with a flying doorbuster waffle iron (That was at Walmart, which we now avoid at all costs the day after Thanksgiving.). Another time, someone stole a mirror from us at a store that tragically no longer exists. My mom once found $150 in the J.C. Penney parking lot, and nobody claimed it.

I have one photo of my mother hunched over the steering wheel in a Target parking lot, holding a Rockstar energy drink and giggling, exhausted. “Is this what it feels like to be hungover?” my mom, who is a teetotaler, said, and laughter erupted from the rest of us in the car. Swipe over to the next photo, and you’ll see my cousin’s gnarly head wound after she smacked her forehead on a ladder at Menards while we were waiting in line.

A few years ago, we started playing the game “Heads-Up” on a smartphone to keep us awake in long lines, and the contagion of howling laughter usually spreads to the patrons standing nearest us. I also began video documenting the annual events with timestamps throughout the night, and now each year while we eat pie, clip coupons, and devise a game plan, we relive Black Fridays past to hype ourselves up.

Cyber Monday Is No Substitute

None of these experiences can be replicated by Cyber Monday or what many stores are doing this year: Black Friday deals all week or for the entire month of November. While many Americans scoff at the thought of trekking out into the wild, much more content to snag the deals with the click of a button from their couch, that just isn’t our style. Black Friday has never been as much about the deals as it has been about quality — and hilarious — time with family. If you aren’t making slap-happy Kwik Trip donut runs at 3:00 in the morning, where’s the fun?

As with so many other things this year, we’re going to try to make the best of it. We’ll go shopping on Friday, but it won’t be the same. The stores won’t be as crowded — because people already shopped Black Friday deals or because businesses will be operating at limited capacity — dressing rooms will still be shuttered, and we’ll all be muffled behind our masks.

If retailers use this as an opportunity to re-close their doors for the whole of Thanksgiving Day moving forward, that would be a positive development, returning the family day back to their employees, but let’s hope all other changes to the 2020 shopping experience are left behind next year. In 2021, bring Black Friday back.

"For Anti-Racism, San Diego Schools Will Teach Black, Hispanic Kids Less","During his successful run for the presidency in 2000, George W. Bush warned against “the soft bigotry of low expectations.” Then-candidate Bush delivered his remarks at the 91st annual meeting of the NAACP on July 10, 2000.

Bush added, “A great movement of education reform has begun in this country built on clear principles: to raise the bar of standards, expect every child can learn; to give schools the flexibility to meet those standards; to measure progress and insist upon results; [and] to blow the whistle on failure. . . .”

But that was then, and this is now. Apparently soft bigotry is not only alive but thriving in San Diego—or at least among the leaders of the San Diego Unified School District. They recently took one small step for a woke administration, but one giant leap for low expectations. You wouldn’t know this from the San Diego Union-Tribune’s headline introducing the story: “San Diego Unified changes grading practices to be equitable, less punitive.”

Would that the “changed grading practices” actually were more “equitable” and “less punitive”! Sadly, that’s not the case. Instead, it is “well-intentioned” racism, what Bush labeled “the soft bigotry of low expectations.” Here’s why.

The Union-Tribune story informs us that, “starting this school year San Diego Unified will eliminate non-academic factors, such as student behavior, from academic grades, following a unanimous vote by the school board Tuesday to overhaul the district’s grading practices.” Why? The answer: “partly to address racial and other disparities in current grading practices, officials said.”

To remedy lower grades in the district reported for “Black, Hispanic, Native American and Pacific Islander high school students” relative to white and Asian students, “experts, teachers and students have said that including non-academic factors into grades and not giving students second chances to learn or make progress can contribute to unfair disparities in grades.”

Under San Diego Unified’s just-adopted grading policy, “academic grades will only be about showing progress toward ‘mastery of standards,’ rather than rewarding students for completing a certain quantity of work.” The new policy will apply to middle- and high-school students.

The new approach is called “standards-based grading.” What exactly does this mean?

First, it means that students will no longer receive lower academic grades for turning work in late. Now, late work will be cited in a separate “citizenship” grade, because somehow the school district now considers punctuality a “non-academic factor.”

Second, students will now receive additional opportunities to revise failing work rather than simply obtaining the low grade they earned the first time they took the exam or quiz. Again, apparently the school district believes doing an assignment correctly or passing a test the first time is a “non-academic factor.”

Third, students caught cheating will now receive a second chance, including the opportunity to receive counseling. Cheating in school, too, is now deemed in San Diego to be “non-academic.”

According to media accounts, the San Diego Unified School District’s new grading policy stems from its desire to make grading more “anti-racist and equitable, partly in response to social justice protests that erupted over the summer in response to George Floyd’s death.”

Yet a 2015 Brookings Institution study raises the question whether this doubtless well-meaning “anti-racism” policy may in fact reflect “systematic biases in teachers’ expectations for the educational attainment of black students.” Which teachers’ biases? White teachers.

The study, conducted by Seth Gershenson, Stephen B. Holt, and Nicholas W. Papageorge, finds that non-black teachers “have significantly lower educational expectations for black students than black teachers do when evaluating the same students” (emphasis in original). The study’s authors find this disparity “concerning, as teachers’ expectations likely shape student outcomes and systematic biases in teachers’ expectations for student success might contribute to persistent socio-demographic gaps in educational achievement and attainment.”

The light the Brookings study sheds on the San Diego Unified School District’s new policy raises the question whether its self-styled “anti-racism” grading policy is, at bottom, less an act of compassion than of condescension. The Brookings data demonstrate that it is white teachers who believe that they know better than their black teacher counterparts just how little to expect from black students.

Expecting less from someone based on his or her race used to be called racism or bigotry. True, the San Diego School District is guided by good intentions. But the road to Hell can be paved with good intentions. And condescension toward blacks hardly qualifies as “anti-racism,” but rather, its antithesis.

What else can it be but condescension to tell black students that they need not live up to “white” standards of timeliness (late papers will no longer receive an academic penalty), quality performance (first-time failing papers will be given “do-overs”), and honesty (cheating will not be punished on the first offense)? Worse, once subjected to these lower standards, how can children—any children, of any race—not help but to internalize this negative view of their aptitude and carry this psychological dagger in their souls into adulthood?

Instead of lowering grading standards based on race, how about this novel approach? We could judge individuals as individuals, not as first and foremost members of an identity group. In so doing, the country would be living up better to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream for our country: “I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”

There may well be other reasons to support the new grading policy, but “anti-racism” clearly is not one of them. In the final count, then, the San Diego Unified School District is simply misguided—as are all those whose “wokeness” is but a sleepwalk through the moral minefield of the bigotry of low expectations.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/25/in-the-name-of-anti-racism-san-diego-schools-will-teach-black-and-hispanic-kids-less/,2020-11-25
China Weaponizes Race To Help Democrats Smear Republican Senator,"This article contains uncensored vulgarities.

Communist China appears to be targeting Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn for calling out China’s moral bankruptcy, including enslaving Uyghur Muslims in the northwest province of Xinjiang.

A White House petition was created by “X.J.,” the same initials as those of China’s communist dictator Xi Jinping, on Dec. 4, just a day after Blackburn’s charged exchange with a member of Chinese state media. Last week, Blackburn tweeted about China’s “history of cheating and stealing.”

Chinese propaganda mouthpiece Chen Weihua responded by tweeting sexist profanities at the GOP woman and labeling her the “most racist” senator.

Shortly after she was publicly insulted by Weihua, Blackburn released a statement condemning communist China’s actions.

“From Tiananmen Square to the Uyghur genocide, Communist China is an expert at slaughtering populations,” Blackburn said in a statement. “America will not bow down to sexist communist thugs.”

The petition which had just over 3,000 signatures on Dec. 7 and spelled Blackburn’s name wrong, echoes Weihua’s comments.

“Us Chinese Americans are shocked by this ignorant and blatant racist attack on China, this is a sheer public insult on the 1.4B Chinese people,” the petition reads. “Racism is running rampant in America now, we can’t stay silent any more, we have to stand up to fight, we hereby condemn Senator Sharma Blackburn’s racist comments and demand an apology from the senator.”

“From Tiananmen Square to the Uyghur genocide, Communist China is an expert at slaughtering populations,” Blackburn said in a statement Thursday. “America will not bow down to sexist communist thugs.”

Illinois Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi also accused Blackburn of racism on Twitter, indirectly endorsing a communist-sponsored media member’s words.

“The last thing we need is a United States Senator engaging in generalizations so racist and ignorant,” wrote back Krishnamoorti, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee.

Joy Reid Proves Leftists Can Do Almost Anything And Still Get Promotions,"Is there anything a left-wing activist can do to fail in media? Using Joy Reid as the standard gives us an indication. Reid, who hosts her own MSNBC show, has long been a point of frustration and baffled awe of conservative media commentators. As Bre Payton pointed out back in 2018, Reid has a knack for getting away with things no one on the right side of the political spectrum could dream of.

Many Americans are aware of her homophobic remarks she claimed a hacker wrote on her old blog, as well as her support for Iran’s antisemitic proposal to move Israel to Europe and her sharing of 9/11 truther information. Nevertheless, this coming spring, Reid will be teaching journalism students about race and gender in media reporting at Howard University in the Department of Media, Journalism and Film as a visiting professor. Her focus will be on the “racial roots of journalistic objectivity vs. fairness,” disinformation in media, and black voters.

On teaching a course on how race and gender affect political coverage, Reid remarked, “Particularly in this era of virtual media, and deep partisanship and political division, it’s never been more important that journalists incorporate a thorough and honest historical context in our coverage.” When considering Reid’s actual commentary and journalism, this plays out like a parody.

Discussing the upcoming Georgia runoff election recently, Reid went on an unhinged rant about GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. She accused them, without any basis whatsoever, of exploiting the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday for empty politics.

This, she argued, was true for “all GOPers,” as though any time a Republican honors King’s legacy it is shallow and hypocritical. She justified this with an ongoing, but completely unfounded, argument of voter suppression against black and minority voters. To boot, she has also argued that a Democrat will never get a majority of white voters.

Another one of her recent tirades focused on President Trump’s rally in Georgia, which she asserted was simply done to rile up racist Republican voters who “can’t believe blacks of all people are allowed to vote and elect a president.” This, of course, ignores the fact that about 8 percent of black voters (18 percent of black male voters) supported President Trump in the 2020 election.

A so-called journalist who will be focusing on race in political reporting should probably not be making such bold and defamatory accusations against an entire political party.

Continuing this thread of misinformation designed to fuel hatred and bigotry, Reid went on a long lecture on how the cause of the massive rioting the country witnessed over the last year were white nationalists, “unleashed at night.” Blaming Trump, she detailed her conspiracy theory that armed white nationalists were targeting peaceful Black Lives Matter protests to “scare fellow white people” into supporting the president.

“It’s an old, tried and true strategy: using fear and anti-blackness for politics,” she claimed, again without evidence. There is absolutely nothing to support such a ridiculous hallucination. In a weird contradiction of these claims, she also publicly praised two violent rioters who attacked Kyle Rittenhouse, calling them “brave young men,” and shared a story claiming Trump was fomenting “deadly violence” and “ethnic cleansing” in defending Rittenhouse.

Demonstrating her hypocrisy and continuing the conspiracy theory that white nationalists were behind the Black Lives Matter rioting, Reid attempted to shame Republicans for not condemning threats made against election workers in Georgia; The White House did so the next day.

When Sen. Lindsey Graham was threatened by opinion journalist Jimmy Williams if he pushed forward a Supreme Court nomination this past September, with Williams saying “I will do everything I can to destroy you,” Reid promoted his tweet, saying, “The knives are out, y’all. Here we go…”

Joy tweeted in support of protests at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s offices in Kentucky and DC saying, “The masses are moving. Republicans won’t steal RBG’s seat painlessly.” This as prominent left-wing activists and organizations were surrounding the homes of Republicans in “protests” to intimidate them over the Supreme Court seat. Outrage over political intimidation is selective for Reid, it would seem.

https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/1333988611629473793

Because it was developed during the Trump era, and in light of historic medical injustices against the black community, Reid has even perpetuated distrust of the coming COVID vaccine.

So, yes, Reid is a profoundly reckless and irresponsible activist who engages in openly racist arguments. Whether she is spreading false information about voter suppression and other conspiracy theories, spreading racism, hatred and bigotry against Republicans or others based exclusively on their skin color, or engaging in open activism and partisanship, Reid is one of the last people working in the legacy media today who should be teaching journalism students anything, let alone about honesty and integrity.

Despite all this, she received the 2016 Women’s Media Center Journalism award and was offered the prominent MSNBC nightly anchor slot formerly held by Chris Matthews. Even after ignoring calls to apologize for an Islamophobic comment, in left-wing circles she is still praised, not for her work but solely for what she looks like.

Associate professor and former CNN producer Jennifer Thomas cheered Reid’s newest recognition “as the only Black woman to anchor a prime-time news show on any major network.” It seems, once again, for the left all that matters is what you look like and what you represent, not integrity, reliability, or anything resembling honesty in media.

Democrats: Stop Treating Black Men Like We're Stupid Or Lose More Votes,"Democrats spent the weeks before the 2020 election ridiculing black men considering voting for President Trump as sellouts who could derail Joe Biden’s presidential bid. Biden himself said as much with his “you ain’t black” comment.

Some Biden supporters went even further. One professor claimed black men just wanted proximity to the patriarchy and power structures white men have maintained for generations. Once the media announced Biden crossed the 270 electoral vote threshold, the left’s approach changed from proactive intimidation to a retrospective explanation for the fact that exit polls indicated 19 percent of black men voted for Donald Trump.

One Democratic candidate for Congress said one in five black men voted for Trump because “they hate Black women.” The same outlets that declared white Trump voters in 2016 were misinformed, ignorant racists claimed black Trump voters—including the 9 percent of black women who voted for him—were self-loathing victims of “disinformation” campaigns.

Former President Barack Obama joined the chorus in a recent interview with The Atlantic. His entire analysis of the increase in black male support for Trump was that black men were attracted to “the bling, the women, and the money” that characterize both Trump’s public persona and hip hop culture. Hearing such a simplistic and dismissive explanation from someone as politically savvy as Obama was disappointing but terribly predictable. Therein lies the problem.

Today’s Democratic Party relies more on marshaling votes based on identity rather than ideas. That clearly didn’t work for many black men.

Stop Treating Black Voters Like We’re Stupid

Some black men may have been influenced by rappers who publicly endorsed Trump, but it is deeply insulting to assume black men in general are less attuned to their own political interests than any other group is.

One of those interests is public safety. Democrats can’t make the case for why the black father whose one-year-old son was fatally shot in the chest should be in favor of defunding the police. This tragedy is no anomaly. More than 400 children have been killed in street violence all across the country in 2020, and large cities have seen significant increases in shootings and homicides compared to last year.

Democrats have convinced black residents in the cities with the highest rate of violent crime—almost all run by Democrats—that they should be more afraid of the Boogaloo Boys than the Bloods and the Crips. It’s not hard to imagine some black voters being skeptical of such an obvious reality inversion.

Black fathers also care about their children getting a quality education. President Obama hasn’t made the case for why low-income black students shouldn’t have the same types of education options as his children. In 2008, he stated he was enrolling his daughters in private school because DC Public Schools weren’t going to meet their educational needs.

Yet one of the first things he did upon entering the presidency was attempt to defund the program poor DC families use to give their children access to private schools. With an average voucher of $9,531, the grant is less than one half of what DC’s traditional public schools spend per student and one-quarter of the tuition of Sidwell Friends, the school the Obama girls attended.

President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos increased funding for the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program and publicly support charter school expansion. In contrast, Biden has pledged to eliminate the voucher program once in office and his supporters in the National Education Association oppose charter schools that are extremely popular with black parents.

Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza can’t go into a black barbershop in Atlanta and satisfactorily explain why the men there should support her organization that is committed to “disrupting” the nuclear family. Asking that question, as well as why BLM removed the language from their website, would seem like a natural response to an organization that claims to care about the lives of black people.

Garza also can’t explain why a dad who coaches his daughter’s track team should get behind the Equality Act—a bill Biden has pledged to sign—which would allow a biological male who identifies as a girl to compete against his daughter at a high school track event where awards and college scholarships are on the line. When Flo-Jo, the fastest woman in history, posts a world record in the 100-meter dash that wouldn’t even land her among the top 6,000 men’s times, I think any father has a right to question the impact this law would have on fairness in girls’ sports.

Earn Our Votes, Don’t Just Assume Them

The pitch to black voters from Biden’s surrogates was straightforward: “You may not be excited about him, but we need to get Trump out first and get to policy specifics later.” For a certain segment of black voters, that wasn’t enough.

Some black voters have always been conservative but others considered Trump’s record on the pre-COVID economy and other important issues more important than his tweets, brash persona, and frequent accusations of racism. That is why conservatives should treat black voters like people—rational individuals with deeply held values and specific interests—not indistinguishable components of an amorphous melanated blob.

That doesn’t mean Republicans should run from issues involving race. Leftists incorrectly attribute disparities in social and economic outcomes to systemic racism, but there should be substantive conservative responses to allegations of racial arrest quotas in New York City and unconstitutional stops and searches in poor black neighborhoods in Baltimore. Failure to do so will embolden Democratic politicians to continue their attempts to whip voters in the booth the same way they whip votes in Congress.

A smart, self-interested Democratic Party would ask itself whether Trump’s increase in non-white support may indicate a larger trend underway. Unfortunately, the party’s intellectual wing and its allies in corporate media are among the most incurious and condescending people in this country.

If self-hatred and selfishness are the best explanations party operatives can come up with, they’ll get even less of the black male vote the next election cycle. Instead, they should take time to explain to black voters why Democrats think government bureaucrats and special interest groups should have more influence on where children go to school than their parents do.

They should also have to explain why celebrities and multi-millionaire donors living in gated communities support paying bail for violent criminals who go back to terrorize working-class neighborhoods. And the ultimate question is why the party that claims to oppose all systemic racism and value black lives vigorously promotes abortion policies that disproportionately reduce the black population—a goal shared by today’s white nationalists as well as Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizards of the past.

All of these questions deserve honest, thoughtful responses, not empty platitudes and predictable euphemisms. The lack of answers to this point shows that black men don’t need to defend their choices. Democrats need to defend their ideas.

Meet The Black ‘Trumpsters’ Who Helped Fire Up Minority Voters In 2020,"Reggie Carr and Johnny Thomas wear their support for Trump in a loud and daring way. For the six months before the 2020 election, the duo traveled around Colorado in a 45-foot passenger bus, wrapped with their giant photos and “I’m A Trumpster” logo.

Their goal? Winning black voters for Trump in this blue state. In a year race-related issues were front and center, their bold support for Trump stood out, which also explains why leftist media largely neglected them.

Carr is a Colorado native. On the first night after his family moved from Denver to Northglenn, a suburb 10 miles north of Denver, his mother awakened him and his brother because someone threw bricks into their bedroom windows. At the time, Carr was only seven years old.

The first several years living in Northglenn were very challenging, he says. He was the only black kid in his new elementary school until his younger brother was old enough to join him. Then his parents divorced.

Fortunately, Carr has a very strong mother, Jackie Carr. She worked hard to ensure her children received a good education. Reggie Carr credits his mother with keeping him out of trouble, teaching him good values, and most importantly, instilling in him a love for music.

She taught him how to play piano and bass guitar and to write lyrics and vocal harmonies. Carr began to thrive in Denver’s music industry. He later moved to Atlanta and founded his own music production company.

Thomas, who is also black, had a much different life. He was born in Florida and grew up in Atlanta. He told me that, growing up in the South, he was surrounded by so much love and southern hospitality that he doesn’t recall ever experiencing any discrimination.

Thomas says he has a loving and deeply religious family, and his grandparents built a church his family still attends every Sunday. His dad is the reverend, and his mom sings in the choir. Thomas thrives in Atlanta’s vibrant music industry as a singer. He was first signed by Bill Lowery Music Publishing and later by Sony.

Carr’s music production company signed Thomas for a while, and that’s how the two met and became friends. Neither Carr nor Thomas were political before 2016. Neither had registered to vote nor joined any political party. Their political awakening came in a very unexpected way.

Becoming The Trumpsters

One day while working in the studio with the TV on in the background, Carr heard then-candidate Donald Trump discussing the need to protect American intellectual property (IP) rights in China. This caught Carr’s attention because his production company had lost a lot of money in China due to the country’s rampant music piracy. Carr immediately called Thomas, who also felt strongly about IP.

“Selling our music without paying us is like stealing food from our children’s plates,” Thomas told me in an interview. “It is just wrong.” They were glad Trump took a stand against China’s IP theft, and decided to do some research on Trump. They liked what they found.

They agreed with Trump’s policy proposals of putting America first, building a strong border, and being tough on China, and they saw him as a tough leader with a strong backbone, willing to fight for what he believes. The duo even found Trump’s communication style endearing, appreciating a leader who sounded like a straight-shooter and spoke what he thought with little regard for political correctness. Trump, they concluded, was the “real deal.”

Their research on Trump also led them to develop a better understanding of conservatism. They told me black people have been conditioned to vote for Democrats, but they found conservatism’s emphasis on faith, family, country, and personal freedom to match the types of values they had been brought up with. By the time they finished their research, it was too late for them to register to vote in the 2016 election — but they were thrilled Trump won.

About a year or two into Trump’s first term, Carr was glad Trump was delivering his campaign promises on criminal justice reform, trade, immigration, and the economy. He was shocked, however, by Democrat and leftist media’s hostility and relentless attacks on Trump. Carr decided he must do something to help his president.

Carr and Thomas founded the I’m A Trumpster website, a platform to combat fake news and distribute clothing and accessories with the “I’m A Trumpster” logo. Once word got out that they had become Trump activists, many of their personal relationships took a hit. Carr said his family stopped inviting him to family functions, and while Thomas still has his family’s support, he says he did lose some friends.

Their activism took a giant leap on Nov. 8, 2019, the day the Trump campaign launched the “Black Voices for Trump” initiative in Atlanta. In a packed conference room inside the Georgia World Congress Center, Carr and Thomas joined hundreds of like-minded black Trump supporters in listening to the president’s call to action: Go to blue states and swing states, and win over minority voters.

From the Ground Up

Carr and Thomas took Trump’s call to action to heart. They decided to get a bus, wrap it in photos and their Trumpster logo, and turn it into a motorcade for the “Minorities for Trump” campaign tour in blue Colorado. Without any support from the state’s Republican Party or big donors, their tour was a financially challenging endeavor from the beginning. The duo had to fund their campaign, including the bus and its wrap, a professional bus driver, and other campaign materials, either by themselves or through grassroots fundraising.

Kim Monson, a local radio show host, helped spread the word and organize a number of fundraising events. Eventually, Carr and Thomas got their bus and wrapped it the way they wanted.

Just when they were ready to hit the road, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, but still, the duo was undeterred. In the six months leading up to the 2020 election, they traveled all over Colorado in their giant bus, stopping by minority neighborhoods, handing out campaign materials and masks with their “Trumpster” logo, and talking to voters about Trump’s policies and conservative values.

They told me one of their best experiences was last summer at the Bandimere Speedway racetrack, where they were invited to park their bus at the finish line. The audience welcomed them with endless cheering and applauding, and everyone wanted to take a picture with them and get their autograph. It felt like a homecoming.

Of course, they have also had plenty of bad experiences. Carr told me that when their driver was taking the bus for a test drive around the block in their neighborhood near downtown Denver, a white woman in a car followed the bus, blasting a “F-ck Donald Trump” song from her stereo. When a Latino driver used his SUV to block her from following the bus, she began to shout profanities at all of them and called the police for help.

“She probably supports defunding the police,” Carr said, chuckling. “But guess what was the first thing she did when she was in trouble? Calling the cops.”

‘Fight for Our Future’

Speaking of cops, I asked Thomas and Carr how they felt about this summer’s protests against police brutality. Both men have family in the police force, and the duo told me unequivocally that the men and women in blue uniforms are the real heroes in our society.

Carr even got a little emotional, saying, “They [police] put their lives on the line every day. Other people run away from dangers, but they run toward dangers.” Thomas added that he knew that cops kill in the line of duty more white people than black people, and that more black Americans die in black-on-black crimes than at the hands of law enforcement officers. He wishes people would do more independent research and learn the truth rather than believing fake news media and Black Lives Matter activists.

When I asked them what they believe is the biggest challenge for America’s black community, Carr answered: “Our community lacks economic freedom. Democrats want to rule minorities by keeping them dependent on their handouts. Democrats give you fish so they can always control you, but Republicans want to teach you how to fish. True freedom is economic freedom.” He added that he wishes black people would work together, develop black entrepreneurs, and grow black-owned businesses, so their communities can accumulate wealth and thrive economically on their own. Thomas agreed.

For the first time in their lives, Carr and Thomas registered as Republicans and voted for Trump in the 2020 election. They believe their activism made a difference. Post-election data indicates more minorities voted for Trump in 2020 than in 2016.

While the campaign season has come to an end, Carr and Thomas are not going to stop their activism. They just started their own radio show and launched IMA Super PAC. They plan to use the PAC as a platform to produce music and documentary films to “educate minorities about the value and benefits of being a conservative.” Carr said the GOP still doesn’t do a good job of attracting young minority voters, which is where he and Thomas can add the most value.

“We know how to get young minority voters,” Carr told me before we parted ways. “We must energize the youth and fight for our future!”

Watch Glenn Loury Call ‘Anti-Racism’s’ Bluff,"Brown University professor and host of “The Glenn Show” Glenn Loury has a message for Ibram X. Kendi and the rest of the “anti-racism” activists dominating leftist conversations about race. He says they are bluffing.

Everyone who is interested in race relations in the United States — and that should be everyone — should spend two minutes watching this clip. It is the most precise explanation that you will ever see for why outcomes for black Americans lag behind those of many other ethnic and racial groups.

Here I explain my idea of the ""bluffing equilibrium"" that stifles public discussion in America about persistent racial inequality. For more of the same, follow us at https://t.co/Wy8KpOFZx9 pic.twitter.com/x4a9DuccwE — Glenn Loury (@GlennLoury) December 29, 2020

Rarely has so much good sense been made in so short a period of time. Loury talks about an equilibrium of tacit agreements under which nobody talks about issues like black on black crime, or the status of the black family, or underperformance of black students, all in order to protect black dignity. There is no doubt that these agreements are in place. Loury is well-placed to understand them in the academy from which they are mainly sprung. This is where the bluff comes in.

The bluff is the belief that nobody will break these agreements and tell the truth that black Americans in fact have agency and a degree of responsibility for their own conditions. Loury is asking us to call this bluff and promising that if we do the critical race theorists will “have no cards.”

He is absolutely right. The idea that the solution to crime, poverty, and academic underperformance among black Americans will be fixed by addressing vague and amorphous notions like systemic racism and privilege theory is flat-out absurd. The only people who truly benefit from this nonsense are those who promulgate it, earning millions by selling white people a quick cure for guilt.

Loury posits that if more black people like himself and his co-host, Columbia University professor John McWhorter, start breaking these agreements of silence, then more white people will too. Well, I’m a white person taking him up on his offer.

I will not pretend that the problems black Americans face will magically wither if more soccer moms read “White Fragility” in their book clubs. I will not pretend that police are responsible for anything but a tiny minority of the black men, women, and children being gunned down in our nation when it is blatantly obvious that the bigger problem is crime itself. I urge all Americans to speak these truths.

None of this is to say that historical inequity does not play a role in the condition of the nation’s black communities, but the past can’t be changed. The future can. As Loury points out, the engine of the American economy has lifted millions of non-white immigrants into great success in America, which would be an impossibility if the real issue is white supremacy.

Far too often, serious solutions like charter schools and school choice, enhanced policing tactics, and strengthening the black family are ignored because of these tacit agreements. The problem is not in 1619, it is in 2020.

Loury is very much a black intellectual in the conservative tradition of Thomas Sowell and the recently deceased Walter Williams. Also like them, he is a rare voice.

Sowell has joked that he and Williams have been nervous about taking the same plane because if it went down the movement would be gone. Sowell and Williams were largely ignored by the left and deserved more attention from white conservatives, quite possibly as a result of these very tacit agreements. This is a mistake that white conservatives must not repeat.

Take Loury’s challenge. Call the progressive anti-racism bluff. It will do far more to improve outcomes for black Americans than tearing down statues or posting positive things about Black Lives Matter on social media. Speak the truth. The worst they can do is call you a racist. And hey, they are going to do that anyway.

Kwanzaa Is A Fake Holiday Invented By A Criminal Marxist,"Spanning from Dec. 26 to the first of January is Kwanzaa, the invented African American holiday celebrated solely by white liberals and clueless public school teachers. Overblown by leftist claiming the holiday has immense cultural significance, a survey by the National Retail Foundation discovered only 1.6 percent of Americans celebrate Kwanzaa.

The “holiday” was created in 1966 by Ron Karenga, who renamed himself Maulana. Karenga, the founder of the United Slaves, a violent rival organization to the Black Panthers, created the holiday for black Americans and derived the name “Kwanzaa” from the Swahili phrase “matunda y kwanza,” meaning “first fruits of the harvest.” That’s about the extent of the deep African roots the official Kwanzaa website claims.

The history of the holiday and Karenga has been seamlessly suppressed by leftists who find the facts inconvenient. Since few know its origins, the current definitions of the celebration are usually nonsensical and made up, much like the holiday itself.

The Guardian asserts Kwanzaa is simply an “opportunity [for black people] to celebrate themselves and their history rather than indulge in the customary traditions of a white Christmas.” The Los Angeles Times says it is “a way to honor African heritage and bring Black families and communities together.”

FrontPage Magazine’s Paul Mulshine writes that “the history of the founder of Kwanzaa has disappeared into an Orwellian time warp.” Indeed, CNN informs readers that Kwanzaa’s violent, racist founder was “a black nationalist and professor of Pan-African studies at California State University at Long Beach,” omitting his criminal and misogynistic past.

Kwanzaa, the “African feast,” really has “nothing to do with Africa and everything to do with California in the 1960s,” writes Mulshine. He contends it was made up to divide Americans, not unite them.

Mulshine explains that the paramilitary organization Karenga ran in Los Angeles in the late 1960s was involved in murder and torture: “In 1967, Karenga was accused of having his thugs beat up a student who asked him an impertinent question at a college forum. In 1969, [United Slaves] got involved in a struggle with the Black Panthers for control of the black studies program at UCLA. All involved carried guns on campus. The US guys were quicker on the draw; they killed two Panthers in a shootout at the student center.”

Karenga himself is a convicted torturer. Here is an excerpt from an article about the May 1971 trial of Karenga for torturing two members of his group:

‘Deborah Jones, who once was given the Swahili title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis’ mouth and placed against Miss Davis’ face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vise. Karenga, head of [United Slaves], also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said.

Karenga served only four to five years in a state prison.

Karenga is currently a black studies professor at California State University, Long Beach where the administration is apparently untroubled by the fact that this radical racist is also a convicted torturer of women. Despite the troubling past of Kwanzaa’s founder, leftists continue to shove this fake holiday down America’s throat every Christmas.

Woke liberals preach that Christmas in the classroom is intolerant and isolates students who don’t celebrate it. Yet Kwanzaa is permitted because the left argue it is a “cultural” holiday. Tons of teacher aids on the web provide elementary instructors with Kwanzaa coloring prints, songs, games, and crafts. But Kwanzaa isn’t actually a cultural holiday. It is best described as a political product of the 1960s, which should qualify it as inappropriate to impose on young and impressionable students.

The seven pillars of Kwanzaa (unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith), said College Fix editor Jennifer Kabbany, “reads like a communist manifesto.”

Patrick S. Poole also noted that the pillars’ claimed “cooperative economics” is an obvious Marxist reference. Poole noted the principle of “collective work and responsibility” is “why Masai and Zulu tribesmen still live in grass huts, wear animal skins and must walk everywhere.”

“It is a good thing that today we do not have to grow our food, build our houses and tend to our own lands,” wrote Poole. “Division of labor and specialization has fueled the prosperity and progress in the West that all Africans envy. And yet it is the express denial of these important economic tools that Kwanzaa lauds.”

“Karenga said [Kwanzaa] practitioners believe one’s racial identity ‘determines life conditions, life chances and self-understanding,’” wrote Ann Coulter.

Incoming Vice President Kamala Harris recently shared a “Happy Kwanzaa” video in which she says her favorite Kwanzaa pillar is self-determination, or “kujichagulia.” Harris says kujichagulia means “be, be and do. Be the person you want to be and do the things you want to do and do the things that need to be done” — whatever that means.

Somehow I find it hard to believe that she has a deep childhood attachment to a holiday that didn’t exist when she was born https://t.co/037S09KqxP — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) December 27, 2020

"WaPo: Brown People Who Vote For Trump Are 'White Supremacists,' Too","Last week, a Washington Post article created a new term, “multiracial whiteness,” to explain why significant portions of Hispanic and black voters turned in their ballots for Trump in the 2020 election. New York University professor Cristina Beltrán explained her newly invented ideology by informing us that “white” is no longer a skin color but a “political color.”

“Rooted in America’s ugly history of white supremacy, indigenous dispossession and anti-blackness, multiracial whiteness is an ideology invested in the unequal distribution of land, wealth, power and privilege — a form of hierarchy in which the standing of one section of the population is premised on the debasement of others,” she writes.

She continues, “multiracial whiteness reflects an understanding of whiteness as a political color and not simply a racial identity — a discriminatory worldview in which feelings of freedom and belonging are produced through the persecution and dehumanization of others.” In other words, if you are a black or brown person who voted for Trump, you are a self-loathing white supremacist.

Democrats usually prefer to just dismiss Trump’s gains with black and brown Americans. Beltrán’s racist take at least admits Trump made significant gains with minority voters.

The left painted Trump and his supporters as racist, but this narrative became unconvincing after Trump outperformed Mitt Romney with Hispanics in 2016 and increased his numbers in the 2020 election. Trump earned 28 percent of Hispanic votes in 2016 and approximately 32 percent in 2020.

Projecting ‘Whiteness’ and Self-Loathing

Hispanics are not a monolith. While many experts point to Trump’s anti-Communist stance as boosting his appeal to Cubans and Venezuelans, who are credited with handing him Florida, that doesn’t explain his appeal among Mexican Americans and other Latinos.

Trump was able to expand his support not only in southern Florida, but also among Hispanics in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin. For example, Starr County, Texas is 96 percent Hispanic. Hillary Clinton won the county in 2016 with 79 percent of the vote. In 2020, Joe Biden only won by 5 points, a swing to Republicans of more than 25 points. In nearby Zapata County, Texas, which is 85 percent Hispanic and historically reliably blue, the county turned red, increasing its support for Trump by 15 percent since 2016.

Since Beltrán can’t admit that Trump’s America-first policies appeal to working-class Americans, regardless of color, her solution, along with others like actor John Leguizamo, is to strip them of their racial identity: black and brown Trump supporters must be racist against themselves. How else to explain them joining hands with their oppressors?

While Beltrán is one of few leftists to acknowledge Trump’s appeal to minorities, she clearly made no attempt to understand why they support him, summing up the “MAGA movement” as the “the wild freedom of unbridled rage and conspiracy theories.”

Beltrán and the rest of the Democrat Party need to do some serious soul searching, because the “self-loathing” Hispanic narrative isn’t very convincing and can be refuted by anyone who witnessed the cultural pride on display at the numerous and organically organized Latinos for Trump rallies.

Simply declaring open-borders and calling Hispanics “Latinx,” (a woke, Anglo term used by only 3 percent of actual Hispanics) is a sorely lacking agenda for the working-class and small business entrepreneurs who make up a huge segment of the U.S. Hispanic population. Since the left is too lazy to do it, let’s explore why Trump outperformed his already groundbreaking 2016 numbers with Hispanics.

The Economy

Trump delivered on the economy. Before the COVID-19 panic, the unemployment rate for Hispanics hit a record low of 3.9 percent in September 2019. In the pre-lockdown Trump era, Hispanics experienced reduced rates of unemployment and poverty, increased rates of homeownership, and rising family median incomes. His business-friendly policies helped Hispanics, who are America’s most entrepreneurial demographic, starting businesses at three times the rate of the general population.

Trump revolutionized the Republican Party by putting American workers at the center of all his policies. Conversely, the Democrat Party is funded by and therefore caters to the corporate media, big business, out of touch Hollywood celebrities, and Wall Street.

The COVID-19 lockdowns put serious financial strains on all Americans. While Trump was advocating for small businesses and imploring state and local authorities to lift lockdowns, Democrat politicians and health officials implemented hypocritical and excessive lockdowns and mandates that have devastated Main Street USA, while giving unfair advantages to corporations like Walmart and Amazon.

With proportionally high numbers of small businesses ownership, Hispanics were hit harder by lockdowns. Many went to the polls terrified not of supposed “systemic racism” but of more lockdowns from a Biden administration.

Strong Leadership

Trump’s caudillo (strongman) personality may also explain his appeal to some Hispanics, especially Hispanic men. “Caudillismo, as it so happens,” explained Pedro Gonzalez of American Greatness, “appeals to the single largest constituency—working-class whites—and the largest minority group, Latinos.”

While leftists were appalled by Trump’s uncensored, straightforward, and unapologetic messaging, many Hispanics were impressed and saw strength where liberals saw male patriarchy and chauvinism.

Law and Order

Radical left-wing open border policies are not popular among Hispanics. According to the Pew Research Center, immigration ranked eighth among top issues for Hispanics, behind the economy, jobs, education, and health care.

A study in the New York Times asked participants how they felt about “illegal immigration from places overrun with drugs and criminal gangs” and whether they would support calling for “fully funding the police, so our communities are not threatened by people who refuse to follow our laws.” Nearly three out of five white respondents found the message convincing, while exactly the same percentage of blacks agreed, and an even higher percentage of Hispanics.

In a different poll from November 2018, 58.5 percent of Hispanics said they “support Donald Trump’s immigration policies,” even if they disliked him personally. And when liberals vilified the U.S. border patrol, one wonders how many knew that more than 50 percent of them are Hispanic Americans who proudly protect our southern border.

Aguilar said he feels, “in a way, vindicated,” because Trump showed that Republicans can win Hispanic votes without talking, above all, about immigration or having a “radical open-borders agenda.”

While Trump defended law and order, Democrats excused violent Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots all summer, which disproportionately affected poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Democrats refused to call in the National Guard to protect small businesses, leaving many of them defenseless and destroyed.

José Niño of American Greatness reported that more than half of Hispanic Democrats supported sending in the military to quell rioting in June, while 60 percent of all Hispanics supported some form of military presence. Defunding the police is wildly unpopular among Hispanics, who value safety and security in their communities and identified “violent crime” as one of their top voting issues this cycle. A July 2020 Gallup survey found that 83 percent of Hispanics want more or the same police presence in their area.

Values

Trump’s emphasis on family values, patriotism, and religious liberty appeals to conservatives and old-school Democrats who feel increasingly out of place in a party obsessed with pronouns, late-term abortion, and the secularization of the culture. Democrats also endorsed Black Lives Matter, whose Marxist mission statement called for the breakdown of the nuclear family, something faith- and family-oriented Hispanics oppose.

For Hispanics hungry to achieve the American Dream, school choice is another popular Republican policy that Trump championed. COVID highlighted the power of teachers unions and the need for educational liberty and parental choice in education.

The working class, particularly essential workers, were disproportionately hurt by school lockdowns and virtual learning. Whereas white-collar and upscale parents could afford ways to keep their children learning, poor and minority parents saw their kids fall behind and disproportionately suffer because teachers unions and the Democrat party were hell-bent on closing schools as a means to destroy the Trump economy prior to the 2020 election.

Authentic Inclusion

Trump’s economic and social agenda appeals to working-class and religious families, regardless of color. Alfonso Aguilar is a former Bush administration official who explained to The New Yorker that Trump’s message of “true inclusion” plays into his popularity. Democrats’ “modern theories of multiculturalism,” explains Aguilar, are “not true inclusion—that’s separating people. That’s marginalizing people. I think President Trump made [Hispanics] feel like part of America.”

Beltrán’s Washington Post article can be explained by a shift in the left’s donors and thus their political agenda. The old Democrat Party pushed their leftist policies via class resentment. Today, because of their reliance on big tech and corporate donations, they push their leftist policies and corporate socialism increasingly via race resentment. This is why Trump’s economic blue-collar message posed an imminent threat to their power.

Trump stole the blue-collar issues that once belonged to the Democrat Party — trade, American manufacturing jobs, and well-paid union jobs. Meanwhile, he marginalized the establishment country club members of his own party.

His workers-first policies also alienated traditional GOP donors, like Wall Street and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. By doing this, he won the hearts of the working class. Democrats, no longer able to credibly say they are on the side of workers, needed to make the election about something else and smear Trump as a racist monster.

Trump was the first Republican leader to ignore consultants and conventional wisdom on how to win Hispanics. He doubled down on border security and stricter immigration laws. Instead of pandering, he sold voters on education, family values, safety and security, acceptance and inclusion, strong leadership, and a chance at the American Dream via a robust economy.

Calling Trump’s minority supporters politically white is intellectually lazy and racist. His supporters — black, white, or brown — are united by his America-first economic agenda, patriotism, and policies that protect the unborn, families, and religious liberty.

As the biggest disrupter in modern political history, Trump turned the GOP into the party of the working class and exposed the weaknesses and corruption in both parties. As a billionaire businessman, he turned the nation’s attention to class and economic issues. His policies demonstrated that he cared about your upward mobility, not your race, and that infuriates and threatens the left.

Blacklisting And Censorship Are Hallmarks Of Repressive Societies,"“That is all right. I had them on my list, too,” a prominent public figure joked after learning that he had been blacklisted by a political opponent.

Who said this? Was it Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., after Simon and Schuster canceled his book deal because he challenged the Electoral College results from Pennsylvania, even though Democrats had similarly objected in 2001, 2005, and 2017?

Was it a Trump administration official responding to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s call to blacklist and deny them future employment?

Was it black conservative radio host Larry Elder after Hollywood censored his documentary “Uncle Tom,” whose IMDB rating of 8.9 surpasses 9 of the past 10 Oscar winners for Best Documentary?

How about someone responding to veteran journalist Katie Couric’s call to “deprogram” Trump supporters?

Or My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, after Twitter banned him along with thousands of conservatives, including former President Donald Trump? Or Newmax reporter Emerald Robinson’s response to CNN’s call to cancel Newsmax?

No. “That is all right. I had them on my list, too,” was the response of David Low, a prominent British cartoonist, when he learned in 1945 that his name was one of 2,300 Britons on Adolf Hitler’s blacklist. Had Hitler captured England, the Gestapo was to arrest those on the list.

No sector of English society or political opinion was spared from Hitler’s British blacklist. The Gestapo targeted Jews in England, members of Parliament, executives and employees of more than 170 British firms, dozens of university professors, members of 400 social clubs and organizations, and journalists at 35 media outlets.

Censorship and blacklisting are the hallmarks of an unfree society. The Third Reich seized power in Germany in 1933 and immediately began controlling newspapers, radio, and films through censorship. Books were banned and burned.

Censorship was also a tactic used by Soviet Russia. When the Bolsheviks took power in Russia in 1917, one of their first acts was to issue the Decree on Press to ban articles critical of their authority. Based on real-life experiences with censorship and other horrors in communist Russia, George Orwell wrote his book “1984” in 1949 to warn the West against totalitarianism. Today China’s Communist Party uses the Great Firewall to block news and online information from its citizens.

Today’s speech punishments by Twitter, Facebook, Hollywood, corporations, and book publishers against Americans are obviously not equal to the mass casualty horrors of totalitarian governments. A direct comparison is not the point here. It’s to point out that certain tools are hallmarks of repressive societies that a society that aspires to be free should not emulate, even faintly.

Censorship and blacklisting are serious unjust cultural acts that increasingly filter Americans into second-class citizens based on their political viewpoints. The censorship and blacklisting that we are seeing in America right now is viewpoint discrimination. Censorship and blacklisting need to be fully rejected by American society before they become accepted cultural norms that make even worse injustices likely and more possible.

It was censorship that gave birth to free-speech advocacy in America and fostered the conditions for our nation’s unique First Amendment, which legally protects unpopular speech. After his brother was thrown in jail for publishing a newspaper in 1722—the new social media of the era—Benjamin Franklin wrote a series of articles under a fake name, Silence Dogood. He had to hide his identity because he didn’t truly have free speech.

His wise words are fitting for today’s threats: “Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech. Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.”

Censorship and blacklisting are narrowing Americans’ liberties and subduing the freeness of our nation today. We must hold the line and stop it now before the current climate of fear degrades into an even worse social and government climate in which previously unimagined restrictions become possible.

How can you help stop this vicious cycle from degrading further and refuse to do as you are told to do? Watch Larry Elder’s “Uncle Tom.” Sign up for updates from Hawley’s new publisher (and one of mine), Regnery Publishing.

Use alternatives to Facebook, Twitter, and Google, such as Clouthub and DuckDuckGo. Encourage tolerance for different viewpoints at your workplace and hire conservatives. To counter Couric’s call to de-program, download, read, and share the “1776 Report.” All these and more are strategies all of us can use to exercise our society’s weakening free speech muscles.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/02/09/blacklisting-and-censorship-are-hallmarks-of-repressive-societies-lets-head-them-off-at-the-pass-in-america/,2021-02-09
This Black Teacher In Rural Alabama Inspired Generations,"From the time she was a little girl, Rosa Jinsey Young knew she wanted to be a teacher. Even though there were no schools for black children in her community, she wanted to help “her people” learn.

A small child with frequent bouts of illness, Young was an unlikely heroine. Born in 1890, the fourth of 10 children, Young grew up in Rosebud, in the heart of Alabama’s Black Belt, a swath of counties cutting through the center of the state with the blackest soil and the largest old plantations. Her parents were farmers; her father also preached as a circuit rider for the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

These were inauspicious beginnings for a young African American girl who wanted to teach. With little formal education, she taught herself to read from her blue-backed speller while also milking cows and chopping and picking cotton.

She was living in a state not interested in educating its black students, with huge funding disparities. Local school boards spent almost three times as much on each white student as they did on blacks. In Alabama, they spent $37 on each white student to just $7 on black students as late as 1930.

Service Was the Heart of her Mission

Facing Jim Crow segregation, deep poverty, isolation, discrimination, and hardship, Young initiated an educational effort that led to the founding of 30 private schools for African American students in communities across Alabama from 1912-1960. The schools educated thousands of children who would have had nowhere else to learn, and raised up leaders in ministry, teaching, civil rights, and even law.

At 15, with money earned from picking cotton, Young sent herself to Payne Institute in Selma to become a teacher. Teased mercilessly for her country ways by the city’s black students, she persevered, arriving late and leaving early every term to work in the cotton fields.

True to her love of learning and hard work, she graduated at the top of her class. In her valedictorian speech, which she had to give while seated because she was so nervous, she declared service as the greatest good.

“Good service is an unfailing guide to success. There is nothing more reputable to a race or nation than Christian service,” she said. “So let us not hesitate but grasp every opportunity that will enable us to do some good for others.”

She took doing “good for others” to heart by teaching in local black schools, where it often rained so hard inside the building children had to sit with umbrellas while reciting lessons. By 1912, she had saved her own money and raised donations from black and whites – including the former governor of Alabama, B.M. Miller – to buy land, pay for lumber and workers, and build her own school: the four-room Rosebud Literary and Industrial School. In two years attendance grew from seven to 200.

“Among these poor children were bright boys and girls filled with high ambitions with marks of leadership on their brows, shining like diamonds,” Young wrote in her autobiography.

Just three years later, her dream was hit hard by a devastating insect. The boll weevil landed in Alabama cotton fields in 1914, destroying the region’s only cash crop. In a last-ditch effort to raise funds, and after asking dozens of churches and people for support, she wrote Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute for advice.

Tuskegee was unable to offer financial support, but Washington directed her to Rev. C.F. Drewes with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod in St. Louis. It had a history of founding black Lutheran missions in the rural South, placing parochial schools in Louisiana in the 1880s and North Carolina in the 1890s. Young offered the Lutherans her school and its contents, including, “45 seats, 5 heaters, 1 school bell, 1 sewing machine, 1 piano, a nice collection of useful books and 150 New Testaments for our Bible Training program.”

Inspired by her request, Drewes sent Rev. Nils Bakke, a Norwegian Lutheran pastor with a heart for black ministry, to Rosebud to begin mission work. A few months later, on Palm Sunday, 1916, Young was the first confirmed Lutheran on the Alabama field, and a teacher and mission worker for Christ Lutheran Church and School in Rosebud.

Soon afterwards, two of her first students, twins Mary and Sarah McCants, went home to Sedan and opened a Sunday School in their father’s barn, carrying an old wagon seat on their heads for seating. Rosa walked 15 miles to the old barn to dedicate their work, which became St. Andrews Lutheran Church and School, with a T-shaped building constructed of rough-cut lumber painted green that housed the school and congregation.

Their auntie, Mrs. Luella McCants, moved six miles away to Buena Vista, and urged Rosa to help start a mission there.

“I first went to Buena Vista on August 20, 1916, having been invited to establish a Lutheran mission there,” Young wrote in her book. “I rode in an oxcart with Sister Luella McCants who had moved from Sedan near Vredenburgh to Buena Vista. The following evening I spoke to a large crowd … Quite a number expressed the desire to have a mission.”

From that humble beginning, St. James Lutheran School and Church graduated Lutheran pastors and school teachers, many of whom are still serving.

Lutheran schools and churches spread throughout communities and were founded by mill workers, sharecroppers, former students, ex-slaves, teachers, carpenters, and farmers. Church members sold eggs, sewed quilts, dug wells, chopped wood, canned figs, pressed cane syrup, ground corn, harvested cotton, and collected their coins to keep schools and churches going through tough times.

With an economy devastated by slavery and the Civil War coupled with the national 1929 stock market crash, poverty in Alabama was deep and widespread. Most blacks lived in simple wood homes, former slave and sharecropper cabins, without electricity or running water. They kept gardens, pigs, chickens, and cows so they could eat. Students recalled how happy they were to get boxes of clothes and shoes from donors.

Over time, 30 schools and 35 churches were founded, all staffed with Lutheran pastors and teachers reaching more than 3,000 people. Young taught at many of the schools and spent her salary to dig a well so the children would have fresh water. Rosa also helped found Alabama Lutheran Academy in Selma in 1922 to train teachers and pastors.

A Long-Lasting Legacy

As African Americans moved away from rural Alabama in search of better jobs and opportunities, Rosa’s influence spread. Many migrators established Lutheran churches and schools in their new cities of Mobile, Pensacola, Chicago, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. As the Alabama population fell, the churches and schools were consolidated. Several churches still remain open with active memberships, but with the advent of integration, all of the Alabama schools begun through Young’s efforts have closed except for one.

The exception is Trinity Lutheran Church and School in Mobile under the leadership of Rev. Dr. Ulmer Marshall. Marshall was one of the 12 pastors who came out of St. James Lutheran Church and School in Buena Vista.

In fact, Young was his religion teacher when he was an eighth grader at Alabama Lutheran Academy in Selma. A tough teacher, Young did not abide distractions – a lesson he learned firsthand the day he rolled a pencil on his desk.

“Everything was focused on learning, and deepening your life with Christ,” he said. Every young man was expected to be a pastor.

The inner-city neighborhood Marshall serves faces many challenges common to urban life with poverty, single parent families, and violence. But that is one reason Marshall has stubbornly kept the school going, even in hard years, because he knows the importance of a Christ-centered education.

The school is one of the church’s strongest ministries, bringing thousands of people through its doors. Today 130 students are enrolled in the school and daycare, with another 50 in after-school tutoring and summer enrichment programs.

“Rosa Young was such a humble woman, with a devout spirit to bring light of the gospel to those in spiritual darkness,” said Marshall’s wife, Gwen Marshall. “I’m amazed at how passionately she persevered, despite great odds against her. Because of her faithfulness to the gospel, she brought about a revolution in black ministry through Christian education for our children (and future pastors). We need more Rosa Youngs today.”

As Young wrote, “I had an ambition to work for the Lord and my race. I had great enthusiasm to serve my people; my heart was overwhelmed with compassion for them. This compassion for my people has remained with me throughout life.”

Washington Post Writer: How Dare White People Celebrate Black History,"Journalist Ernest Owens is annoyed with white people’s attempts to celebrate and promote Black History Month. In a Feb. 5 op-ed at the Washington Post, he complains of what he calls a “thoughtless ‘Happy Black History Month’ email from a White colleague.” He bemoans the “empty platitudes” that make him as a “Black queer millennial” feel “insulted” when white people, especially white bosses, indulge in exaggerated declarations of support for black Americans. “I don’t need or want corporations celebrating Black History Month,” he asserts.

In one sense, I can appreciate Owens’s frustration. Many white Americans’ expressions of solidarity with our fellow black citizens are undoubtedly superficial, if not performative. Corporate commemorations of Black History Month — from Amazon’s “celebrate Black innovators” tab to Apple’s “App Store Black History Month Hub” — say as much about capitalists co-opting the latest cause as it does about companies’ actual commitment to those causes.

One also imagines that priority No. 1 for most white managers or bosses in America this February is “make sure nobody can accuse me of being a racist.” I submit that points to a deeper problem: America is knee-deep in destructive, often irrational victimhood narratives that feed on shame, blame, and manufactured heroics, that can only further undermine civic unity.

I do not intend to cast aspersions on the many people of various races, sexes, ethnicities, and creeds who are authentic in either their wokeness or even their simple, well-intended desire to honor African-Americans during Black History Month. I presume there are many such people, and consider myself one of the latter (we’re reading biographies of great black Americans to our kids).

Yet the normalization of hyper-victimization has made participation in any civic activity tied to identity politics a minefield of potential affronts that few can navigate. Empty platitudes and overwrought gestures are the name of the game when one is driven more by fear and ideology than conscience.

Part of the problem, as psychologist Gad Saad argues in his book, “The Parasitic Mind: How Infectious Ideas Are Killing Common Sense,” is that our society is in an ever-higher stakes game of “victimology poker.” By this, Saad means we increasingly attribute social and political value to those with the most intricate claims to victimhood status.

Being a racial minority is one thing. Living as the opposite sex is another. The intersectional trump card is to possess as many social, economic, sexual, racial, ethnic, and religious victim categories as possible. The fewer of these traits one possesses (hint: white, heterosexual Christian males), the more likely one is to be identified not as a victim worthy of sympathy, but as a victimizer worthy of opprobrium.

Those inhabiting the victimizer class through no fault of their own must play a careful game to avoid cancellation. They can engage in dramatic shows — the genuineness of which is difficult to gauge — that seek to prove their devotion to those deemed victims. When their words or actions are assessed to violate the doctrines of wokedom (regardless of their intention or historical distance), the guilty perform public penitential rites to atone for sins and avoid the labels (e.g., “bigot,” “racist,” “sexist”) that invite invective or end a career.

Even these acts, Saad observes, are often not enough. He cites a 2018 WaPo op-ed by a professor of sociology and director of the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program at Northeastern University. The author demands men vote only for feminist women, avoid running for office, and relinquish any and all positions of authority they may hold. Perhaps men shouldn’t even vote at all!

In such a toxic environment, we shouldn’t be surprised at the histrionics of “virtue-signaling.” For anyone fearful of being labeled a victimizer, one response to the obsessive quality of our identity politics is, as Owens observes, to exploit those victim narratives to further one’s social or professional interests.

Such persons thus engage in an endless competition to not only burnish their political credentials but even, when necessary, to “outwoke” their social or economic competitors. Another response is to manufacture some relationship to victimhood status, no matter how remote — perhaps by claiming one has Native American ancestry — in order to gain access to the victim crowd for both profit and protection

This dynamic is only growing. Public schools in Illinois are mandated to teach the following subjects: black history, women’s history, the “‘history, roles, and contributions of the LGBT community,” “disability history and awareness,” and “contributions of a number of defined ethnic groups made to Illinois and the U.S.” Similar curricula are required in other states. These topics provide an inexhaustible arsenal of suffering species of victim who can express outrage and demand redress.

We fool ourselves to think that (or anything) will be enough. The very essence of victimhood culture — and that so many stand to gain from exploiting it — works against that outcome. So much for being judged according to the content of our character. Wait, who said that?

How ‘Lift Every Voice And Sing’ Became A Song Of Hope For Generations,"The year was 1900 and the annual celebration of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday on Feb. 12 was being planned in Jacksonville, Florida. Carter J. Woodson, recognized as the father of black History, chose the second week of February for the first week-long celebration in 1926 because it marked the birthdays of two important men: Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery and became an abolitionist and civil rights leader, and Lincoln, signer of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Who else to ask for assistance with the special program, but one of the most prominent educators in the city? James Weldon Johnson, principal of the distinguished (and segregated) Stanton School, was just the man for the occasion.

At 28, Johnson’s credentials were impressive. A graduate and class valedictorian from Atlanta University, he passed the Florida bar — the first African American in the state to do so since Reconstruction — and started an afternoon newspaper, The Daily American.

While principal at Stanton High School, he expanded its offerings to include eighth grade through high school, making it the first public high school for black Americans in Florida. Coming full circle, Johnson had attended the school while his mother was a teacher there — at the time, the only black American female teacher in the city.

While Johnson originally offered to write a poem for Lincoln’s Birthday celebration, he then decided a song would be better, asking his younger brother — musician J. Rosamond Johnson — to set his words to music. While the city prepared to celebrate the 91st anniversary of Lincoln’s birth, the Johnson brothers worked. James paced and agonized over the words while Rosamond composed at the piano.

As Johnson would later recall, the first line, “Lift ev’ry voice and sing,” came easily. After that, he set to work finishing the stanza. When the next lines came to him, he realized “the spirit of the poem had taken hold of me.”

Johnson handed the first stanza to Rosamond, who worked on the music at his piano in their LaVilla home in Jacksonville. Rather than sitting down to write the other two stanzas, Johnson instead went outside to the porch. “While my brother worked at his musical setting I paced back and forth on the porch, repeating the lines over and over to myself, going through all the agony and ecstasy of creating.”

By the third stanza, Johnson found himself in a poetic euphoria, weeping as he crafted the lines. “Feverish ecstasy was followed by that contentment — that sense of serene joy — which makes artistic creation the most complete of all human experiences.”

When the piece was finally completed, a choir of 500 black American schoolchildren sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing” at the celebration of The Great Emancipator’s birthday. That performance was just the beginning.

Resounding Through Generations

Long popular in black churches, schools, and civic groups, “Lift Every Voice and Sing” is now viewed by some as the black national anthem and is gaining national prominence.

In January, the NFL promoted its video of Alicia Keys performing the song before this year’s Super Bowl. It has been celebrated through the years by R&B artists like Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles, modern Gospel great Kirk Franklin, and even “Queen B” Beyoncé. Recently, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., introduced a bill to make it the official national hymn of the United States.

The hymn — now printed in more than 30 denominational hymnals — was a staple in the United Methodist Church pastored by Rev. Joseph Lowery. The civil rights hero prayed the third verse of the hymn he so loves at the swearing-in ceremony for President Barack Obama:

God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who has brought us thus far along the way. Thou who has by thy might, led us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray.

Lowery, who co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr. Martin Luther King, said he used the hymn in worship services for 25 years. “It had historicity; it had the religious context,” said Lowery “The black experience is sort of wrapped up in that hymn.”

Nationally renowned composer and musician Dr. Roland Carter, professor of American music at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, recalls it was sung at the opening of every NAACP meeting and has directed several choral performances of his spirited arrangement of the song.

A Song of Hope

The song stirs deep emotions, with its evocative text and soaring musical line that reflects the Johnsons’ deep understanding and appreciation for black spirituals. Booker T. Washington endorsed it in 1905 and the NAACP adopted it as the “black national anthem” in 1919.

Imani Perry, who wrote a biography of the song, “May We Forever Stand: A History of the Black National Anthem,” explains:

The song proved to be, both then and soon after, much bigger than an ode to any one leader or icon. It was a lament and encomium to the story and struggle of black people. The Johnsons at once wrote black history and wrote black people into the traditions of Western music with their noble song.

While never mentioning race, the song describes the hope of freedom while not glossing over the deep trials and pain of African American experience:

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,

Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;

Written during the highly segregated and dangerous years of Jim Crow in the deep South, the song hopes in God’s sheltering hand and trust in Him.

The Highlight of an Impressive Life

James Weldon Johnson’s love of language and the arts stayed with him as he and his brother left the South for New York in where they composed more than 200 musical theater songs for various productions. Ever political, as a founding member of the Colored Republican Club of New York, Johnson later wrote a spirited campaign song for presidential candidate Theodore Roosevelt.

Showing the depth of his intelligence and interests, Johnson later became an active member of the NAACP. He translated Fernando Periquet’s grand opera “Goyescas” into English. In 1915, the Metropolitan Opera produced his libretto version.

While working for the NAACP, on July 28, 1917, Johnson organized a silent march down New York City’s Fifth Avenue of nearly 10,000 black Americans in opposition to lynching. The first protest of its kind, it set the stage for future civil rights demonstrations and, in 1920, for James Weldon Johnson to become the first black American to head the NAACP, a position he held for 10 years.

Over the years, the NAACP published Crisis magazine and several pamphlets, one featuring Johnson’s philosophy about living as a black man in a world that was still segregated:

I will not allow one prejudiced person or one million or one hundred million to blight my life. I will not let prejudice or any of its attendant humiliations and injustices bear me down to spiritual defeat. My inner life is mine, and I shall defend and maintain its integrity against all the powers of hell.

Regardless of what life threw his way, Johnson always returned to his love of the arts, publishing the definitive “Book of American Negro Poetry” (1922), “The Book of American Negro Spirituals” (1925), and “The Second Book of Negro Spirituals” (1926). The following year, he wrote his book of poems, “God’s Trombones,” poetic sermons in the style of old country black preachers. Finally, he penned his autobiography, “Along This Way: The Autobiography of James Weldon Johnson,” in 1933.

“Lift Every Voice and Sing” had by then taken on a life of its own. Young children were deeply affected by the song and kept singing it in churches and schools throughout the South, as Johnson notes in his autobiography:

My brother and I moved away from Jacksonville to New York [in 1901], and the song passed out of our minds. But the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it; they went off to other schools and sang it; they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country.

Although music publishers reissued the piece several times, Johnson most often found it typed or handwritten and pasted into the back of hymnals and songbooks used in Sunday schools, Y.M.C.A.’s, and similar institutions. “I think that this is the method by which it gets its widest circulation,” he wrote.

With a career that took him all over the world, Johnson cherished most the song he wrote to celebrate Abraham Lincoln in 1900. “The lines of this song repay me in elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever I hear them sung by Negro children,” he wrote in 1935. “Nothing that I have done has paid me back so fully in satisfaction as being part creator of this song.”

“Lift Every Voice and Sing”

By James Weldon Johnson

Lift every voice and sing

Till earth and heaven ring,

Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;

Let our rejoicing rise

High as the listening skies,

Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,

Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us,

Facing the rising sun of our new day begun

Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod,

Bitter the chastening rod,

Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;

Yet with a steady beat,

Have not our weary feet

Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?

We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,

We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,

Out from the gloomy past,

Till now we stand at last

Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years,

God of our silent tears,

Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;

Thou who has by Thy might Led us into the light,

Keep us forever in the path, we pray.

Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,

Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;

Shadowed beneath Thy hand,

May we forever stand.

True to our God,

True to our native land.

"Yes, Green Energy Failures Helped Cause Texas Blackout Disaster","As Texans reel from ongoing blackouts at the worst possible time, during a nationwide cold snap that has sent temperatures plummeting to single digits, the news has left people in other states wondering: How could this happen in Texas, the nation’s energy powerhouse?

But policy experts have seen this moment coming for years. The only surprise is that the house of cards collapsed in the dead of winter, not the toasty Texas summers that usually shatter peak electricity demand records.

The blackouts, which have left as many as 4 million Texans trapped in the cold, show the numerous chilling consequences of putting too many eggs in the renewable basket.

Fossil Fuels Aren’t to Blame

There are misleading reports asserting the blackouts were caused by large numbers of natural gas and coal plants failing or freezing. Here’s what really happened: the vast majority of our fossil fuel power plants continued running smoothly, just as they do in far colder climates across the world. Power plant infrastructure is designed for cold weather and rarely freezes, unlike wind turbines that must be specially outfitted to handle extreme cold.

It appears that ERCOT, Texas’s grid operator, was caught off guard by how soon demand began to exceed supply. Failure to institute a managed rolling blackout before the grid frequency fell to dangerously low levels meant some plants had to shut off to protect their equipment. This is likely why so many power plants went offline, not because they had failed to maintain operations in the cold weather.

Yet these operational errors overshadow the decades of policy blunders that made these blackouts inevitable. Thanks to market-distorting policies that favor and subsidize wind and solar energy, Texas has added more than 20,000 megawatts (MW) of those intermittent resources since 2015 while barely adding any natural gas and retiring significant coal generation.

Increased Reliance on Unreliable Renewables

On the whole, Texas is losing reliable generation and counting solely on wind and solar to keep up with its growing electricity demand. I wrote last summer about how ERCOT was failing to account for the increasing likelihood that an event combining record demand with low wind and solar generation would lead to blackouts. The only surprise was that such a situation occurred during a rare winter freeze and not during the predictable Texas summer heat waves.

Yet ERCOT still should not have been surprised by this event, as its own long-term forecasts indicated it was possible, even in the winter. Although many wind turbines did freeze and total wind generation was at 2 percent of installed capacity Monday night, overall wind production at the time the blackouts began was roughly in line with ERCOT forecasts from the previous week.

We knew solar would not produce anything during the night, when demand was peaking. Intermittency is not a technical problem but a fundamental reality when trying to generate electricity from wind and solar. This is a known and predictable problem, but Texas regulators fooled themselves into thinking that the risk of such low wind and solar production at the time it was needed most was not significant.

Special Breaks Helped Cause the Blackouts

The primary policy blunder that made this crisis possible is the lavish suite of government incentives for wind and solar. They guarantee profits to big, often foreign corporations and lead to market distortions that prevent reliable generators from building the capacity we need to keep the lights on when wind and solar don’t show up.

Research by the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Life:Powered project found that more than $80 billion of our tax dollars have been spent on wind and solar subsidies in the last decade, in federal subsidies alone. Texans are also charged an average of $1.5 billion a year in state subsidies for renewable energy.

All that cash hasn’t materially changed our energy landscape. Wind and solar still provide just 4 percent of our energy nationwide. The promise that subsidies would kickstart renewable energy technology remains unmet after more than 40 years.

Renewable advocates will be quick to point out that fossil fuels also receive subsidies from the federal government. That’s partially true, but solar companies receive 75 times more money and wind 17 times more per unit of electricity generated. Nevertheless, the best solution for Texans, and all Americans, would be to eliminate all energy subsidies and allow the free market to drive our energy choices.

As politically popular as wind and solar energy are, no amount of greenwashing can cover up their fundamental unreliability and impracticality for anything other than a supplemental energy source. Yet our government — even in the oil country of Texas, home of Spindletop and the Permian Basin — is designed to incentivize renewable energy projects.

Keep This from Happening Again

This week’s blackouts should be a wakeup call to politicians. Overconfidence in renewables led us uncomfortably close to total grid failure — and when the going gets tough, few things really matter to voters as much as access to electricity. Without it, scrambling for the barest necessities like food, water, and warmth becomes expensive, stressful, and all-consuming.

The consequences are potentially deadly. For all the talk of climate change, cold is far deadlier than heat, responsible for 20 times more deaths. Although the cold itself may not kill you — you might not literally freeze to death — it has devastating potential to exacerbate preexisting conditions and make otherwise minor illnesses life-threatening.

It’s a reality far too many know firsthand, as a recent study found increasing natural gas utility prices led to an increase in wintertime deaths as they force families to choose between putting food on the table and paying the heat bill. In this health-conscious era of the COVID-19 crisis, this should be enough to pause any policy discussion that might inhibit electricity access.

Here’s What to Do

The Texas legislature, and other states hoping to avoid similar messes, should act decisively to protect our electric grid in a few specific ways. First, they should require all electric generation to be “dispatchable,” or readily available — meaning generators guarantee a certain amount of power will be available at all times. No more should we tolerate wind turbines pumping out a measly 2 percent of their capacity and leaving Texas families in the cold.

Second, they should end subsidies for both renewable and traditional energy sources. Research by the Texas Public Policy Foundation explains extensively the problems with energy subsidies, including distorting markets without improving technology or shifting our energy landscape in the slightest. Rather than wasting tax dollars trying (and failing) to pick winners and losers, lawmakers should allow the free market to work.

Finally, they should work to discourage the discriminatory practice of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, which prioritizes political correctness over fiduciary duty and places workers’ and retirees’ futures at risk. Texas and several other states will file legislation soon to prohibit companies that boycott or divest from fossil fuels from doing business with the government. It’s a good start to ensure this energy discrimination campaign doesn’t infiltrate state pensions and investments.

Especially in the bitter cold of winter, a life without electricity is a miserable one. It’s unfortunate that years of poor policy choices — coupled with ERCOT’s mismanagement — made this crisis a reality for so many Texans.

Texans learned firsthand the consequences of unreliable renewable energy this week. If their voices are heard, it won’t happen again.

"Americans Deserve True Black History, Not Lies From The 1619 Project","When I attended last year’s White House Black History Month reception, it appeared few of us took note that it was the 50th anniversary of such observances. Then George Floyd and Black Lives Matter happened, seemingly changing things forever—particularly a reevaluation of the black experience.

Concerted efforts to commemorate black history go back almost a century. In 1926, black historian Carter G. Woodson designated the second week in February as “Negro History Week.” He selected the days between the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln on the 12th and Frederick Douglass on the 20th.

In 1970, the Black United Students group at Kent State University launched Black History Month. It gained momentum after President Gerald Ford recognized it during the nation’s bicentennial celebration in 1976.

Still, growing up in the ‘70s and early ‘80s, I don’t remember an emphasis on black history in the classroom, even in February, until Stevie Wonder helped campaign for a Martin Luther King national holiday with his hit song “Happy Birthday.”

Even then, Black History Month felt like a broken record. The curriculum was repetitious — focusing on the likes of Dr. King, Harriet Tubman, and George Washington Carver. There were no deep dives into educator Booker T. Washington, abolitionist Frederick Douglass, inventor Lewis Howard Latimer, or others.

Was I somehow shortchanged or diminished because I didn’t learn much about black history from my teachers? Not at all. My parents—especially my mother, an elementary school teacher—understood the times. They realized it was their responsibility to ensure their son knew the history and accomplishments of his people.

Before I fully comprehended and appreciated what they did for me, I happily played black history board games. They also got me a set of black history encyclopedias published by Johnson Publishing, then-publisher of the iconic Ebony and Jet magazines.

My formal education—and my fellow students’—would have been greatly enhanced by a better study of black history. Understanding the worthwhile contributions of one’s particular ethnic group toward the advancement of the nation and world is a good thing.

At the same time, the pedagogy of ethnic pride comes with responsibility currently being abdicated for radicalism. That’s why it’s a shame when contemporary Black History Month curricula simply revises history for political gain. A prime example is the “1619 Project” peddled by The New York Times.

At last year’s Times shareholder meeting, I questioned Chairman Arthur “Pinch” Sulzberger, Jr. about it, asking:

The New York Times has invested significant resources in its 1619 Project, built upon the premise that everything in American history is irrevocably built on and tainted by slavery. Many well-respected historians from a wide array of backgrounds have stepped forward to challenge the premises and factual assertions of the Project, particularly the claim that U.S. independence was motivated by a desire to break from an abolitionist Britain. The Times has finally admitted its error. Will it now go back to correct the record with the vigor with which it distorted it, and ensure that schools using 1619 Project materials are not teaching falsehoods?

Confronted about his paper’s failings, Sulzberger showed no remorse. He responded: “The 1619 Project… certainly has its critics, some of whom disagree with some of its conclusions. And one of the things that we’ve tried hard to do throughout the Project is simply to encourage dialogue between those with different perspectives. And we think that that debate has been of real value to the public.”

Despite egregious errors—acknowledged even by those who helped edit it—Sulzberger’s response to 1619 Project failings was that he was basically good with it as long as people talked about race. Really?

Is it healthy and uplifting to tell black students they are perpetual victims living in a racist country founded on preserving the intuition of slavery? Will this encourage them to strive for excellence and achievement to uplift fellow blacks?

This mindset does a disservice to Woodson’s aspiration. As they do with almost everything they touch, leftists turned something that’s potentially useful into just another vehicle for left-wing propaganda and proselytizing. My parents handled Black History Month much better.

Leftist Tokenism Destroys Knowledge Of America's Amazing Black History,"Black History Month should be a great celebration for all Americans, not just those of us who are black. Unfortunately, the pride I felt about it as a child in the late 1970s has almost dissipated. That’s because instead of honoring those who truly made black history into American history, corporate media, corporations and the politically left have appropriated this tradition into a vehicle for virtual signaling.

President Gerald Ford decreed Black History Month a national observance in 1976, a year that marked the fiftieth anniversary of the first iteration of Black History Month. Black History Month evolved from the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History’s “Negro History Week,” which began in 1926. Harvard-trained historian Carter G. Woodson and minister Jesse E. Moorland chose the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.

Woodson’s goal, however, was not to segregate black history to a specific time of the year, but to encourage year-round, ongoing recognition of those who had often been overlooked. Many Americans still embrace Woodson’s vision of perpetual study of black history, but the majority of Americans seem largely unaware of black accomplishments until February rolls around. Also, as we have recently seen, certain school systems overlook much of black history to focus on slavery and the civil rights movement—if there is any focus on it at all.

We also see the acknowledgement of black history erode into two streams of thought: a leftist perspective and the celebration of black modern culture.

In the last few years, a lot of black history observances have been predicated on a certain ideology. Thus the average American’s understanding of black history and accomplished black Americans could easily be limited to slavery, the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King Jr., the Obamas, Kamala Harris, Michael Jordan, Michael B. Jordan, and Oprah.

Some may know a bit about James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, and Malcolm X. But how many would recognize the names Clarence Thomas, Walter Williams, James B. Parsons, Benjamin Hooks, or Zora Neale Hurston, or know that America’s first slaveowner, Anthony Johnson, was African-American?

The other stream, one embraced by corporate media, focuses on modern black culture as black history. Thanks to the media and its corporate sponsors, many Americans do not understand how slave-inspired chants and songs evolved into gospel and the blues, and eventually into modern country, rock and soul music.

School systems are adopting the America-hating and historically dubious “1619 Project” instead of learning that Harriet Tubman was the first woman to ever lead a U.S. military operation or that Madam C.J. Walker was the first female self-made millionaire. We have young adults who can quote Megan Thee Stallion but not George Washington Carver or Booker T. Washington.

As a result, we have people complaining on social media that it was racist for a team with a white quarterback to win the Super Bowl against a team with a black quarterback during Black History Month! We are trending toward celebrating victimhood instead of championing survival and perseverance.

Because of this, I aspire to eradicate Black History Month in its current form. I would like to see American history taught so it thoroughly integrates black, white, Asian, Hispanic, women’s, Jewish and everyone’s history together. Like Woodson envisioned, we could still have specific months to highlight specific groups.

By thoroughly and objectively integrating the recognition of black contributions into our society, we will not only be able to say black history is American history, but also make it worth celebrating again.

Kamala Harris To Speak At Summit With Ties To Antisemite Tamika Mallory,"Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to speak at a summit with connections to Tamika Mallory, a left-wing activist who was forced to step down as the national chair of the Women’s March in 2019 because she was accused of antisemitism for her praise of the bigoted Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and for antisemitic comments.

Harris will be a featured speaker at the Black Women’s Roundtable, scheduled for March 24-28. Mallory is a member of the Black Women’s Roundtable, which is part of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation headed by Mallory’s friend Melanie Campbell. In 2020, Mallory was named one of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation’s President’s Circle Leadership Award Honorees.

Before Mallory stepped down from the Women’s March, Campbell defended her against accusations of antisemitism, sharing a petition in support of Mallory. “Black women all over the nation and Diaspora stand [in] solidarity and support of our #sistar leader @TamikaDMallory #IStandwithTamikaMallory,” Campbell wrote on Twitter in 2018.

Black women all over the nation and Diaspora stand n solidarity and support of our #sistar leader @TamikaDMallory #IStandwithTamikaMallory — Melanie Campbell (@coalitionbuildr) March 3, 2018

Farrakhan is notorious for his antisemitic, anti-white, and homophobic rhetoric. He has blamed Jews for 9/11 and referred to them as “termites.” He has also called whites the “anti-Christ” and accused the “wicked Jews” of “promoting lesbianism, homosexuality,” among other things.

Mallory faced backlash for saying Farrakhan was the “greatest of all time because of what he’s done in black communities.” Mallory was also seen attending an event where Farrakhan said, “The powerful Jew is my enemy.”

Mallory also wrote that “white Jews … uphold white supremacy” in a 2018 statement to the New York Times

Mallory is an “open, unabashed antisemite,” said the Jerusalem Post’s Lahav Harkov. Michael Cohen of the Boston Globe called Mallory’s comment “deeply ignorant offensive.”

Vanessa Wruble, who is Jewish and co-founded the Women’s March, left before the 2019 march, citing concerns about antisemitism after a troubling exchange with Mallory.

Many are disturbed Harris would choose to associate with someone like Mallory. “Tamika Mallory is such a rabid antisemitie that even the @womensmarch kicked her out… She’s not too much of an antisemite for @VP, though,” wrote the Republican Jewish Coalition on Twitter.

This isn’t Harris’s only tie to Mallory. Symone Sanders, a friend of Mallory’s and a fellow activist, was named Harris’s chief spokeswoman and senior adviser in January. Sanders also presented Mallory with the Black Entertainment Television’s social movement award in 2018 and can be seen hugging her.

Left Claims To Care About Black Lives While Abandoning Them,"On August 27, 2020, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both candidates at the time, responded to the shooting of Jacob Blake by talking about the constant fear black Americans live with due to systemic racism. Details of the case, specifically the fact that Blake was armed with a knife, were still developing at the time.

The news of Blake stood in stark contrast to the public response to a mass shooting that had occurred just two weeks prior in Biden and Harris’s backyard. More than 20 black people, including an off-duty police officer, were shot at a party in Washington, D.C. on August 9, 2020.

There were no statements by Biden or Harris. Outside of an article on CNN there was almost no national attention paid to the shooting at all. The Washington Nationals baseball team canceled a game in support of Blake but didn’t even send a single tweet about a brazen act of violence that happened minutes from its stadium.

These incidents reflect one of the most important rules of modern politics: black lives matter much more to the left when threatened by white perpetrators than by black ones.

Concern Is Not Colorblind

Consider the case of Jazmine Barnes, a 7-year-old black girl who was fatally shot in Walmart parking lot in Houston. Police initially believed the suspect was a white man in his 40s. Those original reports led Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, attorney Lee Merritt, and a number of celebrities and civil rights activists, like Shaun King, to declare the tragedy a hate crime.

A few days later the police caught two black suspects and charged them with capital murder. No celebrities corrected their initial statements and the man they accused of the crime took his own life seven months later.

Jazmine Barnes is no anomaly. Between January and September of last year, more than 400 children, mostly black and Hispanic, were killed in street violence. There is a lot of talk about racial disparities in the prison system, but the reality is that those disparities, which are caused by violent crimes, not drug crimes, are driven by fact that 13 percent of the population accounts for half of the homicides in the United States.

I’m sympathetic to communities and politicians who don’t want to increase the number of black men in prison or provide fodder for racists who think black people are inherently violent. There are no virtues or vices inherent to any skin color or ethnic group. Anyone who thinks otherwise hasn’t seen the data on who commits most child sex crimes.

At the same time, the safety of law-abiding black Americans across the country is more important than trying to change the minds of ignorant people who don’t suffer the consequences of violent crime in their neighborhoods.

Many Parts to the Problem

It is impossible to address this phenomenon without being honest about the self-serving political, economic, and cultural interests that perpetuate it. Democratic politicians are reluctant to do anything that can be perceived as critical of their black constituents. They also see the terrible price people like Hillary Clinton and Biden paid politically for supporting tough-on-crime legislation like the 1994 crime bill and have decided it is easier to focus on access to guns and systemic racism.

The party’s support structure plays a large role in selecting which black lives matter as well. Each viral incident creates a seamless coordination between corporate and social media outlets that replay videos on an endless loop, politicians who make speeches condemning systemic racism, corporations that issue statements about the importance of diversity, intellectuals who finally get to cash in on their pseudoscientific racial theories, and education administrators who turn the latest social justice cause into curricula and school resources.

That type of efficient operation illustrates a mature industry in which black suffering is the raw material, fear and division are the main products, and more power for the key stakeholders is the bottom line. That sounds harsh, but how else do you explain the speed with which we went from discussing qualified immunity and chokeholds after George Floyd’s death to demands for more diversity on corporate boards, books on white fragility, pancake syrup logos, NBA jerseys with “Love Us” printed on the back, and media mega-deals for Black Lives Matter co-founders?

Solutions Start With Honesty

Street violence can’t be fixed overnight, but progress can be made over time through a renewed focus on families, faith institutions, and a culture that promotes the sanctity of life. As a Christian father, my goal is to help my children understand that their inherent worth and dignity comes from being created by God, not what they look like or what other people think of them.

Young men who fire guns recklessly into crowds neither see the value in their lives nor the lives of others. Liberal politicians have acted as if more programs are a replacement for strong families, but the government is an unfaithful husband and a chronically absent father. Its resources are stretched too thin and its attention is too transactional to replace what families lose when dads are absent.

Getting the left to value black lives regardless of what is threatening them will also take time. Initiatives like Voices of Black Mothers United are needed to bring attention to the impact of violent crime on families and communities across the country.

We need brave community leaders and everyday citizens to ask their elected officials, whether mayors or congressional members representing large cities, why white supremacy is treated as a national issue while crimes against their actual constituents are rarely addressed from their bully pulpit.

Democrats took their performative activism to a new level in 2020, whether by kneeling in Kente cloth in the Capitol or through public art projects to troll the former president. By contrast, President Trump’s Operation Legend initiative seized more than 2,600 guns and made more than 6,000 arrests, including 467 for homicide, across nine cities between July and December 2020. Considering the fact that only about 60 percent of homicide cases are closed nationally, a rate even lower when black victims are involved, Operation Legend was a government response that actually saved lives.

It is easier for the left to evoke the injustice of Emmett Till’s murder after a white woman harasses a black bird-watcher in Central Park than it is after two separate mass shootings in Chicago, whether outside of a funeral in 2020 or a party in 2021. The predictable cadre of black pundits, academics, and media personalities who pen op-eds and make cable news appearances for the former are conspicuously silent after the latter.

The reason is quite clear. They have decided that race-hatred is worse than self-hatred. It’s time to speak honestly about that. Just because these people have decided to live with it doesn’t mean the rest of us have to lie about it as well.

"No, Cancel Culture Isn’t Stolen From Black People","When I lived in Thailand for three years, I saw a lot of curious attempts to mimic American culture. There is Thai hip hop, Thai country, and even Thai heavy metal. I lived through three Thai Christmases and Halloweens (despite the country being 95 percent Buddhist). I sat through innumerable Thai soap operas as I ate lunch at a cafeteria near work.

You can judge for yourself whether any of these things succeed. I confess I was typically more dismayed than delighted, although I tried to remind myself that imitation is the highest form of flattery.

Not so for Clyde McGrady and the editors at the Washington Post. McGrady in a April 2 article explains that he views imitation as yet another manifestation of “cultural appropriation.” That includes conservatives (he focuses exclusively on attacking white conservatives, but obviously there are plenty of non-white conservatives) who are raising alarm bells regarding the dangers of cancel culture. Because, you see, the idea of “cancelation” itself derives from black culture.

Perhaps the most ridiculous and depressing aspect of McGrady’s article is that in the Post’s April 5 print edition, it appeared directly next to an article about black journalist Alexi McCammond, who in mid-March parted ways with Teen Vogue over some old tweets that “included comments on the appearance of Asian features, derogatory stereotypes about Asians and slurs for gay people,” according to The New York Times.

One wonders if WaPo editors are so blinded by their ideological zealotry that they can’t perceive the irony in featuring an article shaming white people for “cultural appropriation” of cancel culture alongside an article in which a young black woman was canceled for something she wrote as a teenager.

Of course, there are plenty of absurdities in McGrady’s article. There is his claim that “‘cancel culture’ is a new favorite way to describe what’s making them [conservatives] upset (way punchier than ‘political correctness’).” Not quite.

How about the attempts by Big Tech to silence ideas they don’t like, as we recently saw with Amazon’s removal of Ryan Anderson’s book on transgenderism? Or perhaps Kevin Hart’s forced resignation from the Oscars? Or a black security guard fired from his job for using the n-word in the course of telling a student not to direct the word at him? Conservatives have complained about all of these.

Or consider McGrady’s frustration that “‘Cancel’ and ‘woke’ are the latest terms to originate in black culture only to be appropriated into the white mainstream and subsequently thrashed to death.” He bemoans “the commodification of Black slang” as “practically an American tradition.”

What would McGrady prefer? That white Americans insulate themselves from black culture and refuse to listen to black music, eat black-influenced cuisine, or use black-originating vocabulary? Wouldn’t that be racist, egregiously more racist than “appropriating” black culture?

Black culture is American culture, and always has been. This is the complex beauty of cultural intersection. Yes, of course, practically every major American musical genre — blues, bluegrass, country, jazz, rock — is indebted to black culture in one way or another. That’s because black culture has created wonderfully interesting art.

White musicians borrow from these traditions and create their own unique style. Perhaps some of them are cynical and self-obsessed, but the white American musicians I love the most — Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, the Black Keys — are effusive in their praise of the black culture from which their sound originates. Indeed, in an old video of Johnny Winter and Dr. John, Winter explicitly complains about musicians ashamed of their musical heritage.

For McGrady, race is the preeminent prism for interpreting contemporary social and political developments. “Not only have these words been appropriated from Black culture,” he writes, “but they have also been weaponized to sneer at the values of many young Black liberals.”

No, cancel culture is the weapon and it is wielded at blacks and whites, conservatives and liberals alike. How many articles must conservative publications publish bemoaning how cancel culture is not only affecting conservatives, but liberal writers, editors, academics, and celebrities? Go talk to Bret Weinstein, Lindsay Shepherd, or Donald McNeil.

McGrady writes: “‘Cancel’ is now just another word that White people have taken and run into the ground.” How is such a claim not patently racist? How has our culture, and our supposedly leading media institutions, come to accept such asinine, antagonist gibberish as worthy of print? That such a sentence would appear alongside an article describing how a once widely hailed black female editor was canceled for some old tweets she apologized for demonstrates the degree of comedy and tragedy that defines our zeitgeist.

Black culture is beautiful and inexhaustibly interesting. Indeed, there cannot be a truly American culture without the indelible influence of black Americans, whether it be their contributions to language, music, cuisine, literature, politics, or anything else. An exclusively white America, stripped of our shared racial and cultural heritages, would be impoverished. Most white Americans know this, celebrate black culture, and borrow heavily from it, as well they should.

McGrady appears to want it both ways. White Americans are cultural appropriators when they integrate black culture into their own life and language. Yet such persons would undoubtedly be racists if they refused to accept the contributions of black Americans as good and worthy of emulation. In this confused paradigm, there is no way out of the smear of racism. It’s no wonder people like John McWhorter call wokeism an acidic, socially destructive religion.

Above all else, I would want to leave McGrady and those sympathetic to his opinions with a warning and a plea. First, the warning. The WaPo cares less about people than it does about its ideological vision. They, like The New York Times, Vogue, and so many other institutions, will have no trouble canceling anyone who fails to maintain conformity with the progressivist project. They’ve proved that time and again.

Thus my plea: realize who is really involved in racial exploitation by promoting the misnomered “anti-racist” balderdash that only further frays the fabric of American civic cohesion and leaves an increasing number of casualties in its wake.

Cancel culture is real, and the victim list keeps growing. Its victims span every race, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic group in this country. In its malevolence and refusal to forgive, it is the very antithesis of the Christian religion that so deeply informed our Founders, and generations of religiously devout black Americans. It is racist, hateful, and self-destructive. I pray our nation realizes this before it consumes us all.

"Yes, Overreliance On Wind And Solar Fed Texas’s Power Outages","When the lights went out in Texas earlier this year, corporate media and the left swiftly developed a narrative and stuck to it: Texas failed because it didn’t regulate enough and it wasn’t part of the national grid.

This storyline also claimed a lack of electricity from wind and solar had nothing to do with the disaster that claimed 111 lives. Instead, the blackouts were the failure of normally reliable thermal power—natural gas, coal, and nuclear—due to a reluctance to spend billions of dollars to winterize facilities throughout a state more known for persistently hot summers than for transient polar vortices.

A variant of this liberal argument was posited by Pedro Gonzalez at American Greatness. The headline echoed the corporate media’s main gloat over Texas’s misfortune: “When the Free Market Freezes Over.” Unfortunately, Gonzalez, as with leftist media and the environmentalists he draws upon, make a few assertions that turn out to be not quite so.

Correcting the record is important since assigning the wrong reasons for Texas’s electric blackouts will lead to the wrong solutions.

How Much to Blame Wind

Gonzalez starts with the observation that at the root of Texas’s failure is “an indictment of a bought, unresponsive, ruling class.” This is likely his essay’s most correct statement, although not quite in the way he thinks. Gonzalez then repeats the oft-claimed charge that the blackouts were driven by thermal power failures with “wind shutdowns account(ing) for less than 13 percent of the outages.”

It is true that natural gas production in Texas, much of it in the Permian Basin in the west, dropped by about 75 percent soon after the cold front hit. Unfortunately, a cloud of disinformation peddled by the unreliables lobby (for wind and solar) and corporate media fed a false narrative that the failures were due solely to a lack of weatherization.

The reason for the drop in natural gas available for power generation is complicated, but a partial picture of what happened emerged from some 50 hours of sworn testimony before both houses of the Texas legislature on Feb. 25 and 26. Those hearings indicated there may have been some loss of gas supply due to wellhead freeze-offs and cold pipeline problems.

But unmentioned by critics was that ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) and Oncor, the Texas grid operator and one of its two large regulated electric transmission and distribution providers, respectively, inexplicably decided to cut power to the oil and gas fields, compressors, and pipeline infrastructure responsible for fueling the gas-fired power plants that were laboring mightily to keep the lights and heat on in Texas. Thus, human error played a role.

Additional natural-gas supplies were diverted to home heating needs during the record cold. Gas supply ramped up commensurate with electricity provided to the gas production infrastructure. The loss of power to oil and gas infrastructure was also made worse by an Obama administration environmental edict that forced the oil and gas industry to replace natural gas pipeline compressors powered by natural gas with electric compressors.

That regulated industries and the regulators who oversee them—ERCOT and the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUC)—failed to recognize the critical nature of Texas natural gas infrastructure was hardly a failure of the free market, as Gonzalez and the left allege. It was a failure of government regulators.

The Failures Accumulated Into One Big Storm

Gonzalez quotes me: “Chuck DeVore, vice president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, took a similar line as Abbott. ‘Blackouts are a feature of the push to have more unreliable renewables on the grid,’ he tweeted, adding that energy subsidies are bad, too.”

Gonzalez quotes from ERCOT, the very grid operator responsible for much of Texas’s disaster, noting that, “wind shutdowns accounted for less than 13 percent of the outages. ‘It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system…’” But focusing on the days of the power outage is a strawman. Texas’s energy history didn’t start with February’s blackouts. Rather, it is the culmination of 20 years of bad policy.

It’s true that of 31,000 megawatts of installed mostly wind and some solar capacity in Texas, only about 300 megawatts were producing at a critical time during the storm. It’s also true that not much was expected from the unreliables—they generally don’t do well in adverse conditions.

Yes, some 16,000 megawatts of thermal (gas, coal, and nuclear) went offline early morning on Feb. 15, with another 14,000 megawatts offline due to maintenance to prepare for Texas’s long, hot summer. But the focus on what happened just after 1 a.m. on Feb. 15 misses how we got to this point over decades.

Texas Has Substituted Unreliable for Reliable Backups

In the last five years alone, Texas added some 20,000 megawatts of installed capacity of wind and solar while losing a net of 4,000 megawatts of coal and natural gas. This fact alone meant that had every thermal plant operated flawlessly during the height of the polar vortex, Texas still would have been short some 2,000 megawatts of potential demand—a new record in a state that is used to setting electricity consumption records in the summer.

Texas has rapidly become the nation’s leader in wind power largely due to a federal tax incentive called the Production Tax Credit (PTC). First enacted in 1992, the PTC expired in June 1999. It was extended for two more years in late 1999 with an expiration of Dec. 31, 2001. The PTC was expected to be dead by 2001 when, in 1999, the Texas legislature debated and passed its electricity deregulation bill, SB 7. SB 7 went into effect on Jan. 1, 2002. The PTC lay dormant until it was again revived by Congress in March 2002.

The PTC has a significant share of blame in Texas’s recent blackouts in that it incentivizes wind generators to push electricity into the grid even when an abundance of wind, typically in the middle of the night, pushes wholesale electricity prices into negative territory. Wind generators, some owned by foreign governments, can pay the grid to take their power and still make money because the PTC pays them federal tax money for every megawatt they produce. This economic distortion, deepened by Texas’s own property tax abatements for wind and solar, have acted to discourage investment in reliable thermal power plants.

This isn’t the free market in operation, as The New York Times and Gonzalez allege—quite the contrary.

Lack of Weatherization Isn’t the Whole Story

So, about those thermal plant failures, were they due to a lack of weatherization, as the unreliables lobbyists and Gonzalez suggest, or was something else at play? In sworn testimony before the Texas Legislature, it became very clear that cold weather failures were only a portion of the problem, likely less than half.

Most of the thermal plants either tripped offline due to power grid frequency fluctuations—likely ERCOT’s fault for not load shedding quickly enough—or because they were starved of fuel. Importantly, neither problem would have been solved by billions of dollars more in weatherization.

Gonzalez moves next to the unfortunate stories of Texans who used their ability to select their retail electric provider—about 80 percent of Texans within the ERCOT grid have retail choice—to choose Griddy as their provider. These customers were slammed with bills that in some cases exceeded $10,000.

But context is key. ERCOT manages the flow of electric power to 26 million Texas customers, with about 7.5 million meters in that region having retail choice. Griddy served about 30,000 meters, or 0.4 percent of the competitive market. Griddy filed for bankruptcy on March 15 and the $29 million in high electric charges it passed on to its customers will be forgiven.

Lastly, Gonzales repeats the false refrain that Texas’s winter storm of 2011 was “nearly identical” to the St. Valentine’s Day storm of 2021. But February’s storm was substantially worse, and the duration of the cold lasted far longer.

In San Antonio, for example, the 2011 storm saw a low of 19F with temperatures remaining below freezing for two days. In 2021, the low dipped to 9F, with temperatures below freezing for four solid days. Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio broke seven record lows over three days during the event—not at all “identical” circumstances.

Even in the face of a record-breaking storm, most of the power failures can be traced to human error—both in regulatory management of the grid and in a failure to account for how subsidies encourage over-building unreliable wind and solar while discouraging the construction of new thermal plants.

Weakening the Grid for Politics Hurts Texans

So, when Gonzalez concludes by observing that, “the bigger picture comes into view as an indictment of a bought, unresponsive ruling class, weaseling its way from one bubble to the next, letting everyday Americans socialize the cost one way or another,” he’s right, after a fashion, but not in the way he says.

Rather, Texans have suffered as the unreliables lobby has linked up with huge industrials to provide subsidized wind power while destabilizing Texas’s grid. Manufacturers get two things out of this deal: cheap electricity and virtue signaling about their “no-carbon” footprint.

Meanwhile, the cost of reliability gets pushed to everyday Texans—socialized—with the tab going up as more extreme measures come into play to keep the lights, heat, or air conditioning on in a grid with increasingly more unreliables and less thermal year after year.

Unfortunately, Texas—and California and the other 12 states on the Western Interconnection grid—are at high risk for blackouts this summer for much the same reason: Texas has overbuilt wind while California has overbuilt solar. Both have placed enormous financial pressure on reliable thermal generation, causing many thermal power plants to be retired prematurely or not built at all.

The more dependent the entire U.S. grid becomes on unreliables, the more it is increasingly at risk of blackouts. One way to prevent this is to assign a value to reliability and resiliency, forcing intermittent sources of electricity to pay for the cost of ensuring backup—whether through massive battery farms or via contracting with thermal plants that may remain idle until needed—thus ending the dangerous fiction that unreliables are cheap.

As a postscript, Public Utility Commission of Texas Chairman DeAnn Walker resigned on March 1 with the other two commissioners tendering their resignations soon after. At ERCOT, seven of its 14 board members, including all five of the nonprofit’s out-of-state members, have resigned and its CEO was fired.

Meanwhile, the Texas legislature is considering two bills—SB 1278 by Sen. Kelly Hancock and HB 4466 by Rep. Phil King—to assign the cost of rebuilding grid reliability to the wind and solar installations that have done so much to undermine it, leaving Texans shivering in the dark.

You’re Not Antiracist If You Hide Crimes Due To The Perpetrators’ Race,"In the wake of a follower of black nationalist leader Louis Farrakhan murdering a Capitol Police officer this month, corporate media outlets are declining to connect his actions to his extremist beliefs. This appears to be becoming the standard for such cases. A look at the deeper ecosystem of media and narrative construction helps explain why.

In response to an Andrew Sullivan article about the recent Atlanta killings in which he noted black Americans are overrepresented in FBI hate-crime offender data, the Daily Kos’s David Neiwert informed the world that using per-capita rates in discussions on black criminality is a “favorite statistical manipulation” by white nationalists, including incarcerated mass murderer Dylann Roof.

The use of “as a percentage of the population” crime numbers to suggest blacks are more likely to be criminals is a favorite statistical manipulation of white nationalists, especially the whole “Color of Crime” crowd that inspired Dylann Roof.https://t.co/iIAI1Tk6bz — David Neiwert (@DavidNeiwert) March 21, 2021

Neiwert attempted to support his point by linking to a report he authored while at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) a few years back and posting: “White people are by far the demographic most likely to commit hate crimes.”

He is indeed right: Whites do commit the majority of hate crimes in America (53 percent of them); far more than do blacks (23 percent). Of course, without acknowledging that whites are 60 percent of the population and blacks 12, this doesn’t illuminate a whole lot.

Neither did a report of Neiwert’s from 2017, in which he downplayed Islamic terrorism cases from 2008 to 2016 because they were less frequent than white, right-wing ones (63 cases versus 115). By failing to adjust for U.S. population differences, though (3.5 million versus 237 million), Neiwert kept from readers that, by his own count, Muslims were 38 times more likely than whites to commit a domestic terrorist act.

Neiwert, a veteran, award-winning journalist, surely knows all this. He also knows that whites in America likely don’t commit 53 percent of all hate crimes.

Since he has written detailed reports burrowing into the U.S. Department of Justice’s statistics on this issue for the SPLC, Neiwert is no doubt aware the agency lumps Hispanic offenders in with white ones when reporting its “white” offender rates—something they curiously don’t do for the victim category. Considering Hispanic general crime rates are higher than that of whites, it’s likely the 53 percent attribution is inflated in relation to whites.

But what’s more important about the episode is the trend it helps reveal: Long-time “antiracist” advocates, like Neiwert and the SPLC, unmasking themselves as the kind of racists they supposedly decry. It’s a trend that seems to grow more alarming by the week.

Take the SPLC’s recent decision to stop labeling anti-white, black separatist organizations as “hate groups.” The organization didn’t name the groups they delisted, but the article features a picture of Farrakhan and quotes him. They reasoned: “While these groups can be virulently anti-white, this prejudice does not represent the same threat as white supremacy in America.” So, suggests the long-time “civil rights” advocate, it’s okay to be anti-white, even virulently so.

Elsewhere, they admonished the FBI’s supposed “false and misleading contention regarding threats from Black separatists… [because such groups express] valid anger against very real historical and systemic oppression.”

From Black Panther violence in the post-civil rights era, the Nation of Islam’s “Zebra Killings” in 1973 (in which more than 50 white people are believed to have been killed), or the black Muslim “D.C. Sniper” who admitted trying to kickstart a race war; to the recent antisemitic murders by the Black Hebrew Israelites and the extreme violence linked to Black Lives Matter: all of this points to the FBI’s monitoring of black nationalist developments having a pretty firm basis in reality.

Before this, black nationalist groups on the SPLC’s hate-group list had been growing four-fold since 2000, outnumbering white ones on a 2-to-1 basis. Most would find this surprising, considering the attention devoted to ethno-nationalist groups from the mainstream media and the SPLC is nearly always on whites only.

Other “anti-hate” groups can be just as racially discriminatory. Take the SPLC’s partner in Canada, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. Twice its leaders have been forced to admit that, despite their general antiracism mandate, it really is only white people they’re after.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is another “civil rights” advocate that’s curiously racially selective. In 2019, Business Insider published a scathing report about the group’s fraudulent hate-crime reporting—which, they concluded, is intended solely to scaremonger—appropriately comparing them to “ultranationalists” who like “cherry-picking statistics.”

Specifically, when the report’s authors scrutinized the ADL’s tally of more than 600 “extremist violence” incidents between 2009 and 2018 (a tiny number considering 3,300 violent crimes take place in America daily), it found that only 200 could be credibly tied to extremism. While this alone was a big enough indictment against the ADL and the journalists who parrot them, Business Insider failed to highlight another big finding: the source of the inflation.

Among the ADL’s four categories of violence—Islamist, left-wing, right-wing, and white supremacist extremism—researchers found that the first two were more or less accurate; 85 of the 88 Islamist incidents checked out as properly labeled, as did 24 of the 26 leftist ones. Where the ADL was inflating things was almost entirely in the “white, right-wing” areas.

As the researchers noted, among the 300 incidents of right-wing extremism during this period, when reviewed, only 131 were found to truly fit the bill. White supremacist extremism was even more inflated: just 57 incidents of the 199 claimed by the ADL credibly had such a motivation.

That the ADL’s “hate inflation” fell only on whites and right-wingers; that the spirit of scrutiny apparently grips the SPLC when reviewing some racial agendas but not others; and that people like Neiwert pass over basic facts to pursue anti-white narratives can be summed up in one word: bigotry. It should be called out as such by conservatives and independents whenever they see it.

Trevor Noah: US Policing Is A 'Rotten Tree' Made To Exploit Black People,"Trevor Noah of “The Daily Show” said policing in the United States doesn’t just consist of “bad apples” but is a “rotten tree” designed to exploit poor people.

After watching the footage of multiple police encounters when a “human being is being treated like trash,” Noah said he’s not convinced there are “good apples” willing to stand up to the law enforcement officers who use “chokeholds,” “excessive force,” and “violence in their words and their actions to the people they’re meant to be protecting and serving.”

“If we’re meant to believe that the police system in America, the system of policing itself, is not fundamentally broken, then we would need to see good apples,” Noah said. “And by the way, I’m not saying that there are no good policemen, don’t get me wrong. I’m asking where the good apples are, and what I mean by that is where are the cops who are stopping the cop from putting their knee on George Floyd’s neck?”

“We’re not dealing with bad apples, we’re dealing with a rotten tree.” Trevor addresses Daunte Wright, Caron Nazario, and the system that protects bad cops. pic.twitter.com/4nBk7QYWEg — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) April 14, 2021

Noah bypassed the fact that corporate media tends to report on the bad cop narrative far more than highlighting good officers to instead complain that police don’t seem to have the same reaction to killings that black communities do.

“It’s funny how we live in a society where people who will defend these cops at all costs will say, ‘Oh, black on black crime’ and ‘You see these people in their communities, they don’t care,’ but go to any disenfranchised community in America and you will find people marching against that same crime,” Noah said, noting that many of them will call 911. “But I don’t seem to see that with the cops. We don’t see a mass uprising of police say, ‘Let’s root out these people.’ We don’t see videos of police officers stopping the other cop from pushing an old man at a Black Lives Matter protest or from beating up a kid in the street with a baton. We don’t see that.”

This lack of reaction, Noah believes, isn’t because there aren’t “good people in the police force,” but because it goes against what he says is the design of their jobs: to suppress poor people.

“The system in policing is doing exactly what it’s meant to do in America, and that is to keep poor people in their place. Who happens to be the most poor people in America? Black people,” Noah said.

This system, Noah said, monetizes black people by imprisoning them. The “tree that was planted is bearing the fruit that it was intended to,” he continued.

“It’s a system, not broken. It’s working the way it’s designed to work,” Noah said. “And once you realize that, I feel like you get to a place where you go, ‘Oh, we’re not dealing with bad apples. We’re dealing with a rotten tree that happens to grow good apples.’”

IndoctriNation: Top U.S. High School Pushes Racist Activism On Students,"FAIRFAX COUNTY, Va. — Late last month, Suparna Dutta’s son, a student at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, started sending his mother distressing videos from a mandatory lesson straight out of controversial critical race theory — all in the name of “socio-emotional learning.”

The lesson centered a Netflix film, “13th,” with controversial activist and Communist Party member Angela Davis and a biased narrative about policing in the United States. While all discrimination must be eliminated in policing, the film has this odd takeaway: “Criminals are constitutionally deprived of freedom.”

Also unsettling, the PowerPoint slides had the distinct bright yellow three stripes that are the official brand of Black Lives Matter, the multimillion-dollar global enterprise. The slides included a key BLM mantra, “Racism as a structure,” with the menacing oversized finger of a white man over a cowering young black man.

For about 36 minutes, teachers lectured the students—who are about 70 percent Asian, 10 percent black, Hispanic, and multiracial, and 20 percent white—about the critical race theory concept of “intersectionality” and called out the mostly minority students of color for their alleged “racism,” stating without any evidence: “At T.J., the lack of diversity and informed students has perpetuated microaggressions and casual racism.”

In a videotaped message accompanying the lesson, Anant Das, an alumnus from the local activist TJ Alumni Action Group, scolded the students for salsa dancing at an international night celebration, which he called cultural “appropriation.” Teachers also led a bizarre discussion on “what stereotypes might you have about your own culture.” They pushed activism, stating: “Ways to address racism can include being upfront and vocal or pushing for social change through your own actions.”

The “Extra Resources” included a reference to “Black Lives Matter,” with a link to the official website for the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.

The “Black Lives Matter” link in the slide takes students straight to BlackLivesMatter.com, with snappy invitations: “Join the Global Movement” and a sign up for “periodic text messages from Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.” With just one click, T.J. students were directed to the political ambitions of the Black Lives Matter PAC, with its list of 2020 election endorsements, including specific politicians, including a specific school board member, Shayla Adams-Stafford, in nearby Prince George’s County, Md.

Enraged, parents, including me, questioned the school’s activist principal, Ann Bonitatibus. She wrote to the T.J. Parent Teacher Student Association president claiming, “There is no critical race theory training with students.” She deflected responsibility for the teaching, calling it “a project initiated and created by students for students.”

But 200-plus pages of internal school emails, disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, reveal that on Aug. 19, 2020, Bonitatibus sent the T.J. “Equity Team,” including two assistant principals, a message that she had met with student government leaders about a plan to show the “13th” documentary in summer 2021, along with a conversation on “anti-racism.” She wrote, “I shared with them that their idea doesn’t necessarily need to wait until next school year. There could be a way to think about their proposal or a variation of it for this year.”

Over the next seven months, the T.J. principal, two assistant principals, the director of student services, at least three teachers, several counselors, and a Fairfax County Public Schools “equity” officer directly edited, wrote, and reviewed all of the content for the lesson, masked as “socio-emotional learning.”

One set of stakeholders never consulted: parents. That’s why I helped start a new organization, Parents Defending Education, fighting indoctrination in K-12 schools, so we could file FOIA requests like the one I sent Fairfax County Public Schools, revealing the complicity of the principal, teachers, and staff in creating the ideological lesson that our students got.

Meanwhile, over the past school year, we faced a superintendent, school board, and principal leading a crusade to racially alter the school’s demographics, with the school district abandoning the school’s merit-based, race-blind test in December to gerrymander the admissions process so fewer Asians and more black and Hispanic students would make the cut to attend the advanced math and science school.

The stealth lesson underscores several serious issues vexing schools today and the future of America. It reveals how school officials circumvent parents as they move aggressively to indoctrinate students in K-12 schools from neighboring Loudoun County, Va., to California.

It also serves as a cautionary tale on how how important it is that parents assert three rights most districts promise to secure: the right to inspect curriculum, spelled out in Fairfax County, for example, under “Policies and Regulations 3002-3011,”; the right to opt-out students from certain teachings, including on topics “sensitive in nature”; and the right to have “controversial issues” discussed “impartially and objectively,” a point spelled out in Fairfax County under Regulation 3280.4.

Contradicting these promises, the “Extra Resources” in the lesson also included a link to the organization Showing Up for Racial Justice, which believes “none of us can be free until we end white supremacy.” It featured on the homepage a very problematic and reductionist page, “The Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture.”

This displayed “a list of characteristics of white supremacy culture,” including “perfectionism,” a “sense of urgency,” “defensiveness,” “worship of the written word” like memos, “either/or thinking,” “power hoarding,” “individualism,” “objectivity” and—finally, a very disturbing notion to present to K-12 students—“right to comfort.”

The final bullet point led to a shocking video, “On Solidarity with the Black Lives Matter Movement” by a first-generation Korean-American, Kaiti Yoo. She flashed the image of a Time magazine cover with smiling young students beside the headline, “Those Asian-American Whiz Kids,” as she waxed on about learning to “justify our existence through our work, our grades, our accomplishments.”

Yoo’s video laid out a central narrative of critical race theory ideologues like Ibram Kendi and 1619 Project lead Nikole Hannah-Jones, who argue blacks and Asians “don’t experience this country in the same way” because Asians didn’t come to the United States as slaves. It laid out the guilt trip thrust on Asians from critical race theory activists to support radical black goals as the only way to support “justice.” The same theme was present in T.J. lesson materials such as the slide below.

At 30 seconds, the film featured an image of the American flag with a sign in front of it that reads, “The American Dream is Over.” It’s a biased, problematic, and shame-based video for anyone pursuing the “American Dream” without blind support for the BLM movement. It’s wildly inappropriate, unhealthy, and potentially emotionally damaging to thrust on students at a mostly Asian school caught in a race war of the principal’s making.

The next “socio-emotional learning” blocks will be April 21, May 5, May 21, and June 2, according to staff. Back home, Dutta sent a dispatch to the principal. She had one remedy for the indoctrination: the principal’s immediate resignation. Her subject line: “Dereliction of duty.”

Fraternal Order Of Police Blasts LeBron James For ‘Gaslighting’ Attack On Cop Who Saved Black Girl From Stabbing Assault,"The National Fraternal Order of Police condemned LeBron James for using his influence to call for an attack on the police officer who shot and killed a teenage girl wielding a knife to save the life of another black girl.

“@KingJames, with his vast resources & influence, should educate himself and, frankly, has a responsibility to do so, on the facts before weighing in. This is disgraceful & extremely reckless,” the FOP wrote on Twitter. “The officer saved a young girl’s life. No amount of gaslighting will change that fact.”

In a now-deleted tweet, the famous NBA player posted a picture of the alleged Columbus officer involved in the fatal shooting captioned with the words “YOU’RE NEXT” and “#ACCOUNTABILITY.” James removed the post but it still received more than 6,000 retweets in the short amount of time it circulated Twitter.

The White House, aided by the corporate media, also spun the incident to claim without evidence that the officer who shot the black teenage girl was motivated by racism.

“She was a child,” the White House wrote in a Wednesday statement on the shooting. “We know that police violence disproportionately impacts Black and Latino people and communities and that black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police violence.”

Bodycam footage of the Tuesday shooting that occurred shortly after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty in George Floyd’s death, however, shows Ma’Khia Bryant, believed to be 15 or 16, charging two people with a knife. As she moved towards another black girl, the police officer called for everyone to get down and then fired off four shots. Bryant was transported to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.

“We know based on this footage the officer took action to protect another young girl in our community,” Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther told reporters.

Staples Won't Condemn Lebron’s Attack On Cop Who Saved Black Girl,"National office supplies retailer Staples, which owns the naming rights to the arena that hosts the Los Angeles Lakers, refused to denounce Lakers star Lebron James’ targeted attempt to incite violence against a police officer who saved the life of a black teenage girl.

James has once more stirred up racialized political controversy. James has since deleted a tweet in which he posted a picture with the caption “YOU’RE NEXT #Accountability” in regard to the Columbus, Ohio police officer who on Tuesday appears to have protected a black teen from being stabbed by another by shooting the assailant as the teens fought.

Police officers convicted in the court of public opinion over applying force to black Americans have received death threats and in the past year cities across the nation have been looted, trashed, and burned in riots over such incidents.

A high-profile ESPN on-air employee who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Federalist in an interview that “it’s a very dangerous thing that the most prominent player in the sport [NBA] is doing something like this.”

“Is he backing [his tweet] up with statistics, or is it just based on emotion? It’s obviously based on an argument that is the popular argument to make. How is that not a threatening tweet?” The employee said. “This is where, you know, especially people in sports lose a lot of their fans. Kind of like this selective outrage. David Stern [the former NBA commissioner] must be spinning in his grave.”

Spokeswoman Julie Haff for the Republican Party of Los Angeles said James’s comments were “irresponsible and very counterproductive for any conversation related to policing or race relations.”

“Sending out a tweet like that is just very irresponsible,” Haff added.

Staples Center, which paid the Lakers $100 million for endorsement and naming rights in 1999, had no problem involving itself in other political controversies when it was bound to earn plaudits from the left. Since acquiring the arena’s rights, Staples has provided a venue for the Lakers, in addition to the Los Angeles Clippers and other minor league teams.

Data from 2014 showed earnings of $345 million for the arena, making it the number one venue in the United States by revenue. The Staples Center carried a price tag of $70.5 million in taxpayer money when it was built. The publicly financed stadium’s sponsor is clearly comfortable weighing in on political issues — but not in weighing in when its most lucrative client’s employee openly incites violence.

The Federalist emailed and called Staples after James deleted the tweet to understand if it agrees the NBA star was out of line. The company responded, “Staples stands behind our corporate values, which include respect for all people.”

Staples Stores tweeted its support for “black communities” during the summer of Black Lives Matter’s rioting and looting, but is unwilling to voice its support for the black community at a time a police officer ought to be commended for saving a black life. James perhaps realized his tweet was in poor taste, given his deletion, but one of the key corporations earning millions due to a contract with him has not.

“Staples stands with our Black colleagues, neighbors and friends,” the company said in a statement in June. “We do not and will never tolerate hatred, prejudice or discrimination. We are committed to supporting Black communities in both learning and working, and are donating funds and resources to both Black teachers and minority-owned small businesses. We must do better as a community and a nation, and Staples is committing to doing so.”

The Federalist also contacted The Staples Center arena directly to receive a comment, but did not hear back after being transferred to a few different individuals over the phone.

The corporation’s silence instead of support for the black teenager who gets to live another day thanks to this police officer speaks volumes about its so-called position of being “committed to supporting Black communities.”

On Wednesday evening following the deletion of his tweet, James blamed “the entire system” and said he is “so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY.” The Lakers star essentially doubled down and declined to admit that his prior tweet calling out a police officer was unethical and with a high potential to cause violence.

I’m so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate -This isn’t about one officer. it’s about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism. I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY — LeBron James (@KingJames) April 21, 2021

“LeBron and others live to promote the victim narrative, so much so they will post without any verification if it meets their self-fulfilling narrative,” Brandon Tatum, a former police officer in Tuscon, Arizona, who hosts “The Officer Tatum” show on YouTube, told The Federalist. “This goes to show these celebrity athletes are out of touch. I believe the only reason he deleted it was because the obvious nature of self-defense could make him liable in a defamation lawsuit.”

The ESPN employee added that LeBron “is beholden to the league itself and to its players who are African American,” and that leftist virtue-signaling from corporations like the NBA “has backfired from a financial standpoint.”

“[The NBA] is taking cues from LeBron and ESPN wants to maintain a good relationship with LeBron,” the employee added.

If Americans Should Pay Reparations Is Thornier Than You Might Think,"After being first proposed more than 30 years ago by Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, the 116th Congress of the United States voted last week to advance H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-American Act. Aided by the Democratic Party’s control of the executive and legislative branches of government, the current sentiment in the country regarding racial justice and equity may provide the bill’s proponents the opening they seek.

To start, it’s worth noting reparations are not without precedent. The United States paid reparations to Japanese-Americans as restitution for their internment during World War II. It also made reparations to American Indians for seizing their land and mismanaging natural resources.

Yet paying reparations to black Americans who are the descendants of slaves is likely to prove more contentious for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which is the vast length of time that has passed since slavery ended, coupled with the fact no living person has participated in the heinous practice. Indeed, as it violates our fundamental sense of fairness and justice, we tend not to visit the sins of the father upon the son in this country.

Furthermore, while all the relevant demographic data isn’t reliable, it is safe to assert the majority of non-black Americans are descendants of individuals that immigrated to the United States after the end of the Civil War in 1865.

Nonetheless, this issue of the time that has elapsed since slavery ended is not dispositive. To wit, the return of art stolen by the Nazis to its rightful owners would be justified even if centuries passed before the reunification occurred. As such, I don’t believe a brash, reflexive dismissal of the question of reparations is advisable or necessarily cathartic for the country.

There are seemingly two overarching questions pertaining to reparations. The first abstract question concerns whether reparations are “owed” at all.

On the surface, it would seem difficult to contest the claim that uncompensated slave labor conferred substantial benefits on slave owners and, despite the ravaging of the Southern economy by the Civil War, a portion of the fruits of that slave labor was bequeathed to future generations. There is no material difference between art stolen by the Nazis passed down through the generations and wealth accumulated through slave labor passed along through family inheritance. Yet, in any case, the payment of reparations should begin (and perhaps end) with those entities that directly benefitted or suffered from Southern chattel slavery.

Assuming the first question (on whether reparations are owed) is answered in the affirmative, the second question is of a forensic accounting nature. To wit, who should be paid reparations, how much should they be paid, and by whom? It’s become common for opponents of reparations to go directly to this second question and contend that because it would be nearly impossible to sort these matters out in a coherent manner, the entire question of reparations is moot.

Yet I submit that the first question is germane even if the second question poses near-insurmountable difficulties. Nor does the question of reparations being owed turn on whether the payment of reparations would help or harm black Americans writ large. Indeed, a similar question was raised in the state of Israel concerning whether it would be demeaning to the Jewish people — in the sense that they would suffer a loss of dignity — if they accepted German reparation payments.

Another dimension to the forensic accounting question is the prospect that reparations may have already been paid, in whole or in part, in the form of various currencies. For example, while estimates vary, more than 400,000 Union soldiers died in the Civil War. Indeed, Union victory expedited the end of the institution of slavery in this country. The loss of those Union soldiers certainly inflicted an enormous economic and personal cost on their families and subsequent generations of those families.

It is also worth noting the large number of social programs instituted in the United States to confer benefits on black Americans, rationalized in large measure by enduring socio-economic disparities between black and white Americans that some contend have their origins in institutional racism. These programs include but are not limited to “affirmative action,” set-aside contracts for minority-owned businesses, racial preferences in college admissions, and various government financial assistance programs.

How should these programs, and the financial benefits they confer on black Americans, be entered, if at all, into the reparations calculus? Certainly, if an advantage is conferred on a black American, then a disadvantage is conferred on a white American, and such policies have tangible, economic consequences.

The “social equity” question concerning reparations is arguably the most challenging. Where is the social equity in forcing individuals who neither participated in slavery nor benefitted financially, directly or indirectly, from it to pay reparations to the descendants of slaves?

Opinions will differ on the merits of tasking the current generation with paying for the sins of past generations. In this respect, it is noteworthy that Germany has encountered significant problems with Nazi sympathizers and white supremacists since the end of World War II. Are these problems attributable in part to the perceived injustice at being forced to pay reparations for crimes in which they did not partake?

Some claim there can never be racial harmony in this country without paying reparations to black Americans who are the descendants of slaves. A no less important question concerns whether there can be racial harmony in this country if those reparations are paid by those who have no culpability in the institution of slavery nor benefitted financially from it. This is the proverbial Catch-22.

The question of paying reparations to descendants of former slaves is destined to be one of the more provocative issues of our time. It is natural for a just nation to want to cleanse its soul and this entails acknowledging past transgressions. To its credit, Germany recognized that the horrific crimes of the country’s past could not be erased and, instead, went to great pains to memorialize them appropriately.

The outstanding issue for the American people is the penitence they are ultimately willing to pay. The social equity question looms prominently in the reparations debate for rightly inquiring whether a nation should seek to remedy one injustice by creating another.

If these reparations are indeed paid, yet economic disparities among black and white Americans persist, should we also expect future claims that the amount of the reparations was somehow inadequate? Only time will tell if the American people are willing to write a check, but rest assured that they’re not prepared to sign a blank one.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/23/the-question-of-whether-americans-should-pay-reparations-is-thornier-than-you-might-think/,2021-04-23
"If Black Lives Matter Gives A Crap About Black Lives, It Will Retract Its Ma’Khia Bryant Statement","Black Lives Matter, as an organization far more interested in deconstructing the nuclear family, expanding transgender dogma, and dismantling institutions than in actually improving black lives, has frequently shown that its semantically strategic name is a misnomer. After the police shooting of Ma’Khia Bryant, the organization released a statement that unmistakably confirmed it: BLM doesn’t actually think all black lives matter — only those who fit its narrative.

“At the exact same time the verdict of Derek Chauvin was being read for murdering George Floyd, police wasted no time in senselessly taking another Black child,” the organization said in reference to the teenager who died in a fatal police shooting last week in Columbus, Ohio. “Ma’Khia Bryant. We say her name.”

The statement continued, asserting as fact that Bryant had called police for help, although investigators are probing and haven’t confirmed who made the 911 call. The claim that it was Bryant came from family members — the same family members who said the 16-year-old knife-wielding girl “promoted peace,” had a “motherly nature,” “didn’t have no knife or nothing in her hand,” and was a “15-year-old girl,” making them less-than-reliable sources.

“Columbus police officer Nicholas Reardon showed up and shot this 16-year-old child point blank within a matter of seconds,” BLM said. “Another Black life stolen with no regard.”

What the Marxist and race-baiting organization failed to note was that between the time “Nicholas Reardon showed up” and when he discharged his firearm, Bryant lunged at two of the other black girls who were present, pinning one of them against a car and cocking her arm back with a knife in her hand ready to strike. It wasn’t “with no regard” that Reardon fired his gun. It was precisely to save another black life.

Of course “Ma’Khia Bryant’s life mattered,” as BLM says, but so does the life of her would-be victim. If Black Lives Matter really cared about black lives, it would recognize that thanks to Officer Reardon’s brave and decisive action, he spared at least one black girl from a brutal stabbing.

Law enforcement acting ethically and responsibly to protect and serve black communities, however, doesn’t exactly gin up enthusiasm for Black Lives Matter’s efforts to defund the police. Stories of cops saving black girls from grisly violence don’t incite the kind of revolutionary violence that turns cities into hellscapes, garnering national attention for so-called racial justice. Honest depictions of white officers saving black lives won’t prompt Americans to click that “donate” button on the BLM website.

The organization did the same thing with Jacob Blake. Did the lives of his black children matter? Why didn’t the organization have anything to say about David Dorn, the black police officer who was murdered during the deadly riots of 2020? Didn’t his life matter more than the TVs looters were trying to steal? BLM claims to advocate for immigrants and other minorities too. Is it going to say anything about Mohammad Anwar, the 66-year-old Pakistani immigrant who was killed in a brutal carjacking in Washington D.C. last month, allegedly by two black teens who were captured on video?

Ma’Khia Bryant was a human being, created in God’s image, with likely much life left to live. But that isn’t why her life mattered to BLM, an organization that makes its millions and perhaps billions by exploiting pain, outright lying about the facts of police shootings, and ignoring the black lives that aren’t quite as lucrative.

“The call for Black lives to matter is a rallying cry for ALL Black lives striving for liberation,” Black Lives Matter announces on its website. But it’s propaganda. The only black lives that matter to BLM are those they can monetize — and the “girl in pink” isn’t one of them.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/26/if-black-lives-matter-gives-a-crap-about-black-lives-it-will-retract-its-makhia-bryant-statement/,2021-04-26
White House Declares Everything A 'Crisis' Except The One At The Border,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki walked back President Joe Biden’s comments last week claiming the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border is a “crisis.” Psaki said, “The president does not feel that children coming to our border seeking refuge from violence, economic hardships, and other dire circumstances is a crisis.”

The Biden administration has continually refused to acknowledge that significantly higher numbers of migrants coming to the United States constitutes a threat or surge, but has swiftly characterized numerous other things as crises. For starters, there is an immigration crisis ensuing in America.

More than 172,000 migrants were encountered at the border in March alone, compared to a little more than 34,000 migrants encountered in March 2020. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas noted in March that the United States remains on track to encounter more illegals than in the last 20 years. Recent Customs and Border Patrol Protection data shared with Fox News showed the Del Rio Sector encountering 434 percent more migrants than in fiscal-year 2020, and Rio Grande Valley Sector encountering 313 percent more.

This month, a document obtained by the Washington Examiner showed the Biden administration is spending close to $352 a night to provide beds to an estimated 80,000 migrant families until September. The effort is part of an $87 million contract awarded to Family Endeavors, a San Antonio, Texas organization led by a former senior official on the Biden transition team, Andrew Lorenzen-Strait. Illegals need no documentation to be released into the United States after their three-night stay, which is complete with amenities.

Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting digitally with top Mexican officials and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador next month. The administration’s response and messaging pales in comparison to the White House’s centralization of other issues of far less (or no) importance to the American people.

Central America

Psaki walked back Biden’s prior claim about the border being a crisis by suggesting the president had been referring to Central America.

“He does feel that the crisis in Central America, the dire circumstances that many are fleeing from, that that is a situation that we need to spend our time, our effort on and we need to address it if we’re going to prevent more of an influx of migrants from coming in years to come,” she said.

In other words, Biden will not acknowledge that his policies (such as the elimination of Remain in Mexico) are directly contributing to the problems transpiring in Central America — where drug cartels smuggle minors to the border and often rape them along the way. The White House is viewing the effect, while refusing to acknowledge the causation.

Climate

Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of his presidency. The Heritage Foundation found U.S. participation in that agreement will cost the average American family of four $20,000 and the GDP $2.5 trillion by 2035. The coalition calls for eliminating pivotal natural resources, like natural gas and coal, that power 80 percent of the globe.

From the beginning, Biden used the term “crisis” about climate. His executive order signed in January was titled “Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad” and claimed the “Climate Crises” must be “at the center of United States foreign policy and national security.”

Regardless of the claim peddled by the supposed “experts” in a 2019 United Nations report, climate change is not a crisis, nor will lead to mass extinction of humans. As publisher of ClimateDepot.com Marc Morano notes in his new book “Green Fraud,” “[g]lobal temperatures have been holding nearly steady for almost two decades, according to satellites from the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and the University of Alabama at Huntsville.” In addition, “studies have found the Medieval Warm Period and the Roman Warming Period were as warm or warmer than current temperatures.”

Morano highlights the clear facts in his book, which are that data is far more than scanty on this supposed climate “crisis,” but worse that the Left has manufactured a “crisis” due to its interests in depopulation, globalism, and sticking to alarmism favoring security like in the implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns. The environment is not exactly the first thing that comes to mind in terms of crises. The border does, though.

Gun Control

Psaki told Yahoo News journalist Julia Munslow last week, “There’s no question it’s a public health emergency,” when referring to the supposed need for gun control policies.

“It’s a public health crisis …You know, I think the reason that the president feels it’s so important to move forward with gun reform measures, with gun safety measures is because of the trauma that he’s seeing,” she said. “…There’s no reason anyone needs to have an assault weapon. There’s no reason that there shouldn’t be universal background checks to ensure guns don’t get in the hands of people who should not have those guns.”

Once more, a Democrat administration ignores truth in light of anti-constitutionalist agendas. Many might remember a significant Department of Justice report in 2019 found 90 percent of firearms used in crime are obtained through illegal means. But this only further backed up the reality that people legally bearing arms is no crisis to a functioning republic. But a government seeking to illegitimately violate this right might constitute a crisis.

The White House is correct about the law and order issue. If Biden truly cared about public safety, though, he would condemn Black Lives Matter and Antifa — who rioted, looted, murdered, and inflicted chaos on American cities for an entire year.

Black Maternal Health Crisis

In April, the White House claimed there is a “black maternal health crisis” due to “systemic racism.”

“The Biden-Harris Administration continues that commitment to reducing unacceptably high maternal mortality and morbidity rates and to tackling health disparities that are rooted in systemic racism,” a press release said. “That’s why today, the President issued the first-ever presidential proclamation calling on all Americans to recognize the importance of addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity in this country.”

Indeed, there is a significant health crisis in the black community — but it has nothing to do with systemic racism. 117,626 black children were killed due to abortion in one year, as the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. This comprised 33.6 percent of all abortions. The left remains mum on this crisis.

Racial Inequity

“The irony is, we have four crises,” Biden said in December prior to being sworn in, ” …the third crisis is the inequity that exists, in the racial inequity that exists.”

After the conviction of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, the president re-upped the “systemic racism” language. “It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism the Vice President just referred to — the systemic racism that is a stain on our nation’s soul,” said Biden, “the knee on the neck of justice for Black Americans; the profound fear and trauma, the pain, the exhaustion that Black and brown Americans experience every single day.”

Biden continues to peddle the notion that America is inherently racist and must be cured of its whiteness — inadequately pointing to one government institution actively discriminating against black Americans — while ignoring the greatest crisis facing our time. It’s happening at the border.

"8 Years After Their Kids Were Murdered, Two Mothers Still Await Justice","It’s a scenario that tragically plays out across the country every day. Innocent young women — wives and ex-wives and girlfriends — are killed by their partners and ex-partners, leaving families torn apart, children motherless, and communities shattered.

While corporate media focuses on black men and women who die in altercations with police, thousands of black American men and women nationwide suffer the loss of loved ones in other violent ways and they also deserve justice and recognition of their pain. The families of Kervina Woods and Donyea Williams — murdered nearly eight years ago — are still grieving and seeking justice.

Kervina, 24, and Donyea, 27 were shot to death by Kervina’s estranged husband, Beonridge Bradley III, 28, on Nov. 17, 2013 in Selma, Alabama. Bradley was arrested Nov. 18, 2013 — the day both mothers found out their children were lying dead in Kervina’s apartment. Donyea’s mother, Adondra Williams, will never forget her husband calling out from the apartment, “What funeral home do you want to come pick him up.”

The morning of the day that would be her last on earth, Kervina told her mother, Regina, that she was going to get a gun to protect herself and her family. Even though she had moved out and filed for divorce, Bradley was still harassing Kervina. Her car and apartment were frequently broken into. He stalked her.

Kervina was a caring, compassionate home health worker much loved by her clients. She had applied for nursing school. Her acceptance letter came in the mail days after she was killed.

A person whose son Kervina cared for on the job, who asked not to be identified to avoid sensationalizing the relationship, said of Kervina:

Kervina was caregiver for my severely disabled son for a short time until she was killed. She wasn’t just a good or even an excellent caregiver. She was exceptional. I usually spend at least two or three days training a trained caregiver on how to take care of my son. But I really did not have to train her. She had an innate sense of skill and compassion as to how to handle him — from feeding to dressing to simply talking to him. She was not just beautiful. She was motivated to be the best she could be and hoped someday to earn a degree in the healthcare field. We grieve for her family, and her clients also lost a gem.

Donyea had gotten his college career back on track and was studying engineering. Together, they were parents of a four-year-old daughter, whom they both adored. That child lost both parents in one tragic night.

Donyea had answered Kervina’s call and given her a ride home after she was stranded because Bradley had slashed her tires. Bradley pushed into the apartment wielding a semiautomatic weapon. At the door, he shot Donyea in the chest and the head. He found Kervina hiding in the bathroom, and shot her multiple times. He and the driver, Eddie James Irvin III, were found at the scene the next day, jailed, and charged with capital murder.

Hearts broken, the Woods and Williams families buried their children, took care of their grandchildren, and prayed for justice.

For nearly eight years, they attended more court hearings than they can count, reliving the deaths of their children each time. Each hearing ended with the defense requesting a continuance, and the district attorney’s office not objecting.

They repeatedly pleaded for a jury trial, in hopes of a life sentence without parole. But they were not heard. On Apr. 9, 2021, District Attorney Michael Jackson — whom they had not seen in more than seven years — informed them in a Zoom meeting he had finalized the case and was not going to put Bradley on trial as they wished.

Nor, they found out, would he seek prison without parole. Instead, Jackson made an “executive decision” to lower the charge from capital to felony murder and to accept a guilty plea in exchange for two consecutive life sentences.

“We want a jury trial,” Adondra said at the time. “We do not want Mr. Jackson to be judge and jury. Once you decide to pull the trigger and murder two innocent people, you lose all opportunity to participate in civilized society,”

“It’s a slap in the face,” Regina said of Jackson’s deal. “Don’t tell us you imagine our pain You cannot imagine or know it unless it’s your child six feet under. We are not asking for pity. We want justice for all — whether my family or someone else’s family.”

So they hit the pavement, raising their voices for justice — speaking for their children, whose voices were silenced. Adondra and Regina spent two weeks protesting the plea deal and calling for justice, first at the courthouse then at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the site of 1965 marches for voting rights. They were supported by other protesters, along with dozens who drove by, honking their horns in support and promising to pray for a good outcome.

Despite their heartrending cries, on Apr. 21, the district judge accepted Jackson’s plea agreement. Bradley pled guilty, refused to speak to the families of the victims, and received two consecutive life sentences. That means Bradley will be eligible for parole, and he will testify in a trial the D.A. is holding against the driver in June. “That is just backwards,” Adondra said. “It was the shooter who should have the trial.”

In an interview, Jackson told me domestic violence cases can be difficult to present to a jury and get 12 people to agree to the charge. He believes that with two consecutive life sentences “Mr. Bradley will be in prison the rest of his life.” He will be eligible for parole, Jackson said, but he believes it will be at least 30 years before it is considered, and his office will protest it and hopefully so will the family.

Although Regina said she has forgiven Bradley, she still seeks a real life sentence. She wants the district attorney to “tell the truth, the whole truth. You went against our will. You went against what we asked we just wanted our day in court. “His parents can still see him, talk to him. We have to go to the graveyard to see our children,” she adds.

Crime hits the black American population hard. Black women are killed twice as often as white women in domestic violence cases. In general, black and American Indian/Alaska Native women experience the highest rates of homicide (4.4 and 4.3 per 100,000 population) and over half of all homicides (55 percent) are related to domestic violence.

Furthermore, data shows young black men and teens ages 18-34 are killed by guns 20 times more than their white counterparts. “A Public Health Crisis in the Making,” found that although black American men make up just 2 percent of the nation’s population, they were among 37 percent of gun homicides. Indeed, in 2017, half of all black homicide victims were killed by someone they knew.

Donyea was the grandson of Ulysses Blackmon, one of the Courageous Eight, the black American heroes who worked for decades to get blacks the right to vote through the Dallas County Voter’s League. In 1965, they invited Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to Selma to lead the movement, and their work contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

It was because of the right to vote that Jackson was elected in 2004 as the first black American district attorney in the Fourth Circuit (including Selma), and the second black American D.A. elected in Alabama. The Courageous Eight fought for the right to vote because it also is the right to serve on a jury, as jurors are called from lists of registered voters. But if there is no jury trial, you lose your voice.

Rev. Leodis Strong of Selma’s Brown Chapel AME, where most of the mass meetings for the voting rights movement took place, attended last Wednesday’s hearing to “stand in solidarity and prayer” with the families in their “unbearable pain and suffering.”

There should have been more transparent communication between the D.A. and the families in this process so the families, “who have already been victimized and are grieving would not have felt so betrayed and mistreated by going through what happened today,” he said. “These families still have so much to go through with all of this … my heart and prayers are with them.”

Regina’s granddaughter, now 11, recently came to her bed one night, crying because she missed her mom. “Mother’s Day is coming up, and I know we will put flowers on Kervina’s grave,” Regina said. “You have to push through the pain. You learn to cope, but you never get over it. It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.”

Biden’s Unfair Menthol Ban Is Bad For Black Smokers,"The Biden administration is taking aim at menthol cigarettes. Under a new proposal, the minty tobacco product could be outright banned by the federal government. Not all cigarettes, mind you, although there is talk along those lines too, just menthols. The plan isn’t just wrongheaded, it’s dangerous and deeply unfair as well. Also, like so much of Biden’s backwards agenda, it places needless emphasis on race.

So why ban menthols and only menthols? It is because they are the type of cigarette most favored by black smokers. This is a ham-fisted attempt at equity that not only doesn’t create equity but has the potential to harm black smokers more than their white counterparts, who tend to be less likely to smoke Kools or Newports.

By banning the sale of menthols nationwide, Biden would be inviting not just a black market, but a new and deadly black market our country has thus far avoided. As it stands now, the vast majority of cigarette smuggling in the United States is from low tobacco tax states to high tobacco tax states. There is very little international bootlegging into our country because there is no need for it. This menthol move will change that dramatically.

With menthols flat-out banned, bootleggers and the black market will have to look overseas, mostly to China for their supplies. This is a crippling problem in much of Europe and in Australia that we have thus far avoided.

What is worse is that bootleg cigarettes from China are often counterfeit, unregulated, products that do more harm than legal cigarettes. A pack smuggled from Virginia to New York is the real product, it just has a different tax stamp. Smokes from China could be anything.

But even without the concerns regarding Chinese counterfeiting, claims of equity for this policy that punishes black smokers are absurd on their face. One imagines Biden views this as racially progressive because he imagines it will diminish rates of smoking among blacks. Even if it does, though, what a horribly paternalistic plan.

White smokers, Biden seems to think, should be free to make their own decisions about sucking down a Marlboro Light, either because they are better able to handle that choice, or because they are on some level disposable. Black smokers, on the other hand, must be protected by the government from their own bad choices. The proposal limits Americans’ choices on a racial basis, but of course Biden thinks he is doing it for black people’s own good.

Even the American Civil Liberties Union has objected to a racialized approach to smoking. The group opposed a House bill in 2020 that sought to ban menthols on the very basis of its disproportionate impact on black Americans. They also oppose this ban. Encouraging the black community in particular to engage in an illegal cigarette marketplace will only increase dangerous police interactions, the very thing progressives claim they wish to make less common.

This is just another example of a race-based leftist policy destined to go hopelessly awry to the detriment of black Americans. Just as defund the police efforts have led to skyrocketing crime rates in black communities across our country, which is why black voters overwhelmingly oppose the idea, banning menthols will introduce dangerous fake cigarettes and needless police interactions.

Smoking is a choice that a relatively small percentage of Americans make, fully aware of the health consequences. The idea of banning cigarettes altogether is a terrible one, especially as states fall all over themselves to legalize the smoking of marijuana. But targeting such a ban on just one racial group is an awful tobacco policy and an even worse policy on race.

It is not the job of the federal government to try to create conditions of perfect safety for all Americans, or even for black Americans. The crisis of the past year should make crystal clear the dangers of unintended consequences when the state seeks to protect us like a mother protects an infant. The bottom line is that Americans should have the freedom to choose to smoke — all Americans. That includes black Americans.

It really seemed like progressives had thought of every possible way to divide our country further and further on racial lines, but apparently they had not. Now even our vices are to be boxed off into racial categories by Biden and his army of bureaucrats. Soon there will scarcely be a sliver of our society left not defined and dealt with on the meaningless basis of skin color.

Biden should know better, and there was likely a time he did. Now he just parrots critical race theory mantras instead of even trying to engage rationally on race-based questions in our country. Everybody will lose if this nonsense is enacted.

Well, maybe not everybody: Chinese purveyors of fake menthol cigarettes will likely wind up the big winner.

A BLM Activist Pulling A Gun On Bystanders Should Be The Last Straw,"Thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds took to the streets last year in Frisco, Texas — the most suburban of suburbs — to march in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter slogan. Although some people worried the protests would transform into rioting, thankfully, the march remained peaceful. Unfortunately, it also proved to be rather pointless.

Less than a year later, Black Lives Matter activists took to the streets in a neighboring suburb of Plano, Texas to protest the death of Marvin David Scott III, a black man in his mid-20s who recently died in police custody. This time, however, there wasn’t nearly the same level of support from the community. Instead, Plano police were thrust into a tense scene of protesters blocking traffic at a busy intersection.

So, who was Scott? What happened? Nearly two months ago, police took Scott into custody after he was allegedly smoking marijuana behind the outlet mall in Allen, Texas. While detained, officers restrained and pepper-sprayed him, and placed a spit hood over his head. Hours later, he died. According to the medical examiner, the cause of death was a “fatal acute stress response in an individual with previously diagnosed schizophrenia during restraint struggle with law enforcement.”

As with most instances of purported injustice called out by Black Lives Matter activists, the details of Scott’s death provoke several questions. Did he have a criminal record? Did someone report him, or did police merely happen to find him while out on patrol? To what degree did Scott cooperate with the police? Why was he restrained and pepper-sprayed? What do the officers accused of murdering Scott have to say?

Whatever the answers to these questions might be, it should be clear by now that the involvement of Black Lives Matter activists will only exacerbate the problem. After a year of protests and so much media coverage, the official organization Black Lives Matter has mostly succeeded in enriching its highest-ranking members while spreading division and hate in the communities where they organize. The residents of Plano and other communities should take heed and stop enabling them in any way.

Some will object, saying that Black Lives Matter has brought much-needed awareness to the problem of racist law enforcement policies. If it wasn’t for the Black Lives Matter movement, the story goes, most Americans wouldn’t know how so many police departments and other public institutions systematically target and murder poor black Americans, routinely depriving them of justice. Except this isn’t true.

As writers like Heather Mac Donald have repeatedly demonstrated, “This charge of systemic police bias was wrong during the Obama years and remains so today.” While there might be individual instances of racism in law enforcement, it cannot justifiably be classified as “systemic” or even “widespread.”

This is why organizations like Black Lives Matter and its supportive activists and writers have to rely on specific, individual examples of what they can construe as racism instead of real statistics. Even in these cases, the charges of wrongdoing and bigotry are often debatable. Nevertheless, media outlets will do their utmost to present one side and not the other, turning each tragedy into the next political controversy.

True to their Marxist training, the Black Lives Matter organization has effectively applied Vladimir Lenin’s wisdom that “a lie told often enough becomes the truth.” Far from spreading awareness and informing Americans about the criminal justice system, Black Lives Matter’s messaging has done the opposite.

In too many cases, Americans are told to fear police and white supremacists more than actual criminals and terrorists. To make matters worse, contradicting this absurdity will automatically lead to accusations of racism and white privilege.

Black Lives Matter’s activism has brought little in the way of reform and has mostly hurt the communities they purport to defend. Many protests have turned into riots that have precipitated mass looting and arson, resulting in billions of dollars in damages. Additionally, police have been so hamstrung and vilified that they refrain from making arrests, and many police departments now face a shortage of personnel. Consequently, nearly every major American city has seen a surge in crime.

To top it off, Black Lives Matter has collected billions of dollars in donations, little of which has gone to the people or communities in need. From the little that’s known, at least some of their money goes to finance more mansions for founder Patrisse Cullors. As for those neighborhoods and businesses that have been torched by “peaceful protest,” they will have to find another way to pay for repairing the damage.

Fortunately, the protests for Scott have not erupted into an outbreak of mob violence. Yet, a heated confrontation between an angry driver and Black Lives Matter activists — one of whom drew a gun on the driver — should signal to Plano police to stop supporting these demonstrations.

That driver could have easily been shot dead for a grievance that had nothing to do with him or any of the other drivers. It should also be noted that apparently nothing has happened to the activist who threatened to shoot him. Enabling these thug tactics from protesters only emboldens them to become even more disruptive and increases the chance of serious chaos breaking out.

Americans seeking justice for men like Scott should stop depending on corrupt groups like the Black Lives Matter organization. Instead, they should acquaint themselves with the groups that do genuinely good work and with the numerous scholars who give much more accurate accounts of the social ills affecting American cities.

Ultimately, what those who seek answers will find is that much of the ills that plague our society are rooted in culture. This, in turn, suggests the most effective reforms will, likewise, be cultural in nature rather than economic or political.

If we’re to see real, positive change, Americans must stop listening to leftist demagogues and corrupt organizations like Black Lives Matter. Instead, they should focus on giving back to their community, volunteering in local charities, and taking ownership for the well-being of where they call home. It may not be as easy as staging a protest or posting a meme on social media, but it’s much more rewarding.

"No, 'Purity Of The Ballot Box’ Is Not Racist Election Law Terminology","As in Georgia, Florida, and other states, the Texas legislature is working to strengthen the state’s election law against the left’s largely successful 2020 effort to subvert it.

Texas last passed an election code omnibus bill in 2017 (I testified in favor of the bill). That bill, as with 2021’s efforts, aimed to increase safeguards against ballot trafficking, a common tactic that exploits the weaknesses inherent in the mail-in ballot process.

Elections workers ask citizens voting in-person in Texas for a government-issued photo ID. Voting by mail has no such requirement in addition to other vulnerabilities, such as paid ballot traffickers pressuring voters to vote the “right” way or marking the ballot on their behalf.

Using COVID-19 as an excuse to do what they have wanted to do for years, a series of lawsuits led by Marc Elias at Perkins Coie of discredited Donald Trump dossier infamy, attempted to overturn Texas’s limitations on voting by mail. The coordinated effort to “fortify” the 2020 election saw the infusion of $36 million in outside money aimed at boosting mail-in voting in Texas — even to those ineligible to do so under Texas law. Elias already has Texas at the top of his watch list to sue over new “voter suppression” laws.

Further, in Texas as in other states, the 2020 election saw partisan election judges eject authorized poll watchers, preventing them from observing the central count at counties or removing them from polling locations where they were authorized to watch the poll workers. Texas lawmakers are seeking to address these election weaknesses, as they are prone to doing almost every biennial session.

During floor debate on Texas’s SB7 on May 6 and into the early hours of the next day, Democrats claimed the bill’s preamble, making a reference to the need to preserve “the purity of the ballot box through the prevention of fraud in the conduct of an election” had racist origins in Jim Crow-era efforts to prevent black people from voting. Democrats demanded that the offending language be stricken from the bill. It was.

The push to discredit Texas’s omnibus election law overhaul was joined by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF) in a letter dated March 25 in opposition to HB6, the House companion to SB7, alleging the bill, “repeatedly uses the phrase ‘purity of the ballot box’ to justify its aim of emboldening partisan watchers. Comparable language regarding the ‘purity of the ballot box’ that is found in the Texas Constitution has deep ties to calls by white legislators’ in the state to ensure the ‘purity of the Anglo-Saxon race’ by, among other tactics, disenfranchising Black Texans.”

The LDF goes on to conflate the phrase “purity of the ballot box” from Texas’s Constitution of 1876 with the efforts to begin disenfranchising black voters in Texas that followed. This is a remarkable accusation. If true, it would redound to the discredit of those carrying the bill and supporting it.

Revisionist History

The problem with this effort at historical revisionism is that the phrase “purity of the ballot box” has a long history specifically referring to concern about corrupted elections.

In 1869, the U.S. House of Representatives, concerned about systemic and longtime fraud in New York, specifically the Tammany Hall political machine in New York City, convened a “Select Committee on Alleged New York Election Frauds.” This committee issued a report that noted, “A republican government that cannot preserve the purity the ballot (emphasis added) is a failure; one which will not is a fraud, and is already resolved into anarchy.”

The footnotes in the congressional report highlight the New York legislature’s constant efforts to battle election fraud:

1838—Noting voters from outside a district, noncitizens voting, voters voting multiple times at different polling locations to the “disgrace of the state and to the manifest wrong of the whole country.”

1844—Citing “great frauds in the presidential election of 1844” in New York.

1857—A New York State Assembly committee declared that the ballot, “Still fails to be a true-reflection of the will of the people.”

1858—Gov. King of New York in his first annual message in reference to the “elective franchise” declares that, “All know that in the city of New York, and measurably in other large cities, it is not pure and often is not free.”

1865 and 1866—“The legislature of New York finally enacted” election reforms, but they “have failed to secure the purity of the ballot-box.”

In this context, the New York State Assembly’s Committee on Grievances was charged with proposing election reforms to ensure “the purity of the ballot box.” The widespread concern over pre-stuffed ballot boxes even led to the invention of a glass ballot box in 1856 to improve election “transparency.”

In an irony perhaps too great for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund to appreciate, an 1867 edition of Harper’s Weekly shows a black voter casting his “first vote” in a glass receptacle designed to ensure the “purity of the ballot box.”

Some 36 years earlier, concerns over ongoing abuses by the Tammany Hall political machine were raised in the Evening Post on June 25, 1831 over the contested Fifth Ward election in New York City.

The paper noted that “The political character of the state and of the Union may be changed, against the will of a majority of the people, by one single ballot box.” The paper observed that local officials, elected by a corrupt election, will go along with the fraud, by “acquit(ing) or pardon(ing) the accused.” The article concluded that patriots should be on guard against a “fatal innovation (i.e., fraud) upon the purity of the ballot box.”

So there is a well-established historical record of the phrase “purity of the ballot box” being used in America long before the advent of the Texas Constitution of 1876 and the gathering onset of Jim Crow laws designed to segregate and disenfranchise black citizens.

As recently as 2005, writing in the leftwing DailyKos, David Mills authored an article entitled, “Equality and Securing the Purity of the Ballot Box.” In it, Mills details his legal complaint against Shelby County, Tennessee for not using paper ballots in compliance with the Tennessee Constitution, which states, “The General Assembly shall have the power to enact laws … to secure … the purity of the ballot box.”

A Viral Exchange

During debate on SB7, Texas state Rep. Rafael Anchía asked Elections Committee Chairman Briscoe Cain, “What was your motivation for using that term ‘purity at (sic) the ballot box’?” Anchía immediately suggested why, saying, “Because that’s a specific set of words that has a lot of meaning in state history,” with the exchange posted in a promoted video of the floor action that’s been seen 3.3 million times.

Cain responded by saying the bill’s preamble is taken from the state’s constitution, to which Anchía asked, “Did you look at the history before using that word?” before claiming that the phrase was specifically employed to disenfranchise black voters after the Civil War. Anchía went on claim that “penal disenfranchisement schemes were put in place, including in Texas, as far back as 1845, to effectively lock African American people out of the political process.”

This last claim from Anchía was certainly remarkable, causing the bill’s sponsor to amend the phrase “purity of the ballot box” out of the bill. But was it true?

1845 was some 20 years before the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution that made it possible for the majority of blacks in America to vote, so it is unlikely that any measure passed then would have black disenfranchisement as its aim. Further, Anchía’s claim ignores the fact that felon disenfranchisement was common in ancient Greece and Rome with the aim of discouraging criminal behavior. This practice was carried forward by medieval England and then brought to the colonies in America.

Even before the American Revolution, disenfranchisement for criminal activity was common, with citizens liable to lose “freeman” status for criminal behavior — again, long before any significant partisan advantage might be obtained by disenfranchising black voters by the Democratic Party.

The whole kerfuffle on the Texas House floor over SB7’s incorporation of the phrase “purity of the ballot box” from Article 6, Section 4 of the Texas Constitution appears even more stilted when reading the section in context: “…the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box…”

In fact, the 1875 debate over the Texas Constitution shows no evidence that the phrase “purity of the ballot box” had any meaning beyond concern over election fraud. This language is in perfect harmony with the common concerns of the day (and now) regarding ballot box irregularities.

It had no racial meaning in this context, although it is possible that some politicians borrowed the common phrase at a later date to justify their own evil intent — just as the Bible’s reference to slavery was used by some in the Antebellum South to justify slavery, though with a far weaker theological claim than that deployed by abolitionists who also used the Bible to argue the fundamental humanity of slaves and thus, their inherent rights.

In short, Democrats’ claims of the racist origins of the phrase “purity of the ballot box” utterly fail the historical test. As with The New York Times’ 1619 Project, this effort attempts to create a compelling “history” knit from vaporous lies with the aim of frightening Republicans away from passing election reforms needed to safeguard Texas’s elections against fraudulent exploits.

John McWhorter Announces New Book On Antiracism As ‘New Religion’ That Hurts Black Americans,"American linguist and writer John McWhorter is releasing a new book about the dangers of antiracism in October.

In “Woke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America” released by Avery Books, McWhorter will share his insights on how Americans deal with race and why the new, popular approach is treated more like a religion than a political viewpoint.

McWhorter has long detailed his thoughts in his Substack in excerpts of what he called “The Elect” but explained that this published book will give him the opportunity to share his analysis in more detail.

“Woke Racism will express what the Substack excerpts did and then some. It will still analyze Third-Wave Antiracism as a religion. It will still make legions of black people see me as a race traitor,” he wrote.

The book, McWhorter explained, will also “make legions of white people see me as a tragically deluded white supremacist with brown skin who merits dismissal and ostracization” but will be “the most pro-black book I have ever written.”

In the book, McWhorter will explain how antiracism is a “new religion, from the original sin of ‘white privilege’ and the weaponization of cancel culture to ban heretics, to the evangelical fervor of the ‘woke mob.'” He also explains how aiming to “dismantle racist structures” is “actually harming his fellow Black Americans by infantilizing Black people, setting Black students up for failure, and passing policies that disproportionately damage Black communities.”

“The new religion might be called ‘antiracism,’ but it features a racial essentialism that’s barely distinguishable from racist arguments of the past,” the book excerpt states.

McWhorter said he will continue to write Substack posts for his audience in addition to releasing “Woke Racism.”

“I am glad many of you have enjoyed my posts here beyond The Elect excepts, and they will continue, at the rate of once or twice (and I hope, more often, twice) a week. I have loved communicating to you as well as the feedback I get. Let’s keep this going,” he said.

This Black-Owned Boutique Didn't Let BLM Rioters Spell Its Doom,"PHILADELPHIA, P.A. — A men’s shoes and accessories store in Center City, Philadelphia was looted last summer during the Black Lives Matter riots. Owner Steve Jamison, a black man who started Blue Sole Shoes in 2007, did not see it coming.

“I just thought that Philly was different,” he told me. “I thought we would respond in a different way.”

Jamison was at home when people first broke into his store on May 31. His alarm company called him to inform him of a breach. He watched on his surveillance cameras as the front door was broken down.

“It’s just a shock. It’s anger. Fear. You know, worried, concerned,” he said. “All those things came into my mind. It’s my store. It’s my business — my livelihood. And all that came into play. Those are the things I thought about.”

Unlike some other businesses that were cleaned out of all inventory — or even burned down — everything in Blue Sole Shoes was not robbed. The business was targeted early in the evening before the city got completely out of control. Yet products were stolen, and vandalism and damage incurred.

There was not one coordinated group but a random collection of individuals weaving in and out of his store as they looted, Jamison says. Jamison does not remember how many pairs of shoes were grabbed because he says he has moved on “mentally” and “emotionally.”

One would imagine that a business owner would have been terrified to step foot in his store the same day it was getting terrorized. Indeed, other owners who spoke to The Federalist waited days before returning.

But Jamison went back the night of. He got to the store and watched the activity on the street. Looters were trying to come into Blue Sole Shoes and he kept telling them it is a black-owned business.

Throughout the country, this became a trend. Black and Latino business owners taped signs to their store’s windows. “African owned business,” read signs written in Minneapolis, Minnesota, “We support our small diverse and minority businesses.”

Saving his store was vital to his livelihood. Jamison opened Blue Sole Shoes in February 2007 after saving up. His venture was financed with a $120,000 home equity loan and with credit. He knew he would lose his house if the business failed.

After the looting, it was a mess in the store. In the days that followed the break-in, the cleaning began. “Merchandise was just kind of thrown around,” Jamison tells me. “It was just a lot of disarray. It was messiness.”

The door and windows had been boarded up. For days, the violence in Philadelphia continued. Trash heaps were everywhere, graffiti scrawled on buildings and stores, glass shattered in the streets. Some individuals let off fireworks over burning police cars in front of City Hall. The curfew went unobserved.

I asked Jamison what sort of financial strain the looting of his store put him under. He was not sure about the numbers and mentioned that coronavirus lockdowns made matters worse. The store was closed for three months and then some due to the violence — just after Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf announced reopening guidelines.

“I mean, I don’t remember,” he said about damages. “The looting was just in addition to the shutdowns. I really look at it as a whole package kind of thing. Because literally, it came at the end of what were supposed to be the shutdowns — the city had announced we will be allowed to reopen. And then it happened. You know, you couldn’t open because of the looting and the riots.”

The shop owner was more guarded on condemning the movement last summer. He says he has “experienced injustice” and “sometimes hopelessness comes about.” Jamison noted that opportunists participated in the looting.

Kathy Barnette, who is running in Pennsylvania to become the first black Republican female elected to the U.S. Senate, is far more critical of the BLM movement. She told me the BLM movement is “Marxist” and that it is trying to “overthrow the country.”

“The goal of Marxism is to create agitation and divide you and then control you,” Barnette said in an interview. “It overturns the country. What we saw on the streets was very destructive and destroyed lives and murdered lives. There is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow.”

Blue Sole Shoes opened its doors back up in September. Along with two other nearby stores, there was a triple ribbon-cutting ceremony. There are no more wooden boards, there is new glass, and the shelves were restocked.

Asked about how business has been a year after the summer of rage, Jamison said it is going well.

“It’s been busy lately. So, you know, we’re grateful for that,” he said. “It’s kind of where I’ve placed myself in the hope that I can grow from the point of reopening. It wasn’t like a faucet that turned on — like you open the doors and had a flood of people coming in to buy merchandise. That wasn’t the case. But there was a slow, gradual but steady, consistent increase as restrictions loosened.”

“It’s been good to just be at a good place,” he added, “a good space. Not as scary, not as unnerving.”

Black Lives Matter Co-Founder Resigns After Months Of Money Controversies,"One of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Patrisse Cullors, is stepping down from her position as executive director of the activist organization shortly after reports suggested she was using her position to potentially self-deal funds from the charity.

“Cullors leaves BLMGNF in a strong position to support grassroots, art/culture work, and policy work that invests in the future of Black lives,” the BLM organization said in a statement.

Cullors, who openly claims she is a Marxist, will stay on the board until BLMGNF “finds a new permanent” team but is ultimately leaving to work on her new book and television deal. She said this isn’t the first time that she’s stepped back from the organization and that “it was always supposed to interim.” It is unclear if she will remain in her position as chairwoman of the Black Lives Matter PAC.

“With smart, experienced, and committed people supporting the organization during this transition, I know that BLMGNF is in good hands,” said Cullors. “The foundation’s agenda remains the same — eradicate white supremacy and build life-affirming institutions.”

The decision comes just weeks after the Daily Caller exposed that BLMGNF under Cullors and her two other organizations, Black Lives Matter PAC and Reform LA Jails, funneled money to Trap Heals, which is owned by the father of her only child.

The mysterious organization, founded just days before it entered an official collaboration with BLM, quickly became the activist group’s “lead developer of the art & cultural efforts” and was even paid “a collective $238,000 to produce an election night live stream and for consulting services, campaign finance records show.”

Cullors later condemned the Daily Caller’s reporting and “decried what she called a smear campaign from a far-right group, but said neither that nor recent criticism from other Black organizers influenced her departure.”

The BLM founder recently came under fire for buying four homes, all in predominantly white neighborhoods, for an estimated $3.2 million.

"For Blackburn, It Was Fauci's Big Tech Collusion That Was The Last Straw","Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn joined the growing chorus of Capitol Hill lawmakers last week demanding National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci be fired.

Fire Fauci — Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) June 6, 2021

The call came on the heels of more than 3,200 pages of emails made public by a BuzzFeed Freedom of Information Act request, which exposed “America’s Doctor” as a political animal who spent 18 months rising to fame as the nation’s preeminent voice on coronavirus to cover his own plausible role in the viral outbreak.

Emails show Fauci dismissed early evidence that COVID-19 came from a Wuhan lab with taxpayer funding sponsored by his own NIAID, disregarded early indications that the virus was beyond containment, and contradicted his explanation for discouraging masks early on as merely concerned about their supply for health care workers. In the pandemic’s first days, Fauci, according to the emails, was the original anti-masker.

But for Blackburn, it was the emails’ reveal of Fauci’s collusion “in cahoots” with Silicon Valley tech giant Facebook that was the last straw.

“Dr. Fauci was first of all interested in protecting himself and his reputation,” Blackburn told The Federalist in an exclusive Wednesday morning interview, complaining that Fauci had engaged in a politicized “PR campaign” in pursuit of his own self-interest as opposed to clear, concise, and consistent messaging as a credible public health expert.

In an email dated March 15 of last year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg directly reached out to Fauci about participating in building the platform’s hub for virus-related news, an opportunity Fauci appeared excited to entertain in an effort to grow his own media-manufactured monopoly on coronavirus information.

“This isn’t public yet, but we’re building a Coronavirus Information Hub that we’re going to put at the top of Facebook for everyone (200+ million Americans, 2.5 billion people worldwide) with two goals: (1) make sure people can get authoritative information from reliable sources and (2) encourage people to practice social distance and give people ideas for doing this using internet tools,” wrote Zuckerberg. “This will be live within the next 48 hours.”

The Facebook executive continued: “As a central part of this hub, I think it would be useful to include a video from you because people trust and want to hear from experts rather than just a bunch of agencies and political leaders.”

Another offer remains redacted, but Fauci was elated to oblige.

“Your idea and proposal sound terrific. I would be happy to do a video for your hub,” Fauci wrote back. “We need to reach as many people as possible and convince them to take mitigation strategies seriously or things will get much, much worse. Also, your idea about [REDACTED] is very exciting.”

Less than a year later, Zuckerberg reiterated Facebook’s commitment to promoting authoritative information to its users. In February, Facebook announced an “update” in its effort to combat “misinformation” in which the platform would remove posts claiming “COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured.” The policy remained in place for months, until it was finally rescinded last week once the lab-leak theory was given new life among legacy outlets. The tech giant also began to censor emails published from Fauci’s server that documented the doctor’s initial opposition to face masks early in the pandemic.

Rebirth of the lab-leak theory’s plausibility, after Fauci and allies in progressive media dismissed it for months as a fringe conspiracy, came in large part due to a May report in the Wall Street Journal. The blockbuster story highlighted three researchers at the Wuhan lab who sought hospital care for COVID-like symptoms in the weeks before the first outbreak in the same area of the Hubei Province.

Other reporting in May that picked up traction raised questions about Fauci’s personal role in the pandemic’s creation as a proponent of “gain of function” research, wherein scientists extract viruses from the wild and engineer them to infect humans in order to study potential therapeutics including vaccines. Fauci defended the high-risk research, which was temporarily banned by the United States between 2014 and 2017, as worth risking a pandemic over in a 2012 paper.

“In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic?” Fauci wrote in a paper reported on by The Australian last month. “Scientists working in this field might say — as indeed I have said — that the benefits of such experiments and the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks.”

Such research was being conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which the U.S. State Department has publicly said collaborated with the Chinese military. The lab was also operating with a five-year $600,000 annual grant from 2014-2019 by the National Institutes of Health through the Fauci-directed NIAID to study bat coronaviruses that could infect humans. While Fauci has acknowledged the agency’s funding to the lab, the NIAID director had vehemently denied that the money was going toward gain of function research — which is in a peculiar denial given the U.S. moratorium’s language, which defined gain of function as “any research that improves the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.” Fauci later admitted there was “no way of guaranteeing” how the taxpayer-funded grant money was used.

Blackburn stressed that regardless of what was studied, “We should never have been involved in funding research at a lab that is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.”

“How did our tax dollars end up funding this research?” Blackburn said, demanding Fauci at least step aside from his duties at the top of NIAID to allow a congressional investigation to move forward.

Whether Congress will establish a commission to investigate the plausible origins of the coronavirus as a product of the Wuhan lab remains uncertain. President Joe Biden has requested a 90-day intelligence review to probe the possibility, but some on Capitol Hill, including Blackburn, are demanding a congressional investigation to coincide with the administration’s effort.

Wisconsin Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, one of the most vocal members of Congress to raise concern over the virus as a product of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, told Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech on Monday he remains worried that efforts for a genuine probe could be impeded by the Democratic Party’s fear of Chinese confrontation.

“I’m sensing that we’re going to hit this big roadblock which is the concern within a wing of the Biden administration and on the left about provoking the Chinese Communist Party,” Gallagher explained, “whether it’s because they want to get a big deal on climate change or whether it’s because all of their donors on Wall Street are making tons of money off China. … I don’t fully understand it, but that’s what could prevent this from moving forward.”

Blackburn wouldn’t say whether she shared Gallagher’s exact concerns but said, “We’re always worried about things not being pushed through to completion.”

In the meantime, she said, Fauci should not be leading the NIAID.

Axing Critical Race Theory Allows For Teaching Honest History Like Tulsa,"Sometime in May, when headlines about the “Tulsa Massacre” 100th anniversary began to stream in from every outlet from the Washington Post (following the lead of rapper Common in describing “race massacres”) to the Wall Street Journal, obscuring Memorial Day, it became clear what this was about: another “conversation” about race.

President Joe Biden exploited the anniversary by traveling to Tulsa and bragging that he was the first president to do so. As if he just had The 1619 Project read to him, he used the tragedy to ram home the idea that it was emblematic of our nation’s history, and that today racism is still “embedded … systematically in our laws and our culture.”

Biden’s speech directly linked today’s fabricated atrocities with those of 100 years ago. A “through-line” connects the “hate and domestic terrorism” of that event to our situation today, he said, illustrating a way of looking at history that is being promoted in curricula such as The 1619 Project and the Zinn Education Project.

“Remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago,” he continued, “Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields.” Then he claimed outrageously that “terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today, not ISIS, not Al Qaeda.”

The “history lesson” of Tulsa is also being used for another political goal: to lobby against bills in numerous states that would prevent the use of critical race theory and curricula like The 1619 Project.

Sweeping Demonizations

One of those lobbying against the bills is columnist Leonard Pitts, who has spent decades presenting the world similar ideological precepts of race. Seizing the opportunity, he claimed that the “massacre,” in which 35 city blocks were “leveled by white mobs” and 300 black Americans were killed, was “not some isolated event” but was “echoed by New York in 1863, Memphis and New Orleans in 1866, Wilmington, North Carolina in 1898, Atlanta in 1906, Springfield in 1908, East St. Louis in 1917,” and so on.

For Pitts and like-minded commentators, such remembrances provide opportunities to hammer home the idea, as Nikole Hannah-Jones put it in her lead essay in The 1619 Project, that racism is “systemic” and found in the very “DNA” of white Americans. Pitts points to “thousands” of “mass-casualty events” of “white mobs killing Black people in large numbers, often torching their communities” and “lynchings where ‘only’ one or two African Americans might be tortured to death with grisly creativity.”

Like Biden, Pitts used the anniversary to make a political point by noting the confluence of the commemoration and the introduction of legislation in Republican-led states, including Oklahoma, which has banned critical race theory. Such legislation would deny students the ability “to ask necessary questions,” such as “how did good, Christian white people get it in their heads one day to commit mass murder?”

Thus, Pitts reveals the very reason we should ban critical race theory from schools: It imposes a kind of historical interpretation that demonizes “white people,” sweepingly casting them as — as Pitts puts it — “enjoy[ing]” “advantages … made possible by disadvantages imposed on others.” This isn’t history. Nor is it “black history,” which Pitts claims conservatives do not want schools to teach on the pretext that “it might hurt white feelings.”

Much like Hannah-Jones, who on Twitter holds up a “black sister” and highlights when a critic is a “74-year-old white man,” Pitts displays animus towards white people and never considers the harmful effect of teaching elementary school children that they’re responsible, by dint of their skin color, for the suffering of black Americans both past and present.

Telling the Entirety of History

Fortunately, this is not the approach of 1776 Unites, a black-run organization that opposes critical race theory. They have begun offering alternative curricula, free with registration, including a two-part lesson about Tulsa.

Part One describes the settling of the Oklahoma territory by American Indian tribes and their black slaves in the 1830s, the achievements of black attorney J. Coody Johnson, the granting of tribal membership by the Creek and Seminole, the oil boom, the prospering of the Greenwood section (known as “black Wall Street”), and the terroristic activities of the Ku Klux Klan against blacks and others.

There is a brief discussion of the 1919 Red Summer of rioting against newly discharged black World War I veterans who had battlefield experience, with the note that black Tulsans, raised in the “Western tradition of firearms ownership,” were particularly apt to take up arms in self-defense.

What led to the violence in 1921? As with most such cases, it began with a “minor incident” involving a young white female and a young black man, note the lesson materials. During a standoff between armed white men and armed black men outside the courthouse, a struggle ensued after a white man tried to seize a black man’s rifle. Twelve people — ten white Americans and two black Americans — were killed.

The 1776 Unites lesson does not hold back on what happened in the early morning hours of June 1 when “mobs pillaged black homes and businesses, killing those who resisted. Even Whites who tried to help their Black neighbors, or calm those in the mobs … were threatened or fired upon.” By the time the National Guard arrived around midday, 35 blocks had burned.

Part Two is about “Battling Back,” about how some like Greenwood “founder” O.W. Gurley, a son of freed slaves, fled to California, while others stayed to rebuild. And not all whites were racist. Maurice Willows, a Red Cross official, convinced his organization to declare Tulsa a “natural disaster area” in order to provide medical assistance, food, and supplies to the residents.

Discussion questions are thoughtful and expand into universal concerns, such as “mob mentality” and “vigilantism.” The implications of naming are explored. Should it be called a “race war,” as it was by the press, or a “riot,” which implies both sides were equally responsible? Is “massacre” appropriate?

In fact, black Tulsans did not passively allow themselves to be massacred, but fought back. Such lessons about language not only counter negative stereotypes but encourage real critical thinking about the presentation of such events in today’s media — which overwhelmingly used the word “massacre” to describe this historical event.

The donations by black churches, black prisoners, and the Red Cross are recounted. So is the successful fight by black attorneys to stop the walling off of Greenwood for an industrial area. Photos show a thriving, rebuilt district in the 1930s and the 1940s of more than 200 black-owned businesses. What led to Greenwood’s decline was integration, as people moved away, and urban renewal. In the 1970s most of Greenwood was demolished for Interstate 244. Good questions about “urban renewal” and “eminent domain” are posed.

Disingenuous Pushback Against Critics

Do not expect this kind of balanced discussion in the Zinn Education Project or in any of the other groups providing critical race theory-framed history lessons. They don’t want students to think about the dangers of “mobs” (instead, they encourage student protest), the harm of leftist government programs, or blacks’ ability to succeed as entrepreneurs.

The Zinn Education Project, which has been pushing the lessons about the “Tulsa Massacre” as one of its “This Day in History” atrocity for years, is vigorously lobbying against legislation such as that in Ohio, which bans teaching that individuals, by virtue of their race, are “inherently racist” and any requirement that a teacher “affirm a belief in the systemic nature of racism.”

The Missouri bill would ban what the Zinn Education Project calls the curricula of “leading social justice education groups”: “The 1619 Project initiative of the New York Times, the Learning for Justice Curriculum of the Southern Poverty Law Center, We Stories, programs of Educational Equity Consultants, BLM at School, Teaching for Change, Zinn Education Project, and any other similar, predecessor, or successor curricula.” Their campaign has garnered the signatures of more than 2,500 teachers, they claim. A “Day of Action” is planned for June 12.

Such organizations peddling critical race theory-geared lessons are aided in their disinformation campaign by corporate media. A New York Times article insinuates that anti-critical race theory bills are part of the Republican Party’s “broad strategy to run on culture-war issues in 2022.” Other outlets, such as The Guardian, claim that they are attempts to teach a “whitewashed” version of history.

Some columnists also follow Pitts’s example. Tony Messenger at Saint Louis Today, in a column approvingly tweeted by Hannah-Jones, piled on other “massacres” in East St. Louis and “similar mob attacks” in other cities. Like Pitts, he does not mention the rebuilding, but claims that this “absolute wiping out of Black wealth” was “because of racial prejudice.” Well, maybe, if you can make the case that “urban renewal” was not motivated by liberal Democratic policies or that those putting interstates through cities were motivated by racism.

Like Pitts, Messenger charges that bills by “white Republicans” would “ban the teaching of history in public schools as told from the Black perspective, such as Nikole Hannah-Jones’ Pulitzer Prize-winning The 1619 Project.” Messenger flatters himself by claiming he knows what “the Black perspective” is. Sadly, that has been the mistaken, racist notion for far too long.

History is complicated. People don’t act as preprogrammed members of racial, ethnic, or class groups. At times, individuals act nobly; on other occasions, sometimes terribly, and all in situations often far different from ours. Some people participate in mobs; others help the victims of mobs.

So, no, eliminating critical race theory and the 1619 Project would not preclude teaching black history. On the contrary, it would allow a multifaceted, honest, and truthful history to be told.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/10/axing-critical-race-theory-allows-for-teaching-honest-history-like-the-tulsa-violence-100-years-ago/,2021-06-10
Rep. Byron Donalds Blasts CNN Host For Telling Him What To Think,"Rep. Byron Donalds defended his rights as a black man to a white CNN anchor who seemed to suggest that his political views made him unqualified to be in the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). Donalds said he has expressed interest in being a member of the CBC but has yet to receive an invitation.

Brianna Keilar, CNN’s “New Day” anchor, implied Donalds’ exclusion from the CBC could be a result of his support for former President Trump which she said is “incongruent with the mission of the CBC.”

“As a black man in America I’m allowed to have my own thoughts about who I choose to support and who I choose not to support,” Donalds fired back. “My support of President Trump has been consistent but at the same time I’ve had the ability to advocate for issues, ideas, proposals, and funding that have helped the black community in my state.”

Donalds said using his support for Trump as a reason for not be welcomed to the CBC was just a red herring.

“This is whether the ideology of somebody who is conservative is welcome to the Congressional Black Caucus,” Donalds said. “It’s really that simple. So to bring up President Trump and try to make this about him does not matter, it’s irrelevant, it has nothing to do with the situation at hand.”

CNN patronizes Rep. @ByronDonalds, a black GOP congressman, after he calls out the @TheBlackCaucus for denying him entry.

“Since starting in Congress, our office and the Congressman have engaged with several CBC members expressing his interest in joining, but all we’ve got is the cold shoulder,” Harrison Fields, Donald’s communications director, told Fox News. “The sad reality is although the Congressman and those in the CBC share the same race, the (R) behind his name disqualifies him from membership today.”

Donalds told The Federalist his party affiliation should not exclude him from a group whose intent is to fight for black Americans.

“The Congressional Black Caucus has a stated commitment to ensuring black Americans have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream,” Donalds said.

“As a newly elected black Member of Congress, my political party should not exempt me from a seat at the table dedicated to achieving this goal. As a young black man who grew up in the inner city of Brooklyn in a single-parent household, my achieving of the American Dream would be a valued addition to the CBC and one that should transcend politics,” he added.

The CBC, which says it “has a long history of bipartisan collaboration and members who are both Democrat and Republican” does not currently have any Republican members.

The Left's Logic-Defying Race Rhetoric Is Making People's Heads Spin,"In the midst of the nation’s racial upheaval last year, media outlets including the Associated Press, the New York Times and the Washington Post rushed to start capitalizing the word “Black” in reference to African Americans, some announcing the move as a long-overdue gesture of respect. The change prompted newsroom soul-searching on whether to write “white” or “White” in reference to people of European descent.

Capitalizing the term made sense as a simple matter of consistency. But the argument for lower-casing “white” staked its own moral claims. One was that capitalizing it would legitimize white supremacy. Another was that “white” in lower case is an apolitical description of a skin color; it doesn’t merit capitalization because whites don’t represent a shared culture.

News organizations adopted inconsistent policies on the question – the AP, Times and others voted for “w”; the Washington Post and National Association of Black Journalists chose “W.” But the notion that there is no white culture drew jeers of derision from some quarters. It was virtually impossible to pretend not to see that white culture is routinely cited to refer to white supremacy and white privilege as a shorthand for the cultural biases, prejudices and values that prop up systemic racism.

Both ideas – that white culture is omnipresent and nonexistent – can’t be true. Or can they?

Wokeism’s Self-Cancelling Paradoxes

The white culture conundrum is one of many such paradoxes in today’s topsy-turvy woke culture, where colorblindness once represented the ideal of being unprejudiced, but now marks the epitome of racism.

These apparent contradictions can cause confusion, frustration and moral whiplash in a swiftly changing society where many people fear that one wayward move can result in a public flogging or a pink slip. Yet as the public seeks guidance, the fractured market of ideas seems unable to provide clarity on which rules apply in which situation.

“These contradictions and conundrums have hit like an avalanche,” said Jason Hill, a native of Jamaica and author of the 2018 book, “We Have Overcome: An Immigrant’s Letter to the American People.”

“Everyone needs to be aware because at some point they are going to be caught in these conceptual snares,” said Hill, a philosophy professor at DePaul University. “Most people are caught off-guard and cede their position. If you try to argue your way out, they’ll ensnare you in more traps.”

The paradoxes come in a variety of iterations, from moral imperatives to abstract propositions. In Ibram X. Kendi’s best-selling book, “How to Be an Antiracist,” the celebrity professor writes that cultural relativism is “the essence of cultural antiracism. To be antiracist is to see all cultures in all their differences as on the same level, as equals.”

Taken literally, Kendi’s dictum would mean that the antiracist culture he envisions is no better than the racist culture he blames for racial disparities in health, wealth, education and other measures. Yet it’s impossible to read Kendi’s work as anything but a critique of racist culture, and by extension, gun culture, rape culture and consumer culture.

This paradoxical pairing of a radical cultural critique with a radical cultural relativism is hardly unique to Kendi, but one of a growing number of widely circulating self-cancelling propositions.

Take gentrification, often invoked as an example of systemic racism because it can lead to the displacement of generations of black residents by incoming affluent whites. The famed antiracist writer Ta-Nehisi Coates has described gentrification as a crime, and others have denounced whites moving into black neighborhoods as ethnic cleansing, colonization and genocide.

Yet the reverse of gentrification – white flight from increasingly black neighborhoods – is also deemed a racist reflex by some, Coates among them, because it abandons once thriving schools and communities to neglect and disrepair. Hence the paradox: Condemning gentrification and white flight seems to leave no room for movement in any direction, inducing a moral paralysis.

“If both advocating for integrating city neighborhoods and advocating for retreat to safer suburban neighborhoods can be painted as racist — and there are many examples equivalent to this one — almost anyone could be ‘canceled’ at any time,” said Wilfred Reilly, author of the 2019 book “Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War.”

“It makes almost every conversation not among close friends into a booby-trapped environment,” said Reilly, a political science professor at Kentucky State University, a historically black college.

Some critics of progressive politics describe these paradoxes as the inevitable consequence of sloppy, illogical thinking based on emotional arguments and political expediencies. The inconsistencies can also result from the social justice movement’s strategy of “problematizing” – a philosophical posture that deconstructs and delegitimizes existing values and institutions as systems of oppression when seen through the lens of race, gender and power. Indeed, the term “woke” refers to being hyper-aware of the constant microaggressions and oppressions that become evident everywhere once one gets into the mindset of problematizing, or turning everything into a problem.

Using Paradoxes to Trap Dissenters and Undermine Logic

Others see the self-cancelling propositions in more sinister terms: as moral double-binds and Orwellian doublespeak deliberately designed to deceive, entrap and neutralize political opponents.

“They’re not bugs, they’re features,” said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which defends free speech and other individual rights of students and faculty at colleges and universities.

“It gives you infinite power over your opponent if you can literally have your argument any which way that works to your advantage,” said Lukianoff, co-author of the 2018 book “The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure.”

To be sure, any large movement will have discordant voices and divergent opinions, and a certain amount of viewpoint diversity is inevitable. In all human affairs, from politics to religion, there seems to be no shortage of hypocrisy. Fabio Rojas, a sociology professor at Indiana University, said the visibility of paradoxes in the realm of social justice is a testament to the movement’s ascendance in Western societies.

“Social justice is the theory of the moment. It’s all that we’re doing,” said Rojas, author of the 2007 book “From Black Power to Black Studies: How a Radical Social Movement Became an Academic Discipline.” “Right now the social justice world is gigantic, very popular.”

Still, many antiracist advocates don’t see these conundrums as contradictory, but as being situationally true in specific contexts, and also dependent on other nuances, such as whether a word like “culture” is being used literally or metaphorically.

Ron Scapp, an academic specialist in ethnic studies, is among those who acknowledge the contradictions and paradoxes as real, not imaginary; but Scapp says they are not the result of muddled thinking or an underhanded attempt at emotional blackmail. They simply reflect the ubiquity of systemic racism that permeates so much of American society, which means that we encounter racism wherever we turn, and all our options are morally fraught.

This sensation of feeling trapped is what is often meant by the idea that facing one’s white complicity in structures of oppression will necessarily cause white people to experience discomfort and even distress, because they have no place to hide in the society they have created, said Scapp, a professor of humanities and teacher education at the College of Mount Saint Vincent, in New York, and past president of the National Association for Ethnic Studies.

“The options aren’t painless – this comes with a price,” Scapp said. “And doing good doesn’t mean that you get to feel free from any pain or inconvenience that history has set us up for. There’s some white people who want a quick and easy out, to buy their way out of that history.”

Several critical race theorists told RealClearInvestigations that another factor might be at play in the calling out of contradictions: a whiff of white privilege in demanding perfect logical consistency without bothering to attend to context or to the literal and rhetorical uses of language.

“There might be some element of that [white privilege] involved in demanding logical consistency where it’s so easily shown that there is none,” said Robert Westley, a Tulane University law professor who specializes in critical race theory and reparations. “If we suspend the rhetoricity of language and just approach it in a logical way, then you could generate these kinds of contradictions all day long.”

In many intellectual traditions, logical consistency is not considered to be the loftiest human intellectual attainment, and rationalism lacks the prestige of paradoxes, enigmas, koans and riddles. In the Anglophone world, contradictions have been celebrated as transcendent by the playwright Oscar Wilde, poet Walt Whitman and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson, who declared that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” Political theorist Saul Alinsky, the author of the 1971 community organizing guide “Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals,” gamely advised: “In the politics of human life, consistency is not a virtue.”

Contradictions in Leftist Scholarship and Workplaces

Paradoxes aren’t the sole domain of the activist, but also are a tendency of progressive scholarship. For example, we are told that women are equal to men in all areas of competency, but studies show that women are more effective in 84% of leadership skills and in 13 of 19 areas of leadership effectiveness, according to research reported in Harvard Business Review.

It is accepted as a self-evident truth that slavery and segregation enriched white America at the expense of African Americans. But research also shows the opposite: that racism acts as a drag on the whole economy – retarding investment, growth, purchasing power, consumer spending and depressing other metrics — which economically harms white people, too, according to a report in The New York Times.

The most fertile ground for contradictions might well be the diversity and equity industry, which seems to have outpaced the pulpit in its zeal for issuing moral precepts.

A recurring theme in the social justice movement is the plea for an honest conversation about race, where all perspectives are respected. But the public is also getting the inverse message: that it is imperative for whites to remain silent to make room for marginalized voices and to stop centering their privileged experiences.

In the antiracist consulting world, it is a truth universally acknowledged that organizations should hire people of color to promote diverse viewpoints and insights from those employees.

But according to materials from The Walt Disney Co., recently leaked to City Journal, there is a limit on exploiting black wisdom. “Do not rely on your Black colleagues to educate you. This is emotionally taxing”; “Do not call on your Black colleagues to represent the voice of their community”; and “Be aware of tokenism, when Black professionals are expected to be representative for their entire race.”

Critical race theorist andré douglas pond cummings (who writes his name in lowercase letters), said this is actually sound advice for an organization that has hired one or two token black employees. The problem of tokenization disappears when organizations have true diversity with many black colleagues representing multiple black perspectives, said cummings, a business law professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock who has taught courses on corporate justice and “Hip-Hop & the American Constitution.”

He said many of the paradoxes will become moot in a socially just society.

“Maybe some of these seeming incoherences or inconsistencies just need time to come to a place of coherence,” cummings said.

Appeasing moral scolds can present a special challenge for homebuyers who want to be “on the right side of history” and increasingly see their words and actions as moral statements. The real estate dilemma of gentrification versus white flight is particularly acute for someone who might opt for a hybrid automobile over a gas-guzzling SUV and insists on shopping at businesses that support Black Lives Matter. A home purchase, the most expensive personal investment most people will make, becomes imbued with the greatest moral significance of all.

Rachel Garshick Kleit, a professor of city and regional planning at The Ohio State University, has taught classes on and written about teaching “The Socially Just City.” She said her students have been torn between the two impossible options when they think about home ownership as a personal moral decision. “They were in moral conflict over it in a class discussion,” Kleit said. “They were trying to figure out what their personal responsibility was.”

Gentrification is deeply personal for all involved. In a 2019 New York Times article about gentrification in Raleigh, N.C. – headlined “The Neighborhood’s Black. The New Home Buyers? White.” — a community organizer vented her frustration: “Our black bodies literally have less economic value than the body of a white person. As soon as the white body moves into the same space that I occupied, all of a sudden this place is more valuable.”

Some critical race theorists are willing to grant moral absolution on this point. The moral predicament of home ownership arises out of the default culture’s fixation with individualism, said Westley, the reparations specialist at Tulane. The critique of gentrification and white flight is not so much a moral litmus test for individual white homebuyers, according to Westley and Kleit, but a critique of the government policies that shape real estate markets in ways that are harmful to people of color.

“I think you have to get out of this individualist paradigm where it’s all about me and what I do, as opposed to it’s about what we do as a society and a community,” Westley said.

‘Endless Contradictions, Fabrications and Fantasies’

The topic of woke paradoxes has received scant attention, but it hasn’t escaped notice altogether.

Conservative British author Douglas Murray grappled with the issue in his 2019 book, “The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity.” He traced the cause of the linguistic convolutions to the social justice movement’s emphasis on identity politics and its jettisoning of traditional liberal principles such as colorblindness. This manner of thinking distorts the benefits of liberalism (that is, civil rights gains for minority groups) into a type of idolatry, elevating identity politics as an end unto itself. This confusion leads to “endless contradictions, fabrications and fantasies,” Murray wrote.

As a paradox-spotter, Murray has few peers. Murray depicts social justice activism as an incarnation of the Orwellian principle that revolutions start out professing that all people are equal but then slip into the self-serving belief that some people are more equal than others. Though Murray doesn’t mention the U.S. Declaration of Independence – “all men are created equal” – slavery and discrimination might well be one of the most egregious examples of this unfortunate tendency.

Murray does cite other examples. One is a 2014 study by Australian researchers that found that children of same-sex couples are healthier and happier than children brought up by straight couples. In another study, UCLA researchers found that gay couples are more likely to stay together than straight couples (and, surprisingly, lesbian couples).

Murray also noted the perplexing declamations that women are more capable than men. This incongruity gained currency after the Great Recession of 2008, which was allegedly caused by too many men in positions of power in the finance and banking industry. Christine Lagarde, former head of the International Monetary Fund (now president of the European Central Bank), blamed the financial meltdown on the underrepresentation of women on the boards of banks and in regulatory agencies. “If it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers,” she was quoted as saying, repeating a favorite mantra, “the world might well look a lot different today.”

According to Murray, who is gay, one of the “central conundrums” of our time is expressed by people with marginalized identities: You must understand me. / You will never understand me.

Murray dubbed these moral strictures as “paradoxical, impossible demands.”

“The inherent willingness to rush towards contradiction” is “not enough to stop this new religion of social justice,” Murray wrote. One reason “why contradiction is not enough is because nothing about the intersectional, social justice movement suggests that it is really interested in solving any of the problems that it claims to be interested in.”

That left Murray with only one possible conclusion: “Their desire is not to heal but to divide, not to placate but to inflame, not to dampen but to burn.”

"To Prompt Less Policing, Black Communities Need More Married Fathers","Father’s Day is a time to appreciate the role fathers play in training the next generation, and then-presidential candidate Barack Obama used his national platform to do so in a memorable speech 13 years ago.

“Of all the rocks upon which we build our lives, we are reminded today that family is the most important,” Obama said. “And we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation.”

In the speech, Obama also addressed poverty, crime, incarceration, and poor educational achievement in the black community — and looked to the home for both the root cause of those issues as well as the solution.

He presented statistics that children who grow up without a father are “five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of school, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.” Obama challenged black men to live up to the responsibilities of fatherhood and demonstrate examples of excellence and hard work within an intact family unit.

But just a few years after Obama’s speech, the predominant narrative is that pushed by the proudly Marxist Black Lives Matter organization with its shameless antipathy towards the traditional family and especially fathers.

“We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement,” a now-removed page on the Black Lives Matter website said, “by supporting each other as extended families and ‘villages’ that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.” It’s painfully obvious that any mention of fathers is missing.

The family unit — father included — is the basic building block of society, providing the primary method for teaching children moral values, self-control, and responsible adult behavior. It’s also the long-term solution to preventing crime far more effectively than BLM’s plan to abolish the police.

To solve the crises of crime, incarceration, poverty, and education, we must rebuild the “rock of the family” with strong fathers, as Obama called for. America needs a rebirth of family values and responsible fatherhood.

But instead, Black Lives Matter minimizes black fathers. Rather than look to families for social change, BLM calls for the murder of police officers, justifies looting as slavery reparations, and is linked with most of the more than 600 riots that caused an estimated $2 billion in property damage last year. Its goals and those of its affiliate organizations include abolishing the police and prisons, ending capitalism, and disrupting the Western nuclear family.

The destructive influence of Black Lives Matter has made things worse, not better. Violent crime has skyrocketed in cities implementing BLM’s “defund the police” agenda and where police departments have retreated before rioting mobs. In 2020, the number of black homicide victims increased by more than 1,100.

The real violence epidemic in black communities is not systemic police racism — as BLM would have you believe — but crime. In 2018, police shot and killed 996 people, of whom 209 were black. The same year, there were 14,123 murders in the United States. Over half, or 7,407, of those were black victims. Of single-victim, single-offender situations, at least 89 percent of black victims were killed by black assailants.

In 2020, 15 unarmed people killed by police were black and 21 were white. Those 15 deaths of unarmed black people by police equal only 0.17 percent of the estimated 8,600 deaths of black people by homicide in the same year. Police actually prevent the deaths of black Americans — the reason 81 percent of black Americans want the same number or more police in their communities.

Black Americans, particularly young men, commit violent crime at a rate much higher than their proportion of the population. The black population of the United States is 13 percent, but black offenders committed 52 percent of all homicides between 1980 and 2008.

Obama identified the right source, of both the problem and the solution. Black communities not only have some of the highest rates of violent crime, they also have the highest rate of children born to unmarried mothers — 69 percent overall, and higher in many inner-city neighborhoods.

The crisis of fatherless families is not unique to the black community. The out-of-wedlock birth rate is 52 percent among Hispanic Americans. At 28 percent, the illegitimacy rate among white Americans is higher than what Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed among black families in 1965 when he predicted catastrophic social consequences.

As Obama noted, the effects of fatherlessness on children is devastating. Eighty-five percent of youth inmates, 71 percent of all high school dropouts, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children did not have a father at home. If we truly believe black lives matter, we must separate myth from reality and speak the truth about why so many are being lost.

Mickey Guyton Represents Left’s Next Cultural Conquest: Country Music,"“If you think we live in the land of the free, you should try to be black like me.” This is the chorus to country singer Mickey Guyton’s 2020 song “Black Like Me,” and a focal point of the New Yorker’s latest feature piece on Guyton, titled, “Mickey Guyton Takes On the Overwhelming Whiteness of Country Music.” The gist of the article is pretty simple: country music is racist, and it needs to be disrupted from within by woke artists like Guyton.

Predictably, “Black Like Me,” received a nomination for Best Country Solo Performance at the 2021 Grammy Awards. In 2020, Guyton co-hosted the Academy of Country Music Awards with Keith Urban, where she was nominated for the New Female Artist of the Year award, and during Blackout Tuesday in 2020, Spotify put “Black Like Me” at the top of the Hot Country playlist.

Even though Guyton’s songs are glorified by corporate country and the corporate media, everyday country fans, like myself, haven’t exactly clicked with her music or enjoyed the fact that country radio is constantly shoving it down our throats.

First of all, “Black Like Me” is based on the lie that the American dream does not exist for black or brown Americans. Taking a page out of the BLM mission statement, Guyton’s song overtly maintains that our country is institutionally racist, has made little to no progress since slavery, and if you have melanin in your skin, you may as well stop trying. Basically, if the 1619 project were a country song, “Black Like Me” would be it.

But then again, hopeless victimhood based on left-wing lies are sort of Guyton’s brand. Here are the lyrics to her 2020 single “What Are You Gonna Tell Her,” a song about how women, especially black women, will never make it in the world because of sexism:

She thinks life is fair and God hears every prayer And everyone gets their ever after She thinks love is love and if You work hard, that’s enough Skin’s just skin and it doesn’t matter… But what are you gonna tell her When she’s wrong?… Do you just let her pretend That she could be the president? Would it help us get there any faster? Do you let her think the deck’s not stacked?

These whiney lyrics already seem dated since most of us assume Kamala Harris is poised to become the first female black president within the year due to Biden’s rapid mental decline.

Guyton’s music is based on a divisive falsehood. Moreover, there’s really nothing that makes her songs in any way remarkable or even country. Her sound is far more pop than twangy or rootsy, it doesn’t have a unique or interesting melody, and her lyrics are pedestrian, albeit very progressive.

The problem with Guyton and the Brooklyn-based author of the New Yorker article, Amanda Petrusich, is that neither of them seem to understand anything about country music or fly-over America in general.

Petrusich psychoanalyzes country music, saying the genre has “shifted from mirroring white anxieties to seeding them.” With no evidence, she writes that country music “establish[es] racial divides.”

She also says country music is “often predicated on feelings of nostalgia for an imagined rural past, in which life moved more slowly and the continuation of tradition was paramount,” adding that “This sort of longing for a bygone era is rarely a Black experience, in part because the myth of the ‘good old days’ tends to predate the civil-rights movement.”

I’ll start by saying that outside of Brooklyn, Amanda, rural America does, in fact, exist, and as of 2020, 57.2 million people live in it.

Petrusich’s politically motivated stereotyping of the genre prevents her from understanding the beautiful underlying truth behind authentic country music. Country music is not racist, it is regional. Non-corporate country gives listeners a glimpse into the everyday lives of distinct voices from unique areas across the country. That’s why country music has so many sub-genres (bluegrass, red dirt, honky-tonk, Texas, Tex-Mex/Tejano, outlaw, folk etc.).

Take, for example, Emily Scott Robinson’s “Westward Bound,” a beautiful song about the America “that the Interstate left behind.”

Pass the corn fields and the UFO museum Little churches washed in white With names like Holy Restoration Tabernacle of Eternal Life In the mountains of New Mexico I cross the Great Divide Flip through the empty radio And drive on through the night

Or “Coal Country” a song by Charles Wesley Godwin, a native to West Virginia, whose music captures the beauty, tradition, and pain of the Appalachian hills:

It put a roof over my head And the armor on the tanks in Normandy The lights shone bright in the hands of its care From the western skies to Washington D.C Now it lies broken, high, and cold In its grave of Appalachian stone Coal Country Now we don’t need tokens to a company store That’s what government stamps and codeine’s for We may have won a few battles, but we lost the war Now we’re slaves and poor

Country music also has an uncanny ability to capture the everyday human experience. Flatland Cavalry is a folk band known for its use of the often forgotten fiddle, utilizing it for upbeat tunes and blue ballads. One of my favorites is “Sleeping Alone.” It’s smooth and miserable and clever all at once.

Counting constellations on the popcorn ceiling And staring at your picture on the wall Rays of lonely moonlight slowly slice through the blinds As the tears begin to fall I’m tired of sleeping alone And I just wanna be where you are Tired of saying goodnight through the phone And waking up each morning in the dark Better say a prayer Turn out the light Sigh and hug my pillow tight I’ll be with you soon my dear If only in my dreams

Unfortunately, songs like the ones listed above do not usually get played on country radio. Pop country music like Guyton’s is reflective of a decades-long and growing tension within the country music industry. Motivated by bigger profits, Nashville executives prop up rap-country and pop-country singers so that they can appeal to a larger, cross-genre audience. Consequently, more traditional regional country artists get overlooked by the growing monolithic corporate country sound, leaving hardly any distinction between your local pop and country stations.

Uplifting artists who use traditional, regional sounds would be a positive change for the industry. But Guyton couldn’t care less about the struggling country artists fighting the Nashville machine because she is part of that machine. She is every self-conscious, self-loathing Nashville executive’s affirmative action dream. Her mediocre, politically trendy music has benefited tremendously from the corporate obsession with “diversity” that is now infecting country music.

Indeed, The New Yorker’s Petrusich worries that: “Guyton’s advocacy is so vigorous that it sometimes risks overshadowing her artistry.” But you can be sure Nashville’s virtue signaling executives are not really worried about artistry. They want her politics upfront and center as a shield against the threat of being called racist.

Guyton quite clearly has zero respect for or any understanding of the genre she claims to be part of. She stereotypes all of country music and shames it for not hitting the right intersectional checkmarks. “It’s not enough for just one to make it here and there — it needs to be a sea of Black women, a sea of Latina women, a sea of L.B.G.T.Q. artists,” Guyton tells the New Yorker. “If we don’t see that, then it’s just gonna be the same white guy in a pickup truck with a ball cap, maybe some sneakers.”

The anxiety over the underrepresentation of black singers is a growing concern for corporate country. Guyton knows this and she is using it to her advantage.

To be clear, there are many talented black country stars like Darius Rucker, Yola, Cowboy Troy, Kane Brown, and Jimmie Allen. Aversion to Guyton’s music specifically doesn’t make someone a racist. I love Yola’s “Ride Out In The Country,” because it’s simple, soulful, and perfect for, as she sings, “take[ing] a ride out in the country.” By contrast, “Black Like Me” is politically charged, unremarkable, and a pop song.

Something I don’t hear Guyton or Petrusich complaining about is the massive over-representation of black artists in R&B, rap, hip-hop, funk, and blues. Is that racism, too? No, because that doesn’t fit the critical race theory narrative. There is zero evidence that country music is perpetuating racism in America, just like the overrepresentation of black artists in multiple other genres is not perpetuating racism.

Country music showcases lifestyles, homes, families, traditions, pains, and joys of people who tend to live in, as Robinson sings, “the America that the interstate left behind.” Leftists don’t want to amplify the voices and messages found in country music because it tends to run counter to their goal of establishing a cultural reset. They want to reimagine the genre on their terms. It’s part of the reason why they cheer on the destructive nature of rap and bro-country. It’s also why they fawn over b-list woke singers like Guyton.

As a Latina woman, I never found that my race inhibited my ability to love country music. I didn’t have to be white or grow up on a farm to love Alan Jackson’s “Gone Country,” or consider myself a redneck to blast Gretchen Wilson’s “redneck woman” as I’m driving down the freeway. For me, it was never about skin color.

I gravitate toward country because of its incredible story-telling powers, its ability to capture human emotion and the everyman’s experience, and because it reflects my values. Good country music is honest, raw, American, and for all these reasons, worth protecting from those who seek to destroy it.

Why Is Indiana GOP Letting Tax Dollars Fund Critical Race Theory?,"State agencies in Republican-controlled Indiana are providing taxpayer dollars and marketing assistance to a far-left organization that is bringing two prominent critical race theory activists to a statewide teachers’ conference this summer.

Indiana Black Expo, a group that bills itself as “celebrat[ing] cultural diversity and inclusiveness across all races, ethnicities, nationalities, generations, socioeconomic levels and religious affiliations,” will host its annual education conference from July 13 to 15. Dena Simmons and Dr. Bettina L. Love, two activists who frequently rake in thousands from taxpayers to lecture on “systemic racism,” will deliver keynote speeches. Both did not respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.

Simmons became the subject of national controversy earlier this year when whistleblower teachers in Naperville, Illinois, documented her publicly funded training accusing “whiteness” of damaging education. In a widely viewed YouTube video, Simmons says those who do not support “antiracism” in education — an ideology that charges the United States with “systemic racism” and accused people of evil based on their inborn skin color — are “white supremacists.”

“Whiteness will do whatever is necessary to protect its power. People will die of whiteness before giving it up,” Simmons wrote in an Instagram post in March. Simmons has also praised the error-riddled, racially charged, and anti-American New York Times school curricula known as the 1619 Project.

More than 5,000 teachers and professionals attended the Indiana Black Expo last year, most of them working in public institutions. The title of this year’s conference is: “Education Equity: The Role of Schools and Universities in Leveling the Playing Field.”

Familiar People, Familiar Topics

Black Expo President Tanya McKinzie did not respond to an inquiry asking how much Simmons and Love are being paid for their speeches. Several state agencies fund the outfit with taxpayer dollars.

“This year’s theme, ‘Education Equity: The Role of Schools and Universities in Leveling the Playing Field,’ presents an opportunity to explore approaches to enhance culturally responsive culture in our schools and universities,” McKinzie told The Federalist.

Simmons, who The Federalist reported was paid more than $10,500, or $175 a minute, to speak to the Naperville, Illinois public school district earlier this year via Zoom, will speak for 75 minutes at the Indiana conference. She is the founder of LiberatED, “a collective focused on developing school-based resources at the intersection of social and emotional learning (SEL), racial justice, and healing.”

The former Yale staffer is known for her broad generalizations critical of white people as a category. A whistleblower who previously spoke to The Federalist and attended her lecture in Naperville said she claimed Americans are “spiritually murdering” students and that “our education is based on a foundation of whiteness.”

Simmons’ Indiana keynote is titled “From Surviving to Thriving: Creating Equitable Environments Through Emotional Intelligence and Culturally Relevant Practices.” Its description reads, in part:

During this interactive session, participants will explore impostor syndrome, emotional intelligence, and culturally relevant pedagogy, and anti-racist practices. Through narrative, Dr. Simmons will discuss how the intersection of emotionally intelligent and culturally relevant practices can create equitable and welcoming communities, where everyone can learn in the comfort of their skin.

Love, a University of Georgia professor who frequently lectures on “Abolitionist Teaching, anti-racism, Hip Hop education, Black girlhood, queer youth, Hip Hop feminism, art-based education to foster youth civic engagement, and issues of diversity and inclusion,” according to her website, will speak for 85 minutes to Hoosier teachers. The title of her speech is, “We Gon’ Be Alright, But That Ain’t Alright: Abolitionist Teaching and the Pursuit of Educational Freedom.”

This is not the first time Simmons and Love have spoken together at conferences aimed at publicly funded educators. Last summer, both spoke on a panel called “Abolitionist Teaching and the Future of Our Schools” with critical race theory consultant Gholdy Muhammad and Brian Jones, associate director of education at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

‘It’s My Obligation’

Multiple state government entities are involved in the conference, including state-funded universities. The Indiana Department of Child Services, Department of Education, and Commission for Higher Education are listed as conference “partners” on the Black Expo organization’s website.

Child Services told The Federalist the state agency paid Black Expo $20,000 this year. Noelle Russell, a spokeswoman for Child Services, said in an email that “the agency supports a number of community initiatives and events but is not involved in the organization or execution of the conference.”

The Department of Education responded to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request that “it was determined the Department does not maintain the records you are requesting, as the Department is not a financial sponsor of this event.” However, Secretary of Education Katie Jenner, appointed by Republican Gov. Eric J. Holcomb and making a taxpayer-provided annual salary of $175,000, will speak at the conference on the third day.

An open records request showed the commission did not directly throw money to the 2021 conference either. However, documents obtained by The Federalist show the Indiana Higher Education Commission has paid Black Expo $7,500 in taxpayer funds during the last three years. That sum went toward the 2019 conference. The service contract can be read below:

Another person appointed by the governor as a leader of this state agency will also speak at this critical race theory-infused conference.

Teresa S. Lubbers, the commissioner of the group whom state taxpayers pay more than $220,000 annually, will “present the data that has been driving conversations around equity and education at the state level.”

Lubbers claimed in an interview with The Federalist that the commission “has no involvement with critical race theory.” Yet the state agency Lubbers runs sent out an invitation for the event through the agency’s state-run email, jointly signed by Lubbers and McKinzie and featuring the state’s seal and branding.

The invitation can be viewed below.

“I think it’s my obligation to provide information to any group that wants to know information about how students are doing,” Lubbers said when asked if she believes it is reasonable for a taxpayer-funded state agency to lend a hand to organizations and speakers who promote critical race theory. “That’s my obligation.”

Dr. Beverley Pitts, chair of the commission, indicated to The Federalist that she had no knowledge of the conference speakers prior to seeing the newsletter. Commission Secretary Jud Fisher and others on the commission appointed by the governor declined to comment.

“You know, I’m not involved in any of those kinds of activities,” Pitts said. “In fact, I learned about it with our kind of newsletter.”

Big Government, Big Business

Two taxpayer-funded institutions, Indiana University and Indiana State University, are also listed as sponsors of the event.

“For more than five decades, Indiana University (IU) has been a proud supporter of the Indiana Black Expo (IBE) Summer Celebration, one of the largest African American cultural events in the country,” the school’s website states. “During the weeklong celebration, Indiana University partners with IBE to ensure educational equity for all.”

Additionally, the university outlines what will be discussed:

Planned topics include equity challenges in K-12 and higher education during COVID-19; best practices with how to teach and engage students with technology; effective engagement of students through personalized learning and blended learning environments; identification of access gaps for students and teachers navigating a non-traditional learning environment and necessary supports; and fighting educational inequities in the face of COVID-19.

Several Indiana University professors will speak at the conference, in addition to the university’s Dr. James C. Wimbush, vice president for diversity, equity, and multicultural affairs, Assistant Vice President for Diversity Education Monica M. Johnson, and Director of Diversity and Inclusion Rachel Ann Brooks.

“Indiana University is deeply committed to cultivating an environment that advocates inclusion and equity for all,” Winbush said in a statement. “That commitment has been the driving force behind IU’s position at the forefront of diversity efforts in higher education as well as its long tradition of opening doors for underrepresented, underserved, and minority groups. As part of this commitment, IU continues to be a proud supporter of Indiana Black Expo.”

One of the private groups listed as funding the conference is Lilly Endowment, Inc., a non-profit that frequently contributes to left-wing causes, especially in-state. Documents reviewed by The Federalist show the foundation funneled more than $1.1 million to Black Expo in 2020.

Where Are Indiana’s Republicans?

Many Indiana Republicans were contacted about the state resources being expended towards this event, but only one responded. Those who did not return a request for comment on the matter include Senate Education Committee head Jeff Ratz, Senate Education Committee member Dennis Kruse, Senate Majority Leader Rodric Bray, and House Speaker Todd Huston. The Indiana GOP could not be reached for comment as well.

Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office also did not return a request for comment.

Lawmakers were asked (a) whether they believe this is a good use of state taxpayer money and (b) if they support Simmons’ reported comments that Americans “are spiritually murdering” students and that “our education is based on a foundation of whiteness.”

House Education Committee Chairman Bob Behning responded to The Federalist’s inquiry and condemned critical race theory, but did not say whether he will take any action regarding the state government’s involvement in this conference.

“I don’t support critical race theory curriculum being taught in Indiana’s public schools,” Behning said. “This polarizing issue is top-of-mind for many concerned families in our state and across the nation. We should be focused on bringing Hoosiers together, and ensuring every student has the opportunity to succeed throughout their entire academic career.”

Chelsea Wolfe’s Olympic Flag Burning Promise Is A Sign Of Decline,"“My goal is to win the Olympics so I can burn a US flag on the podium,” wrote transgender BMX freestyle rider Chelsea Wolfe in a March 2020 Facebook post. Wolfe, a male, is now that much closer to making his dream come true after he was selected on Monday to be an alternate for Team USA’s women’s BMX freestyle event at the upcoming Olympic Games in Tokyo.

Leaving aside the fact that Wolfe is a man and should not be competing against women, his 2020 statement makes one wonder why he would even be picked as an Olympic athlete, since he clearly has no respect for the country he will be representing.

It turns out this doesn’t matter much, since the only pushback Wolfe has received is coming from conservative media, with others either not caring at all or praising him for “making history” as a trans athlete.

Another Olympic Protest

More than 50 years ago, two American track athletes, John Carlos and Tommie Smith, made their own acts of political protest on the Olympic podium. Both men raised their black-gloved fists and lowered their heads during the American National Anthem at the Mexico City 1968 Olympics. The iconic photo of the two men outstretching their arms into black power fists captured the zeitgeist of the late 1960s in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and great racial unrest.

Smith and Carlos, winners of the gold and bronze medals in the 200-meter sprint, respectively, were also dressed in symbolic protest. They wore black socks and no shoes to symbolize black American poverty and a black glove to express black strength and unity. Smith also wore a scarf for black pride, and Carlos beads, in memory of lynching victims.

A wave of boos “rippled” through the spectators as the pair descended from the podium and left the field. Two days later, Smith and Carlos were suspended from the team by the U.S. Olympic Committee because the men violated the International Olympic Committee’s strict rule prohibiting political statements and protests (a rule that is still active today).

Upon returning home, the men were slammed by the public and the media, including some members of the black media, for not showing respect for the United States on the world stage. Indeed, a large number of Americans, including Americans who believed in the civil rights movement, viewed the protest as an insult to the United States.

“East Germans, Russians, even Cubans, all stand at attention when The Star-Spangled Banner or any other national anthem is played,” wrote a Time Magazine journalist in 1968, contrasting other nation’s respect for the flag with Carlos and Smith’s lack thereof.

Sports editor of the “Baltimore Afro-American” Sam Lacy, who had been instrumental during the push to integrate Major League Baseball two decades earlier, wrote that he was embarrassed by the Nazi “heil-like salute,” which he said was “childish and in extremely poor taste.”

None of this is to downplay the very real racial discrimination that existed in 1968, or to comment on whether Carlos and Smith should have raised their fists. It merely underscores that in that day, even those with severe criticisms of their country maintained those alongside honor and respect.

A Decline In Patriotism

John Carlos, Tommie Smith, and Chelsea Wolfe represent a major shift in the United States. What is the bigotry Wolfe is fighting? Is it even remotely comparable to what black Americans were facing during the civil rights movement (especially since burning the flag is far more extreme than the black power fist)? Wolfe certainly cannot claim he is being discriminated against as a transgender athlete, since he is being allowed to participate in women’s sports.

It’s not clear why Wolfe wants to burn the American flag at the podium, and he doesn’t really have to answer this question since many Americans don’t seem to care.

In 1968, by contrast, the American media was so thirsty to know why Carlos and Smith were protesting the United States that Carlos had to tell a group of reporters in the athlete’s village: “Next man who come up and puts a camera in my face or a speaker up in my face, I’m going to knock them down and jump on them, you hear?”

The American people in the 1960s saw Carlos and Smith’s fists as a personal attack on America. They did not want to see the United States be defamed and embarrassed in front of the world, and especially her enemies, like the Soviet Union and Cuba.

Things have changed since then. Wolfe doesn’t need a chance to burn the American flag at the podium. Symbolically he already has, because the United States hand-picked him to be a representative of America internationally. Was Wolfe forced to apologize or take back his statement before accepting his place on the team? Nope, and I’m not surprised since that kind of rhetoric has become commonplace among American athletes in 2021.

Even if Americans are not paying too much attention to Wolfe, you can bet the Chinese are. This year, the genocidal Chinese government slammed the United States, saying it is a racist country in order to deflect from their human rights abuses committed against the Uyghur Muslims and in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Can our president defend the United States against such slander? No, because he has repeatedly stated that the United States — not China or Lebanon or India, the United States — is institutionally racist.

Can American citizens defend themselves? No. Thanks to taxpayer-funded critical race theory, millions of Americans believe that the United States is an evil, inherently racist country. Indeed, China’s slanderous talking points were handed to them on a silver platter by Black Lives Matter and the Biden administration.

Given how strong of a reaction there was to Carlos and Smith raising their fists, it’s not hard to imagine how much stronger the reaction would have been if an Olympic athlete threatened to burn the American flag at the podium in 1968. The shift in the American psyche is reflected in the numbers as well, with American pride plummeting to a record low in 2020.

National Decay

What we are witnessing is a decline in our culture, ethos, and national credibility. It’s no secret that China is beating us in a space race we aren’t even competing in and that they now have the world’s largest navy. What are we doing to meet this challenge? NASA has launched “Mission Equity” (no seriously, that’s not a joke), and our military feeds American soldiers’ spirits with Ibram X. Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist,” instead of notions of equality, patriotism, and camaraderie.

It’s gotten so bad that we can’t even recruit soldiers based on patriotism anymore. Just take a look at our military recruitment ad compared to that of Russia and China.

America was founded on principles that freed slaves during the Civil War, granted women the right to vote, established authentic equality during the civil rights movement, and triumphed over the Soviet Union and communism. Today, our founding principles, the documents in which they are contained, and the men who wrote them have been smeared and denounced. Our sense of self and love of country is eroding.

The Olympics have always been a powerful tool for measuring world power and dominance. Why else would the Chinese government fund grueling Chinese “sports schools” to raise Olympians?

That’s why Wolfe’s comments are not just an innocuous Facebook post. It has a profound effect on our enemies and on the American psyche. The world is not only laughing at us, they are taking measure of our weaknesses, and they will use it against us. They know a self-loathing nation is a weak nation.

"By The Left's Standards, Vaccine Mandates Clearly Institutionalize Racism","While 46 percent of white Americans have received at least one COVID vaccine shot by now, only 33 percent of black Americans have done the same, according to the federal data available as of June 21 and analyzed most recently by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).

This means that, under the “disparate impact” standard now used to convict a workplace of racial discrimination under federal regulations and to accuse the United States of “systemic racism,” any use of vaccine status to reward or punish employees or citizens also comprises systemic racism. So, for example, using COVID vaccination status to determine who may get tickets to public events or requiring people to be vaccinated to keep their jobs will turn away larger percentages of black Americans than of white Americans.

“Overall, across these 40 states, the percent of White people who have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose (46%) was roughly 1.4 times higher than the rate for Black people (33%) and 1.2 times higher than the rate for Hispanic people (38%) as of June 21, 2021,” KFF reports. In some states, the racial imbalance was even higher.

“White people had a higher vaccination rate compared to Hispanic people in all reporting states, except Virginia, Vermont, and Missouri, and a higher rate than Black people in every reporting state, except Oregon, Alaska, and Idaho,” KFF notes.

In New York, 51 percent of white people and 35 percent of black people have gotten at least one COVID shot, making white people 1.5 times as able to get access to locations under the state’s vaccine passport system, Excelsior. The alternative to vaccination under Excelsior is constant COVID testing, which again would be disproportionately applied to black citizens.

On just about every poll, African Americans and Latino Americans have registered higher levels both of COVID caution and vaccine hesitancy than white and Asian Americans over the entirety of the virus outbreak. COVID vaccines have been widely available for free in regularly accessed locations like grocery stores and pharmacy chains for at least a month nationwide, meaning that disparate levels of COVID vaccination at this point are not entirely due to lack of access among blacks and Latinos, but a greater preference for not receiving the shot.

Disparate impact, also called “adverse impact,” is the legal theory that “Discrimination can result from neutral employment policies and practices which are applied evenhandedly to all employees and applicants, but which have the effect of disproportionately excluding women and/or minorities,” according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In other words, this legal theory says that racism can be proven when a neutral policy applied equally to all results in greater effects on non-white people. That’s exactly the outcome in the case of vaccine passports or requiring COVID vaccination for employment or college enrollment when approximately one-half as many black Americans are vaccinated as white Americans.

Despite the legal and social implications of effectively banning higher percentages of black people from their premises, many major employers, especially universities, have demanded COVID vaccination as a condition of employment or university enrollment. Many large hospital and other health-care employers have also mandated COVID vaccines for employees.

The latest numbers show white unemployment at 5.1 percent, black unemployment at 9.1 percent, and Latino unemployment at 7.3 percent.

Approximately 450 colleges and universities so far have announced they will require students to be vaccinated to enroll this summer or fall. At many campuses, such as Indiana University and the University of Notre Dame, students are filing lawsuits in response.

Many governors and counties have also relaxed mask mandates and social distancing rules for the vaccinated, including Colorado, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin. This happened after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued guidance affirming that those vaccinated don’t need to wear masks indoors.

Under “disparate impact” rules used by federal agencies such as the EEOC, however, this will have clearly discriminatory effects. Such rules would have the effect of banning higher percentages of black people from places based on their medical history. Or if unvaccinated employees are, say, still required to wear masks at work while the vaccinated can lose the masks, disproportionately more black employees will then be forced to publicly disclose their private medical decision by continuing to wear masks.

Despite racial implications like these, the EEOC recently issued guidance saying employers can mandate COVID vaccines as a condition of employment. The guidance, however, seems as clear as mud, also telling employers that while they can mandate vaccines they can’t do so in a way that would produce disparate racial impacts or violate other regulations such as those protecting medical privacy — which means they can’t actually mandate vaccines for employees. This is probably why lawyers told news outlets the EEOC guidance is a lawsuit bonanza.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/24/by-the-lefts-standards-covid-vaccine-mandates-clearly-institutionalize-racism/,2021-06-24
9 Most Insane Lies About Georgia's Voter ID Law In DOJ's Lawsuit,"On Friday, the Biden administration filed a 46-page complaint against the state of Georgia, alleging the state’s Election Integrity Act of 2021 violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. For a lawsplainer of the Voting Rights Act, read here. But for a taste of the surreal state of the U.S. Department of Justice under President Joe Biden, follow along.

1. It’s Still 1965

Given that on occasion President Joe Biden believes he’s still in the Senate, it should come as no surprise that his Department of Justice believes it’s still 1965.

In alleging that provisions in the Georgia voting-integrity law violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the DOJ opened its complaint by proclaiming that the Georgia legislature enacted the law “against the backdrop of Georgia’s history of discrimination against Black Georgians. ” The complaint continued with an entire section headed “The State of Georgia’s History of Discrimination,” which stressed, “the history of official racial discrimination against Black citizens in Georgia with regard to voting is longstanding, well-documented, and recognized by Federal courts.”

The DOJ drafted its complaint as though that reality still exists and acting oblivious to the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder, even though a few paragraphs later the Biden administration noted that Georgia had been subject to the preclearance requirement of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act until 2013, when the Supreme Court decided Shelby County.

But as the Supreme Court made clear in Shelby County, since Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 “things have changed dramatically,” and “conditions have changed significantly.” At the time the Voting Rights Act passed, “the blight of racial discrimination in voting” had “infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century.”

Accordingly, as part of the Voting Rights Act, Congress required states that had maintained tests or devices as a prerequisite to voting such as literacy and knowledge tests or good moral character requirements, “and had less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election,” to obtain federal permission before enacting any law related to voting. Georgia was one of nine states subject to Section 5’s preclearance mandate.

However, after recounting the extreme circumstances that originally justified Section 5’s usurpation of state control and disparate treatment of the states, the Supreme Court concluded that “the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.”

For instance, the Supreme Court noted, by 2009, “the racial gap in voter registration and turnout [was] lower in the States originally covered by § 5 than it [was] nationwide,” and the covered states saw near parity between black and white voter turnout and registration rates. This reality led the Supreme Court in Shelby County to declare Section 5 unconstitutional, and Georgia and her sister states thus free to pass laws regulating voting without seeking federal government approval.

Yet to read the DOJ’s complaint against Georgia, one would think nothing had changed. Or maybe a more apt assessment would be that the men and women running the Biden administration’s DOJ want Americans to think nothing had changed. Well, and that the DOJ honchos don’t like the Shelby County decision and the Supreme Court stripping the power of federal bureaucrats to micromanage state election systems.

2. Georgia Republicans Are a Bunch of Racists

Relatedly, the DOJ’s complaint point-blank accuses the Georgia legislature of racism. In enacting the Election Integrity Act of 2021, “the Georgia General Assembly intended to deny or abridge the right of Black Georgians to vote on account of race or color,” the complaint opens.

Significantly, to sue under Section 2, the DOJ does not need to allege intentional racism. Rather, the federal government need only claim that the challenged “standard, practice, or procedure. . . results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.”

While elsewhere in the complaint the government focuses on the results of the challenged provisions to claim the impact disproportionately affects black voters, the DOJ didn’t leave it there, as it could have, instead of seeing fit to brand the Georgia General Assembly as full of racists.

3. Racists Exist, Ergo, the Law Is Racist

Besides calling the Georgia legislature racist, the DOJ’s complaint wants to hold the state responsible for racists everywhere. For instance, someone created “a GIF with a slow-swinging noose aimed at [an election worker]” and later that same election worker “faced death threats,” the complaint alleges.

Horrible? Yes. Relevant in any way? No.

That didn’t stop the DOJ from including the allegation, as well as another that noted that “one phone caller threatened to behead Reverend Warnock and referred to the church at which he is a paster, Ebenezer Baptist — the church once pastored by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. — using a vile racial epithet.” The church, the DOJ explained, had to filter comments on its social media pages given the significant number of racist comments related to Rev. Warnock’s candidacy” for U.S. Senate.

Another allegation noted that “during the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial contest, a racist robocall referred to candidate Stacey Abrams as “Negress Stacey Abrams” and “a poor man’s Aunt Jemima.”

Again, horrible and, as the DOJ says, vile. But completely irrelevant to whether the Georgia law violates the Voting Acts Right.

4. A Complaint Is Not a Campaign Ad

The Biden administration’s peddling of random and anonymous racist comments as reflective of both the Georgia legislature and the state as a whole mirrored Democrats’ campaign strategy over the years to convince blacks not to vote for Republicans. The irrelevant allegations merely added some legalese to charges, such as Biden in 2012 that, “They’re going to put y’all back in chains.”

Several other portions of the complaint likewise sounded strikingly similar to campaign commercials touting Democratic candidates. “Vice President Kamala Harris became the first Black and Indian-American Vice President ever elected,” the complaint boosted. And “on January 5, 2021, with strong turnout among Black voters, the State of Georgia elected its first Black Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock, and its first Jewish-American Senator, Jon Ossoff,” the complaint cheered.

The most striking of the allegations came later when the DOJ claimed as a reason to believe the law was racist that “many elected officials in Georgia have not been responsive to the particularized needs of Black residents.”

5. One Thing Has Nothing to Do with the Other

Likewise irrelevant, yet included in the DOJ’s complaint, were references to Stop the Steal, and litigation about claims of voter fraud in 2020.

“Despite a dearth of evidence,” the Biden administration wrote, “accusations of fraud around the absentee voting process and the tabulation of votes circulated widely.” The complaint continued, “lawyers behind several lawsuits seeking to overturn presidential election results in multiple states hosted a press conference at a ‘Stop the Steal’ event” where calls “Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to be locked up,” were made.

The DOJ further stressed that “a barrage of lawsuits alleging voter fraud were brought.” Why, exactly, was that a problem? Here’s the DOJ’s answer: “These lawsuits often included allegations focused on counties containing significant numbers of Black voters and other voters of color.”

Similarly problematic in the DOJ’s view was that at least one Georgia senator whose committee bore responsibility for handling the voting legislation had attended a senate hearing at which unfounded claims of voter fraud were presented. What does that have to do with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act? Nothing.

Probably the most shocking irrelevancy, however, was the DOJ’s beef that “a number of lawmakers in the Georgia Senate, who subsequently helped draft, promote, and pass SB 202, issued a statement in support of an unsuccessful lawsuit brought by the State of Texas asking the United States Supreme Court to overturn Georgia’s election results.”

Not only does this allegation have nothing to do with Section 2, the DOJ also ignored that Texas’s complaint about Georgia’s handling of the election presented a constitutional claim premised on the Electors Clause and the state’s failure to conduct the legislatively mandated signature checks and its use of dropbox voting — something the legislature had not provided for.

While the federal government might find the Electors Clause claim meritless, it isn’t exactly a good look for Department of Justice to criticize a state for seeking redress in the courts for claimed constitutional violations. And it is laughable to further suggest that the Election Integrity Act of 2021 violates Section 2 because some lawmakers involved in that legislation supported Texas’s litigation.

6. It’s a Partisan Law

Equally laughable are the DOJ’s allegations concerning the supporters of the new Georgia voting law.

“On February 17, 2021, SB 202 was introduced in the Senate with only white sponsors,” the DOJ wrote in some sort of “gotcha” moment. The DOJ then outdid itself by complaining that the Senate passed the bill “along party lines with no support from Black legislators,” and the House did the same.

They then complain Kemp signed the law “behind closed doors and before a group of supporters that did not include any people of color. When Rep. Park Cannon, who is Black, attempted to witness the signing, she was arrested.”

Is it strange that the governor would not invite a representative who called the legislation “Jim Crow 2.0” to its signing? Or that she would be arrested after officers told her to stop pounding on the governor’s door during the signing ceremony?

7. Problems, What Problems?

The Biden administration’s complaint also takes a hilarious-if-it-weren’t-so-sad spin on the legitimate concerns that drove passage of the Election Integrity Act of 2021, with the DOJ acting as if there were no problems in Georgia’s administration of the 2020 election.

The DOJ spins began early in its refusal to even acknowledge the name of Georgia’s law, the Election Integrity Act of 2021, instead, saying the bill is known as “Georgia Senate Bill 202,” and referring to the voter-integrity law as SB 202 throughout the complaint.

Then, the Biden administration ticked through the challenged provisions, which include the prohibition on the government from distributing unsolicited absentee ballot applications and the bar on private organizations from distributing duplicate absent ballot applications. The DOJ also objected to the requirement that in requesting an absentee ballot, voters without a state-issued driver’s license provide a photocopy of another form of identification, which could include a utility bill.

The lawsuit further alleged that limits on the time period for registrants to request a ballot, limiting absentee ballot drop boxes, barring out-of-precinct ballots, and banning distribution of food or drink to persons waiting in line all violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

For anyone knowledgeable about the issues that plagued Georgia and other states, the DOJ’s arguments proved guffaw-inducing. Consider, for instance, the DOJ’s complaint that “SB 202” now requires voters to provide identification for requesting an absentee ballot.

“Since 2006, in-person voters in Georgia have been required to show photo identification,” the complaint read, but “prior to SB 202, absentee voters were exempt from this requirement.” “Instead,” the DOJ explained, “election officials would compare the signature on a voter’s absentee ballot envelope with the voter’s signature in the voter file.” But now, to the horror of the DOJ, instead of using a signature match, Georgia requires voters to provide identification to request a ballot then again when the ballot is submitted.

This complaint is pretty rich given that Georgia was previously sued for requiring a signature match and to settle that litigation the state entered into an agreement establishing a stringent process for rejecting applications based on a mismatch in the signatures: In effect, the cumbersome procedures agreed to ended the signature requirement for the 2020 election.

Yet the DOJ now complains that it is too burdensome for black voters to provide their driver’s license or state identification number, or another identifying document such as a utility bill, to request an absentee ballot.

Similarly, in complaining that Georgia’s new law tightens the use of dropboxes, the DOJ ignores two main issues the legislation sought to address. First, Georgia’s legislature had never approved the use of dropboxes. That supposed “authorization” came from the State Election Board.

But the Electors Clause of the Constitution mandates that state legislatures determine the rules for federal elections and not unelected bureaucrats or judges. Thus, the Georgia legislature’s approval of drop boxes actually expanded voting opportunities from what the legislature had previously authorized.

Second, the DOJ’s complaint that the Georgia law limits the number and locations of drop boxes ignores that the flood of drop boxes used in 2020 were not properly monitored and ballots were not properly safeguarded. For instance, earlier this year, Georgia’s secretary of state referred three counties “for investigation after those counties failed to do their absentee ballot transfer forms in violation of Georgia Rules and Regulation.” Also, two weeks ago, the secretary of state announced an investigation into Fulton County following revelations that it “is unable to produce all ballot drop box transfer documents.”

8. Left Hand, Meet Far-Left Hand

While in its lawsuit against Georgia, the Biden administration claims that Georgia’s requirement that voters cast ballots in the proper precinct violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, just a few months ago, the Biden administration agreed that Arizona’s out-of-precinct voting law was valid.

That admission came in the form of a letter to the Supreme Court in the case of Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, following Biden’s inauguration. The Trump administration had previously submitted an amicus curiae, or friend of the court brief, supporting Arizona’s voting-integrity legislation that banned ballot harvesting and required voters to cast ballots in the proper precinct. After the Biden administration took over, it informed the high court that “it does not disagree with the conclusion in that brief that neither Arizona measure violates Section 2’s results test.”

Yet now, the Biden administration claims that Georgia’s statute barring out-of-precinct voting violates Section 2. It’s almost as if the Biden administration has something against the state of Georgia.

9. How Do you Make Sausage?

The bottom line, after nearly 50 pages, is that the Biden administration just does not like the fact that the Georgia legislature passed the Election Integrity Act of 2021, and the complaint unwittingly makes clear that is the real beef the DOJ has with the new law. How else to explain the DOJ’s allegations related to the legislative process, and its complaint, for instance, that one of the law’s bill sponsors had indicated that a future bill would include a provision not later included in the bill as past? Or the tedious detailing of the process by which the bill passed?

It’s almost as if Biden forgot how the Obama-Biden administration squeezed through the so-called Affordable Care Act.

Documents: Indiana State University Funds Critical Race Theory,"Indiana State University, a red-state taxpayer-funded institution with an endowment of $70.1 million, spent tens of thousands of dollars to co-sponsor an education conference that is giving a platform to critical race theory activists.

Financial documents reviewed by The Federalist upon receipt of a public records request show Indiana State has funneled a total of $95,000 to Black Expo, Inc., a far-left nonprofit. The group hosts an annual education conference for primarily public school and public university teachers. This year’s conference is titled “Education Equity: The Role of Schools and Universities in Leveling the Playing Field.”

For the 2021 conference, the documents show, Indiana State sent $27,500 to Black Expo, the same number as its contribution last year, and just shy of its $40,000 contribution in 2019.

As The Federalist reported earlier, Black Expo’s conference slated for July 13 to 15 will feature Dena Simmons and Dr. Bettina L. Love. The “anti-racist” speakers, who frequently lecture on “systemic racism” and “white privilege,” will deliver keynote speeches for an unknown sum.

Tanya McKinzie, president of Black Expo, declined to say how much Simmons and Love are raking in. Instead, McKinzie said the conference “presents an opportunity to explore approaches to enhance culturally responsive culture in our schools and universities.”

Simmons will lecture on “psychological and emotional safety through emotional intelligence, cultural responsivity, and anti-racist practices,” and Love on “the struggles and the possibilities of committing ourselves to an abolitionist goal of educational freedom, as opposed to reform, and moving beyond what she calls the educational survival complex.”

Neither Simmons nor Love responded to The Federalist’s request for comment.

As a benefit of sponsoring this year’s conference, Indiana State is receiving an advertisement blitz and the ability to participate directly in the conference. Receipts show the $27,500 earns the taxpayer-funded institution the following.

“ISU listed as a co-sponsor of the Education Conference”

“Opportunity to conduct a workshop during the Education Conference”

“ISU’s logo on video screen signage”

“ISU’s logo included on all e-blast marketing advertising the event”

“ISU’s logo included in the program”

“A print ad will be included in the Education Conference program (ad to be provided by ISU)

“Representation on the Education Conference steering committee”

“ISU’s logo and link on IBE website”

Spokesman Mark Alesia for Indiana State defended the university’s participation in Black Expo, noting it is pleased to continue its relationship with the group.

“Indiana State University did not choose the speakers for this conference but supports free speech, a bedrock value of this institution,” Alesia told The Federalist. “ISU is a longtime sponsor and exhibitor at Indiana Black Expo, which offers significant opportunities to connect with alumni and prospective students. We are proud of our graduates who have, and have had, leadership positions in the organization. Indiana Black Expo helps connect young people in Indiana to higher education institutions like ISU while inspiring individuals of the endless possibilities for success that come with earning a college degree.”

Alesia declined to comment after asked in a follow-up question whether the university will continue to stand by the conference given its lurch toward critical race theory.

The brand appeal for the state university appears to be a driving force in its relationship with the non-profit. Indiana State’s 2019 contributions to Black Expo’s week-long “summer celebration” earned it a great deal. As a benefit of being recognized as a “Crystal Level” sponsor, the school received the following:

“ISU’s logo on Business Conference and Mayor’s Breakfast Signage”

“ISU’s Listing on Business Conference and Mayor’s Printed Materials”

“ISU’s Name on Video Screens at Corporate Luncheon

“Half Page Color Ad in Summer Celebration Event Guide”

“6 Public Announcements in Exhibition Hall During Three-Day Exhibition Hall”

“10’x15′ Exhibit Space in Sponsor Zone”

“Table of Ten (10) at Corporate Luncheon”

“Table of Ten (10) at Mayor’s Breakfast”

Indiana State is hardly the only taxpayer-funded group to have involvement in the conference.

Indiana University is named in the title on the conference’s website and is also a co-sponsor. Several professors from the school will deliver speeches, including, Dr. James C. Wimbush, vice president for diversity, equity, and multicultural affairs, Assistant Vice President for Diversity Education Monica M. Johnson, and Director of Diversity and Inclusion Rachel Ann Brooks.

“For more than five decades, Indiana University (IU) has been a proud supporter of the Indiana Black Expo (IBE) Summer Celebration, one of the largest African American cultural events in the country,” the school’s website states. “During the weeklong celebration, Indiana University partners with IBE to ensure educational equity for all.”

Multiple government agencies in the Republican-run state are participating in the conference. As documents by The Federalist last week show, the state’s Department of Child Services paid Black Expo $20,000 this year. Representatives from the Department of Education and Commission for Higher Education will speak, and the commission has sent the group $7,500 in the last three years. All three agencies are listed as “partners” on Black Expo’s website.

Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office did not respond to a request for comment, nor did several other Republicans in the Indiana General Assembly. It remains unclear if conservatives in office will take action.

Below are the full check requests from Indiana State to Black Expo, which The Federalist obtained with an open records request.

I Shouldn’t Be Forced Into Politics To Play College Sports,"“Black Lives Matter is not political, it’s basic human rights,” my coaching staff and teammates heading our new “Call to Action Committee” told me and the other team members after practice. They were responding to some of the concerns I had expressed prior to the team meeting.

By the next game, while running out of the tunnel 10 of my 13 Davidson College teammates and all four of my coaches were wearing T-shirts with “Black Lives Matter” bannered across the front. When the national anthem played and with our U.S. Army veteran team doctor behind us, most of my team dropped to one knee in protest of America’s “institutional racism.”

The virtue signaling was clear: those wearing the T-shirt and those on their knees supported basic human rights, and the rest of us simply did not.

Political messaging in sports isn’t new, but the grip and scale this possesses over sports is. Administrators providing collegiate athletes the platform to speak out on important issues has transformed athletics into a system of coercive speech. Today, athletes and coaches with fashionable views are pressuring their programs into mirroring their beliefs and being applauded by the media and universities for doing it. But is anyone stopping for a moment to question whether the players protesting really want to be?

The partisan social justice messaging on such public display unjustly forced me to make a choice between compromising my beliefs in front of my family and friends or “out” myself as someone holding different opinions. I chose the latter, but in the face of cancel culture and team pressures other athletes are understandably not as willing.

Numerous popular social justice initiatives are tied to partisan politics, and their symbolic nature and all-or-nothing approach leaves no room for nuanced opinions or discussion. From the audience’s perspective, you’re either wearing the shirt or you’re not, you’re either kneeling for the anthem or you’re standing. The campaigns are designed to publicly lump non-participants into a category of ignorance that inevitably leads to divisions and frustrations within the locker room.

But the fact is, Black Lives Matter—something any decent person affirms as a concept—titles an organization that is not devoted to uplifting black communities but funneling millions of donations to prominent Democrats and promoting neo-Marxist social chaos. Regardless of where you fall on the aisle, such a blatant political affiliation makes it clear this isn’t simply about human rights.

Further, this currently dominant movement that claims it wants to end “systemic racism” has cost black communities billions of dollars in damages, destroyed their local businesses, and directly resulted in the loss of at least 19 lives, most of whom were black. Research into the effect of mass media attention this movement aims to create finds homicide rates in these communities soaring from the de-policing and mistrust their messages foster.

Therefore, as someone who cares deeply about black lives, I could not embrace something that was so obviously harming them. But rather than engaging with these shortcomings, I, along with many other athletes, face this unfair ultimatum.

Additionally worrisome is that athletic staff well knew the dilemma we faced. Discussions behind closed doors all ended with the same unsatisfying response: “There’s nothing I can do.”

Coaches and administrators fear the potential public response of placing any boundaries on this type of speech at college competition. They too feel compelled to recite this political messaging even if they don’t fully believe in its merits. This fear of scrutiny indicates the movement’s real intensions to propel a single narrative without any critical examination.

If we’re truly interested in protecting black lives, however, there should be a willingness to explore more ideas in pursuit of that shared goal. Issues of racial disparities are important yet complex. They don’t deserve to be left to this performative and partisan messaging.

Social media and the connectivity of the internet have opened countless platforms for athletes to publicly express their personal opinions. That is why, in a setting where cohesiveness is everything, athletic leadership should not encourage or feel compelled to promote a movement designed to silence and divide. It’s time we get back to playing sports, not politics.

A Black Man Grabbed A Black Woman And Leftists Are Calling It White Supremacy,"Anti-racism protests are once again racking Washington, D.C., and attorney Benjamin Crump is involved so it’s time to play “find the lie.”

For more than three weeks now, angry denizens have gathered each night in front of Nellie’s Sports Bar after a video surfaced on social media showing a security guard attempting to eject a patron who had been fighting with others inside.

The initial clip that was posted on Twitter appeared to show Keisha Young, 22, pulled down a set of stairs on her back toward the exit by a man in a security uniform. At the foot of the steps, another man jumps on top of the guard and starts hitting him. Then there’s a pile-on with yet more people.

The incident reportedly took place in the early morning hours of Sunday, June 13. A story in the Washington Post quoted Young as saying, “Instead of reasoning with me, the security guard just bum-rushed me.” As the paper told it, Young “was attacked without warning after she apparently was mistaken for a different woman accused of sneaking in a bottle of liquor from another establishment.”

Benjamin Crump, the illiterate Al Sharpton who allegedly has a law degree, tweeted that Young was “savagely dragged … by her HAIR” and declared that she had been “falsely” accused of bringing the liquor bottle into the bar.

The next day, Nellie’s issued a statement saying it had ended its relationship with the contracted security vendor, that it was investigating the incident, and that it was indefinitely closing. Loud protests gathered nonetheless and left-wing groups in the city put out a set of “demands,” including that the bar “give reparations to the black queer and trans community” and that it remain shut down until all demands were met.

They also wanted the owners to subject themselves to a humiliating public “listening session,” wherein, no doubt, protesters would take turns screaming at them and demanding that they apologize for being white. (This was once known in China as a “struggle session” but in present-day America we call it “listening.”)

Three days after the brawl, though, a second video surfaced showing what happened in the moments preceding what was seen on the first one.

In that second video, Young is seen at the top of the stairs with about three other men who are fighting, plus two security guards intervening. Young is raining blows on one of the men who is trying to cover his head with his arms. As she’s absolutely wilding out in the fight, the guard reaches over the group of men and yanks Young by the shirt down the steps to remove her from the violence that she was actively participating in.

At the protests outside of the bar, activists have said, “We’re not gonna sit here and let black women be disrespected” and chanted, “protected black women, respect black women.” One demonstrator said, “That’s why we out here, because America, because of this white ass establishment, don’t respect black women and they damn sure don’t respect black people.”

But there’s a niggling detail about this whole saga that complicates the cut and dry narrative that Young’s black body was violated by the hands of white supremacy— the man who put his hands on her is also black.

Shouldn’t that make a difference if we’re going to throw around phrases like “white ass establishment”?

I’m not sure it makes a difference, but Nellie’s is a gay bar, and it used to be the most popular one in D.C. Over the years that I’ve lived here — I used to go on weekends — episodes like Young’s with the fighting and rowdy behavior have become common. It’s anecdotal, but in the most recent times I’ve been to Nellies, at least half of the patrons have been black. It wasn’t infrequent for most of them to be.

In essence, I mean that Nellies is not a “white ass establishment.” To the contrary, at this point, it’s almost a predominantly black bar.

But who can blame the protesters? This is what they’ve been taught to do by academia, the national media, the Democratic Party, and all of the entertainment industry. Claim victimhood based on race, gender, or sexual identity; then make demands; and then reap the rewards. The facts don’t matter. The story does, even if it’s fake or, at best, incomplete.

New York Times columnist Charles Blow, who is black, did this exact thing back in 2015 when he made a bunch of noise about his son being held up by police at Yale.

Blow wrote on Twitter at the time that he was “fuming” over a call he received from his son about having been “accosted” and held up at gunpoint because he fit the description of a suspect.

In follow-up tweets related to the incident, Blow said, “This is exactly why I have no patience for people trying to convince me that the fear these young black men feel isn’t real.” He also tweeted the phrases “I can’t breathe” and “Black lives matter.”

In a column for his paper, Blow wrote, “I am reminded of what I have always known, but what some would choose to deny: that there is no way to work your way out — earn your way out — of this sort of crisis. In these moments, what you’ve done matters less than how you look.”

Never did Blow mention a fairly important fact. The officer who held up his son was also black.

No matter. Blow got what he wanted. He became a prominent player in the Black Lives Matter moment that, like today, was burning hot and he was booked on national TV to talk about it. Likewise, Young is pursuing monetary gain by way of a lawsuit.

This is how America operates today. We call it “social justice.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/06/a-black-man-grabbed-a-black-woman-and-leftists-are-calling-it-white-supremacy/,2021-07-06
"As California Exports Blackouts To Nearby States, Will Texas Succumb?","California’s electric grid operator declared a “Flex Alert” Friday morning, showing all that mandated solar and wind power can’t reliably keep the lights on in California. California’s politically driven renewable energy mandates are likely to cause more blackouts this summer outside of California after a remarkable ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that allows California to hijack electricity that Arizona already contracted to receive.

California is America’s largest importer of electricity. The Golden State also mandates an increasingly large share of renewable energy on its electric grid with a goal of 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2045, while banning the renewal of coal-fired power contracts to provide electricity to California from out of state.

This would be fine if the consequences of these mandates were limited to those who voted for them. But they’re not. Because California’s grid is part of the Western Interconnection, its laws and regulations on electricity affect eight Western states and parts of four more, including El Paso, Texas.

How California’s Mess Is Affecting Other States

Fearful of blackouts this summer that might affect the Sept. 14 recall election targeting Gov. Gavin Newsom, California’s grid operators are buying up power around the West. This prompted Arizona officials to warn that California’s actions may lead to blackouts in Arizona, with Arizona Corporation Commission Chairwoman Lea Márquez Peterson blasting the late June FERC decision to prioritize electric utilities in California over those of other Western states.

“Our electric utilities did the right thing and planned ahead, securing pre-negotiated contracts with utilities in the Pacific Northwest to ensure that critical hydropower would be available to Arizonans when it would be needed the most, which would be delivered across transmission line through the state of California,” Márquez Peterson noted in a statement.

Tucson Electric Power and Arizona Public Service, two Arizona utilities, specifically warned that California was “exporting its reliability issues which are the result of dynamics within (California) to the rest of the West.” I raised this issue in 2017 and 2019, but regulatory agencies and elected officials too often wait until after a crisis to act. As a result, California’s aggressive environmental goals have become a crisis in the Western U.S.

A compelling political battle may arise in the West this summer. The question will be whether Western governors will passively stand by and allow their electric generators to save California from afternoon and early evening blackouts at the cost of their own constituents losing power. Given the antipathy towards California in neighboring states, it’s not hard to understand how California paying a premium for power and driving up prices while threatening blackouts won’t go over well for governors seen as doing little to stop it.

How California Energy Began to Break Down

So, how did California and its neighbors arrive at this point? Because California’s electricity goals measure net use of electricity by source, it allows California politicians to virtuously claim they are “greener” than they really are.

They do this by generating a surplus of subsidized solar power during mild days. This surplus electricity is priced to sell, as there is often more supply than demand in California. As a result, California frequently exports cheap electricity to other states in the middle of the day. This has depressed the value of baseload power generation, discouraging needed new investment and causing the premature retirement of gas and coal powerplants.

Even so, California’s grid is increasingly unstable, resulting in a frequent need to import electricity in the late afternoon. This happens almost daily when solar power ramps down with the sun and people return home from work and school, causing a shortfall in electricity for two to three-and-one-half-hours—something called the “duck curve” for the shape of the electric demand graph. During hot evenings, California relies on natural gas, coal, and nuclear power from surrounding states when their own renewables fall short.

Will Texas Turn Itself Into California?

California’s wild hourly swings in mandated renewable power generation have wrecked the economics of generating reliable electricity in other Western states.

This phenomenon parallels the struggles Texas is increasingly contending with in its own grid (known by the acronym ERCOT for Energy Reliability Council of Texas). In Texas’s case, it wasn’t due to ambitious renewable mandates set by politicians and regulators but generous federal subsidies for wind and solar that allow them to make money even when they pay Texas’s largely free-market grid to take their power, as happens with one-third of Texas power contracts during the year.

The huge financial advantage federal subsidies provide to wind and solar has distorted Texas’s largely deregulated electricity market, discouraging investment in new gas-fired power plants and resulting in the early retirement of thermal plants. Since 2016, Texas added a net capacity of 13,000 megawatts of wind and solar—although it usually produces a fraction of that at largely random times—while losing a net of 4,000 megawatts of more reliable coal and gas-powered generators.

This erosion of reliability was at the heart of Texas’s deep-winter blackouts. Fortunately, for Texans, the legislature passed a bill during its recently concluded 2021 session that, if used correctly by the Texas Public Utilities Commission, would begin to address the weaknesses in Texas’s grid caused by the growing share of unreliable wind and solar. On July 6, Gov. Greg Abbott directed the commission to take four significant steps:

Incentivize investment in “reliable sources of power, like natural gas, coal, and nuclear power.” Allocate reliability costs to generation resources that cannot guarantee their own availability, such as wind or solar power. Better schedule generator maintenance (significant amounts of power were down for maintenance during the winter storm). And accelerate the construction of new powerlines connecting reliable power to customers.

While Abbott’s new policies will help Texans avoid future blackouts, there is little chance concrete action will happen before summer’s end, leaving Texas vulnerable to at least one more summer of tight electricity supplies during hot days when the wind isn’t blowing over West Texas’s wind turbines.

Don’t Subject Right States to Left Governance

Given the havoc California is visiting on its neighbors in the West, it’s interesting that there were multiple calls for Texas to join one of the national grids after the winter storm, with The New York Times headline mocking,

As Arizona, Nevada, and other Western states are finding out, interconnectivity with California generates numerous problems. In addition, the roughly 85 percent of Texas served by its own grid—El Paso connects to the west and parts of the Panhandle and East Texas connect to the Eastern Interconnection—remains largely free from federal electricity oversight because Texas electricity doesn’t engage in interstate commerce. Most Texans see that as a powerful benefit.

It’s instructive to examine the electric prices to consumers that result from each state’s energy policies and mix of generation. Through April of this year, California’s average electricity prices clocked in at 18.52 cents per Kilowatt-hour (kWh), the highest in the contiguous U.S. outside of New England, increasing by almost 12 percent year over year.

This is about double the average of the other states in the Western grid, meaning California can pay top dollar to drain other states’ power supplies, leaving them to bake on hot summer days while Californians remain cool. In Texas, the average price of electricity through April was 10.34 cents per kWh, 56 percent of the average in California—and that’s including a massive spike in prices due to Winter Storm Uri in February.

In the wake of Texas moving to limit the danger of blackouts from an overreliance on unreliable renewables versus California pressing ahead with its 100 percent renewable mandates, it will be fascinating to see which model delivers the affordable, reliable power that’s a prerequisite to modern civilization.

‘Black Widow’ Gives Natasha Romanoff The Sendoff She Deserves,"Spoilers.

After a year of constant pushbacks and delays thanks to COVID-19 shutdowns, Marvel Studios finally returned to the big screen this past weekend with the much-anticipated release of its latest film, “Black Widow.”

Directed by Cate Shortland, the film is emblematic of a James Bond-style spy thriller, with loaded action sequences and impressive character development for its leading protagonists. Coupled with Marvel’s classic, witty humor, the movie represents a strong debut for “Phase Four” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

Set after the events of “Captain America: Civil War,” the movie follows Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) as she attempts to evade the law, while grappling with the haunting shadows of her past. Forced to reunite with her childhood stunt family comprised of “sister” Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), “mother” Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), and “father” Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian (David Harbour), Romanoff aims to clear the red from her ledger once and for all, fighting to take down evil Russian boss Dreykov (Ray Winstone) and his Red Room espionage program.

The film does a great job exploring Romanoff’s early history and providing fans with insight into her work as a Black Widow assassin working under Dreykov. Long shrouded in mystery, Romanoff’s backstory has never received the attention it truly deserved, with here-and-there references to the character’s past over the years.

In “Black Widow,” however, Romanoff’s past finally gets the limelight, as the film adequately details the important moments that allowed her to grow into the Avenger she is.

One of the most significant themes of the film is the importance of family. To take down Dreykov, Romanoff must first look to the past to heal the fractures of her stunt family. Even as she repeatedly tells herself the whole thing was just a charade, Romanoff can’t shake the love and compassion she developed in those early years for her fake family. In the end, this realization helps her repair the damage to not only her stunt family, but also later her Avengers family.

While Johansson’s performance was excellent as usual, the breakout star of the film was Florence Pugh. Not only did she seamlessly transition into the role of Yelena Belova, I found myself thoroughly invested in her story. At times, her arc was much more compelling than the leading character’s. Irrespective of the scene or circumstance, Pugh’s performance stole the show and made me excited to see what Marvel has in store for her.

The film did have some weaknesses, however. After 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” Marvel fans headed into “Black Widow” well aware of Natasha Romanoff’s ultimate fate. While the movie does a great job at further expanding Romanoff’s story, her legacy would have been better served if the film were made prior to “Endgame’s” release.

Watching “Black Widow” before seeing her sacrificial demise in “Endgame” would have made the emotional impact of her death much more meaningful. It would have also brought her character arc full circle without having to jump backward after “Endgame.”

Additionally, the film handled the character of Taskmaster poorly, rewriting the character with an entirely different backstory from what we see in the Marvel comics. Moreover, the franchise changed Taskmaster’s gender, replacing the man from the comics with a woman in the role of Dreykov’s daughter. While I don’t have a problem with the MCU altering certain characteristics in their adaptations, to completely disregard Taskmaster’s comic origins feels like a disservice to the comic writers who spent years establishing the character.

Overall, “Black Widow” is an action-packed spy thriller that makes for an excellent return to the big screen for Marvel Studios. In many ways, the film marks a passing of the Black Widow mantel from Johansson to Pugh, setting up an exciting future for the character of Yelena Belova. While an earlier release would’ve added more emotional weight to Romanoff’s final actions in “Avengers: Endgame,” the film does a superb job providing the character with the solo movie she has so long deserved.

Fans can catch “Black Widow” in theaters now or on Disney Plus with Premier Access.

The Loudest Crying 'Racism' Are Some Of The Best-Paid Black Americans,"Isn’t it weird how the loudest voices assuring America we’re all incurably racist tend to do so from very comfortable, financially secure perches?

That fact couldn’t have been illustrated more perfectly than in an article last week by Washington Post columnist Paul Butler, an oppressed minority who also happens to be a law professor at the prestigious Georgetown University and a well-paid legal analyst on national television for MSNBC.

The thrust of Butler’s column is that America remains a top-to-bottom racist country and that even when blacks achieve success in white-dominant fields and spaces, it sucks.

“[F]or now, I am okay with working at a university that in its early years was financed by the sale of enslaved people,” he wrote. “I love my students and respect my colleagues, and have been part of the community’s efforts, still incomplete, to make reparations for that travesty.”

He added that “helping majority-White spaces be less racist and more inclusive feels transformative,” but also that “other times, it feels like an intellectual version of my great-grandfather’s job; he cleaned outhouses — i.e., shoveling White people’s excrement.” Knowing what’s really on Butler’s mind must fill the heart’s of his colleagues with great affection and admiration for him. Who wouldn’t want to be around a person who associates you with feces?

But how is it that someone with so much opportunity and financial security at his fingertips — and at a level most white people couldn’t bother to dream of — can be so miserable? It’s almost always the case in our never-ending nightmarish discussion on race that those leading the insistence that America is hopelessly racist are curiously doing very well, even thriving, despite not being white.

Race hustler Benjamin Crump, an alleged attorney, is making a fortune by hyping up every single run-in between cops and blacks that he can spin into another example of the absolute myth that police everywhere are out to shoot them.

He said in a recent interview that his firm gets one-third of the settlement claims he negotiates with local governments that he shakes down through his wild media campaigns. That means the $12 million settlement in September for the death of Breonna Taylor earned Crump an almost $4 million cut. The $27 million settlement for the death of George Floyd just four months later got him double that.

Joy Reid moved swiftly from guest to contributor to weekend morning host to finally having her own primetime show at MSNBC. If that’s not the face of oppression, what is?

The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Stacey Abrams of journalism, whined her way to a tenured job at the University of North Carolina, akthough she ultimately refused the offer after complaining that “the credentials, the awards, [and] the status that I have” weren’t properly appreciated. (Victimhood is now weighed in credentials, awards, and status.)

Her colleague Charles Blow, also at the Times, wrote last month in earnest that as a bisexual black man, he is so aggrieved that in one interview he had to remind the journalist “that I had written a best-selling book about my identity and that that book has been developed into an opera that will become the first opera by a Black composer to be staged at New York’s Metropolitan Opera in its history.”

Ibram Xolani Kendi, formerly known as the more easily pronounced Henry Rogers, holds lofty jobs with the prestigious Atlantic magazine and at Boston University, writing things like, “Whenever an American engages in a racist act and someone points it out, the inevitable response is the sound of … denial.” Kendi’s department at BU last year got a $10 million donation from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. How do black people survive in this country?

Admittedly, it’s possible to point out problems without actually having personally experienced them, but that’s not what any of these people are doing. Each of them professes to have been marginalized and disadvantaged because that’s the black experience in this country. Yet there they sit with some of the most coveted jobs and status that America has to offer.

Are they special? Were they able to accomplish something in spite of being black that others in the same race cannot?

What’s their secret? Maybe black Americans would be in a better position if they shared it.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/12/the-loudest-voices-crying-racism-are-always-some-of-the-most-famous-well-paid-black-americans/,2021-07-12
"Amid DC Violence, Black Community Leaders Rally To Protect Each Other","In the same spot where 6-year-old Nyiah Courtney was shot and killed two weeks ago, 100 black men gathered to hold their community accountable.

“The responsibility of the safety of this community is on the people who live in this community,” said Advisory Neighborhood Commission 8C Chair Salim Adofo.

The event “100 Black Men for Peace and Empowerment” called on strong black men to lead an effort to organize and support their community. On Saturday, the group went door-to-door in Southeast Washington, D.C., handing neighbors pamphlets with information about work development programs, how to pay back rent, and where to receive mental health help. The group also called for an end to gun violence and helped clean trash off the streets.

“When we can see black men doing some positive things in the very community in which they live, we can start to change the way people view their neighborhoods. We should be neighbors opposed to, ‘Oh, those are just people who live there,'” Adofo said.

Building bridges between neighbors is an effort to rebuild communities, Adofo said. With rising crime rates in predominately black neighborhoods and community members’ growing suspicion of law enforcement, many violent crimes go unreported. Adofo wants to change that.

Violent crime has skyrocketed in cities supporting Black Lives Matter’s “anti-police” narrative. In 2018, there were 16,214 murders in the United States (with one chart reflecting 14,123 total murders that year), about half of which were black victims. Of single-victim, single-offender situations, about 89 percent of black victims were killed by black assailants, as The Federalist reported. Despite making up only 13 percent of the population, black Americans committed 52 percent of all homicides between 1980 and 2008, according to the Deparatment of Justice.

In a recent letter, Mayor Muriel Bowser linked D.C.’s spike in killings to court failures, which D.C. Superior Court Judge Anita Josey-Herring denied. While court systems have been operating at a slower pace due to the pandemic, homicide rates in Washington, D.C., have been steadily increasing for years.

Pretty surprising back and forth between @MayorBowser and D.C. Superior Court Chief Judge Anita Josey-Herring on Friday. Bowser linked the current spike in killings to the courts operating at limited capacity. Josey-Herring responded that the courts have been working. pic.twitter.com/BYGHP9U78g — Martin Austermuhle (@maustermuhle) July 24, 2021

The city is experiencing a severe staffing shortage at the D.C. 911 dispatch, which fields calls relating to violent crime. This shortage is a product of employees on a combination of family leave, personal leave, and sick leave — and, according to the emergency agency’s interim director, Cleo Subido, who implemented mandatory overtime, it’s also a product of slacking.

“Currently, the District is paying us for 12 hours and we are plugged into the radio for less than seven hours for the most part,” Subido wrote.

With apathy, poor leadership, understaffing, and crime on the rise, including 106 homicides this year in the District, people like Adofo are turning inward to combat violence.

“This is on us as a community,” Adofo said. “We want to make sure that we can get the resources to the people that are in the most need so that we can stop the gun violence.”

Simone Biles And The Media’s Celebration Of Choking,"It’s not a crime to choke under pressure but when did it become something to admire with deep reverence?

After U.S. Olympian Simone Biles dropped out of not one but two games this week, events that she and her peers have been training their entire lives for, the response from the national media has been to effusively cheer and pay homage to the power and bravery of giving up.

And make no mistake, much or most of the celebration for Biles’ backdown is because she happens to be black.

It’s not enough for the media to say, “Gee, it’s too bad she quit and hopefully she works out her problems,” but they have to herald her as a trailblazer because it makes liberal journalists feel good to pity (i.e. look down on) others, particularly when it comes to race.

“A different kind of pressure follows Black women who achieve in traditionally White spaces,” wrote Washington Post sports reporter Candace Buckner. “If they’ve had a realist for a mother, since childhood they’ve heard the refrain they’ve got to work twice as hard to get half as much. And if they spent two seconds in America, then they know that mama was right.”

She said the lesson of Biles’ abrupt withdrawal should be in “letting Black women be great without carrying a deeper narrative.”

MSNBC’s Hallie Jackson similarly observed that Biles “is not just an athlete. She is not just one of the best athletes in the world. She’s also a black woman athlete.”

Jackson’s guest, sports writer Kavitha Davidson, nodded along thoughtfully and bemoaned “the pressure on black women to be 100 percent perfect all the time.”

(When you work in the national media, you’re allowed to invent new racial stereotypes and concepts at will.)

Davidson said Biles is “literally carrying the weight of an entire country on her shoulders and probably an entire sport, and that weighs a lot.”

Eren Orbey of the New Yorker was in awe at the “radical courage” it took for Biles to see herself out of the games. He called it “its own kind of achievement.”

Remember that the next time you’re given an assignment on a tight deadline at work. Should you feel that the pressure is too much, walk out and remind yourself that that in itself is “its own kind of achievement.”

There is of course nothing wrong with Biles choosing not to compete. It’s very literally her neck on the line each time she hurls and twists her body into the air. She said she was sitting the games out not for physical injury but because “the mental is not there.”

Fair enough! Plenty of people cave under pressure. Very few of them will know pressure like the Olympics. Biles certainly didn’t seem to think much of it, even referring to herself after withdrawing the first time as “the head star of the Olympics.”

But choking doesn’t make Biles special. And the incident certainly doesn’t reveal a “superhumanity,” as a headline in New York magazine asserted. That remains true even though Biles is black.

No one in America interested in the Olympics expects anything more or less than that she do our country proud. If someone like Kavitha Davidson believes there’s some added responsibility on black women to be “100 percent perfect all the time,” that’s something she might raise with a therapist, rather than project it on the rest of the nation.

Biles is an undeniably gifted athlete. She choked. It should be very easy to celebrate one and not the other, even though Biles is black.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/28/simone-biles-and-the-medias-celebration-of-choking/,2021-07-28
Blackburn Introduces Amendment Moving Amtrak Money To Border Wall,"Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn introduced an amendment Wednesday to the behemoth bipartisan infrastructure bill to replace funds for Amtrak with money for the southern border wall.

“I am very pro-infrastructure,” Blackburn told The Federalist in an exclusive interview. She qualified her comment, however, with opposition to the $1 trillion bill, frustrated over the colossal price tag and the boondoggle projects.

“I am not for the Green New Deal and wasting money,” she said. “Amtrak should be able to stand on its own.”

The senator’s amendment would reallocate the $1 billion currently set aside for the predominantly East Coast rail service to construction of the southern border wall, which President Joe Biden halted in the first days of his administration. Migration levels have reached new highs as border apprehensions eclipsed 1 million for the first time in 15 years, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The last time we had more than 188K monthly apprehensions on the the southwest border was March of 2000. We had more than 1.6 million total apprehensions that year, an all-time record, which we're on pace to surpass this year. But yeah, Biden has the border under control, sure. pic.twitter.com/nZaf4jf3vf — John Daniel Davidson (@johnddavidson) July 16, 2021

“Every town is a border town, and every state is a border state because of this open southern border,” Blackburn said, justifying her legislation to remove funds from the transit service for the Acela Corridor to completion of the wall.

The more than 2,700-page infrastructure package, which is headed for a vote on Saturday, includes billions for long-neglected projects Blackburn said needed to be addressed, including highway and waterway management. The bill as it stands, however, failed to earn her support for its trillion-dollar price tag.

Blackburn pointed to the bipartisan $350 billion bill from the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation put forward in June by Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., as “more realistic.”

“We need to be good stewards of the taxpayer’s money,” Blackburn said, after the Biden administration has blown the nation’s deficit with trillion-dollar packages inducing inflation just seven months into office.

Amtrak, she said, ought to be paid for by the people who use it as opposed to taxpayer dollars for the beloved Biden project. The president rode the train often as a Delaware senator and celebrated its 50th anniversary at an event where he appeared to make up a story about a train conductor who congratulated him for riding it 1.5 million miles.

Other Republicans have taken issue with the latest infrastructure package, headed for the House as early as next week, and have proposed a flurry of amendments to make last-minute changes. Among them include a similar amendment from Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson to prohibit the cancellation of border wall contracts, but that was rejected by a 48-49 vote. It needed 60 votes to pass.

Another amendment proposed by Blackburn on Wednesday seeks a reversal of Biden’s decision to cancel permits for the Keystone XL Pipeline.

Of the more than 250 amendments proposed, however, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee has introduced the most with 35, according to an analysis by RollCall.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/05/blackburns-infrastructure-shake-up-would-move-amtrak-funding-to-border-wall/,2021-08-05
How The Left’s Calcified Identity Politics Ruined The New ‘Gossip Girl’,"A review of the new “Gossip Girl” in Vanity Fair wants to know “Why Doesn’t the New Gossip Girl Feel Fun?” But what’s amazing about this negative review of HBO’s reboot of the iconic teen drama is that it doesn’t see itself. The writer notes, “The rebooted Gossip Girl refreshingly centers Black voices — but the show stops short of engaging with resulting questions of status and power.”

The reason? Because those “centered black voices” are the voices of power, the black characters are the privileged elite, and it’s just not okay in today’s media climate to critique black power and privilege. While the show “centers black voices,” what it does not do is poke fun at those voices, because it’s simply not allowed.

Instead of being problematically wealthy, the black powerful elite in “Gossip Girl” are assumed to be entitled to their privileges. This shows vividly how much race has replaced class in the revised construct of American socialist ideology.

The new version of “Gossip Girl” replaces vapid white teens and their dramas with very serious black teens and their very serious vapid dramas. Sure, that appears to be much of the point, but it isn’t much fun. Because viewers aren’t supposed to think they are vapid, viewers are supposed to think they are entitled to their privilege.

These new, privileged teens living in New York, attending the top prep school, and posing for Instagram are socially aware. They are rich kids with real feels for the working class. The first day of school sees rich boys bringing breakfast to the “strike line” at the Navy Yard, and the two main characters, half-sisters Julien Calloway (Jordan Alexander) and Zoya Lott (Whitney Peak), are more sympathetic than their counterparts Blair and Serena from the original show.

The author of the Vanity Fair review, Delia Cai, writes: “The breadth of references to real-life Black and afro-indigenous cultural authorities is refreshing; a mainstream show where teens live and breathe Black art as the cultural default feels like a revelation.”

“But,” she continues, “though the new Gossip Girl succeeds in depicting the kind of privilege that takes us from protest to Net-A-Porter all in one day, it stops short of truly engaging with the accompanying concepts of power and elitism. And maybe that’s why it doesn’t feel ‘fun.’”

“It’s beautiful and interesting and a little revolutionary — but watching it is just not the same as laughing at rich white people doing rich white people things,” Cai writes.

The reason, of course, is that you can’t make fun of the new privileged elite’s privileged elitism, because they are “of color.” There can be no “send-up” of rich black girls, and rich black girls can only be serious about their race and identity. They can’t get high with the help, or sleep with their dad’s best friend or whatever. The show is not fun is because it’s not allowed to be.

Part of the problem with the new “Gossip Girl” is that everyone is either oppressed or some kind of savior. The parents who aren’t wallowing in post-divorce drunken self-pity are really good people trying to do the right thing. The teachers are humble servants to the ruling elite who just want to keep their low-paying, private school jobs, and the students — while privileged, rich, bratty, and out for blood — are minorities. They are black, they are LGBT, they are untouchable.

Critics of the show don’t realize this is the problem. Once a group of people is essentially sainted in the public eye and proclaimed to do no wrong, while anyone who disagrees is declared problematic, there can be no fun made. How can Hollywood take aim with poison arrows at privileged minority characters? They can’t; there’s no rubric for it.

Satirists like those who created the first “Gossip Girl” series will have to get over their unwarranted adulation of people based on skin color alone if they want to have any fun. They may not be up to it, but ratings show that audiences are well bored of these woke concerns.

When Vanity Fair calls out a show that intentionally and purposefully “centers black voices” but still lacks in the entertainment department, Hollywood should realize that the real problem is their lack of imagination.

EXCLUSIVE: FBI Knew Of Hunter's Missing Laptop By December 2019,"The FBI knew as early as December 2019 that Hunter Biden believed Russians had stolen his laptop, which he believed made him vulnerable to blackmail because of compromising evidence on the laptop combined with his father’s presidential ambitions. This explosive revelation establishes that either Joe Biden lied to the American public, or the intelligence community lied to him.

When The New York Post went public in October 2020 with videos, text messages, and emails from an abandoned MacBook laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, Joe Biden told Americans the laptop was a Russian hoax.

But now Brian Della Rocca, an attorney representing John Paul Mac Isaac, has told me that the video of Hunter Biden telling a prostitute he thought Russians had stolen a second laptop, leaving him susceptible to blackmail, was “definitely on the hard drive” of the Biden MacBook abandoned at Isaac’s shop and later seized by the FBI.

This new revelation establishes that, since December 2019, the FBI had knowledge that a second laptop had been stolen from Hunter Biden and that that laptop contained material making the Biden family a national security risk and subject to Russian influence.

Joe Biden surely received briefings on these risks well before his October 2020 denial of the authenticity of the laptop, so the question is: Did the FBI fail to provide Biden a truthful briefing on this intel, or did Biden fail to level with voters?

One week ago today, The Daily Mail published “unearthed footage” of a naked Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that “the Russians have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex!” According to The Daily Mail, “after filming himself having sex with the woman using his laptop in January 2019, Hunter left the camera rolling as he recounted a Vegas bender in which he spent ’18 days going round from penthouse suite to penthouse suite,’ sometimes costing $10,000 a night.”

The video continued with Hunter recounting how he had nearly overdosed during the summer of 2018 while partying in Las Vegas with his drug dealer and two other guys. According to the president’s son, after he regained consciousness, “there was this Russian 35-year-old, really nice, pure brunette,” Hunter explained. Soon after, Hunter discovered his laptop was missing.

“I think he’s the one that stole my computer,” Hunter is heard on the tape explaining. “I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere,” Hunter explained. “They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex, f-cking, you know,” Hunter added. “My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,” Hunter continued, “and somebody stole it during that period of time.”

The prostitute then asked Hunter if he worried the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him. “Yeah, in some way yeah,” Hunter replied, noting his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

In its expose from last Wednesday, The Daily Mail omitted any mention of the source of the video, but The Federalist has now confirmed that the blackmail video was contained on the hard drive of the Hunter Biden MacBook abandoned at a Delaware repair shop, The Mac Shop, Inc.

After that MacBook was abandoned, Isaac informed the FBI of its existence. FBI agents later seized the computer from Isaac in December 2019, but by then Isaac had already made a copy of the hard drive.

Isaac later provided a copy of the hard drive to Robert Costello, who at the time served as a lawyer for former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In October 2020, Giuliani provided a copy of the drive to The New York Post, which ran multiple stories on the details revealed in emails, text messages, and videos, including evidence of a pay-to-play scandal involving Joe Biden.

When the Post broke the story the month before the 2020 presidential election, other media outlets ran cover for the Democrat candidate, with Twitter deplatforming The Post and preventing users from sharing the story.

While the corrupt media blacked out the story, at the final presidential debate before the election, then-President Trump confronted Biden with the details revealed from the MacBook, calling it “the laptop from hell”:

[Y]ou were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it’s even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people.

After denying any improprieties by either himself or his son, Biden responded by telling the American public:

There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani.

When Trump countered by asking Biden if he was saying the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” Biden said: “That’s exactly what [I] was told.”

At the time Biden professed to voters in October 2020 that he was told the laptop was another Russian hoax, what the FBI or the intelligence community would have likely told Biden was unknown. However, the revelation that, since December 2019, the FBI had a copy of the video showing Hunter saying Russians had stolen his laptop, and the laptop contained sex videos that put him at risk for blackmail because of his father’s plans to run for president, changes the complexion of things.

This new detail means that the FBI knew, not just of the existence of the MacBook with compromising videos and damaging emails and text messages related to Joe Biden, but that there was a second missing laptop, likely with similar information on it, that had been stolen from Hunter and believed to be in the possession of Russians. The FBI also would know that Hunter had spoken on his father’s presidential ambitions “all the time” and saw himself as a potential blackmail target.

It is unfathomable that the FBI or overall U.S. intelligence agencies would not have immediately briefed then-candidate Biden on the situation. During the run-up to the 2016 election, the FBI and intelligence community provided defense briefings to both the Clinton and Trump campaigns as a matter of course. Amazingly, the FBI used one of those intelligence briefings to spy on Donald Trump based on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation launched based on unverified gossip.

Specifically, on August 17, 2016, as part of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into the Trump campaign, FBI Agent Joe Pientka was tapped to brief Trump, Michael Flynn, and Chris Christie as part of a two-hour meeting warning the team of foreign intelligence threats.” As The Federalist’s Sean Davis previously reported, declassified information would later be established that Pientka had been “selected to attend on behalf of the FBI so he could ‘record’ or ‘overhear’ from Trump, Flynn, or Christie ‘any kind of admission’ that they were colluding with the Russian government to steal the election from Hillary Clinton.”

Even if the FBI hadn’t launched a more-justified investigation into “The Big Guy” based on the concrete evidence contained on the MacBook indicating an illegal pay-to-play agreement involving the former vice president who was then a presidential contender, a defensive briefing to Biden on the risk of Russian blackmail based on Hunter’s stolen second laptop would be indispensable to our national security interests.

In the case of Trump, the FBI would also later insist mere months after first receiving the unverified and now debunked Steele dossier that an Intelligence Community Assessment include details from a former MI6 officer’s memorandums that claimed the Russians had “kompromat” on Trump.

However, because both James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, and John Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, objected to including reporting from the Steele dossier in the text of the Intelligence Community Assessment, it was instead included as a separate “annex,” which then-FBI Director James Comey then briefed Trump on in person.

While Comey claimed he told Trump about the salacious “intel” because the press had the information and he expected it to be made public soon, it was the leak to CNN of the briefing itself that provided a “news” hook for the dossier, resulting in it being published in full soon after.

Unlike the unverified Steele dossier, here the FBI had a MacBook laptop containing a Biden Foundation sticker and photographs, videos, emails, and text, providing for easy confirmation of the authenticity of the source information. And on that laptop was a video of Hunter stating he believed the Russians had a second laptop of his that contained similarly compromising material, which created a blackmail risk given Joe Biden’s then-upcoming presidential run.

Surely, evidence that the Russians had authentic “kompromat” on the Biden family would make both a written intelligence briefing and an in-person briefing to the elder Biden essential. In fact, shortly after the Post published its first article covering the material contained on the MacBook, an unnamed “person familiar with the matter” told USA Today that, “at least in part,” there was a federal investigation underway concerning the MacBook “aimed at determining whether Russia has set its sights on a familiar target: Biden’s father, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.”

“Federal authorities,” according to the source, were also “investigating whether the material supplied to the Post by Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is part of a smoke bomb of disinformation pushed by Russia.” There is no evidence, however, indicating the material contained on the hard drive is “disinformation,” leaving open a serious question: Did the FBI lie to Biden, or did Biden lie to Americans?

"After Afghanistan, No More Moral Blackmail From Failed Interventionists","Days after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was initially sold as a necessary pre-emptive effort to secure deadly weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein planned to use against the American people, National Review ran an op-ed by former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum attacking everyone on the right who opposed the war as “unpatriotic conservatives.”

In the nearly two decades since it was published, the column has become something of a Rosetta Stone for deciphering the underlying motivations and mindset of the most ardent proponents of the idea that stable democracies can be imposed by military force from the top down. Like an insect captured in amber, Frum’s essay is a near-perfect specimen of the neoconservative id, equal parts delusion and sanctimony.

Frum attacked legendary conservative columnist Robert Novak for correctly predicting that America’s foray into Afghanistan would be a “futile slaughter”; he attacked Pat Buchanan for correctly predicting that America’s military might wouldn’t be enough to overcome its ignorance of Afghanistan’s culture and history; and he characterized the entire movement of conservatives who opposed the neoconservative plan to democratize the world through military conquest as Vichy apologists whose sole aim was to stand up for terrorist suicide bombers.

After tarring war opponents as Nazi collaborators, Frum transitioned to tarring anyone who opposed open borders and unchecked immigration as racist relics pining for the return of the KKK. “They began by hating neoconservatives,” Frum wrote. “They came to hate their party and this president. They have finished by hating their country.”

“War is a great clarifier,” Frum concluded. “The paleoconservatives have chosen—and the rest of us must choose too. In a time of danger, they have turned their backs on their country. Now we turn our backs on them.”

Frum, who was sent packing from his perch at the American Enterprise Institute for his refusal to do much of anything in exchange for his six-figure sinecure there, was right about one thing: war is a great clarifier.

We Won Afghanistan, Then Lost It

Take Afghanistan, for example. Although the post-9/11 invasion of the country was presented to the American public as necessary to take down al Qaeda and its then-leader Osama bin Laden for their roles in perpetrating the worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor, the mission quickly shifted to nation-building and democracy-exporting. By December of 2001, the Taliban–which had harbored al Qaeda in Afghanistan—had been routed, and bin Laden had escaped through the mountains into Pakistan.

In his State of the Union address in 2002, President George W. Bush all but claimed total military victory in Afghanistan.

“In four short months, our nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan’s terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression,” Bush stated.

At that point, the military mission in Afghanistan should have concluded. But by 2004, the mission to destroy the terrorists responsible for 9/11 had morphed into a mission to export and establish Western-style liberal democracy not just in Afghanistan, but in Iraq, too.

“As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny, despair, and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East,” Bush told Congress in 2004. “We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and condescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government.”

The subtext of Bush’s address was no different than the overt charge leveled by Frum: if you opposed the bait-and-switch from defeating terrorists to nation-building all over the Middle East, either because you believed it be contrary to the purpose of the military or you believed it was futile and doomed to failure, you were racist and xenophobic.

Let’s Just Try It and See What Happens

Bush’s sentiments were echoed more eloquently by the late Charles Krauthammer in a speech delivered to the American Enterprise Institute in February of 2004. Krauthammer’s remarks, entitled “Democratic Realism,” extolled the virtues of democracy promotion by force, and scoffed at the idea that a liberal Western democracy in a tribal nation like Afghanistan with no history whatsoever of secular, representative government would do anything but flourish.

“Realists have been warning against the hubris of thinking we can transform an alien culture because of some postulated natural and universal human will to freedom,” Krauthammer acknowledged. “And they may yet be right. But how do they know in advance?”

When he then asked during his speech where it is written that tribal Islamic societies with no sense of national identity akin to the American esprit de corps that unites all people within its borders regardless of color or creed, let alone a tradition of Western rule of law and civic order, are incapable of peaceful, secular democracy, an attendee at the dinner yelled out “the Koran!” Unfazed and apparently oblivious to the possibility that the vacuum created by forcibly deposing Saddam Hussein and other Middle Eastern leaders would lead to Islamists throughout the Middle East deposing their own governments, slaughtering Christians and apostate Muslims, over-running American diplomatic outposts and murdering American ambassadors, and eventually re-establishing the Islamic caliphate, Krauthammer soldiered on.

Spreading democracy around the globe, Krauthammer argued, was the only way to stop terrorism, and to argue otherwise was idiotic. To oppose the grandiose plans of the neoconservatives and liberal internationalists was, in Krauthammer’s words, “intellectually obsolete” and “politically bankrupt.”

As we all now know, having witnessed the post-invasion debacle in Iraq, the disastrous Arab Spring, the pre-meditated murder of four Americans in Libya, the rise and spread of ISIS, and the ignominious fall of Kabul in Afghanistan, the utopian vision of Frum, Bush, and Krauthammer was a lie. It was a lie that cost two decades, trillions of dollars, and tens of thousands of American lives and limbs, and it was an incalculably destructive lie that was sold by smearing its realist opponents as condescending, racist know-nothings who lacked both the brain and the heart to understand how the new world truly worked.

Smears to Substitute for Having Any Arguments

The fall of Afghanistan should have shocked the architects of its failure back into reality. Instead, they’ve moved on as if nothing much happened at all and are now arguing that America should, nay must, allow tens or even hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees into America immediately.

Being wrong means never having to say you’re sorry and being wrong about every failed foreign policy endeavor of this century apparently means you get to blather your way past America’s worst defeat since Vietnam so you can instead talk about the need for open borders. The solution for failing to export American democracy to Afghanistan, you see, is to import Afghanistan into America.

Wouldn’t you know it, the same arguments and epithets deployed against opponents of America’s failed wars are now being deployed against opponents of unchecked immigration. Moral blackmail is the stock-in-trade of the failed internationalist.

Are you concerned that people posing as refugees might be terrorists intent on killing Americans on U.S. soil? You’re a racist. Are you worried that the same government and immigration system that allowed the 19 9/11 hijackers entry to the United States might not be competent to judge who is and who is not a security threat? You’re a xenophobe.

Do you think maybe it is time for the U.S. government to focus on what is best for American citizens rather than what is best for Afghans, or Syrians, or Libyans, or Iraqis? You’re probably a Jim Crow fanatic who wants segregated water fountains. Do you think the family of the current president, via their shady business deals with corrupt oligarchs beholden to America’s enemies across the globe, might be getting rich by manipulating the president’s foreign policy to enrich themselves? Well, you’re obviously a Russian stooge.

A Projection of Their Own Guilt

The same people who tried to morally blackmail you into supporting a failed Forever War in Afghanistan—the ones who declared that you were either on board with the new international interventionist imperative or you were with the terrorists—are now trying to morally blackmail you into supporting open borders with Afghanistan and every other country that America’s incompetent elites thought they could turn into Stepford if only they invaded it hard enough. In truth, the entire foundation of the Washington establishment’s failed foreign policy is its members’ own feelings of guilt.

They felt guilty that Afghanistan looked like an awful place to live, so they set about rebuilding the country in their own image, complete with gender equity courses and lectures on how the predominantly Muslim citizens of the country need to be more like their secular Western counterparts.

They felt guilty about what they spent 20 years doing in Afghanistan—falsely offering hope of an eternal American safety net, constructed and maintained not with their own blood, sweat, and tears, but with those of enlisted American military men and women scoffed at and mocked by the smart set—so you must accept the risk posed by a terrorist who pretended to be a refugee to get across the nation’s increasingly non-existent southern border.

They feel guilty about their wealth and privilege (not guilty enough to give that wealth or privilege to anyone else, of course), so you must accept the lower wages that are the obvious result of inflating the labor supply while depressing demand through job-crushing progressive economic policy.

Triumph of Denial Above Experience

These concerns about the runaway costs of interventionism, however, are based firmly in reality. Take the story of an Afghan interpreter told in “Outlaw Platoon,” the spectacular war memoir by Sean Parnell, who served as a combat platoon leader in one of the most violent parts of Afghanistan.

In his book, Parnell details how one of the Afghan interpreters in his platoon, a man who had been thoroughly “vetted” and given access to some of the Army’s closest held secrets, helped engineer an improvised explosive attack that killed one of Parnell’s troops, Cpl. Jeremiah S. Cole, and seriously injured four others. That interpreter, who went by the name Yusef, also arranged for the murder of his counterpart Abdul so Yusef would have total access to all sensitive information, such as troop movements and attack plans, which he then passed along to America’s enemies.

“Knowing where Abdul had been going and the road he had used to get there, Yusef’s tip had allowed the insurgents to establish an ambush in time to catch Abdul on his way back to Bermel from his family’s house,” Parnell writes. “With Abdul dead, Yusef knew he would be promoted to head interpreter.”

“We’d gone through our year in country, judging these Afghans through the prism of our own value systems, never fully grasping what we were up against,” Parnell concluded.

Earlier this week, Parnell shared that story on Tucker Carlson’s primetime show on Fox News. Media Matters immediately responded by slicing and dicing the transcript of Parnell’s appearance to smear him as a racist for believing, based on his own personal experience with a vetted Afghan who murdered one of his brothers in arms, that America could not properly vet the thousands of Afghans wishing to immigrate to America.

The President Who Wouldn’t Be Morally Blackmailed

Like one of those old magic eye posters that contained images hidden among visual white noise, once you see the American ruling elite’s reflex to resort to moral blackmail to win an argument, you can never unsee it. Every policy, every argument, every talking point asserts that you are a racist and a bad person if you believe America’s government should first and foremost protect American citizens. This is a fun game for the failed foreign policy establishment, because they reap all the benefits of using Americans’ blood and money to pump up their self-esteem while bearing precisely none of the costs.

One of the primary reasons this cadre of credentialed incompetents loathed former president Donald Trump is because, as a secular, thrice-married New York billionaire, he was impervious to the moral blackmail that had worked like a charm on everyone else for over a decade. He didn’t much care if they called him racist for wanting to secure the border and put an end to open borders. He didn’t care if they called him heartless for wanting to shut down immigration from “sh-thole countries” to preserve the wages of American workers. And he didn’t care if they called him stupid for refusing to go along with their plans for forever wars all around the globe.

For a time, America had a president who wouldn’t be bullied into doing things that weren’t in America’s national security interests. They hated him for it, and it’s why they spent every waking moment for four years, including two impeachments, desperately trying to throw him out of office.

Moral blackmail only works when the target cares what the blackmailer thinks about him. America’s interventionist elites have publicly failed in the most spectacular way possible, with the evidence of their failures playing on repeat on television for all the world to see.

Breaking their hold on power from here on out is simple: stop caring what they think, and stop caring what they say about you. Their ideas are disastrous and their rhetoric—that anyone who disagrees with them is a racist traitor—is toxic in a society built on free expression. The architects of the nation-building policies from Afghanistan to Iraq are failures and should be treated with the same disdain reserved for flat earthers or bloodletters.

Do you want to prevent the next Iraq or Afghanistan or Libya or Syria from being foisted on the American public at the cost of who knows how many decades, lives, or trillions of dollars? Stop giving them an inch. Stop kowtowing to their moral blackmail. Start telling them no.

"White Supremacy Causes Black Homophobia, Says Strange NYT Writer","I’m starting to think we should be doing less to suppress ideas rooted in critical race theory and instead let them all expose themselves for how stupid they and the people who spread them really are.

Charles Blow, the forever columnist-in-training of the New York Times, is an excellent example. Blow wrote Wednesday on a few recent incidents of prominent black men who mocked, belittled, and disparaged other black men who are gay.

“Let me say first that the country has quickly evolved on the acceptance of gayness, and that includes an evolution among Black people,” he said. “But, as acceptance and visibility rise, the minority who feel threatened by gay people has grown louder. They talk in apocalyptic terms about a ‘gay agenda’ destined to recruit throngs to a gay ‘lifestyle.'”

The minority who feel threatened by gay people has grown louder? Why, that sounds awful and like something black people may want to work out among themselves.

Aha! But that’s where the social justice, critical race ideology nonsense comes in. According to that crowd, even the bigotries, prejudices, and patterns of anti-social behavior exhibited by ethnic minorities can all be traced back to the ultimate evil — whiteness.

Blow went on to say that black people who oppress other black people for being gay are actually doing so because of white supremacy. “In a society that treats racism as a sport,” he continued, “in which each racial group is jockeying against the others, all of them shadowed by a culture of white supremacy laced with misogyny, anything that reduces your percentage of straight males, or ‘feminizes’ them, is seen as weakening the race.”

Blow added that black homophobes are “doing the work of the white supremacist patriarchy.”

You probably understood none of that, but that’s because it has no foundation in logic or critical thinking (which are in and of themselves tools of white supremacy, don’t you know). No, it’s simply more excuse-making for a tendency that is, even according to leftist institutions, particularly present in a specific, non-white race.

The CDC’s website — a religious text for liberals — addresses it outright. A page on “HIV and African American People” lists the “challenges” black communities have in preventing infection. One of them is homophobia, which “can make it difficult for some African American people to be open about risk-taking behaviors.”

In other words, homophobia among black people results in a lot of black people contracting HIV because they feel pressured into keeping their homosexuality a secret.

CNN’s formerly sane Don Lemon said in 2011, “I think there is a segment of the black community — a big segment of the black community — that are homophobic and it has a lot to do with religion.” He said that “In black culture, and similar in Latino and other minority cultures, it’s the worst thing you can do as a man.”

Homophobia as an issue among black people is so well known that a 2017 headline at The Root blared the words to its 90% black audience (the other 10% are young white men who look like Rachel Maddow), “Stop Pretending to Be Shocked at Homophobia in the Black Community.”

Again, maybe we shouldn’t be trying to hush up people like Blow. Maybe we should be eagerly promoting them to show just how stupid the critical race B.S. really is.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/26/homophobia-in-black-men-is-caused-by-white-supremacy-says-very-strange-new-york-times-writer/,2021-08-26
What's Wrong With A Study That Used 'Black Names' On Fake Resumes,"How pervasive is hiring discrimination against blacks in the United States? Those who push for more extensive racial intervention efforts by the government claim this sort of discrimination has not left us, that civil rights and equal opportunity laws are not sufficient to eliminate it, and a combination of greater government activism as well as more extensive private initiatives. But are those claims valid?

One of the key pieces of evidence academics rely on to prove ongoing racial discrimination is the resume audit, in which resumes from black and white candidates are sent to prospective employers. The researchers measure how many of each receive calls from those employers. A meta-analysis from 2017 identified 21 different studies using this method; as summarized at the Harvard Business Review, indicated in the title, the evidence of these studies proves that “Hiring Discrimination Against Black Americans Hasn’t Declined in 25 Years” and, therefore, “affirmative action policies” and “more active intervention” are needed to end discrimination.

We’ve seen those calls grow, with increasing reports of critical race theory training in corporate America, which makes it all the more important to look critically behind the curtain at the proof that’s being used.

Consider the most recent such study: in a massive effort, a team of economists at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Chicago claim to have demonstrated clear racial discrimination against black applicants at 23 large American firms, in which (imaginary) black applicants were less likely to receive responses to their resumes than (imaginary) white applicants, at a difference of 2.1 percentage points. But all is not as it seems.

Here’s how the researchers (and their research assistants) conducted their study. First, they identified 108 Fortune 500 companies, with 125 entry-level jobs at each, and sent 8 fictitious resumes out for each (more or less; this would total to 108,000 but they only sent 83,000 applications altogether because some identified jobs were filled during the process). For each job, they sent four “black” and four “white” resumes; they also randomly varied the age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and political leaning of the imaginary applicants. They then measured the frequency with which the hiring employers contacted them, which was, on average, 24 percent.

Their results? First, they identified the gap in contact rates of 2.1 percentage points, black versus white. They also found that male and female applicants were equally likely to be contacted, although some companies, for some jobs, were more likely to contact men and others women. Applicants over age 40 were less likely to be contacted, with a differential of 0.6 percentage points.

Applications listing belonging to a LGBTQ club experienced no difference, nor did applications identifying “gender-neutral pronouns.” They found no statistically significant differences in contact rates across states, for the gaps for gender or age, but they did see greater racial contact gaps “in geographic areas with more prejudice as measured by Implicit Association Tests (IATs) and internet searches for racial epithets,” and reduced gaps at more profitable companies as well as companies with centralized hiring offices. The racial gaps were also greater in “customer facing sectors including the auto services and sales sector and certain forms of retail.”

What Is in a Name?

In all of the above descriptions, however, I’ve skipped over how “race” is indicated in the resumes. Their method is not the same as their approach towards signaling sexual orientation or politics, that is, involvement in a “Black Students Association” or an “Irish Heritage Society.”

Instead, the researchers assigned both first and last names that are either “distinctively black” or “distinctively white,” with the requirement that “more than 90 percent of individuals with that name are of a particular race.” They also “selected the most common distinctive Black and white names for those between 1974 and 1979”; for last names, they used common names with “high race-specific shares” in the 2010 U.S. Census.

What are those names? The “black” first names include: Aisha, Ebony, Keisha, Kenya, Lakeisha, Lashonda, Lawanda, Tamika, and Tomeka for women, and Antwan, Darnell, Jamal, Kareem, Marquis, Rasheed, Tremayne, and Tyrone for men.

The “white” first names included Allison, Amanda, Amy, Emily, Erin, Jennifer, Meredith, and Susan for women, and Adam, Brad, Geoffrey, Jason, Jeremy, Joshua, Nathan, Scott, and Todd for men.

The “black” last names included Alston, Bethea, Booker, Hillins, Jefferson, Muhammad, Smalls, and Washington. The “white” last names included Bauer, Becker, Burkholder, Carlson, Erickson, Hershberger, Olson, and Schultz.

In other words, with respect to first names, the first list is not simply “distinctively black”; it is distinctively black and poor. That’s not simply a matter of stereotype. A study by a University of California at Los Angeles researcher in 2017 identified this as a serious concern with this form of discrimination testing, citing a previous study that found that “[b]lacker names are associated with lower-income zip codes [and] lower levels of parental education,” and identifying that names of poorly educated black mothers are more likely to be perceived of as distinctively black.

An older study, from 2003, similarly found that in the ’80s and ’90s, naming conventions shifted and “led to a ‘ghettoization’ of distinctively Black names, namely, a distinctively Black name is now a much stronger predictor of socio-economic status” — so much so that that paper’s analysis suggests it is the correlated socio-economic status, not the name, that is behind these lower resume call-back rates.

Second, with respect to the last names, the “distinctively white” names are not just “white,” but signal ethnicity in their own way: virtually all of the “white” last names are distinctively German, with a minority specifically tied to Amish and related communities (Hostetler, Yoder) or Jewish communities (Klein, Meyer). This further muddies the issue because it makes it impossible to identify whether the black applicant was selected against, or whether positive stereotypes about Germans or Jews affected their likelihood of being selected.

On the Basis of Class

Could this study — and a variety of similar studies throughout the years — be fixed? It would be much harder to create a list of “middle-class black” and “middle-class white” names to test against each other, because these are far less likely to be distinctive. Could researchers test stereotypically “redneck” or “white trash” names and see whether Brandy, Crystal, Daisy, Billy, Clyde, Earle, or Travis (to take a few from a list that purports to be “104 Redneck Baby Names for the Bogan In All of Us“) have the same sort of reduced call-backs?

Or, since they tested for discrimination against LGBT people by mentioning membership in a club, could they not have tested paired resumes listing politically neutral clubs that signal race, such as singing in the African Methodist Episcopal choir versus a Methodist choir, or an African dance versus Irish dance club? In fact, in the year 2021, there’s an even clearer way (although admittedly with more work involved) to indicate race: we no longer include photographs on our resumes, but we have LinkedIn and other social media profiles with headshots that achieve the same result.

As it is, this study, and all such similar ones, are at least as likely to test whether applicants are rejected on the basis of social class. While it is a serious concern if lower-economic class workers struggle to find a job, they do have an option of adopting an alternate name for professional purposes, while someone cannot do likewise in regards to skin.

Job discrimination on the basis of race is certainly worth investigating, but it is incumbent on the researchers upon whose work politicians and policymakers rely to be able to correctly diagnose the severity of the problem before providing prescriptions to remedy it. Fundamentally, these resume audits simply do not prove what the researchers claim they do.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/26/whats-wrong-with-a-study-claiming-it-found-job-discrimination-by-using-black-names-on-fake-resumes/,2021-08-26
Don't Let Wendy Osefo Of ‘Real Housewives’ Explain Police To Your Kids,"It’s a good thing Wendy Osefo of Bravo’s “The Real Housewives of Potomac” let her husband do most of the talking with their children on policing in America. If she had been the one to do it, she likely would have filled their heads with nonsense about cops everywhere shooting unarmed black people for sport.

Osefo told her husband Eddie on the latest episode that the two should talk with their young boys “about police and relationships with police.” The scene was apparently shot around the time the Derek Chauvin trial was taking place, which Osefo, who is black, said “just made me wanting to shelter” her kids.

“I think it’s unfair that black parents have to break their children’s innocence to prepare them for the world that they live in,” she said.

Fortunately, Eddie took the lead on that conversation and told their boys more or less that some cops are bad, but his wife apparently needs her own special lecture about police and race. She has bought into the media myth that black people, men in particular, are at constant risk of being gunned down by racist cops.

It’s a lie, even though dishonest news outlets say things like “negative experiences with the police” are “an unfortunate rite of passage for many Black Americans.” That claim appeared in Politico back in June, but let’s do something Politico didn’t do — let’s look at data.

The Police-Public Contact Survey conducted every so often by the Justice Department asks respondents about their interactions with law enforcement. The latest survey is from 2018. That year, just 6.5 million black people said they had any type of contact with police. Among those, just 251,000 of them said they experienced a threat or use of force by law enforcement. This doesn’t take into account whether the threat or use of force was justified, but only that a respondent says it happened.

The total black population in the United States sits at 42,640,000, according to the Census. That would mean that barely above half of a percent of the entire black population claims to have experienced a threat or use of force when interacting with police.

When something is experienced by half of a percent of all black people, we probably shouldn’t be describing it as a “rite of passage for many black Americans.”

Now let’s look at the worst-case scenario: A black person is shot dead by a cop. The Washington Post tries to keep track of that each year. For the last full year, 2020, the Post says a total of 18 black people died in police shootings. Again, this doesn’t account for whether each shooting was justified, only that it happened.

Put another way, 0.00004 percent of the black population in 2020 was killed by cops with guns. For each year that the Post has been keeping track, the number of black people shot dead by cops never got higher than 38 and that was back in 2015.

That’s the devastating reality that Wendy Osefo has been wanting to “shelter” her kids from? That’s the “unfair” truth for black parents that “break their children’s innocence”?

Black kids, like all kids, need to learn about police and what it is they do. But don’t let them learn it from Wendy Osefo.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/14/do-not-let-wendy-osefo-of-real-housewives-explain-race-and-police-to-your-children/,2021-09-14
BLM Is Threatening An 'Uprising' Against 'Racist' Vaccine Mandates,"It’s a rule in the national media that vaccine hesitancy is worthy of shame and scorn, right up until it collides with their most precious cause, the Black Lives Matter movement.

Hesitant (white) nurses? Outcast.

Hesitant (white) Facebook moms? Shun.

Hesitant (white) Trump supporters? Guillotine.

But there’s oddly been no prescription for the Black Lives Matter crew in New York who are accusing the city of racial discrimination by mandating vaccines for public, indoor activity.

Hawk Newsome, the co-founder and chairman of Black Lives Matter Greater New York, was quoted Saturday in the New York Times saying that restaurants “are using vaccine mandates to enforce their racist beliefs and excluding black patrons.”

At a protest Monday in front of New York restaurant Carmine’s, Chivona Newsome, also a co-founder of the group, said of the vaccine mandates, “What is going to stop the Gestapo, I mean the NYPD, from rounding up black people, from snatching them off the train, off the bus?”

She further issued the threat that BLM was “putting this city on notice that your mandate will not be another racist social distance practice” and that “Black people are not going to stand by, or you will see another uprising .” She said vaccine verification “is not a free passport to racism.”

The catalyst for those remarks was an incident at Carmine’s last week wherein three black women from Texas were charged for assaulting a hostess at the restaurant, allegedly over a vaccine verification dispute and, as a lawyer for the women subsequently claimed, because the hostess, who is of Asian descent, used a racial slur.

A lawyer representing Carmine’s has disputed the allegation about a racial slur. Video footage of the incident includes no audio, but what can be seen is that the three women were being led inside the restaurant by a member of staff who was not the hostess. But once inside, the hostess is seen exiting to return to her post, when all three customers turn to follow her back outside. One of them approaches the hostess from behind and begins speaking as the others circled. A fight ensues.

Lawyers for both sides agree, though, that the dispute was not over the vaccination status of the three women, but over additional members of the party, several men, who did not have vaccine cards.

The details are kind of beside the point, though. Black residents make up a higher rate of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in New York City than white residents. They’re also vaccinated at a lower rate, with 45 percent of New York City’s adult black population having been fully vaccinated, versus 56 percent of white adults.

I don’t care if anyone, regardless of race, chooses not to receive a vaccine against COVID. That’s their dice to roll. But imagine a white Trump supporter saying his right to dine indoors among strangers shall not be infringed.

Dr. Leana Wen would be on CNN for 24 hours straight assuring us that there is no constitutional entitlement to Restaurant Week.

But because we’re talking about Black Lives Matter, which can do no wrong in the media’s eyes, suddenly vaccine mandates aren’t so pressing an issue. Suddenly, groups of people with a specific demographic raging against mandates aren’t so worthy of ridicule.

Remember that the next time a mousey CNN correspondent does one of those ungodly long segments on harm to “public health” caused by vaccine hesitancy in rural communities (Trump supporters). This isn’t about public health. It’s about politics.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/22/black-lives-matter-is-threatening-an-uprising-against-racist-vaccine-mandates/,2021-09-22
ESPN Showing Games Because Of Players' Skin Color Is Wrong,"Jackson State’s Peyton Pickett shoved his Florida A&M defender to the ground to pick up extra yards on Sunday while the crowd went wild — something Pickett and other members of Jackson State’s football team are probably used to. But what they aren’t used to is being nationally broadcasted, as the game was.

National coverage is not taken lightly in the football world. It is coveted by all teams, all divisions, and all conferences.

But in a new partnership with ESPN, members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) and Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) — which are composed of historically black colleges and universities — will receive national coverage in more than 100 games this season.

This new partnership has been praised for highlighting black athletes, but the new broadcasts aren’t doing that at all. It is dividing the sport of football — a sport of tradition and unification.

Right now, in most American homes, you can find a college football game on some sort of broadcast on TV. In week three of play, nationally ranked teams like Alabama, Florida, and Clemson flashed on many TVs, but this year these popular teams have shared the limelight on nationally syndicated broadcasts.

While HBCUs are defined as “any historically Black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black Americans,” top tier teams like Alabama, Florida, and Clemson are also schools with athletic teams historically composed of black players.

In 2018, Clemson had 57 black athletes on their roster. Of their last three national championships, two were led by starting African American quarterbacks, Deshaun Watson and Homer Jordan. But this isn’t just common at Clemson. On a larger scale, black athletes make up nearly 60 percent of all college football rosters.

Black athletes are getting covered, and for playing for schools other than HBCUs. Airing the games simply because the players are black creates division. After the new partnership with ESPN, headlines read, “Black College Football is ESPN’s New Baby.”

Head Coach of Jackson State Deion Sanders even created a separate HBCU or “black” combine for those athletes of HBCUs in preparation for the NFL draft. Instead of referring to the game as simply college football, or participating in one, shared combine, a specific distinction had to be made between the skin colors of those playing the game.

But why? For decades, the American sport has allowed those of all ethnicities to play together. Now, the emphasis on airing HBCUs makes it seem like the races must have their own circles in the sport, as opposed to sharing one.

And what happened to air time going to the teams that earned it? That is a more equal and fair option.

When people flip on their TVs to watch any athletes compete, they flip on their TVs to watch the best of the best compete. They don’t flip on their TVs just to watch “black” football, and they certainly don’t flip on their TVs just to watch “white” football either.

Conferences like SEC and BIG 10 get primetime coverage because they are the top in the sport, and they earned the right to be called that.

An historic culture comes with any big, Division I football game, and it is one that everyone can engage in and enjoy — just as the sport of football was created to do. Certainly there are teams with different demographics than the HBCU teams who aren’t getting national coverage and who are just as good, but those teams have to earn their coverage as opposed to having it given to them because of the color of their skin.

The situation would be different if ESPN were choosing to air all Division I teams, or even Division II or Division III, but ESPN is airing people for the color of their skin. If the roles were reversed what ESPN is doing would be rightly deemed segregation, because it divides the sport.

Granting teams coverage because of the color of their skin isn’t giving them respect or appreciation, but having them earn it on the playing field would. HBCUs should be aired on national TV because they are the best at playing football, not because of the color of the players’ skin. The same goes for any team, in any sport, in any division.

When President Gerald Ford was a student and football player at the University of Michigan in 1934, he nearly quit the team. Not because he was burnt out, or injured, but because his teammate Willis Ward — only the second African American to play football at the university — was told Georgia Tech would refuse to take the field if he was dressed and played.

Ford threatened to quit the team, which caused protests around campus on Ward’s behalf. Ford took a stand not so Ward could play on a separate team, but so they could share the field, and have equal status.

He took a stand so they could play the sport of football together. Football isn’t meant to be about skin colors and racial division, but about sharing the field and the sport and overcoming those divisions for the greater good.

Democrats' Betrayals For Big Business Are Piling Up. Can GOP Seize It?,"(Watch the video for a monologue on this article and an interview with the Conservative Partnership Institute’s Wes Denton on where the left lost track — and how the right can win.)

Democrats’ summer of Black Lives Matter is over. Front-line nurses’ year in the sun has passed. Gone are the COVID cries to evict no one ever for any reason at all. Disparate impact? Never heard of her. It’s 2021 now; we’ve advanced.

These aren’t simple proclamations. Go and read a newspaper from September 2020, and then glance at one from this past month. The political debates are nearly unrecognizable, it’s almost impossible to believe that the same people were often making both policies.

New York City is a leader in world liberalism. For years — and especially since May 2020 — its politicians have mangled their schools, their parks, their police force, and their courts, all in the name of fighting racism. Most of the time, the changes they made hurt blacks more than whites, but that’s beside the point; in liberalism, it’s the effort that counts.

New York City is also a leader of the world’s COVID cult. New Gov. Kathy Hochul says that if you want to serve God, you must receive the sacrament of vaccination. Mayor Bill de Blasio has decreed that all restaurants must see proof of vaccination before service.

There’s the snag: Today in New York City, roughly 72 percent of black residents aged 18-44 have not taken the novel vaccine, meaning now roughly 72 percent of black residents aged 18-44 are banned — banned — from entering dining establishments.

Statewide, 53 percent of black residents aren’t vaccinated, compared to only 44 percent of white residents who have declined the shots; yet this week, the state’s governor announced she would use the powers of this unending emergency to fire and replace as many as 72,000 health workers for refusing the vaccine.

In New York City, health-care workers were lauded as both heroes and COVID experts just weeks ago. Most of those workers are women, a plurality are black, and now, thousands of them might be out of jobs. The hospital system never collapsed due to COVID, but it might collapse due to Hochul’s measures to fight it.

New York City is not alone in reversing course: Down south in Florida earlier this month, one apartment owner promised to evict any tenants who decline the vaccine. It’s unsafe to be near the unclean, he said. So black mother Jasmine Erby and her two children were given the boot.

“There was no loophole, no working with me, no extensions and I literally had to walk away,” Irby told Fox News. “It was either get the shot or get out.”

What a difference 12 months makes. Over the course of 70 years, the Democratic Party grew from the party of segregation that Martin Luther King Jr. marched against to the party that commands 90 percent of black votes.

In the summer of 2020, the desires of black Americans were the sole obsession of the Democratic Party. Remember all those doctors and public health officials signing a letter that claimed protesting against racism was the sole valid justification for ignoring stay-at-home orders? And now they seem to want to throw all that away — all sacrificed at the altar of Covid hysteria.

Political History Can Help Explain What’s Going On

But while that might explain what, it doesn’t explain why, so what more is at play here? The answer might be found in the same history that transformed the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln into the Republican Party of Richard Nixon. That transformation is the story of business — and class.

The 1950s and 1960s Republicans never decided they didn’t like black people, despite what liberals might claim. In 2021, Democrats didn’t either, despite those viral accusations that “Democrats are the real racists!” Rather, the parties changed in other ways.

By the Civil War, the major parties were regional. Their makeup wasn’t just based on ideology, but also class and religion and what faction you were a part of. If your city’s ruling political machine was Democratic and you were opposed to them, then you might be a Republican no matter what your ideology was, and the same could happen in the other direction too.

That’s why, if you went to Young Americans for Freedom’s 1961 Rally Against Global Communism at Madison Square Garden, you saw both Republicans and conservative Democrats. That’s why the 20th century had a long tradition of “liberal Republicans,” from Thomas Dewey to Nelson Rockefeller and George Romney, all the way to Mitt Romney.

If you lived in the North, or were black, you were very likely a member of the GOP; and if you lived in the South and were also white, you were very likely a Democrat. Industry in the North, agriculture in the South — the two regions had differing economic interests, different cultures. It would take a century after the war for these political groupings to begin to change, but eventually they did.

It began earlier, but by the time Gen. Dwight Eisenhower was president, Republicans were firmly a party of Big Business: big defense, big industry, and big manufacturing. With that, their priorities changed, and along with them, their voters. As Democrats assumed the mantle of labor, the GOP positioned itself in opposition to the demands of the unions, and vice versa.

This is a simplification of a complicated time, of course. The role of government; how to combat chronic poverty; law, order, and policing; cynical identity politics — all played crucial roles. But in the end, the priorities of the Republican Party were with one class, the priorities of the Democratic Party with the other.

The Parties Are Shifting Again

Now, that’s changing again. The Democratic Party has become beholden to the Big Business it once hated so much, even at the expense of Big Labor and Big Race. Corporate money is now on their side. Wall Street, Silicon Valley — these centers of wealth chart their party’s path. The technocrats and elites have assumed direct and near-total control.

So the old, lower-class components of the Democratic party go by the wayside. Labor and the Democratic Party used to be nearly indivisible; then, President Barack Obama put environmental activists above them in the pecking order, and the relationship has never recovered. Now, urban blacks are once again being sent to the back of the Democrat bus.

They might get away with all of this. In fact, that’s the exact gamble they’re making. They’re guessing that they can mistreat their old base as much as they want, because they have nowhere else to go and so will never abandon them.

But they could very well be wrong: Populist conservatism — the kind that pays heed to the concerns of the working class — has arrived just in time to meet the shift in the Democratic Party (and Democrats are a little cross about it).

‘Science’ As a Tool of Power

Angelo Codevilla was a brilliant thinker and a wonderful man. We tragically lost him two Sundays ago. Before he left us, he wrote a lot down, thank God. Among them, this bit on the clash between the rulers and the ruled:

The ruling class’s appetite for deference, power, and perks grows… The ruling class wears on its sleeve the view that the rest of Americans are racist, greedy, and above all stupid… The rulers want the ruled to shut up and obey… The clash between the two [sides] is about which side’s vision of itself and of the other is right and which is wrong. Because each side — especially the ruling class — embodies its views on the issues, concessions by one side to another on any issue tend to discredit that side’s view of itself.

Racial politics are not immune to this struggle. Last year, the elites in charge granted themselves “emergency powers” to fight COVID-19. And not once since they gave themselves this power have our elites brooked any question about their right to rule; because now, their absolute power isn’t about politics or ideology: It’s about “science.”

“Science” rules for them. Science aligns with their exact wants and desires at any time. Science serves them, and we serve them too.

“Because ordinary people will pervert reason with ideology, religion, or interest,” Codevilla wrote, “science is ‘science’ only in the ‘right’ hands. Consensus among the right people is the only standard of truth. Facts and logic matter only insofar as proper authority acknowledge them.”

So when did he write that? July? Last fall? Maybe in March 2020? Nope: He wrote that for The American Spectator in July 2010.

Will People See the Truth in Time?

Of course, none of this means the left will surrender willingly. They may be alienating the rank and file of their old base, but they’re doing everything possible to pretend otherwise. Actual working-class men and women are souring on Democrats, but the SEIU, the Teamsters, the United Auto Workers — their leadership is thoroughly bought and sold; they’ve been accepted into the ruling class (and they like it).

In addition, the culture of partisan identity in America (a culture particularly prominent in poor communities) will be a hard thing to change. Go to the country north of Philadelphia, the land that coal left behind, and ask people who they’ve voting for. More often than not, they’ll tell you who their grandfather or grandmother voted for. Go to a black church in my neighborhood, and you’ll hear the same.

Finally, Democratic leadership is loath to surrender black radicals’ demands as a cudgel to keep middle-class whites in line. It’s an incredible weapon: The kind that can make FBI agents — grown men with badges, guns and a monopoly on legal use of force — bend the knee before teenaged rabble.

But change is coming; in both parties. With it comes a chance to crack past the hysterical demands of the “leaders” and into the rock of voting blocs that just recently seemed politically unreachable. A change like that takes the active participation of both parties. Right now, we have it, but if anyone can screw it up, it’s the Republican Party.

Instead of sitting on their hands, they’ll have to be proactive. It’s difficult, but doable. In D.C., even the minority party has tools to defund vaccine mandates. In state legislatures like Texas and Florida, they can back the governor’s executive orders with more permanent legislation.

If Big Business was as smart as it once was, its titans would donate to both parties equally. Instead, they chose Democrats, meaning the GOP is no longer beholden; honest Republicans don’t owe them a thing. This is the opportunity; seize it.

Left Claims To Oppose Racism While Spewing It At Black Conservatives,"It seems the left is always on the hunt for stories that fit their narrative of America’s prevalent racism, and for perpetrators to punish accordingly.

Just look at what happened when a man with an extensive media following played the victim card by accusing a woman of being racist after he filmed their interaction in a park. Even though the accusations are questionable — she can’t be heard saying the alleged insult in the video — she still lost her job after the man used the bully pulpit of social media to foment outrage and put pressure on her employer.

Her offense, if it happened at all, was minor compared to what leftists do to black conservatives. Yet when leftists – especially white ones and those burrowed in corporate media – all too frequently use either dog-whistle terms or flat-out racist rhetoric about black conservatives, they rarely face backlash, loss of status, or financial ruin.

During the recent campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the top challenger – Larry Elder, a black conservative – was called the “black face of white supremacy” in a Los Angeles Times commentary. This slur was repeated at a rally attended by Newsom. Around the same time, a white woman wearing a gorilla mask hurled an egg at Elder as he campaigned on the streets of Los Angeles.

No prominent (read: left-leaning) black group defended Elder or condemned the racially charged attacks against him. What if someone in a gorilla mask had attempted to assault Andrew Gillum, the black Democrat candidate for Florida governor in 2018? This would likely have been in the news cycle for weeks. The offender would have been arrested for criminal mischief at a minimum, but probably for a hate crime – which is a felony.

This double standard isn’t called out as it should be. For those of us in minority groups – and in the even smaller minority of black and conservative – we’ve lived with the hatefulness because we do not march in lockstep with leftists. In simple words, we are the true resisters.

Elder was not the first case of the left and the media disparaging a minority conservative. When Sen. Tim Scott gave the rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, the response from the left was beyond childish; it was disgusting and flat-out racist. Meanwhile, Twitter allowed the “UncleTim” hashtag to trend for more than 12 hours.

Twitter would have likely blocked or banned such behavior immediately if it had been targeted at the Big Tech giant’s ideological compatriots. But offending black conservatives apparently doesn’t violate community standards unless enough people complain to make the offense overwhelmingly obvious.

During a congressional hearing in 2017, Rep. Steve Cohen, D.-Tenn., called the Center for Urban Renewal and Education’s (CURE) Star Parker “ignorant” after she compared the verbiage of Roe v. Wade to the Dred Scott decision. He spoke condescendingly to her throughout the exchange. Again, no outrage from black or feminist organizations.

In 2015, actor George Takei called Justice Clarence Thomas a “clown in blackface” because of his stance on same-sex marriages. Nothing happened to Takei. His social media accounts remained unlocked. People moved on. Had he had said such a thing about former President Barack Obama, who opposed same-sex marriage until 2012, Takei might have been canceled.

Also in 2015, Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson was called everything from “Uncle Tom” to a “traitor to his race.” The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) declined to condemn the attacks or even comment on them, simply stating “We are a non-partisan organization.”

The Atlanta Jewish Times removed a commentary by former Georgia state lawmaker Vernon Jones because of his alleged “far-right” associations. It begs the question: would they similarly remove something written by Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock? After all, Warnock has spoken positively of antisemites and made anti-Israel comments.

We cannot forget how President Joe Biden, who is hailed as a uniter in the media, told black Americans who might want to vote for Trump: “You ain’t black.”

I have been called a “Nazi” while providing testimony at a local county council meeting against illegal immigration. That’s actually quite funny since, besides being a black conservative, I’m also an Orthodox Jew.

If you look anywhere on social media, you will find similar scenarios of black conservatives being denigrated with epithets instead of being debated with thoughts and philosophies. The real question is whether this behavior from the left is simply being ignored, or being accepted.

"The Left Wanted To Destroy The Police, And So Far They’ve Succeeded","For the past year-and-a-half, “police reform” has been at the center of public debate. After President Joe Biden and leftist Democrats took power, the radicals reintroduced their legislation to “reimagine” policing — the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

We were told that it was of momentous importance, yet three weeks ago, when it was announced that Senate negotiations had failed and the bill was finished, the overall reaction from the left was general indifference. Ruling class media expressed perfunctory outrage for a day or two, and then the issue disappeared. Why?

Let’s take a moment to consider how we got here. The real purpose of Democrats’ Black Lives Matter-inspired legislation was to destroy policing, not to improve it, as I observed last May. The bill was poison. It was built upon the big lie that American policing is systemically racist.

We saw almost a year of Black Lives Matter and Antifa mob violence with 574 riots; $2 billion in destruction, arson, and looting; at least 25 dead; and more than 2,000 police officers injured. To re-enforce this spirit of lawlessness, leftist prosecutors dismissed most charges against rioters and looters in Portland, New York City, and across the country.

While every aspect of the Democrat bill was designed to undermine law enforcement, two provisions would have directly dismantled the police and resulted in thousands more black people being killed. First, the bill would have stripped the protection of qualified immunity for individual officers, causing more officers to leave the job or retreat from fighting crime. Second, in deference to tenets of critical race theory, the bill would have made it law that any group-identity statistical disparities in investigation or enforcement results would constitute prima facie proof of racial profiling.

Law-abiding minority citizens want the police in their communities. Eighty-one percent of black Americans want to keep or increase the number of police officers in their neighborhoods. But this bill would have prevented police from proactively policing high-crime black communities. A leftist, race-based enforcement quota system would have permanently diverted vital police resources away from high violent-crime neighborhoods.

Mission Almost Accomplished

So why was the radical left so quiet when its legislative plan to destroy policing failed? Because their mission has already been almost completely accomplished. In virtually every major Democrat-run city and beyond, policing as we know it has been undermined beyond recognition — perhaps beyond repair.

The numbers speak for themselves. America’s crime epidemic saw a 30 percent homicide surge in 2020, the biggest ever. Almost 10,000 homicide victims were black — 53 percent of all victims, despite blacks constituting only 13 percent of the U.S. population.

The Black Lives Matter Marxists’ program of defunding, demonizing, and dismantling the police has emboldened criminals and caused police to pull back. The war on cops has also escalated. Already this year, 241 officers have been shot, 44 killed by gunfire, and ambush attacks have increased 103 percent.

Black Lives Matter, Democrats, the ruling class media, and rogue prosecutors have broken the police. Perpetuating the myth of systemic police racism has justified eliminating cash bail, ending qualified immunity, and enacting laws that practically legalize theft. In Democrat-run cities, proactive policing is dead. Officer morale is at rock bottom and many of the most qualified veterans are bailing out. Last year across the country, retirements increased by 45 percent and resignations by 18 percent.

Finally, the radical left has insidiously and effectively undermined our law and civil order through an organized takeover of states’ attorneys offices by radicals. Funded by leftist billionaire George Soros, these rogue prosecutors subvert the system from within — dismissing thousands of felony cases, failing to charge violent criminals, and arbitrarily refusing to prosecute quality-of-life crimes, such as public urination or prostitution.

In this way, no matter how effective local police are at arresting criminals, their efforts are sabotaged. Massive spikes in violence are directly connected to pro-criminal Soros prosecutors in Chicago, Baltimore, Austin, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and other Democrat-run jurisdictions.

Last year’s BLM/Antifa armed rioting and today’s out-of-control violent crime demonstrate that when the mob and street criminals run wild and police pull back, American civilization disintegrates. This is the ultimate objective of the leftist elites.

How Can We Fight Back?

Faced with such a vast array of anti-police power, what can we do? Two options remain. In Democrat-run cities, residents and neighbors must organize, speak out, and take grassroots political action outside the Democratic Party machine. In Republican states, citizens and elected leaders must enact unabashedly pro-police laws and policies — everything the Democrats are not.

Unfortunately, in most Democrat-run cities with leftist mayors and city councils, subversive prosecutors, and increasingly more woke police chiefs, things will get a lot worse before they get better. Violent crime is intensifying and spreading, but average citizens are beginning to fight back.

Austin, Texas, is ruled by a leftist Democrat mayor and city council who enacted one of the most radical defund the police efforts in the country — $150 million, one-third of the police budget, was cut. The result has been a public safety disaster. Homicides in the city have increased 44 percent over last year and 200 percent compared to five years ago. During the past year, police retirements increased 65 percent and resignations 63 percent. Undermanned, the Austin Police Department no longer responds to citizens’ 911 calls for eight categories of crimes and disturbances.

But Austin residents have stood up, putting an initiative on the November 2 ballot to hire more police officers and increase officer training. However, the arrogance and extent to which leftist elites will go to demolish the police knows no bounds. Soros, who funded the radical Travis County district attorney, has also sunk $500,000 into a campaign to defeat Austin citizens’ public safety initiative.

Florida Leads

Fighting for the police and preserving the rule of law in every Republican state is crucial. In this fight, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is leading the way.

Of all America’s governors, DeSantis has been the most outspoken in his support for police and the rule of law, proclaiming, “Make no mistake: the reason that you have such huge spikes in crime in many parts of the country is because of not standing up for law enforcement, having weak policies where you’re letting people out, and you’re not prosecuting people who are committing habitual offenses. That is clearly causing disastrous consequences.”

Under DeSantis, Florida enacted the “Anti-Riot Bill,” increasing penalties for crimes committed during violent assemblies and protecting law enforcement officers and law-abiding citizens. The Florida law also makes it more difficult for municipalities to defund the police.

The leftist elites, whether in the form of Black Lives Matter Marxists, Antifa anarchists, socialist Democrats, subversive district attorneys, or critical race theory race hustlers, know that American civilization cannot survive without law, order, and public safety. This is the reason they are destroying the police. And this is the reason that the American people must stop them.

What Kamala Won’t Tell Black Churches Is What They Need To Hear,"Vice President Kamala Harris will be appearing by video message in more than 300 black churches in Virginia from now until the state election on Nov. 2. Reports call Harris’s outreach plan an effort to “boost” Democrat candidate Terry McAuliffe in a tightening race for governor of a state that both parties are eager to claim as a pivotal prize heading into the 2022 election cycle.

NEW — More than 300 Black churches across VA will hear from @KamalaHarris btwn Sun. and November 2 in video message that will air during morning services as part of outreach effort aimed to boost @TerryMcAuliffe.#VAGOV Video first obtained by CNNhttps://t.co/vaefXtWqUe pic.twitter.com/l8re0KUkN1 — Eva McKend (@evamckend) October 16, 2021

I am sure Harris expects a nearly automatic reaction to her plea, and that it will produce overwhelming support from the black parishioners targeted. After all, who can forget President Joe Biden’s message to the black community when he said “you ain’t black” if you don’t vote Democrat.

As a black conservative and former state attorney general, I’m excited for what the vice president will choose not to say to the congregations of these 300 churches. Here’s why.

Harris will very likely not talk about the 20 million black children who have been aborted since the 1973 Roe v. Wade court decision legalizing abortion. She won’t talk about the generations of black youngsters, children and even grandchildren of the black babies aborted, who themselves were never born thanks to Democrats’ staunch advocacy for a procedure that targets black women.

She won’t talk about the population of American blacks continuing to stagnate and decline as a result of the disproportionate percentage of black abortions in America as compared to all abortions performed. Although black women make up only 13 percent of the female population in the United States, they account for 36 percent of U.S. abortions. This disproportionate figure is almost exactly the ratio of incarcerated blacks compared to the population of blacks in the country — 35 percent to 13 percent.

So why am I so excited if she’s not going to talk about the sanctity of life, or the violence that’s destroying black communities, or the discord in our public education system that is failing to adequately prepare young black children for economic opportunity? Because black America knows there is a problem and especially the black church knows there is a problem.

The problem is that the black community has been down this road before and has seen decline over the past several decades despite entrenched Democrat leadership in large urban centers and blue states like Virginia. Homicide and violent crime are up 30 percent over a year ago, which is a big deal in the black community as, despite being only 13 percent of the population, black Americans represent 56 percent of murder victims nationally and approximately 90 percent of the murderers of other blacks.

Black churches are aware of these astonishing murder statistics because it’s the black clergy who get the calls from government officials late at night to quell the violence and calm the crowd. It’s the black churches that hold the funerals for the scores of young black victims of self-inflicted urban violence. All this while Democrats continue to strip law enforcement budgets to prove they’re “woke” to leftist “defund the police” BS and black communities suffer loss of police protection.

While the Democrat Party, led by Biden and Harris, tries to mandate this country further and further into a socialist agenda, it’s the black community who constantly gets the shaft from these same Democrat politicians who promise them the moon, the sun, and the stars every election cycle. Then, once the black vote is secured (thus securing the election), Democrats expect the black community to stay patient while moving them further away from that promised moon.

Never mind a black agenda item such as education choice reforms that would provide marked improvement for young black boys and girls. Instead, Democrats prioritize loosening border restrictions and allowing more illegal entries, which will further burden public education and negatively affect the black children trapped in low-performing public schools.

Vice President Harris may have sung in her church choir, but she has never advocated for the lives of unborn children. The black church, however, rightly supports life as a gift from God that should never be abandoned.

Democrats in Virginia believe it’s not only legal but acceptable to allow babies born alive to be kept comfortable and simply die out after birth. This can never be the position of the church in America, whether it be black or white.

The “black church” is no different from the “white church” in its recognition of the need for a great awakening that will restore America as one nation under God, dedicated to justice and mercy and committed to loving our neighbors. Yet the vice president and the Democrat Party go out of their way to insist that America be a nation that does not honor its Creator, the importance of family, and the role of fathers and men in shaping the character of young boys.

The black church had a front-row seat to experience the advances in the state of black America during the Trump administration, with record-low unemployment and economic gains that resulted from policies that actually uplifted and empowered black citizens as independent stakeholders, not merely as pawns of one party or the other.

I hope the church is paying careful attention to what Vice President Harris is not saying — and that the values of the black churches and all churches in Virginia find their way to the voting booths on Nov. 2.

CCP-Friendly Firms Like BlackRock Are Pushing U.S. Companies Leftward,"While Americans continue to suffer from the effects of a global supply chain shock, seemingly never-ending pandemic restrictions, and skyrocketing inflation, another, potentially even more serious crisis is developing behind the scenes.

In meetings in China, Davos, and Wall Street board rooms, bankers, government officials, and, most importantly, investment management firms like BlackRock are transforming the global economy by using their massive amounts of power and wealth to coerce corporations to promote causes favored by elites.

The Handful of Firms That Control Trillions

Fueled by trillions of dollars of new government spending and trillions more printed by the Federal Reserve and injected into the financial system under the guise of “building back better,” BlackRock and other investment firms have amassed unprecedented amounts of wealth in recent years, which they now regularly use as a tool to push for societal changes.

BlackRock, the world’s largest investment management corporation, now controls nearly $10 trillion in assets. (Just one year ago, it controlled less than $8 trillion.) And that’s just one of many large investment firms. The ten largest management firms have more than $41 trillion in assets under management, nearly double the annual gross domestic product for the United States (about $21 trillion).

Investment firms don’t use the fortunes they manage to build swimming pools of money; they buy assets, especially stock and real estate, in order to provide a good return for their investors and to increase their stranglehold on Wall Street. Investment firms like BlackRock now control so much stock, in fact, that they can effectively force virtually any large corporation in the United States to do — well, pretty much anything they want.

According to scholars at Harvard Law School, the three largest investment management firms — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — “collectively cast an average of about 25% of the votes at S&P 500 companies,” and that data is a couple of years old. The number is almost certainly higher today, based on previous trends. When you add other large firms to the mix, the number goes even higher.

Pushing Left-Wing Agendas

BlackRock, State Street, and others are using their stock to force companies to adopt policies and social causes promoted by elites, many of which align with left-wing goals.

The most important tool for accomplishing this strategy is environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, a new framework for evaluating businesses. Under an ESG model, which has already been widely adopted by corporate America, companies are rewarded or punished based on how they score on dozens of metrics developed by bankers, investors, activists, and, in some cases, government officials.

For example, one influential ESG model developed by the International Business Council of the World Economic Forum — one of the leaders of the international “Great Reset” movement — evaluates businesses based on their commitment to the Paris Climate Accords, water use, “ecological sensitivity,” and, among many other things, the “Percentage of employees per employee category, by age group, gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

Although there are many politicians in America, Canada, and the European Union seeking to use government to enforce ESG metrics, at present, the primary drivers behind the movement are investment firms like BlackRock and banks. BlackRock has been one of the world’s biggest supporters of ESG metrics, using its power as one of the world’s largest shareholders to pressure companies to change society.

BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been an open supporter of the Great Reset movement’s use of ESG metrics. Fink has even asserted he believes in just five years “everything we do” will be affected by ESG scores.

The widespread adoption of ESG standards explains, in so many ways, why hundreds of large corporations have in recent years appeared to become propaganda mouthpieces for left-wing elites, on issues ranging from voter identification laws like Georgia’s to critical race theory.

In China’s Pocket

As troubling as all of this is for those of us who believe in the decentralization of power and wealth and the importance of individual rights and decision-making, there are also good reasons to believe this massive, cronyist ESG machine now being built could soon be heavily influenced or even hijacked by foreign entities, most notably China.

Some of the key figures promoting the Great Reset, “sustainable investment,” ESG standards, and other mechanisms for altering the world have also spent the past few years striking deals with the Chinese government, selling their souls to Beijing in exchange for access to China’s lucrative investment opportunities.

BlackRock, for example, secured in the summer of 2021 a highly sought-after deal with China’s government to offer investment products and services in China. Importantly, the deal came just days after BlackRock and other management companies met with key Chinese officials concerned about the international community’s perception of China in the wake of its government’s recent authoritarian activities.

The episode was recently reported by The New York Times’ Li Yuan, who noted, “At the height of a market sell-off in late July, the deputy chairman of China’s securities regulator, Fang Xinghai, summoned executives of BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and other firms to a meeting, trying to alleviate investor nervousness over Beijing’s crackdowns, according to a memo I reviewed.”

“Some 20 days later,” Yuan continued, “regulators approved BlackRock’s application to offer mutual funds in China. Around the same time, a BlackRock executive told The Financial Times that China was underrepresented in global investors’ portfolios and in global benchmarks. The firm recommended that investors boost their allocations by two to three times.”

The only thing worse than having Davos and Wall Street elites engineer society as part of a “reset” of the world economy is having those same elites beholden to the Chinese Communist Party.

What To Do About It

The United States is in desperate need of change, but Americans shouldn’t expect the federal government to solve their problems. Washington is corrupt, and if recent history has taught us anything, it’s that few improvements occur regardless of which political party is in control of Congress.

Americans need to once again turn their attention toward their local communities and state governments, which can act as safeguards against overreaches from the federal government, Wall Street, and international institutions like the United Nations. We also must start buying, banking, and investing locally. Corrupt corporations and large investment management firms have little, if any, influence over local businesses and governments.

Finally, conservatives need to reemphasize the importance of balanced budgets and limiting the power of the Federal Reserve. One of the biggest reasons Wall Street has so much power is because trillions of dollars have been funneled into investment corporations and banks over the past several years. The national debt and the Fed’s quantitative easing policies aren’t problematic merely because they pose significant economic risks, they are helping to further the centralization of power in the hands of a small class of elites in government and business.

Like it or not, the Great Reset of our economy is happening. To beat it, we must change our tactics and, more importantly, rethink our priorities.

"Blackburn Grills TikTok On Invasion Of Privacy, Ties To Communist China","Sen. Marsha Blackburn tore into TikTok’s Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman in a recent hearing, grilling him on the company’s invasion of user data and its connections with the Chinese Communist Party.

Blackburn began by pointing out that although the social media giant had previously promised that it would never share user data with the Chinese government, their privacy policy allows them to share data with parent companies. One such company is ByteDance, where the Chinese government has recently obtained both a board seat and an ownership stake.

Blackburn questioned Beckerman on TikTok’s ties to China, asking “Does TikTok share user data with its parent company ByteDance?”

Beckerman dodged the question, citing a report that indicates TikTok does not share user data directly with the Chinese government, while sidestepping the issue of ByteDance’s access to user data.

Blackburn also asked if TikTok has programmers and data teams in China, to which Beckerman answered “we have engineers in the United States and throughout the world,” prompting Blackburn to reply “that answer is yes,” which Beckerman does not deny.

Blackburn also pointed out that TikTok collects a wide variety of biometric user data, including “face prints, voice prints, geolocation information, browsing and search history, not just on TikTok but on other apps.”

When challenged on this data collection, Beckerman eventually reverted to a sales pitch for the app, saying “TikTok is an entertainment platform where people watch and enjoy and create short-form videos” saying that “it’s about uplifting and entertaining content.”

Blackburn later called out the company’s data collection practices when she remarked “in essence, what you’re doing is making our children and their data, you’re making that the product,” going on to note that the data is sold and “weaponized against” users.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/26/blackburn-grills-tiktok-on-ccp-ties-invasion-of-privacy-youre-making-our-children-the-product/,2021-10-26
"Indiana University Sent $55K, Professors To Push Critical Race Theory","Indiana University, one of the largest and most well-funded public universities in the United States, funneled $55,000 to a left-wing education conference in exchange for exclusive marketing services and exposure, according to a public records request reviewed by The Federalist.

The July conference for educators and administrators was hosted by the nonprofit Indiana Black Expo and had the title “Education Equity: The Role of Schools and Universities in Leveling the Playing Field.” Indiana’s Republican-run government also financially supported the event through grants. It featured two prominent critical race theory (CRT) activists, Dena Simmons and Bettina L. Love, as reported by The Federalist this summer.

Simmons notably told attendees that people should not “let whiteness seep into us,” after making headlines months prior for telling teachers in Illinois they are inherently racist while being paid $175 per minute with public dollars. Love spoke at Indiana’s Black Expo for 85 minutes on the topic “We Gon’ Be Alright, But That Ain’t Alright: Abolitionist Teaching and the Pursuit of Educational Freedom.”

Rolling Out The Red Carpet

Indiana State University, a different government-run institution, spent more than $27,000 to support the CRT conference for educators across the state in exchange for services, according to a prior Freedom of Information Act request. The new documents obtained through the Indiana Access to Public Records Act show IU, Indiana’s flagship state university, exchanged $55,000 for eight different services as the “title sponsor.”

Due to this sponsorship, IU received its name on the masthead of the conference website. Black Expo referred to the controversial event as the “Indiana University Education Conference” and let IU place an advertisement. Likewise, the school had its “name and/or logo” on “all virtual marketing advertising” and obtained “premium signage on virtual platform screens.” All this gave the appearance of government support for the critical race theory-spreading conference.

In addition to being greenlit to provide a two-minute welcome speech to attendees and introduce the keynote speakers, IU administrators, whose salaries are funded by public dollars, gave critical race theory training at the event. Black Expo granted IU the opportunity to host workshops at their conference.

One such workshop was moderated by Monica M. Johnson, assistant vice president for diversity education and cross-cultural engagement for IU. Johnson, who was appointed to her post in September 2020, spoke on “Higher Education’s Role in Advancing Equity.” The talk can be viewed here.

Johnson was joined by four other IU staffers for the panel, including Rachel Ann Brooks. Brooks, the university’s director of diversity and inclusion, discussed the Black Lives Matter riots last summer. She said students “leveraging their voices” and “saying enough is enough” indicates America is at a crossroads. In her view, universities will either “show up or step back “for the left-wing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) agenda that encourages treating Americans differently based on the inborn color of their skin.

Another workshop IU headlined was titled “Real Talk? How to Discuss Race, Racism, and Politics in 21st Century American Schools.” Delivered by IU school of education professor Marcus Croom and planned by his left-wing consulting group Brio Education, the workshop is the same title as an August book by Croom.

The public university instructor, who made $39,700 last year from IU according to public records, is no stranger to controversy. On Oct. 10, Croom shared a lecture on Twitter by openly racist and anti-semitic Rev. Al Sharpton with the hashtag “realtalk.” His feed also shows extensive support for CRT czar Nikole Hannah-Jones—the writer behind the ahistorical New York Times “1619 Project.”

While Croom’s Black Expo address has not been made public despite his position and the event being sponsored through government agencies, it is clear where he stands on CRT. He is a major proponent and verbatim uses the term, unlike other proponents who use “diversity” and “equity” lingo for the same thing due to public backlash against such initiatives.

Croom proclaims on his school website that he “generate[s] knowledge through case study and qualitative methods using post-White vindicationist philosophy, practice of race theory (PRT), and race critical practice analysis.” Croom also claimed in a Feb. 2020 paper titled “Meet Me at the Corner: The Intersection of Literacy Instruction and Race for Urban Education” that “[a]fter critical race theory was introduced to the field of education, a number of works advanced our knowledge related to literary instruction and race.”

‘The Berkeley Of the Midwest’

The new information obtained by The Federalist sheds light on how one of America’s major public institutions is advancing the extremist left’s racial agenda despite being ostensibly overseen by Republican lawmakers. Todd Rokita, Indiana’s Republican attorney general, expressed to The Federalist his discontent with IU’s equity initiative and connections with Black Expo.

“Schools can and should teach history accurately, including reflecting on the contributions and struggles of all Americans, from all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds,” Rokita said. “However, committing discrimination in the name of ending discrimination is illegal, and only serves to create a hostile environment that further divides us.”

Rokita’s office, however, declined to comment as to whether it will take any legal action against IU for its potential racial discrimination.

U.S. Rep. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican who is head of the House Republican Study Committee, told The Federalist Republicans in the state ought to take charge now on opposing CRT. Parents within the state are currently pressing state lawmakers to address the issue in the upcoming January 2022 session.

“Critical race theory is a dangerous and divisive ideology that has no business in any educational setting, let alone our publicly-funded universities,” Banks said. “State legislators should address this funding next session due to the overwhelming Hoosier opposition to these ideas.” The congressmen sent a memo to committee members in June calling for lawmakers to “lean into the culture war” and join the “organic movement” against divisive left-wing dogma.

Still, this is nothing new for IU. According to the school’s website, it has been a “proud supporter” of Black Expo for “more than five decades.” IU also describes on its website how the conference centralized critical race theory. “Planned topics include equity challenges in K-12 and higher education during COVID-19,” said the school.

It remains to be seen whether Republicans in the state will take action to oppose the divisive ideology pushed in the taxpayer-funded Black Expo conference. The Federalist reached out to top lawmakers in the legislature regarding the event but to no avail. The governor has yet to respond to a request for comment.

“IU should not receive one public dollar while they are the ‘Berkeley of the Midwest,” William Ellis, chairman of the Monroe County Republican Party—where IU-Bloomington is located—wrote in an email to The Federalist. “IU’s leftist policies seem to go unchecked time and again, so I have little hope that more than hand-wringing will be done to get IU back to its mission of education as opposed to indoctrination.”

IU did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Black Expo President and CEO Tanya McKenzie. See the contract agreement between IU and Black Expo below.

How BlackRock Endangers U.S. Prosperity And National Security,"BlackRock is a big, powerful company that most Americans know little about. It manages almost $10 trillion, and the vast majority of its investing is done “passively,” meaning the money is invested in indexes of stocks and no stock-by-stock selection occurs. BlackRock manages money for large institutions and pensions. Just about everyone reading this has money, or knows someone who has money directly or indirectly in a BlackRock account.

Despite BlackRock passively investing for most clients, it wields immense power — both over the companies whose shares it holds, and through them over the American economy. This is because, even though BlackRock is not the ultimate owner of the shares it manages, it can vote those shares on behalf of its clients.

That tremendous voting power enables BlackRock to exert extraordinary influence over corporate management and policy. Those corporations are themselves often behemoths like Exxon and Microsoft. Moreover, BlackRock functions in an intensely oligopolistic environment. Only three other asset managers — Fidelity, Vanguard, and State Street — begin to compare with it in size and heft, and it is the biggest of them all.

BlackRock Touches Almost Everyone’s Daily Life

BlackRock is a major cause of corporate leftism in America, using its power to push for left-wing political priorities. In the just-completed third quarter of 2021 alone, BlackRock opposed the reelection of 800 company directors. In just one example, because of BlackRock’s leverage, big American oil company Exxon is considering dropping several drilling projects due to BlackRock removing board members and installing new members — despite the globe objectively being underinvested in energy production. If your gas costs more, think BlackRock.

BlackRock also contributes to the economy’s monopoly problem. Despite the unfortunate consolidation of power within a few large companies, the largest companies in a single industry should still be competing with each other head-to-head on price and quality. Thus, American Airlines, Delta, and United should all be seeking to provide better or less-expensive service to air passengers.

But BlackRock and the other big asset managers have “cross-holdings” in all of the largest players in the industry, a consequence of passive investing. Indeed, BlackRock and the other asset managers are often the biggest shareholders in each of an industry’s largest firms.

When this situation was analyzed in the airline industry, researchers found higher prices (less competition) on routes between two competing airlines when the airlines both counted the same “passive” manager as their largest stockholder (Eric Posner and Glen Weyl survey the evidence in their book “Radical Markets”). So: if your air carrier loses your bags, provides shoddy service, or charges you too much, think BlackRock.

BlackRock is also a prominent cause of the unprecedented rise in housing prices that has killed the dreams of so many Americans to own their own homes. BlackRock is leading the way to buy up single-family homes, purchasing a large chunk of homes nationwide to list them as rentals. Of course, most of your “conservative” politicians have been silent about these problems and have proposed no hard-nosed policies to combat them, such as capping corporations’ ability to buy up single-family homes.

Here’s the kicker. While BlackRock is pushing corporate wokeness in America, they are also tight with China. China’s massive human rights abuses and carbon emissions (nearly double those of America) are not impediments to this relationship.

BlackRock wants market access to China’s huge but troubled economy, putting the Chinese Communist Party in a position to manipulate BlackRock and Wall Street. The company recently became the first foreign-owned company allowed to offer a set of mutual funds and other investment products for Chinese consumers.

China’s Economic Woes Are America’s Investments

First, take a step back. Chinese stocks have performed terribly in 2021. The Chinese economy is slowing, and the country has substantial underlying problems. The population is aging fast.

Meanwhile, the property sector is in trouble. Because of China’s state-run banking system, which underpays for deposits in order to subsidize loans for state-owned companies, and because of a lack of trust in China’s public markets, Chinese consumers have plugged money into property to amass multiple condos and flats. A large chunk of the sales in the last year alone were for “investment” purposes.

In other words, it is extremely common for middle-class Chinese families to sit on a half dozen flats or condos as a retirement asset, hoping to pass these along at a higher price when they need to raise cash in retirement. This type of behavior and market structure is unstable.

Chinese residential property is a $60 trillion asset class — the biggest in the world — and activity related to the property sector contributes to nearly a quarter of Chinese economic activity. China’s overall corporate sector sits on a massive debt load relative to the size of China’s economy. You’ve heard about this in the news if you’ve heard about Evergrande, but this is only one of many troubled property developers.

As China’s government confronts these problems, the government is also cracking down on industries and launching anti-monopoly measures, especially where the investors who lose out are mostly Americans or other foreigners. China’s industry crackdowns have been abrupt and sudden, and American investors have been taken without warning.

At the same time, many other Chinese companies have been subject to accounting scandals — a result of poor accounting standards in China and China’s unwillingness to allow their companies to be subjected to American accounting standards, despite these companies having many American investors.

Aside from ramifications for the Chinese economy if such a huge segment is troubled, American investors in offshore Chinese debt stand to lose out in particular. One might say these investors took their own risks and should face the consequences, and that’s probably true for investors in Chinese property debt. But many investors in Chinese equities are unknowing Americans who — through the likes of BlackRock — hold a large basket of Chinese equities in their retirement accounts.

BlackRock’s Conflict of Interest in China

Despite all these concerns, Wall Street — led by BlackRock — is telling clients to buy Chinese investments. In August, after a particularly large crash in Chinese stocks, BlackRock said investors should triple their exposure to China.

In September, after Chinese investments fell further, BlackRock said investments in China should be increased because risks of government intervention were already priced in. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are also still selectively “bullish” on China (although maybe not as much as BlackRock).

To be fair to BlackRock and other Wall Street firms, China’s market looks cheap after this year’s crash, but there are many reasons investors should be wary about diving in. Investing 101 tells you that “cheap” stocks can remain cheap for a long time, and often get even cheaper.

Rupert Darwall, a senior fellow at the RealClear Foundation, warns that Wall Street in general, and BlackRock specifically, are at risk of Chinese pressure influencing their investment decisions. Legendary investor George Soros (even if you vehemently disagree with his politics, he is an extremely gifted investor) called BlackRock’s investing billions in China a “tragic mistake” that will harm U.S. national security and investors. Soros is right.

Let’s flush this out. Why does China care if Wall Street is telling its clients to buy, and how could these investment decisions harm national security?

To put it bluntly, Wall Street appears to have a conflict of interest. Here’s how the New York Times’ Li Yuan put it:

Even while Beijing tightens its grip over business and the economy, it is giving global investment firms greater opportunities to serve Chinese companies and investors.

At the height of a market sell-off in late July, the deputy chairman of China’s securities regulator, Fang Xinghai, summoned executives of BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and other firms to a meeting, trying to alleviate investor nervousness over Beijing’s crackdowns, according to a memo I reviewed.

Some 20 days later, regulators approved BlackRock’s application to offer mutual funds in China. Around the same time, a BlackRock executive told The Financial Times that China was underrepresented in global investors’ portfolios and in global benchmarks. The firm recommended that investors boost their allocations by two to three times.

In other words, because China is so extremely intolerant, and because Wall Street wants to do business in China, Wall Street may be afraid to slap a “sell” on Chinese investments for fear of retaliation from the Chinese government. Worse, Wall Street might be incented to put more client assets in China in return for greater business access. Something similar appeared to happen when the index creator MSCI introduced a large weight to Chinese equities in its popular emerging markets index.

How This Harms U.S. National Security

This potential conflict of interest harms national security in two ways.

First, aside from putting hard-earned American pension dollars at greater risk, sending money into China directly helps the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is short of dollars, and needs more of them to sustain its system and keep monetary policy from becoming too tight.

Actions like screwing foreign investors make it likely that capital will flee China, not enter the country (although tight capital controls reduce the ability of capital to leave and, already, U.S. companies in China are having trouble pulling money out). If Wall Street is directing client accounts to greater China exposure, that’s helping fix a problem of reduced dollar inflows that the CCP created.

Second, this is a national security issue because if systemically important American firms with tremendous lobbying power are tied to China, we are prone to greater foreign influence on our politics and on our foreign policy.

Consider that the big media companies running pro-China coverage of the coronavirus origins — CNN, NBC/MSNBC, and ABC — all have substantial business ties to China via their parent companies AT&T, Comcast, and Disney, respectively. Consider also the Wall Street and multinational corporate lobbying against tariffs, simply because these firms are already tied to China. This wouldn’t be the first time corporate power negatively influenced U.S. policy decisions, either.

Politicians Must Act

BlackRock is emblematic of a larger problem with corporate America, and policy action is in order. Short-term and country-less globalist multinationals should get penalized for their business activities in China, including the pollution created there.

Companies like Nike and Amazon, which produce many of their products in China, pay far below what American small businesses or small corporations pay, simply because they are large and multinational, allowing them to manipulate their tax liability by shifting profits overseas (Nike’s effective tax is less than 15 percent and the company has paid no federal tax for several years).

Democrats are largely captured by these corporations; Democrats’ new tax bill will likely skip raising corporate taxes but increase small business taxes. But so are many Republicans, even though these corporations hate Republican voters. Such a political situation is unsustainable and ripe for a shakeup.

BlackRock deserves particular scrutiny. BlackRock activities, including voting of passive shares that enables monopolistic activity and pushes leftwing agendas in corporate boardrooms, and buying up single-family homes, deserve a policy response. A competent Congress would grill BlackRock executives about what threatens to look like a conflict of interest, where China induces behavior on Wall Street in return for market access.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/03/how-the-massive-money-manager-blackrock-endangers-u-s-prosperity-and-national-security/,2021-11-03
"As Leftists Cry 'White Supremacy,' Black GOP Woman Makes History","“What you’re looking at is the American dream.” Thus began the victory speech by newly elected Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears, peppered by cheers, applause, and a chorus of “Win-some, Win-some,” before a patient and packed house in Chantilly where the GOP held their election night headquarters.

It was shortly before 1 a.m., by which time Republican Glenn Youngkin had been declared the winner in governor’s race, that Sears, a U.S. Marine veteran, took to the stage flanked by her husband Terence, also a Marine, and two adult daughters, Katia and Janel.

Sears is the first black female to win statewide office in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 2001, Sears became the first, and still only, black Republican woman elected to the House of Delegates in Virginia, winning in an upset over a 20-year Democrat incumbent. Along her path, the 57-year-old native of Kingston, Jamaica ran a homeless shelter and served as vice president of the Virginia State Board of Education.

Sears’s American dream began seven months prior to her own birth when her father immigrated to the United States on August 11, 1963 with a mere “$1.75 in his pocket.” Sears would later ask her father why he came to the United States during a time as turbulent as the civil rights movement. “Because America is where the jobs and opportunities are,” he told his daughter.

“When I joined the Marines I was still a Jamaican. But I was willing to die for this country,” Sears said proudly, adding she is “proud to be American and its future,” as the crowd began to chant “U-S-A, U-S-A!”

“There are those who want to divide us, and we must not let that happen. They would like us to believe we are back in 1963 when my father came … We can live where we want. We can eat where we want. We own the water fountains,” said Sears. “We have elected a black president – twice. Here I am. Living proof! In case you haven’t noticed, I am black and I have been black all my life,” continued Sears to increasing applause and cheers.

Sears was referencing McAuliffe and his media cheerleaders calling Youngkin and his supporters white supremacists, a smear that makes no sense considering the same electorate just also voted in a black lieutenant governor and a Cuban-American attorney general in Jason Miyares.

But logic did not stop idiotic statements from the tone-deaf left. Disgraced former ESPN sports reporter Jemele Hill doubled down on this failed theme. Mere minutes after Sears gave her impassioned and inspiring victory speech, Hill tweeted, “It’s not the messaging, folks, This country simply loves white supremacy.”

Joy Reid of the far-left MSNBC, opined “Education [using air quotes], which is code for white parents don’t like the idea of teaching about race … You have to be willing to vocalize that these Republicans are dangerous.” This is about a Commonwealth that cast more than 1.66 million votes for Sears and nearly that many for Miyares in their victories.

MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace also piled on with a lie that has been running rampant in progressive circles, that “critical race theory, which isn’t real, turned the suburbs 15 points.” Of course, critical race theory is real and Virginia schools have boasted about teaching it. But not for long, should Youngkin fulfill his promise of banning the racist ideology designed to conquer and divide school children into indelibly permanent classes of victim and victimizer.

“But that’s not what this is about,” said Sears. She listed a litany of goals for the upcoming administration such as citizens keeping more of their own money, safer neighborhoods, and “our children are going to get a good education. Education lifted my father out of poverty. Education lifted me out of poverty. Education will lift us all out of poverty,” she declared, adding that children will “not just survive, but thrive, with marketable skills and create generational wealth. We will have transparent government.”

“This is a historic night. I did not set out to make history. I just wanted to leave it better than I found it,” said Sears, paraphrasing a strongly held American Indian belief. “Help is on the way. The cavalry has arrived,” concluded Sears to more applause as she thanked her family, supporters, and team on such a momentous time in the Commonwealth of Virginia.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/04/as-leftists-cry-white-supremacy-black-republican-woman-makes-history/,2021-11-04
Why Republicans Should Be All Over The Alabama Coal Miners’ Strike,"On Nov. 4, New York City police arrested a group of coal miners peacefully protesting outside the Manhattan headquarters of BlackRock, the biggest financial asset manager in the United States. The demonstrators were there because of a bitter strike by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) that began last April against Warrior Met Coal, Inc., which mines non-thermal metallurgical, or “met,” coal in Brookwood, Alabama.

Warrior Met is a leading U.S.-based producer and exporter of met coal. It describes itself as an “environmentally and socially minded supplier to the global steel industry.”

BlackRock holds a roughly 14 percent stake in Warrior Met, making it one of the major shareholders in the company. (Other large asset managers, including Vanguard and Fidelity, also own large blocks of Warrior Met stock). The demonstrating miners targeted BlackRock, along with other large institutional owners of Warrior Met, because its holdings in the company give it the leverage to force management to end the strike, which management has so far shown no signs of wanting to do.

The arrest of the Alabama coal miners outside BlackRock’s headquarters is a parable of contemporary America. Here’s why.

Why Blackrock Matters

Although hardly a household name, BlackRock is among the top five owners in almost every major global company. Thus, it holds one of the top five voting blocs of shares in each of those companies.

BlackRock has shown no hesitation in muscling corporate management in the past. Its CEO and founder Larry Fink issues a letter every year to the CEOs of corporate America, laying down the instructions he expects them to follow.

When Fink speaks, corporate America listens. For example, massive oil producer Exxon is considering dropping several drilling projects after BlackRock forced out Exxon board members and installed new ones in their place. If BlackRock can roll Exxon, it can roll Warrior Met.

Why the Strike?

The main objectives of the strike are to recover some of what the UNMA contends were $1.1 billion in concessions the union made in 2016. At that time, the debt-laden Walter Energy—which owned Warrior Met’s predecessor, Walter Resources—was restructured in corporate bankruptcy.

Walter Energy’s Alabama assets were bought out by an entity called Coal Acquisition LLC, which served as a vehicle for a consortium of private equity firms and hedge funds. The restructuring terminated Walter’s collective bargaining agreement with the miners, and its replacement with Walter’s successor, Warrior Met.

That agreement, which expired last March, required major sacrifices from the miners. They agreed to a $6 an hour pay cut, a $1,500 deductible and co-pays up to $250 (up from a $12 co-pay) for health care insurance, and the elimination of what had been double or triple overtime pay for weekends and holidays.

In the miners’ view, these concessions helped restore Warrior Met to profitability. The UMWA International’s president says his union’s members “are the reason Warrior Met even exists today… They made the sacrifices to bring this company out of the bankruptcy of Walter Energy in 2016.”

$45,000 a Year for Difficult, Dangerous Work

Overtime has become the crucial issue in the current strike, with miners claiming the company forces them to work 12- or even 16-hour shifts that stretch into weekends, and on every holiday except Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas. Warrior Met has countered with an offer of a $1 per hour wage increase, with an additional hike of 50 cents an hour in four years. It refuses to rescind the 2016 $6 per hour cut. Management also demands the right to fire strikers and to award seniority to the strikebreakers (some call them scabs) on whom it is now relying.

The Brookwood miners’ current pay averages $22 an hour. To make that, they may have to work in mining shafts that can go 2,000 feet below the surfac, and travel up to 10 miles to reach the coal face.

Since Warrior Met emerged from Walter’s bankruptcy, it has returned to profitability. Like many other energy suppliers, it had a bad 2020 because of Covid-19. But global demand for coal has soared this year, owing in large part to ostensibly pro-environmental government and corporate policies. Senior Warrior Met executives have reportedly awarded themselves bonuses of up to $35,000 this year.

Warrior Met’s recent third quarter of 2021 saw its most profitable results since the onset of the lockdowns. Its CEO boasted that “[w]e were ideally set to take advantage of the record high pricing we saw this quarter, enabling us to leverage the strong global recovery by increasing our average net selling prices and delivering strong production during the ongoing union strike. . . . [W]e are finding that strong steel and coal demand globally, as well as the Chinese ban on Australian coal imports, are providing tailwinds that play to our strengths.” (China is refusing to buy Australian coal because the Australian government has called for an international investigation into the origins of Covid in Wuhan.)

With Warrior Met now firing on all cylinders—and profiting from China’s boycott of Australian coal—the miners expected a fair share of the gains. But Warrior Met’s managers and owners are saying, “Eat cake.” That leads us back to BlackRock.

Where Does BlackRock fit in?

BlackRock was founded in 1988 by its current CEO, Fink. BlackRock is the world’s largest private asset manager, controlling almost $10 trillion in assets for its clients. BlackRock has only three competitors of comparable, although smaller, scale.

The bulk of BlackRock’s business consists in managing non-public portfolios for institutions. Institutional clients include governments, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, and both private and public pension plans. Although its clients own the shares it manages, BlackRock decides how to cast the proxy votes for most. This gives BlackRock immense power over corporate management. It is not restrained in using that power.

Asset managers like BlackRock follow both “passive” and “active” investment strategies. Most of BlackRock’s holdings were, and still are, “passively” managed, meaning the performance of those funds is designed to match that of stock market indices whose contents are calculated by companies other than BlackRock, such as Standard and Poor.

Passive investment creates a portfolio of stocks weighted by market capitalization rather than by other factors such as social responsibility or environmental practices. In concentrating historically on passive investing, BlackRock was relying on the “efficient market hypothesis,” which affirms that over time the best risk-adjusted returns are obtained from a portfolio that mirrors the stock market at large, rather than one that involves “active” selection of particular shares.

“Passive” investment is, however, a low-fee and competitive environment for BlackRock and other asset managers. In recent years, BlackRock has increasingly promoted “active” (and, for BlackRock, much more lucrative) investment models based on economic, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors.

Thus, BlackRock pledged to reduce holdings in fossil fuel companies in its actively-managed ESG portfolios, and specifically to screen out companies that generate more than 25 percent of their revenues from thermal coal. As of last January, however, BlackRock held $85 billion in coal company shares in its index-linked portfolios.

The ESG investment style that BlackRock is using to brand itself has had its share of powerful critics. The former head of BlackRock’s ESG investing has denounced it as a “dangerous placebo.” U.K. hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn has said that BlackRock’s climate change credentials are “full of greenwash.” So, to paraphrase the scriptures, BlackRock’s voice sounds like Jacob’s, but its hands may be Esau’s.

BlackRock and the Democratic Party

BlackRock is a major DC “swamp” denizen with has close and substantial ties to the Biden administration and, before that, to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. The Atlantic reported in January 2019 that in a meeting with candidate Joe Biden, Fink told him, “I’m here to help.” Fink also angled for the position of secretary of the Treasury under would-be-president Hillary Clinton.

BlackRock’s years of help for the Democratic Party have not gone unrewarded, either in policy or personnel. Biden’s Securities and Exchange Commission and Labor Department are attempting to impose BlackRock-promoted ESG mandates on securities markets.

The head of Biden’s National Economic Council is a BlackRock alumnus, and one of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin’s top advisers had earlier been Fink’s chief of staff. BlackRock has a hold on the Biden administration as tight as investment banker Goldman Sachs had on the Obama administration.

Now, Back to the Arrested Miners

Suppose we were to take BlackRock’s (and Warrior Met’s) professions of social responsibility at their word. Also, let’s suppose that in owning a large piece of Warrior Met, BlackRock is not compromising its alleged environmentalist goals. Why shouldn’t BlackRock lean on Warrior Met’s management to cut a deal with the striking Alabama miners?

At the worst, that might mean a nick to Warrior Met’s bottom line. Even so, Warrior Met is an insignificant part of BlackRock’s massive holdings. Why should that matter to a—serious—socially responsible asset manager? Indeed, why should it matter to Warrior Met, which also claims to be socially responsible, and apparently can hand out large bonuses to its senior executives?

Warrior Met’s offer to the strikers is derisory. It would not restore them to the position they had when Walter Energy went broke five years ago. It would not allow the miners’ wages and benefits to keep pace with the inflation that BlackRock’s powerful allies in Washington DC are causing. Warrior Met might actually have the pricing power to ride out the Biden inflationary storm, or even to benefit from it. But its workers, if they are bulldozed into accepting its terms, would be badly squeezed.

Instead, what do we see? A protracted miner strike that is all but ignored by the corporate-friendly MSM. A coal mining company that vaunts its wokeness but tries to crush a strike by those who work for it. Behind it all, BlackRock, which wants the peace of its Manhattan Park Avenue office undisturbed by the rabble from Alabama who go 2,000 feet underground to mine coal for it 16 hours a day, weekends included.

Republican populists should be all over this strike, even though the establishment Republican Party is happy to trash blue-collar strikers. The Alabama miners are our people and our voters. Fink and his plutocratic crowd are our sworn enemies. They own the Democratic Party. Let them have it: it’s going down to defeat soon enough anyway.

GOP presidential hopefuls should be swarming to Alabama to rally the miners and show support for their cause. (Donald Trump, are you listening?) GOP members of Congress should have BlackRock in their cross-hairs. They should be drafting the legislation that will unfasten its grip on corporate America. And why shouldn’t Tucker Carlson do a segment on the miners’ strike?

"Thanks To Leftists, The Black Talent Big Biz Seeks To Hire Doesn't Exist","We haven’t yet reached the spectacle in which woke workplace zealots demand that NBA teams suit up at least one black, one white, one Asian, and one Hispanic player in their starting line-ups, but some private workplaces are coming close. The human resources protocols of one of the world’s largest financial investment firms are taking woke quotas to a surreal new level.

According to the Times of London, hiring managers at State Street Global Advisors will need to seek permission before hiring additional white males. State Street aims to triple the number of black, Asian, and other minority staff as part of a drive to improve diversity within its management by 2023.

Failure to meet the target will result in a drop in executives’ bonuses. Woke-ism seems to outweigh capitalism. Instead of serving their clients’ interests by hiring the best financial advisors, State Street’s clients have been taken hostage by woke-ism.

State Street is headquartered in the United States, with offices in dozens of other countries. Unfortunately, State Street and many other Fortune 100 companies with diversity hiring initiatives will have severe difficulty meeting their targets regarding black representation in the United States, and at least partly because of leftist politics.

Too Few Qualified Black Candidates

That’s because the current talent pool of qualified black candidates is likely not large enough to meet these goals of “equal representation.” The reason for this is not the “systemic racism” we are consistently told about. Ironically, the same left-leaning organizations pointing their fingers at capitalism and crying “racism” are responsible for the underrepresentation of black people in nearly every facet of society except prisons and professional sports.

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), a federal agency that tracks academic performance, says that 80 percent of black students graduated from high school in 2019. However, in order to achieve the impressive 80 percent, school boards in at-risk areas lowered academic standards. If the standards were consistent with the 1990 or 2000 standards, the graduation rates would be much lower.

For example, in 2015, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board voted unanimously to deem a 1.0 grade point average as passing rather than deny such students a diploma. In Baltimore earlier this year, a student who passed only three classes in four years ranked near the top half of his class with a 0.13 grade point average, according to Forbes. The district ran on a $1.4 billion budget for only 78,000 students – a cost of $18,000 per year per pupil, according to the magazine.

College graduation rates for black students are not much better. Based on a 2019 report from the NCES, only about 40 percent of black students who enter college graduate with a degree in six years. For black males, graduation rates are 34 percent, smaller than any other demographic tracked.

Policy Not Privilege Created Today’s Disparities

The woke left built a Ponzi scheme in public education that has bankrupted the black community financially, morally, and academically. Now the left is trying to infect the private sector with the same failing philosophies. It is easier to blame rich white suburbanites and brand them with “white privilege” than to admit that decades of misguided leadership, social welfare programs, and failed policies have decimated the two-parent black family, creating the academic, financial, and boardroom disparities we see today.

What we have seen in the black community in the past 50 years is nothing short of cultural genocide. When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, nearly 80 percent of black children were born into two-parent families. Today, nearly 80 percent of black children are born into fatherless homes.

Stacks of credible research conclude that children raised without a father are more likely to exhibit behavioral problems, face abuse and neglect, abuse drugs and alcohol, commit crimes, go to prison, and drop out of high school, taking them out of the running for the corporate boardroom. Fatherless homes generate disparities that range from health care to economic liberty.

Lack of representation in corporate boardrooms, corporate leadership, and many other sectors of society is not because of mythical white privilege. It is due to the breakdown of the black family, which prohibits children from learning behaviors required to achieve success academically and beyond.

Left Has Long Controlled Failing Schools

The left has for decades controlled school boards and administrations in nearly every American city. Their stewardship has not produced stellar outcomes and innovative new programs. The only visible gains are seen in increased budgets and career advancement for progressives, all while producing a long list of excuses for student failure and blocking school choice for parents desperately wanting to move their children from failing and dangerous schools.

State Street’s bow to woke-ism is good news for savvy, honest, and scrappy entrepreneurs who care more about their clients than worshipping woke gods. The lurch to the left by global corporations creates new market opportunities for companies that serve customers’ interests in lieu of popular ideology and suit up the best financial advisors, regardless of race or ethnicity.

Medical Journals Replace Scientific Method With Critical Race Ideology,"Rejection used to be common for medical sociologist Thomas LaVeist when he tried to get his research published on the effects of racism on the health of black people. “Now,” said the 60-year-old dean of Tulane University’s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, “I have those same journals asking me to write articles for them.”

LaVeist’s experience illustrates the transformation in medical research. While few would dispute that black Americans are more prone to chronic health problems and have shorter life expectancies than whites, the medical community generally sought answers in biology, genetics, and lifestyle. Research, like LaVeist’s, that focused on racism was frowned upon as an amateurish detour from serious intellectual inquiry.

In recent years, and especially since Black Lives Matter protests erupted last year, systemic racism has been transformed from a fringe theory to a canonical truth. Medical researchers offer a sweeping socio-political explanation for racial health disparities by citing the hundreds of peer-reviewed articles authored by LaVeist and a host of others, thus conferring upon the study of systemic racism the imprimatur of scholarly authority.

This year, the National Institutes of Health issued an apology to all who have suffered from structural racism in biomedical research. The NIH is dedicating $90 million to the study of health disparities and structural racism, engaging in more than 60 diversity and inclusion initiatives, and committing “every tool at our disposal to remediate the chronic problem of structural racism.”

Deemed incontestable, systemic racism provides the political rationale for “dismantling”—in the words of no less an authority than the NIH—the institutions and cultural standards that, according to the framework’s advocates, are maintained to uphold white supremacy.

The consequences of ignoring this new prime directive for racially focused research were made clear this year when the top two editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association were pressured to resign after the organization ran a podcast that questioned whether systemic racism explains racial health disparities.

“This is the first time the NIH has issued a call for research on structural racism. This is the first time JAMA fires an editor who said something wrong about racism,” says Shervin Assari, an associate professor of family medicine and urban public health at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles, one of four historically black medical schools in the U.S. Assari has authored more than 350 papers on race, social determinants, and health equity

To institutionalize its new policy, JAMA is revising its peer review standards and diversifying its ranks to advance health care equity, a term that refers to narrowing or even eliminating racial health disparities in chronic conditions and life expectancies. Similar steps are being adopted throughout the medical profession. A lead editorial in JAMA’s August special issue dedicated to racial health disparities called systemic racism a scientific fact beyond dispute and said all medical journals are morally obligated to document it in their research.

Racial health disparities underlie the four-year gap in black-white life expectancy in the United States. Factors that contribute to this disparity include chronic conditions, unintentional injuries, and suicide and homicide, which is the leading cause of death for black males aged 44 and younger. Scholars committed to the systemic racism explanation blame the disproportionately high crime rates in poor black neighborhoods on discrimination, substandard schools, and other manifestations of systemic racism.

The rapid turn of events has blindsided traditional doctors.

“The spectacle of the gatekeepers of medical publications announcing a political blueprint that medical authors must follow – or else – is pretty breathtaking,” Thomas Huddle, who retired this year as professor at the University of Alabama–Birmingham’s medical school, said by email. “The medical gatekeepers are in the grip of a moral panic.”

Some find the systemic explanation to be leftist polemic, while others doubt that it explains everything it claims to explain. These skeptics worry about the career implications of publicly dissenting from the new orthodoxy – but it’s also possible that blaming an entire national culture for racial disparities could prompt independent scholars and conservative think tanks to produce opposing research that explores black-on-black murder, racial disparities in IQ testing, and other taboo subjects.

The transformation sweeping through the health-care profession is not happening in a vacuum. It mirrors social justice movements committed to exposing structural racism that allegedly pervades education, criminal justice, the arts, hard sciences, and other domains of U.S. society. Activists in those fields, as well as medicine, talk of dismantling white supremacy and other “structures“ that cause racial and gender power imbalances and harm non-white groups.

Skeptical physicians say that medical journal editors are essentially replacing the scientific method with a political ideology, namely critical race theory, and leaving little room for alternative explanations—such as personal agency or cultural differences.

“There’s a tremendous amount of groupthink,” said Stanley Goldfarb, a former dean for curriculum who taught about kidney disease at the University of Pennsylvania medical school before retiring this summer. “If you don’t agree with all that, you’re a bad person.”

All I Want For Christmas Is An Un-Woke ‘Survivor’ Season,"–Season 41 spoilers ahead.

In a crazy yet classic finale, “Survivor” Season 41 concluded last week, turning castaway Erika Casupanan into a victor and recipient of the $1 million prize. Erika may have won by outwitting, outplaying, and outlasting her fellow competitors, but viewers lost a lot this season.

For decades, “Survivor,” one of the longest-running reality TV shows of all time, has captured the attention of viewers worldwide with daring physical challenges, mind-boggling puzzles, and deliciously dramatic twists. Unfortunately, the latest season is plagued with virtue signaling that is turning off viewers including me, who are asking Santa for an un-woke season 42 coming in 2022.

What producers bragged would be the most diverse cast in the show’s history, due to literal race requirements implemented by the network, turned into a season peppered with quotas and grandstanding that heavily focused on themes present in the race-based ideologies being taught in schools, corporate workplaces, and universities.

Survivor has tons of fans just like me who, after giving the show a random chance one day, got hooked on the challenges, tribal councils, and theater. But what started as an addictive, escapism TV show that gave players of all shapes and sizes a shot at becoming the winner of a million dollars and the fame that comes with it quickly morphed into a woke performance. The dramatic “social experiment” that captured viewers’ attention for years has slowly but surely pivoted to cater to the woke crowd.

And while host and producer Jeff Probst often brags that what happens on the island is a reflection of the outside world to some degree, the show’s producers and even Probst himself are involving themselves to move the leftist culture agenda in the show forward. In the first episode of Season 41, Probst’s iconic catchphrase, “Come on in, guys,” was questioned by the host himself, who asked competitors if he should change it to fit the radical gender ideology that many institutions have accepted.

One of the castaways, Evvie Jagoda, a self-proclaimed “queer woman,” said she didn’t have any problems with the phrase. But later, contestant Ricard Foyé, who has a “transgender, pregnant husband,” said he thought the phrase should be modified to be more accepting.

“I’m with you. I want to change it. I’m glad that was the last time I will ever say it,” Probst gladly agreed before encouraging viewers who disliked the change to “@” him on Twitter.

Unfortunately, Probst’s catchphrase wasn’t the only virtue signaling on the show. Later in the season, after four of the show’s black contestants formed an “all-black alliance,” the black castaways reflected on the tension they feel between voting out their alliance members, thus cutting down the chances of having a black winner, and playing the game strategically based on the show’s goals to outwit, outplay, and outlast other contestants, which has nothing to do with race and everything to do with physical, mental, and social skills.

“Everywhere I go as a black woman, I’m a black woman first… There’s no question that we’re coming out of a year like 2020 where people are just now becoming conscious of the fact that being black actually means something. It has this currency that can kill you… literally kill you. Coming here to play this is about uplifting other black people and giving black people something to root for, [aside from] everything else that’s out there that’s killing us,” castaway Liana Wallace said, invoking the familiar critical race theory that says life should be viewed through a race-based lens.

She also commented. “how beautiful that we are starting out with a cast that is 50 percent POC [people of color, meaning people who aren’t white].”

Wallace’s black tribemates eventually voted her out of the game and onto the jury, after which she posted how proud she was to be “the catalyst for having important discourse in white households across America.”

“I formed a black alliance because I am a black woman, and Survivor, being a microcosm of the real world, would not let me forget that. I formed a black alliance in solidarity. I formed a black alliance because it meant George Floyd, Emmett Till, and that little black girl with a dream who might be watching knew that I saw them and that I would not forget them, not even for $1 million,” Wallace wrote on Instagram.

DeShawn Radden, another black castaway who made it to the final round of the game, also commented on how his race reportedly affected his gameplay.

“The gameplay and morals intersected, and it was so hard,” he said on the brink of tears. “This is the game I love, and I came here to play it, but people don’t understand that extra baggage you bring into this game. It’s a blessing to have such a diverse cast, but I didn’t think this decision, this moment, would be so hard.”

The speeches guilted Xander Hastings, a white male who made it to the final tribal council, into admitting some form of white privilege for not considering how race might change the way players approach the game in the reality tv show.

Viewings for the show were already dropping below the six million threshold usually required to stay on air prior to this woke theater, partially due to increases in streaming the show through the Paramount Plus app, but multiple people on Twitter testified that they halted their viewership following the show’s virtue signaling. They were quickly branded as racist for opposing the show’s shift to the left.

CBS can you let me know when the trend of replacing white racism with black racism ends, so I can go back to enjoying the regular version of the shows?#Survivor @CBS https://t.co/mptAmnmLFV — Sentient Meat (@icymi1900) October 28, 2021

I’m done #Survivor . The moment you allow racism on your show, you should be cancelled immediately. Shame on you #cbs — Neal White (@NealWhite13) October 30, 2021

Another CBS show with this blatant racism. This show is done. This woke nonsense is unwatchable. The producers and the network set this all up just like they did on BB. Time to move on. R.I.P. #Survivor — JM House (@JMHouse9) October 28, 2021

Several former “Survivor” cast members and victors also spoke out against the wokeness, noting their disappointment with the show.

“It’s a big deal when you take tradition out of things. That’s a huge deal,” Russell Hantz, who was branded as one of the show’s “most memorable villains,” said in a video posted to his YouTube channel.

“We created this game. We did this. We have passion towards the game. And when you take away iconic sayings in the game, when you take away that from us, it feels like a slap in the face,” he added.

Victor Parvati Shallow from “Survivor: Micronesia Fans vs. Favorites” also said she disagrees with Probst’s decision even though she admires him as a person.

“I think Jeff might be having a bit of an identity crisis,” she said on “Rob Has A Podcast.” “I think he’s just coming in and he’s like, ‘I got to be super woke. I got to say all the right things to make sure all the different groups of people are feeling heard and seen.'”

When previewing Season 41, Probst claimed the show was getting back to its beginnings but also promised that the show’s woke campaign would continue.

“For right now, where ‘Survivor’ needs to go is with fresh faces, fresh voices, players who are of the moment, players who can let us watch them and learn,” he said.

Viewers don’t want woke theater. They want the old “Survivor” that gave young, old, black, white, American, Canadian, Republican, and Democrat contestants a shot to outwit, outplay, and outlast their competitors for a shot at a million dollars. The new version of “Survivor” isn’t cutting it, and if wokeness continues to plague the show, nobody wins.

It's Time For The Black Community To Embrace A Post-Racial America,"In some respects, I feel as if we are living through a time like Charles Dickens, “The Tale of Two Cities,” of which he wrote, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.”

We are bombarded with messages claiming America is overflowing with systemic racism and white supremacists. Even the National Council on Family Relations now labels the traditional two-parent family an extension of white privilege.

If you listen exclusively to the news media, the entertainment industry, and the academic-industrial complex, you will be surprised to learn this truth: This is the least racist period in the history of our country.

Having lived in the Jim Crow south, my parents and grandparents would have loved to have grown up in the America I grew up in. A large percentage of the country has been operating in a post-racial America for many years. Across our nation, people have been interacting with each other with respect, dignity, and compassion regardless of race. They have been judging people by the content of their character.

We can pass laws that allow me to enter the front door and reserve a room in any hotel in this country, but we can’t pass laws to force people to open their hearts and their homes to people who don’t look like them. But that is precisely what Americans have done for decades. So how do we explain the differences in the realities on the ground and what we hear in the media?

My family is a classic example of the “best of times – worst of times” and of the disparity between reality and rhetoric. My children, who are now adults, grew up in a two-parent family. They had their challenges, but they also had stability, unconditional love, and clear boundaries.

Unfortunately, there is a stark contrast with their cousins on my side of the family. Of my four siblings, my children are the only ones who grew up with both a mother and father in the home. As a result, the lives of my siblings’ children have been interwoven with trauma and tragedy.

How do we explain these differences? Was it systemic racism built into American society? Or was it something else? We have two tales from the same family with the same skin color, yet the disparities are quite broad.

On the day Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, I was five years old. At that time, nearly 80 percent of black children were born into two-parent families. Sadly, in my lifetime, we have seen the black community transform from 80 percent two-parent families to 80 percent fatherless homes without one national initiative to reverse the trend.

If the American black family was a spotted owl or a gray wolf, it would be on the endangered species list. Instead, what has happened to the American black family is nothing short of a cultural genocide.

This is not the dream King had in mind, and it has been a nightmare for children born during this period. The black community has been used as a political pawn for 50 years.

Therefore, I have taken on this crusade to begin a transformation back to cultural roots in the black community and reverse a trend that has devastated generations of families, including helpless children born into situations not of their own making.

I know from personal experience that this country is not systemically racist. My parents and grandparents lived through systemic racism. I did not.

Unfortunately, my siblings made different decisions in their lives. All four of them used drugs and three were incarcerated. Far worse, their children were left to be raised without fathers in their lives. Theirs are the stories of many families ravaged by the lack of father involvement, personal responsibility, faith, and most importantly, hope.

I mourn deeply for what has happened to their lives. My children live in wide disparity from their own cousins, and it is not because of the color of their skin.

To be clear, we do have racist people in our country that do bad things to people, but the country is not systemically racist. To put it another way: If you look for racism in this country, you’ll find it. If you look for opportunities, you will find them 100 times over.

How do we resolve this “Tale of Two Cities,” the 80 percent fatherless homes and the chronically low graduations rates for black high school students? Ironically, the power to change ultimately lies in the hands of black Americans. I would like to direct the following comments to black Americans throughout the country.

For far too long, we have watched our black communities destroyed from within. As a community, we are worse off now than we were before the Civil Rights Era.

We have it within our power to move forward and begin a transition of healing and growth that is long overdue. And we do not need government help or funds to accomplish this transformation.

We are missing out on opportunities in this country to which we are fully entitled as American citizens, opportunities that seem to be clearly visible to nearly everyone except native-born black Americans. Many of us are blinded by tears of anger, mistrust, and misunderstanding that lead to decisions that are not in our own best interests.

Today, black American citizens who have legally immigrated from the Caribbean Islands and African countries like Nigeria earn significantly higher incomes than native-born black Americans. They achieve higher levels of education. They are living the American dream civil rights leaders desired for us.

Many of these new citizens came to the country with intact families, which helped with their achievement and integration. Another reason for their success is they have not been indoctrinated by years of anti-white, anti-American, and anti-capitalist hatred.

Now more than ever, it is imperative that we reconcile with the past sins of our nation, re-establish two-parent families, and rebuild our culture and join other Americans around the “Table of Prosperity” as fellow citizens of this great country. How do we get started?

I believe it starts with tapping into the strengths of our cultural roots, which are linked to our Christian faith. Forgiveness is the cornerstone of Christianity. Just as God extends forgiveness to us in Christ, we are called to forgive others.

As we forgive the country for the sins of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and many other forms of bigotry that followed, the heavy burden of bitterness, anger, and resentment will be lifted from our shoulders. Our eyes will be opened so we can clearly see the path forward allowing us to focus on what is best for our future and the future of our children.

To forgive is an act of strength, not weakness, and we must begin the healing and strengthening process in our communities. This is our Prodigal Moment. It is time to come home.

Now, to all Americans: Our shared history transcends political parties, race, religion, and class. It is a shared humanity that binds us together like the intertwined roots and branches of trees in a dense forest.

Organized groups are igniting forest fires to divide and destroy our unique American culture. It’s imperative that we not only extinguish their efforts, but foster a new movement that nurtures, unites, and strengthens us as Americans, regardless of race, for generations to come.

District Pays $57k For 'Woke Kindergarten' Program To 'Disrupt Whiteness',"A Bay Area California school district that agreed to spend $40 million on creating an ethnic studies curriculum hired several critical race theory organizations to assist their push for “Anti-bias/anti-racism.” While the startling figure revealed the scale of Hayward Unified School District’s push for critical race theory, previously unreported public records and even the district’s website more fully encapsulate Hayward Unified’s extremism.

The district, which consists of 19,000 K-12 students in three high schools, five middle schools, and 21 elementary schools, dedicated $123,000 for a variety of critical race theory training programs for staff and students that expressed extreme sentiments. This expenditure included an organization called “Woke Kindergarten” that received $57,000 to teach public school teachers and staff how to “disrupt whiteness.”

Woke Kindergarten

A contract between the district and Woke Kindergarten revealed that the far-left organization founded by Akiea Gross was paid $50,000 by the district to conduct workshops and trainings for staff members at Glassbrook Elementary School. The contract abstract says staff members were expected to “learn how to use Woke Kindergarten’s resources and pedagogical approaches in practice as a way to disrupt whiteness” and “white dominant/settler colonial narratives.”

Pale skin color, or “whiteness,” has become one of the prime targets of critical race theory. After lying about teaching CRT, Los Angeles Unified School District hosted a critical race theorist who taught staff how to “challenge whiteness.”

This summer, The Federalist broke the news that the American Psychoanalytic Association published an article by psychoanalyst Donald Moss that accused whiteness of being a “parasitic condition.” Infamous critical race theorist Robin DiAngelo even wrote a book maligning what she called “well-meaning whiteness.” Now, pale skin has become a target of Hayward Unified School District. Less than 4 percent of the district’s students are white.

A separate contract with Woke Kindergarten revealed that the district paid an additional $7,000 for them to implement learning practices through an “abolitionist lens.” Although the organization’s website domain is expired, their YouTube account displays overtly partisan extremism.

A minute-long video intended for children titled “Spot the Difference” compares images from the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021 with Black Lives Matter protests, specifically those that did not result in violence, chaos, arson, or death. By bypassing the numerous examples of leftwing terrorism, Woke Kindergarten teaches children the opposite of reality: that the right is uniquely violent while the left, the very same left that caused at least 25 deaths and up to $2 billion in damage through their riots in 2020, are persecuted victims.

One video fawned over failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams while another called “We Keep Us Safe” includes lines like “fund communities not police,” as well as the slogan “abolish the police.”

The organization’s Instagram account boasts the same extremism, with one post encouraging children to support the “eradication” of America’s borders, which are allegedly “invisible man-made ideas that colonizers created.” In another post, the organization’s founder complains that critical media coverage amounts to far-right violence.

As the name implies, the organization was made to indoctrinate young children into left-wing politics. One post explains that Woke Kindergarten began when its founder led a protest in what appears to be a kindergarten classroom where children made protest signs and chanted “no Donald Trump.”

Through her work with Woke Kindergarten, Gross has collaborated with other critical race theorists such as those at the Bank Street College of Education, where she has been a repeat panelist at the college’s Black Lives Matter at School Conference. Gross gave a speech at the conference in 2019 where she remarked that “we have to burn the whole system down” if we want “black children to thrive in schools,” a remark that earned her a cacophony of applause.

Anti-Racist Math?

The district also hired Quetzal Education Services for professional development, with two different contracts amounting to a total price tag of $23,000. The organization hosts professional development trainings to “disrupt white fragility” but specializes in injecting CRT into math courses with its anti-racist math workshop series, which trains teachers in “anti-racist math pedagogy.”

Quetzal is too extreme to work within the framework of diversity, equity, and inclusion, a common Trojan horse for CRT. Their website explains, “We are abolitionists and antiracist practitioners. Diversity, inclusion, and tolerance fail to provide the empowering education we seek for Black and Brown youth & our communities because those efforts continue to center whiteness.”

Critical race theorist Lori Watson and her organization Race Work also received a total of $43,000 from the district between two different contracts. Watson, who condemns the U.S. education system as “inherently racist,” was paid by the district to run staff trainings and to run a program called SLAM, an acronym for Student Leaders’ Antiracist Movement. SLAM, like Woke Kindergarten, intends to turn students into leftwing activists.

Watson’s website explains that SLAM is designed to “empower and mobilize them as catalysts for change through an anti-racist leadership youth movement,” continuing to say that students will “develop the skills and tools to disrupt systemic racism.” Watson doesn’t just seek to turn children into allies, she seeks to turn them into “co-conspirators,” echoing a theme found in the curricula of other California public schools.

Public School District Explicitly Endorses CRT

Hayward Unified hasn’t merely contracted the push for CRT out to external organizations. It’s also pushing the corrosive theory directly. One document pertaining to race and equity explicitly mentions CRT. This press release invokes the theory as well and explains that “efforts to develop an Ethnic Studies framework are informed by and will include Critical Race Theory and the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.”

Their anti-bias/anti-racism page is also rife with calls for racism. The “Home” section lauds Dena Simmons, a critical race theorist who said “we can’t let whiteness seep into us” at a taxpayer-funded conference. The page displays a month-by-month breakdown of the push for CRT in the district, with each one focusing on a different topic. One month prominently features the words “you are on Native land.”

Advertising Group That Works to Defund Police

The district’s “Equity and Anti-Bias/Anti-Racism” page features a brochure for staff, families, and students respectively, each of which promotes CRT resources and organizations. Reclaim the Block is one of the organizations advertised in the student brochure.

According to its website, Reclaim the Block “began in 2018 and organizes Minneapolis community and city council members to move money from the police department into other areas of the city’s budget that truly promote community health and safety.” The organization believes that “public safety without policing is possible and necessary” and its website features multiple calls to either “divest” from or to “defund” the police.

A number of other organizations are listed on the student brochure including Black Lives Matter and The Audre Lorde Project, which describes itself as “a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two Spirit, Trans and Gender Non Conforming People of Color center for community organizing.” Although it is linked incorrectly, students are also encouraged to visit the website Unicorn Riot, a far-left media collective that reports favorably on Antifa, the domestic terrorist group that was responsible for much of the chaos during the Black Lives Matter riots.

One book that Kendi recommends is “Black Marxism: The Black Radical Tradition,” which condemns “racial capitalism.”The brochure also gives several book recommendation lists, including a book list from infamous critical race theorist Ibram X. Kendi. The list opens with a foreword in which Kendi claims that people can’t become “not racist,” but rather “can only strive to be “antiracist” on a daily basis, to continually rededicate ourselves to the lifelong task of overcoming our country’s racist heritage.” One book that Kendi recommends is “Black Marxism: The Black Radical Tradition,” which condemns “racial capitalism.”

Hayward Unified’s push for critical race theory is one more striking incident of government schools pushing racial grievance politics on staff and students at the expense of American taxpayers.

Why Fighting Divisive Racial Narratives Is A Patriotic Necessity,"Charles Love’s Race Crazy: BLM, 1619, and the Progressive Racism Movement arrives in the midst of a glut of books about The 1619 Project, Black Lives Matter, and the various incarnations of the modern woke movement. While many of these books are fine contributions to the corpus chronologizing America’s disturbing descent into tribal conflict, a decade from now, Love’s book—a brilliant admixture of deep-dive journalism and social commentary—is the book that will be remembered because of its patriotic ambition.

How is Race Crazy patriotic and how is it ambitious?

To appreciate the book, it would be helpful to explain what the book is most certainly not. Anyone looking for a polemic against left-leaning America or a screed bemoaning every policy position of the modern Democratic Party will be disappointed. It is not a “political book” in the modern sense of the term. Neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden make any significant appearance.

It is a book that seeks to explain that there is a pernicious and stealth movement in modern America seeking to both undermine, and in some cases, “dismantle,” the basic tenets of America’s liberal traditions and institutions.

Love places himself squarely and proudly in the tradition of Jeffersonian liberalism, Madisonian constitutionalism, the redemption of Gettysburg, and the 14th amendment, as well as the titanic achievement of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He juxtaposes this tradition of individualized liberty and personal agency with what he calls the “progressive racism movement.”

As he writes, “The 1960’s Civil Rights movement championed by Dr. Martin Luther King and other courageous advocates of racial equality, has been stood on its head. In our now race-obsessed society, one’s identity—long regarded as personal and self-created—has reverted to being tribal and genetically determined.”

As Love sees it, there are two pillars to the progressive racism movement that are deeply misunderstood. The first one is BLM.

Anyone with a scintilla of political awareness now recognizes that there is a colossal chasm between affirming the sentiment that “black lives matter” versus offering financial, corporate, or political support for the ideals of the Black Lives Matter organization itself.

As Love writes, “Corporations who donate to them are contributing to their own demise, blacks who march with them are marching for perpetually bad neighborhoods, and whites who support them are supporting their future unemployment. Do it at your own peril and the peril of the country.”

The half of the book focusing on Black Lives Matter is not just a redundant denunciation of the Marxist roots of its founders or the violence it has been said to perpetuate. Instead, Love takes a deep journalistic dive into the Black Lives Matter organization. What he discovers would shock and surprise most Americans.

Black Lives Matter, he discovers and argues through voluminous research, is just the arm of a much wider but secretive organization called the Movement for Black Lives. As Love writes, “While their anonymity is intriguing, their beliefs are dangerous. What they describe on their website is nothing short of an operational plan for takeover of the country.”

Love describes the byzantine maze of funding for BLM that is both difficult to decipher and shrouded in deep secrecy. As he vividly illustrates, “The Movement for Black Lives is a force, yet they have remained in the shadows. I hope you will do internet searches to see what comes up. You will find mentions, but you’ll be surprised how few there are and how none are associated with any person. We at least know the faces of the women who started Black Lives Matter, though they are largely figureheads today.”

He provides numerous chapters describing the Movement for Black Lives 2020 Platform, using this segment of the book as an exegesis tackling a variety of issues including incarceration, crime, drug laws, and education.

The second pillar of misunderstanding is The 1619 Project. Love is quite charitable to many of the features of the project. He claims much of it is eloquently written, fascinating, and replete with a lot of information that Americans should know about. But, he warns, “the entire Project focuses only on America’s flaws. This will bring nothing but misery to all involved.”

He then asks the question that reveals the thrust of his concern: “Why should people who hold contempt for the country be allowed to educate our children, particularly about the country they despise?”

Love’s articulation of the stakes involved when a large segment of the nation decides to embrace pseudo-historic “narratives” over well-established historic facts is both eloquent and guttural. The basic questions of American identity that American schools have traditionally served to answer—what are the self-evident truths of Jefferson, what does it mean to be a Madisonian when trying to understand the American regime, what did the Framers mean by the phrases “limited government,” natural law, or due process—are simply missing from the educational orbit of today’s educational system. The 1619 Project would double-down on this exercise in political ignorance, and a hearty embrace of 1619 curricula would have a profound impact on the experiment of self-government.

Here’s why: the real agenda of the 1619 Project is to reformulate what America has always been about, away from the traditional view that America has historically fallen short of its ideals, yet steadily working from generation to generation to inch closer to them, and towards a more radicalized and deeply cynical narrative in which racism is in the nation’s “DNA,” that oppression was not really a contradiction of America’s founding, but was the very raison d’etre for the creation of the nation itself.

As Love writes, “The 1619 Project is reframing American history to make it solely synonymous with slavery. They are succeeding at making this perspective mainstream and bringing this toxic approach to the classroom.” Love uses the word “danger” frequently, and he is right to do so.

If being an American is not grounded in established churches, divine monarchs, or rigid class structures, but instead is the fragile consequence of “a people” believing in shared truths as articulated in our founding documents, then what is the logical consequence of a generation professing no belief in these truths? A generation that has no love or veneration for our founding documents? Who believe the real story of the nation is not one of nobly struggling for liberty, justice for all, and equality under the law, but instead is a sprawling and infinite tale of permanently subjugating large swathes of the country?

When President Obama eulogized John McCain in 2018, he perfectly articulated the fragility of the American creed: “John understood, as JFK understood, as Ronald Reagan understood, that part of what makes our country great is that our membership is based not on our blood line, not on what we look like, what our last names are, not based on where our parents or grandparents came from or how recently they arrived, but on adherence to a common creed that all of us are created equal.”

The 1619 Project suggests there is no “common creed,” only a stealth employment of highfalutin language in our founding and governing documents to hide what many revisionist historians now believe to be true—that America was never truly aiming for real justice.

Instead, sophisticates of the left believe modern enlightenment is synonymous with becoming hyper-aware of the truth of ubiquitous oppression, understanding that the country has not really made great strides towards racial justice and harmony, but has merely pivoted to camouflaged forms of injustice, cloaked in systemic or implicit structures of discrimination.

As Love phrases the matter, “Where critical race theory and the Black Lives Matter Movement hold that racial problems are systemic, The 1619 Project goes further. The problem is not a few misguided, racist laws here and there. It is that slavery and its remnants are alive today.”

My criticisms of Race Crazy are few. There is but a single section on how it is now “Time to Act.” An entire section devoted to the question of “what now?” would have been welcomed.

Also, while most of the book was probably written before the recent surge in parental interest about education, it would have been powerful to see Love’s response to those who argue they simply believe CRT and the 1619 Project are merely trying to tell the complete story of America, blemishes and all, asking schools to expand beyond a sanitized version of American triumphalism.

Love is answering the call Lincoln makes in his much under-appreciated 1838 Lyceum Address, in which he states, “If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.”

Race Crazy is the tonic we need to avoid this national suicide.

West Virginia Treasurer Moore Drops BlackRock Over Woke Capitalism,"Image Credit eflon / Flickr

West Virginia Republican Treasurer Riley Moore announced Monday the state’s Board of Treasury Investments would no longer be working with BlackRock for banking transactions over the investment firm’s animosity towards fossil fuels and friendliness with Communist China.

“As the state’s chief financial officer and chairman of the Board of Treasury Investments, I have a duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are managed in a responsible, financially sound fashion which reflects the best interests of our state and country, and I believe doing business with BlackRock runs contrary to that duty,” Moore said in a press release.

Today I announced my office will no longer use BlackRock, Inc. investment fund for banking transactions. Any company that thinks Communist China is a better investment than WV energy or American capitalism clearly does not have the best intentions for WV. https://t.co/AA5fqGK9zN — Riley Moore (@RileyMooreWV) January 17, 2022

The West Virginia treasurer’s office raised issues with the firm’s commitment to “net zero” emissions investment strategies at the expense of the state’s workers who are reliant on coal, oil, and natural gas. Moore also cut the state’s relationship with BlackRock over the group’s escalating investment in Chinese interests.

“The Chinese government’s blatant interference and controls over businesses and markets creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty and risk for anyone attempting to invest there,” Moore added.

BlackRock did not respond to The Federalist’s request for comment on Moore’s decision.

In December, the educational nonprofit Consumers’ Research penned a letter to 10 governors including West Virginia’s warning consumers and governments about BlackRock’s relationship with China.

“BlackRock’s funneling of billions in U.S. capital to China carries with it risks not present in other markets, risks that threaten the large wagers the company is putting on steep returns from the Middle Kingdom,” wrote Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild. “Chinese firms are not held to the same transparency standards as their western counterparts, so foreign investors are often hard pressed to appreciate the true risk profile of what they’re investing in.”

Whether other states will follow Moore’s lead remains an open question.

“I know several other states are looking at this as well,” Moore told The Federalist. “I think this is the beginning of a big pushback.”

In November, Moore led a coalition of 15 states pledging to park $600 billion in taxpayer assets elsewhere from firms that refuse investment in fossil fuels. Wall Street’s refusal to invest in the capital-intensive industry has served as a primary obstacle to energy production. Republican treasurers in Ohio and Oklahoma, however, each top-10 oil-producing states, remain absent from the coalition.

Backlash against BlackRock for its antagonism towards the industry began to escalate last year after Texas lawmakers overwhelmingly voted in the spring to direct state pension funds to pull investments from the firm.

In a recent letter to Texas politicians revealed by Alex Epstein, author of “The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” the company tried to save face with lawmakers by claiming to be a proud proponent of power production by way of cheap reliable fuels. CEO Larry Fink, however, has simultaneously pledged in his 2022 letter to executives the company’s efforts to reach “net zero” emissions, a prospect incompatible with a flourishing oil and gas industry.

“Instead of acknowledging oil/gas’s immense value and apologizing for BlackRock’s role in today’s energy shortages, Larry Fink’s 2022 letter makes a trivializing reference to their value and does not even mention today’s energy crisis, let alone reflect on BlackRock’s culpability,” Epstein wrote.

"No, Requiring Voter ID Is Not ‘Jim Crow 2.0’ And It’s Offensive To Say That","Whether Mitch McConnell’s boneheaded distinction between African-Americans and “Americans” was a misstatement or something more sinister, the fact remains: America will not benefit from federalizing its elections.

The narrative that continues to be stoked by the radical left is that states all over the country are actively denying blacks the right to vote and only the federal government can stop it. At the center of this controversy is the “oppressive” requirement that all voters be required to produce a valid ID, which will disparately affect black voters because everyone knows blacks are more likely than whites to not have an ID.

Joe Biden’s risible claims about voting rights are true to what Malcolm X described as the “trickery” of the white liberal: “The history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negroes think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems.”

The trickery for today’s white liberal is to manufacture racism by creating the narrative that voter ID is racist and will disproportionately harm blacks. Or that limiting the amount of early voting and other measures that increase ballot vulnerability is inherently racist because blacks won’t vote unless the federal government prods them to the polls because blacks are so dependent on the federal government.

Not only is this narrative unsupported by facts, this lie covers the truth that Democrats don’t want any election laws passed that might catch or stop from voting illegally people Democrats believe will vote Democrat—including voters who don’t want to prove they haven’t voted twice in the same election.

Every black person I know has an ID. Can any supporters of the Freedom To Vote Act or the John Lewis Voting Rights Act produce black people who tried to vote but were turned away because they did not have a valid photo ID? That’s the rap on Georgia and other states’ laws requiring all prospective voters to prove who they claim to be as a protection against claims of voter fraud.

The big deal with these state legislatures tightening security measures is allegedly not that the measures are unnecessary, but that they are discriminatory, racist, and targeted to keep blacks from voting. Democrats must believe that blacks aren’t smart or interested enough to get a photo ID, the central security measure being added to state voting protocols.

For the past year, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi have been “Jim Crowing” that the Georgia law and others like it are racist since black people are more likely than their white counterparts to not have an ID and therefore be denied their vote (for Democrats—because, according to Joe Biden, you ain’t black if you don’t vote Democrat). Really?

What is it about being black that makes one less likely to have identification? Seems like a racist sentiment. Assuming that there is a black adult without identification, we are supposed to presume that black voters without IDs would be so intimidated by a requirement to present an ID that they would rather not vote than stop by the local license branch and get an ID for the cost of a Big Mac and a Coke? Most states like Indiana will waive the minimal fee if necessary.

But if Democrats are right, and requiring identification is indeed racist, why are they only making noise about required ID voting? Shouldn’t they complain about driving, which would be racist because an ID is required to drive? What about opening a bank account, credit application, or ordering a cell phone, cable and ordinary utilities?

All these would have racist implications daily rather than just on Election Day. Yet there’s not a peep about blacks not being able to get a cell phone or cable TV, because that doesn’t get the Democrat his votes.

This all leads to the Democrat solution: kill the Senate filibuster. Of course, we are reminded that the filibuster was the procedural tool used by Democrats and Republicans to oppose civil rights legislation. But the use of the tactic that may have been used against what is now viewed as popular legislation does not make the tactic itself racist in its application.

The filibuster has evolved from its initial incarnation to a procedure that provides the minority party or position the opportunity to be heard. Since both parties have often been in the minority, both parties have benefited and suffered from its deployment.

I know it might be painful for them, but perhaps Democrats should open up their playbook and remember what they did to intimidate and suppress black voters in the first half of the 20th century.

It is unnerving that the Democrat Party draws comparisons to its champions of segregation Bull Connor and George Wallace suggesting that voter ID is a discriminatory tool, the same as the poll tax or the literacy test, that actually prevented blacks from voting in a notoriously humiliating manner. Such comparisons are a disgrace to the honored memory of all who fought and won victories in securing the right to vote.

In the continued invocation of Jim Crow, the euphemism for the abhorrent laws that legally sanctioned segregation, discrimination, and brutality, Biden and his race-baiting big government aim to racialize the filibuster so that all who support its continued use are brandished racist forevermore. I hope blacks in this nation are wearing thin to the leftist patronization that denigrates the proud history of black and white patriots who fought, bled, and died for freedom, independence, and our opportunity to vote.

Will The Money Raised For Black Lives Matter Actually Go To Black Lives?,"Image Credit Patrisse Cullors / YouTube

Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, stepped down from the group in May last year after a series of financial scandals provoked her resignation. Now more than eight months later and upwards of $60 million raised, the global charity remains plagued with money controversies and no apparent leadership or oversight.

According to a Washington Examiner investigation published last week, the address listed on the organization’s tax forms is wrong, and its two remaining board members refused to say who was managing its $60 million bankroll.

Meanwhile, Cullors’ supposed replacements ended up replacing nobody.

“BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors appointed two activists to serve as the group’s senior directors following her resignation in May amid scrutiny over her personal finances,” wrote the Examiner’s Andrew Kerr. “But both quietly announced in September that they never took the jobs due to disagreements with BLM. They told the Washington Examiner they don’t know who now leads the nation’s most influential social justice organization.”

Where the pile of money will be spent remains unknown. The group’s bylaws dictate that the executive director “shall have charge of all funds and securities of the Corporation.”

Shalomyah Bowers, who remains listed as the group’s deputy executive director, did not respond to The Federalist’s inquiries, and neither did the foundation.

[LISTEN: Did BLM Dupe Corporate America Out Of Millions?]

Meanwhile, black business owners are being crushed by draconian vaccine mandates protested by activists.

In Boston, the Massachusetts Restaurant Association wrote to the city’s leftist mayor last week complaining that City Hall’s vaccine requirement for dining is costing its businesses up to $15,000 a week. The soon-to-be six-figure losses are steep sums for an industry already operating on slim profit margins after routine lockdowns nearly took them out of business altogether.

The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation operates a “Survival Fund” to step in where the government falls short.

BLMGNF and BLM Grassroots designed the BLM Survival Fund to support Black people and their families facing economic hardship during the pandemic by giving them cash as a means of support to keep them in their homes, keep food on the table, and ultimately provide a little breathing room in their lives.

But without functioning oversight or leadership and with a 990 tax form outside of public view, according to the Washington Examiner, it’s unclear how much money will actually find its way into the hands of the people BLM claims to support. In July of last year, the group provided the “bulk of funding” for a more than $8 million cash purchase of a Toronto mansion, raising more frustration among followers over its finances.

California regulators warned on Monday that they would hold BLM’s leaders personally liable unless the group filed the required documents to maintain an adequate level of transparency.

Brian Flores’ Lawsuit Against The NFL Will Damage Black Head Coaches,"If former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores gets a head coaching job after his widely publicized lawsuit against the National Football League for “systemic racism,” it will come at the expense of future black head coaches.

In a lawsuit filed February 1 that appeared to be written from the perspective of getting maximum press (even including a Martin Luther King Jr. epigraph on the first page of the filing), Flores accuses the NFL of “following systemic patterns, practices and/or policies that are discriminatory towards the Proposed Class” of black coaching candidates. His lawsuit was released after the New York Giants passed over Flores for Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll.

The lawsuit contains a number of interesting tidbits and allegations, including that New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick had been informed of Daboll’s hiring even before Flores was slated to interview with the Giants and that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross offered Flores $100,000 per game that Flores threw, so the Dolphins could gain better draft positioning for Tua Tagovailoa in the 2020 NFL draft.

What the lawsuit doesn’t contain, however, is actual proof that the NFL is a systemically racist organization and needs to be punished for discriminatory behavior.

Most of Flores’ allegations don’t come close to proving legally actionable systemic discrimination, which must involve finding racist intent or internal statistical “patterns” of inequity. He points out that the NFL currently employs only one black head coach (and three minority head coaches, counting Ron Rivera and Robert Saleh) in Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers. But judging an organization by one year of results is not actionable.

Race-Norming Is Over

Flores also attacks “race-norming” used in the NFL’s concussion settlement with players to demonstrate the league’s racist malintent. Race-norming is a controversial medical practice that seeks to reduce the number of false positive findings in medical research by normalizing scores to the average of one’s biological race. This is controversial since medical data reveals that the average cognitive score as measured by a battery of tests is lower for a black person than the average score for a white person of similar background.

Yet the medical community frequently endorses the use of biological race to diagnose susceptibility to various diseases (i.e., groups originally descended from Africa have a higher propensity for kidney disease). That is not to say that race-norming doesn’t deserve criticism. Kristen Dams-O’Connor has a point when she says that “race is a terrible proxy for the things that actually matter” in medicine, such as obesity, genetic disease, and stress levels.

It is entirely possible, and likely probable, that NFL adopted race-norming on the advice of the lawyers and doctors they employed, not because of racist malintent. Or, more cynically, they insisted on race-norming to lower the number of players who could file for settlement.

But the NFL already agreed to end race-norming in a $1 billion settlement, and there are valid medical reasons they would try to implement race-norming in the first place. Flores is trying to dishonestly stretch a medical issue into a political one, which lowers his credibility to speak on behalf of black NFL players and coaches.

No Coach Pay Inequity

If that wasn’t enough, Flores then goes after the “disparity” in contracts for white head coaches versus black ones by pointing out the particular case of disgraced former Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden, who lost his job after revelations of text messages that some consider racist, sexist, and homophobic. Sure, Gruden had banked the largest contract deal in history in 2018 in the form of a 10-year, $100 million contract with the Raiders, but at that point he had a long record of coaching and winning, as well as being a commentator on ESPN.

The NFL has been no stranger to giving black head coaches massive deals, either, even with fewer qualifications. In fact, Todd Bowles, who had never been a head coach except in relief, bagged a four-year, $4 million-per-year head coaching deal with the New York Jets in 2015.

Despite being demoted after several losing seasons, he also recently bagged the largest defensive coordinator contract ever for any coach with a three-year, $9 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. All this is probably deserved. But Flores’ examples of coach pay inequity do not prove systemic racism of any kind.

‘Rooney Rule’ for Interviewing Candidates

It is Flores’ criticism of the NFL’s diversity practices that will hurt black head coaches’ futures the most. In the lawsuit, Flores goes after the NFL’s longstanding diversity rule entitled the “Rooney Rule,” accusing it of being a “sham” and insisting on a much more radical position of forced hiring of more black coaches and black hiring evaluators.

The “Rooney Rule” is a highly regarded diversity rule that requires NFL teams to interview at least one (with a recent revision, two) non-white candidates before choosing a candidate for head coach. This rule, which was devised in conjunction with the NFL’s diversity group, The Fritz Pollard Alliance, was designed to create more pathways for black head coaches to access the interview process. It was not designed to force NFL owners to hire minority candidates for “equity.”

In fact, Kevin Sheehan of his eponymous popular football podcast noted as much, saying “I do think that one of the intents [of the Rooney Rule]… was to create the process where teams were forced to interview minority candidates because they weren’t interviewing minority candidates on the regular, and that the experience and the exposure that the candidate, that the African-American or minority candidate, would get would be super helpful.”

In ripping the rule, Flores selfishly attacks one of the primary ways black coaching candidates can gain access to valuable experience to build up their knowledge of the NFL interview process.

Creating Unhealthy Dynamic

The really disturbing part of the lawsuit is that, without real evidence the NFL is a systemically racist organization, Flores is creating an unhealthy relationship dynamic between the NFL and the NFL’s many qualified head coaching candidates, such as Leslie Frazier of the Bills, Eric Bieniemy of Kansas City Chiefs, and Bowles of the Buccaneers. With Flores breaking confidentiality norms and going public about his private interview experiences, teams in the future will become more afraid even to bring in minority head coaching candidates for fear that they might retaliate with racial discrimination lawsuits if they don’t get the job, especially with so little real evidence.

After all, Flores just publicly embarrassed Stephen Ross, the owner who employed him for three years, and John Elway, the general manager of the Denver Broncos who considered him for head coach, accusing him of appearing “hungover” for his interview. If there’s one thing you don’t do as a head coach, it is publicly embarrass the owner and general manager of an organization.

Maybe Flores has some valid concern regarding his treatment in the NFL hiring process. But blaming it on his race really shows contempt for the many white coaches who have also been hung out to dry for bad behavior in the NFL.

Take Scot McCloughan, a white former general manager of the Washington Redskins. An anonymous source (possibly former team president Bruce Allen) leaked stories about McCloughan’s alleged drunkenness to tarnish his reputation in an effort to fire him from the organization. That is cold behavior at the top of the NFL, but it wasn’t because of McCloughan’s race. It’s because the NFL unfortunately retains people without integrity.

One can think Flores is a quality candidate who deserves a head coaching job without making his lack of such a job about his race. Unfortunately, Flores chose the low road, the litigious road, on this issue by making unfounded allegations of racism. Even if he personally benefits from making them, the rest of the league’s talented black coaching staff will suffer for his choice.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/07/brian-flores-lawsuit-against-the-nfl-will-only-damage-black-head-coaches/,2022-02-07
"The AP Is Wrong: Abortion Bans Do Not Harm Poor Women, Abortions Do","On February 1, the Associated Press (AP) published a widely disseminated article claiming that minority women “bear the brunt” of pro-life laws restricting abortion. Here’s a fact-check of this article’s many false and misleading claims.

The thesis of the AP’s argument is: “if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to further restrict or even ban abortions, minority women will bear the brunt of it.” The article notes that the black abortion rate is extremely disproportionate compared to the white abortion rate in the South, but absurdly correlates the high black abortion rate with pro-life laws.

The truth? Minority women have the highest abortion rate nationwide, and the abortion industry’s targeting of low-income and minority communities is plain to see. To borrow a line from the AP, “The numbers are unambiguous” — but the AP was looking at the wrong numbers. According to the most recent analyses available, nearly 80 percent of Planned Parenthood’s abortion businesses are located in minority neighborhoods and nearly 90 percent of its “mega facilities” are within walking distance of non-white neighborhoods.

In another failed attempt to paint abortion access as the solution to a problem, the AP reporters highlight the high infant mortality rate in Mississippi. There, black infants are nearly four times as likely as white infants to be killed in abortion violence. Also, according to the AP, “Black infants were about twice as likely as white infants to die during the first year of life.”

With no explanation as to how abortion access improves this dire situation, one is left to deduce that the AP authors think infant mortality is best cured by prophylactically killing the child in utero before he or she has a chance to die outside the womb.

The truth? An analysis of more than 100 peer-reviewed studies shows that each abortion a woman undergoes increases the risk of preterm birth for her subsequent children (and preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality). The AP also forgot to mention that Mississippi, with its astronomical black abortion rate, also has the highest rate of preterm birth in the nation.

According to that finding, “In Mississippi, the preterm birth rate among Black women is 44% higher than the rate among all other women.” If the AP had taken off the abortion blinders, it could have seen that, by referencing the black infant mortality rate, it was highlighting one of the many reasons abortion needs to be abolished — not expanded.

At every turn, the AP fails to explain how increased abortion access can meaningfully improve any of the struggles non-white women face. In fact, reliance on “abortion access” may be exacerbating the very situations in question.

The reality is that 76 percent of abortion-seeking women admit they would not be seeking an abortion if their circumstances were different. That statistic comes from Human Coalition, where 77 percent of abortion-seeking clients are minority women. Even the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute reports that “qualitative data from in-depth interviews portrayed women who had had an abortion as typically feeling that they had no other choice, given their limited resources and existing responsibilities to others.”

The AP fear-mongers about the impending fate of abortion-on-demand via the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court ruling, saying: “If abortions are outlawed, those same [minority] women — often poor — will likely have the hardest time traveling to distant parts of the country to terminate pregnancies or raising children they might struggle to afford.”

Considering the fact that most women don’t want abortion access but want their circumstances to be different, why do the AP’s (both white) reporters and all those who claim to support abortion on behalf of women ignore the facts and instead choose to cry “abortion access!” more loudly?

Corporate abortion doesn’t just refuse to invest time, money, and strategy into improving the circumstances of the low-income minority women it claims to care about. It rallies against efforts to support these women with tangible resources and financial investments.

Minority women ask for support, and abortion peddlers — bolstered by their mainstream media allies — respond, No, you need abortion. One is hard-pressed to find a better example of modern racism than that. The “soft bigotry of low expectations” doesn’t feel very soft to the black child as he’s violently evacuated from his impoverished mother’s womb.

The abortion industry and its allies may view minority families as undeserving of support, but the pro-life movement is already standing alongside these communities and ramping up its support in preparation for Roe v. Wade to return to the ash heap of history, where it belongs.

Through Students For Life of America’s Campaign for Abortion-Free Cities, advocates deploy each month to knock on doors and have conversations in the very neighborhoods Planned Parenthood has infested for generations. These activists provide information about free, local, nonviolent resources — often within walking distance to the communities that need abortion alternatives the most.

Online, SFLA’s Standing With You initiative is doing the same thing — connecting those most targeted by the abortion industry with the resources that change their circumstances so they can reject abortion and embrace life, both for themselves and for their children.

The Supreme Court Did Not Make ‘Attack On Voting Rights’,"On Feb. 7, in a 5-4 decision the Supreme Court entered a stay of a lower court’s order directing Alabama to redraw its congressional districts ahead of the upcoming primary elections. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the federal courts should not override a state’s election law close to an election. Yet in a dissent joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan presented the high court’s stay as an attack on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, black Alabamians’ electoral power, and “all of American democracy.”

Democrats and the left-leaning media have likewise framed Monday’s joint decision in Merrill v. Milligan and Merrill v. Caster as “further undercut[ting] the Voting Rights Act.” Contrary to such claims, however, the Supreme Court’s decision yesterday did not address the merits of the Voting Rights Act claim, but merely considered the propriety of the lower court issuing an injunction so close to the election. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurrence signed on to by Justice Samuel Alito, stressed that point, while also countering many of the claims Justice Kagan made in her dissent.

To understand these competing arguments, as well as to realize how disingenuous are Kagan and Democrats’ claims that the decision is an attack on the voting rights of black Alabamians, requires both a backdrop to these lawsuits and an historical refresher concerning the state’s congressional districting.

How We Got Here

Following the 2020 census, the Republican-controlled Alabama legislature redrew the state’s congressional map. While Alabama neither gained nor lost congressional seats, the legislature drafted new borders for the seven congressional districts to account for population shifts and to equalize population between the districts. The state did this by beginning with the prior map and then altering the boundaries of the prior districts, succeeding in several cases in eliminating county splits between districts.

After passage of Alabama’s 2021 congressional redistricting plan, three groups of plaintiffs filed separate suited against John H. Merrill, the Alabama secretary of state. Together the three lawsuits alleged the 2021 redistricting plan violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act (VRA), although the Equal Protection claim fell to the wayside during the lower court proceedings. Instead, the parties and the court focused on the VRA, with the plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction under Section 2.

Section 2 of the VRA provides that “[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State . . . in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . .” In the context of redistricting plans, case law holds that a state violates Section Two “if its districting plan provides ‘less opportunity’ for racial minorities [than for other members of the electorate] ‘to elect representatives of their choice.’”

For instance, “a plaintiff may allege a § 2 violation in a single-member district if the manipulation of districting lines fragments [cracks] politically cohesive minority voters among several districts or packs them into one district or a small number of districts, and thereby dilutes the voting strength of members of the minority population.”

In a comprehensive 200-plus page opinion, a three-judge panel of the Northern District of Alabama concluded the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their Section 2 VRA claim. The court then entered a preliminary injunction directing the state legislature to, within 14 days, or by February 11, 2022, “enact a remedial plan” that would “include two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.” In absence of the Alabama legislature doing so, the court indicated it would hire, at the state’s expense, “an eminently qualified expert to draw on an expedited basis a map that complies with federal law for use in Alabama’s 2022 congressional elections.”

Alabama requested a stay of the order, When the district court denied the motion, the state filed a motion for an emergency stay before the Supreme Court. As noted above, the Supreme Court granted that motion in a 5-4 decision, with Justice John Roberts dissenting separately from the dissent authored by Justice Kagan that justices Breyer and Sotomayor joined.

The Justices Explain Why

Under normal circumstances the granting (or denying) of a stay would merit no opinion—merely a simple order of the fait accompli. But here, likely prompted by Justice Kagan’s dissent, Justice Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Alito, explained why they voted to stay the lower court decision. That discussion exposes Democrats’ claim that the court is attacking the VRA as unfounded.

“As background,” Justice Kavanaugh wrote, the lower court “ordered that Alabama’s congressional districts be completely redrawn within a few short weeks,” before absentee ballots must be mailed for the upcoming primary elections. But first, as the court summarized, candidates must meet filing deadlines, without knowing for sure in which district to file, or maybe even in which district they live.

State and local election officials also need to prepare for the elections and, Kavanaugh noted, the lower court’s “order would require heroic efforts by those state and local authorities.” Even then, it “likely would not be enough to avoid chaos and confusion.”

That is why, as Justice Kavanaugh explained, the Supreme “Court has repeatedly stated that federal courts ordinarily should not enjoin a state’s election laws close to an election.” “That principle,” Kavanaugh stressed, “reflects a bedrock tenet of election law: When an election is close at hand, the rules of the road must be clear and settled. Late judicial tinkering with election laws can lead to disruption and to unanticipated and unfair consequences for candidates, political parties, and voters, among others.”

It was for those reasons—reasons of time—the stay issued. As Kavanaugh reiterated, “the stay order is not a ruling on the merits, but instead simply stays the District Court’s injunction pending a ruling on the merits.” “The stay order does not make or signal any change to voting rights law,” Kavanaugh stressed.

Not a Harm to ‘All of American Democracy’

Kagan argues otherwise in her dissent, but, really, her analysis came down to the fact that the lower court crafted a detailed and thorough analysis of the issues. But that doesn’t make it correct. It also does not overcome the Supreme Court’s consistent position that a stay is appropriate this close to an election. Kagan’s claim that the stay harms black Alabamians and, more broadly, “all of American democracy,” besides being overwrought hyperbole, is unsupported by the history of Alabama’s congressional districts.

For almost 50 years, Alabama’s congressional districts have remained very similar. In 1970, when Alabama dropped from eight to seven congressional districts, the state carved up districts based broadly on geography, but in the 1990s a new map was established by a court after it ordered the state congressional plan to contain a majority-black district.

Known as the 1992 plan, it remained in effect, with only minor changes coming into play in the 2000 and 2010 redistricting cycles. Significantly, the U.S. Department of Justice precleared both the 2001 and 2011 maps as consistent with the VRA—and both of those maps included only one majority-black district. As seen below, the 2021 redistricting map closely mirrors those previously approved districts, maintaining the one majority-black district, but with less zigging and zagging into the counties.

Yet now justices Kagan, Breyer, and Sotomayor pretend that keeping the status quo of one majority-black district until the Section 2 VRA claim can be resolved on the merits is an attack on black Alabamanian’s voting rights and our country’s democracy.

It is not. It is a stay. Nothing more and nothing less.

"Georgetown Law Protects Racist Comments, Punishes Anti-Racist Ones","Constitutional law scholar Ilya Shapiro is on administrative leave from Georgetown Law School amid being investigated for criticizing President Biden’s choice to select a Supreme Court nominee on the bases of sex and race. His suspension is outrageously hypocritical in light of many law professors’ ugly, racist attacks heaped upon conservative judges, especially Justice Clarence Thomas, that received little or no criticism in the legal academic community.

Shapiro is being investigated for tweeting: “Objectively best pick for Biden is Sri Srinivasan, who is solid prog & v smart. . . . But alas doesn’t fit into the latest intersectionality hierarchy so we’ll get lesser black woman.” Yes, Shapiro used the inartful phrase “lesser black woman” because President Biden announced he would only consider black women candidates to be his nominee. In the context of his tweet, however, Ilya was clearly not saying that a black woman nominee could not be an excellent choice.

In contrast to Shapiro’s opposition to racism, many law professors have engaged in openly racist attacks on justices, with little to no professional repercussions. Such criticism of Thomas is an especially clear example of this double standard in the profession and at Georgetown.

Many law professors, including at Georgetown Law, have been unapologetically vicious in their racism towards Thomas. According to a review by Georgetown Law Professor Charles Abernathy of the book, “We Won’t Go Back: Making The Case For Affirmative Action” (1997) by then Georgetown Law professors Charles R. Lawrence III & Mari J. Matsuda:

[Justice Thomas] is said to be “a ‘handkerchief head’ and ‘a chicken-and-biscuit-eating Uncle Tom.’ While these slurs against Justice Clarence Thomas are quoted as the words of others, Lawrence reports them — repeatedly — with the same mixture of glee and anger common in epithet calling. Finally, in the author’s own words, Justice Thomas is lashed for the ‘extremity of his betrayal’ of blacks. [footnotes omitted]

That is what racism actually looks like, in full bloom. Proper outrage over such sentiments ought to far exceed the faux uproar over Ilya’s opposition to racial and sexual preferences in hiring. Yet I am unaware of Lawrence being publicly chastised or put on administrative leave by the dean of Georgetown Law School, or of anyone at Georgetown, other than Abernathy, saying a word of public criticism about his statements.

The phenomenal Bari Weiss uncovered a real gem of hateful speech from Georgetown Law Professor Carol Christine Fair, who tweeted during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation: “Look at this chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”

In stark contrast to its treatment of Shapiro regarding his poorly worded tweet, for which he has already apologized, Georgetown Law School came to Fair’s defense, saying: “Our policy does not prohibit speech based on the person presenting ideas or the content of those ideas even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable.” To her credit, Fair would have Georgetown give Shapiro the same broad latitude to speak his mind that she received for her far more incendiary comments.

Beyond the selectively sensitive faculty at Georgetown, many others in the legal academy have gleefully, and without apparent consequence, expressed racist contempt for Thomas. Since working on Justice Thomas’s confirmation as a lawyer in the White House counsel’s office, I have been appalled by the frequency and vehemence of the ad hominem, racist attacks on him.

A few others, such as Professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin, have laudably objected to such attacks on Justice Thomas, as reflected in this article on a speech she gave in 2005 at the University of Virginia:

Brown-Nagin said she disagrees with Thomas on many issues. . . . Nevertheless, she chose to take a contrarian position because much of the rhetoric about Thomas’s jurisprudence is exaggerated and intellectually dishonest. Thomas has been called ‘someone who looks black, but thinks white,’ she said, and an ‘Uncle Tom’ who ‘obeys’ Justice Antonin Scalia. A recent article by a legal academic called Thomas even worse — he was a ‘Sambo’ for cultivating good relations with whites for his own advantage and to the disadvantage of other blacks. ‘I think the rhetoric is inhumane…It’s dehumanizing to Thomas as well as to all of us,’ Brown-Nagin said. ‘In my view, it’s well beyond what anyone needs to do to make their point.’

Yet, apart from a few criticisms from within the legal academy, I do not recall a single law professor being rebuked by his faculty or dean, suspended, or fired for such intemperate and baseless comments. I do not think they should be, any more than Shapiro should be punished. The remedy for speech you dislike, or even despise, is more speech, not economic intimidation or cancellation.

Perhaps the reason Ilya’s statement is being treated differently than the attacks on Justice Thomas is because legal academics frequently agree that race should be a factor in both public and private decision making and even in assigning the views people are expected to hold. But much of the public, across all races, thinks otherwise. That is precisely why it is important to have a robust debate over President Biden’s (or any other president’s) reliance on race and sex as a selection criteria.

For example, polling on affirmative action in college admissions indicates that a significant majority of black Americans agree with Thomas’s and Ilya’s opposition to racial preferences and to racializing all aspects of American life. According to a Pew Research poll in 2019, 62 percent of blacks opposed having race be a factor at all in college admission criteria.

On other issues, such as voter ID laws and defund the police, the liberal and academic elite clearly do not represent the views of the majority of black Americans. A 2021 poll shows that 69 percent of blacks support voter ID requirements to vote. A 2021 poll showed only 28 percent of black Americans supported the defund the police movement.

But holding the “wrong” views on these issues will get you branded a racist on college and law school campuses. That the legal academy is so out of step with the sentiment of ordinary Americans even across racial boundaries makes it all the clearer that scholars like Ilya should have a place at Georgetown to challenge the received wisdom in academia on these questions without being accused of, let alone disciplined or fired for, “racial insensitivity.”

Shapiro’s tweet did not disparage anyone, including any potential Supreme Court nominee, on account of his or her race or sex. It would be the height of employing a double standard if Georgetown Law School Dean William Treanor took any additional adverse action against Shapiro for this tweet when many law professors continue to smear Justice Thomas as unqualified or a traitor to his race and are celebrated in the academic community.

Shapiro is a good man, an excellent scholar, and has a much-needed alternative point of view to contribute to the Georgetown Law community. Let’s see if Treanor has the integrity to live up to his professed “respect for diversity” and keep Shapiro.

This American Pastor’s Lyrics Paved The Way For ‘We Shall Overcome’,"We are often tossed and driven on the restless sea of time

Somber skies and howling tempests oft succeed a bright sunshine

In the land of perfect day when the mists have rolled away

We will understand it better by and by

By and by, when the morning comes

When the saints of God are gathered home

We will tell the story of how we’ve overcome

For we’ll understand it better by and by

Charles Albert Tindley’s life — and his hymns, like that above — tell the story of how he overcame restless seas, howling tempests, and trials “dark on every hand” to embody a deep abiding faith in God and his Word, knowing that the tumultuous storm will pass, Hallelujah.

Courage my soul, and let us journey on

Though the night is dark, it won’t be very long

Thanks be to God, the morning light appears

And the storm is passing over, Hallelujah

Born into extreme poverty, forced to work at a young age, and denied an education, Tindley overcame when the stars disappeared. He became a pastor serving the largest African American United Methodist Church on the East Coast, with more than 10,000 members of many nations and races. He left a lasting legacy in song, as the grandfather of gospel music.

His song “I’ve Overcome” is considered by scholars to be the basis of the popular civil rights anthem “We Shall Overcome.”

Tindley’s childhood began on the eastern shore of Maryland. He was born in the town of Berlin on July 7, 1851, the child of an enslaved father, Albert Tindley, and a free black mother, Hester Miller Tindley. Because of slave codes, Charles was born free because his mother was free.

But his mother died when he was just four years old, and his father was impoverished, putting his son to work at a young age to survive. His mother and aunt had taught him to love the Lord, but his master never allowed him to go to church and threatened him with a whip.

“It therefore became my lot to be ‘hired out,’ wherever father could place me. The people with whom I lived were not all good. Some of them were very cruel to me. I was not permitted to have a book or go to church,” Tindley wrote in his “Book of Sermons” in 1932.

We are often destitute of the things that life demands

Want of food and want of shelter, thirsty hills and barren lands

We are trusting in the Lord and according to his Word

We’ll understand it better by and by.

Despite never attending school, Tindley taught himself to read and write, as his son Elbert T. Tindley wrote in his 1942 book about his father’s life, “The Prince of Colored Preachers.”

I used to find bits of newspaper on the roadside and put them in my bosom (for I had no pockets), in order to study the ABC’s from them. During the day I would gather pine knots, and when the people were asleep at night I would light these pine knots, and, lying flat on my stomach to prevent being seen by any one who might still be about, would, with fire-coals, mark all the words I could make out on these bits of newspaper. I continued in this way, and without any teacher, until I could read the Bible without stopping to spell the words.

Married at 17, Tindley and his young wife Daisy moved to Philadelphia in 1868. They had eight children, but buried two daughters.

In the midst of tribulation, stand by me

When the hosts of hell assail and my strength begins to fail

Thou who never lost a battle, stand by me

To support his family, Tindley worked as a hod carrier supplying materials to brick masons on construction sites. He was also a janitor at Bainbridge Methodist Episcopal Church, studying at night with correspondence courses from the Boston School of Theology and with a local rabbi tutoring him in Hebrew.

In 1885, Tindley signed up to take the examination for admission into the ministry. At the time of the exam, another candidate, a black college graduate, contemptuously asked Tindley, “How do you expect to pass this examination? I and other candidates hold diplomas in our hands. What do you hold?”

“Nothing but a broom,” said Tindley, who had just finished sweeping.

Tindley passed the examination with the second-highest score in the class. He was then assigned as an itinerant preacher, serving parishes in coastal towns in Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland. Methodist ministers who were newly ordained often got moved every few years. He was 6’2” and became known as “the tall, lanky, silver-tongued pulpit orator,” his son Elbert wrote.

In 1905, Rev. Tindley was called back to Bainbridge United Methodist Church in Philadelphia — the very church where he had started as a janitor. The congregation’s reaction to their new pastor was recorded in their 150th-anniversary journal:

All were pleasantly surprised, for as Tindley mounted the rostrum, wearing a Prince Albert Coat — then the garb of many African American Protestant preachers — he had a dignified bearing acquired during his previous appointments. They were further surprised when Tindley delivered a masterful, soul gripping sermon that brought loud Amens and ‘praise God’ exclamations from his listeners.

The congregation of 120 soon grew under Tindley’s leadership, eventually moving to larger sanctuaries to meet the needs of a growing congregation. A new building was erected at Broad and Fitzwater Streets in 1924 and, in spite of his protests, the church was named the Tindley Temple Methodist Church. There he preached three services each Sunday to the 3,200-capacity sanctuary, a congregation of blacks, whites, and immigrants from many nations.

Tindley Temple United Methodist Church broke two racial barriers: It was one of the very few multiracial churches in the nation and it was the first black church to own property on a main street — Broad — in Philadelphia. Its multi-million-dollar building, built from 1925 to 1928, is recognized on the National Register of Historic Places for its beaux arts, Romanesque, and art deco architectural styles.

His ministry extended beyond the church doors, as he was a leader in the south Philadelphia black community who suffered deeply in the Depression, as well as from discrimination and violence. Under Tindley’s leadership, the church used its business relationships and resources to train and place African Americans in new positions, also feeding more than 500 hungry men and women daily in the church basement.

Tindley advised church members to start businesses such as restaurants and barber shops and to save their money to purchase homes. The church formed the East Calvary Building and Loan Association to offer mortgages and evening job training classes to church members and new migrants from the South.

Having grown up among the enslaved, Tindley also clearly recognized the evils of slavery, segregation, and discrimination. In 1915, Tindley and other leaders, including local black pastor Rev. Wesley Graham, led protesters in a march to the Forrest Theater to protest against the showing of D.W. Griffith’s film “The Birth of a Nation,” the epic silent film that glorified the Confederacy, vilified African Americans, and inspired the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan.

They were attacked by whites with clubs, sticks, and bottles. Graham was hospitalized; Tindley’s injuries were treated at home.

In the midst of tribulation, stand by me

When the hosts of hell assail and my strength begins to fail

Thou who never lost a battle, stand by me

Rev. Tindley’s lasting legacy are his hymns, which tell the story of overcoming hardships and trials through enduring faith in Jesus Christ, using biblical themes and life experiences that remind singers of Christ’s power over worldly woes.

In 1901, C. Austin Miles, who composed “In the Garden,” published eight of Tindley’s songs in his “New Songs of the Gospel.” Over the next 25 years, Tindley published 34 additional songs; he was the first hymn writer to have a hymn copyrighted.

In the modern era, Tindley’s hymns — and his influence on black gospel music — were highlighted in the hymnal “Songs of Zion,” called “the most groundbreaking collection of African-American song in the last half of the 20th century.” Published by Abingdon Press in 1980, “Songs of Zion,” which included 16 hymns by Tindley, sold more than 1.2 million copies and included essays by renowned music scholar J. Jefferson Cleveland, who recognized Tindley’s gift.

“Music has always been an integral part of the Black church worship experience and in the beginning of the 20th century was the emergence of Blacks as prolific hymn writers, called gospel hymns,” wrote Cleveland in the essay, “A Historical Account of the Hymn in the Black Worship Experience.”

Without a doubt, the renowned Dr. Charles Albert Tindley was the most prolific of the black hymn writers, whose music written primarily from 1900-1906 became popular after World War I. It was Tindley’s music that inspired the famous gospel songwriter Dr. Thomas A. Dorsey to forsake vaudeville and blues and write religious music exclusively.

Tindley’s gospel hymns, which leaned heavily on black spirituals, were “an entirely new genre,” Cleveland wrote. “Tindley incorporated folk images, proverbs and biblical stories in songs that had a universal appeal.”

A host of musicians owe a debt to Charles Tindley — hymns still sung in gospel music venues and appearing in Protestant hymnals. “Stand By Me” is one of the most popular of his gospel hymns, which he wrote in 1905. It was popularized by Elvis Presley, while also sung as the blues by Josephine James and as folk by Bob Dylan.

Tindley’s sons once asked their father to what he attributed his success. Tindley answered quickly. “On my knees.” Tindley was known to rise at 4a.m. each morning to spend time in his study singing and praying.

Of all the hymns he wrote, Tindley’s favorite was “I Have Found at Last a Saviour,” which captures the heart of his faith, while giving a nod to the age-old hymn “Rock of Ages,” written in 1776.

Christ is now my sum of pleasure,

Counting all things else but dross,

I have found my richest treasure,

Around the sacred Cross:

My soul is satisfied,

Forever to abide

In Thy cleft, O Rock of Ages,

Where no harm can e’er betide.

Tindley died in 1933 at the age of 82, and his obituary was written up in several major newspapers, which noted his influence across racial lines: “Dr. Tindley was the pastor of the largest Negro congregation in the United States, one which frequently overflowed services at the church. It numbered more than 10,000 members. He was the author of many hymns, and many of his lectures were delivered to audiences not of his race.”

As a saint gathered home, Tindley’s stories continue to tell us how to overcome.

Trials dark on every hand and we cannot understand.

All the ways that God would lead us to that blessed Promised Land

But he guides us with His eye and we’ll follow ’til we die

And we’ll understand it better by and by.

By and by when the morning comes.

When the saints of God are gathered home

We will tell the story of how we’ve overcome

For we’ll understand it better by and by

Dems' BLM Takeover Means A New Multimillion-Dollar Race Hustling Hub,"The Black Lives Matter plot thickened this week with some particularly partisan developments after a longtime Clinton family ally and a top Russia hoaxer essentially took over the organization.

According to recent filings as reported by The Washington Examiner, Marc Elias, a Democrat lawyer known for funding the bogus Steele dossier while he was general counsel for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, looks to be representing BLM’s Global Network Foundation through his law firm. Additionally, Minyon Moore, a top Clinton ally, is now on BLM’s board of directors.

In other words, the corrupt Democrat establishment has effectively taken over a major left-wing organization committed to radical left-wing policies and race-hustling.

This might not seem like a big deal. It’s not like BLM was a neutral or centrist entity that’s suddenly going to be run by Democrats. On the contrary, the organization, which is under intense scrutiny right now for leadership corruption, shady finances, and disclosure delays, has long been upfront about its extreme aims. Its founder admitted the group’s embrace of Marxism, and its webpage used to broadcast its disdain for the traditional nuclear family.

The problem arises in the stickiness of the “Black Lives Matter” name and what it means that figures within the Democrat establishment now explicitly own that brand.

The genius and frustration of the Black Lives Matter organization has always been that by virtue of its very name, it cannot be easily battled, for it’s irrefutable that black lives do indeed matter. In dubbing itself “Black Lives Matter,” the organization grants legitimacy to its actions and those of its broader movement — including even the violent riots carried out by its followers. What’s more, it automatically retains a rhetorical edge on its opponents: Only racists would argue with “Black Lives Matter,” they shout over their critics.

It’s for this reason that support for the organization goes unquestioned where other political sloganeering isn’t tolerated. Schoolchildren can wear masks that say “Black Lives Matter” but are forced to remove them if they say “Jesus Loves Me” instead. As part of my former apartment lease term, no flags could be flown from the balcony, but BLM flags waved proudly from adjacent units without a peep from the management office. Arson, murder, and property destruction by BLM rioters are described with sanitary “fiery but mostly peaceful protests” chyrons on network television.

Amid the 2020 summer of rage, even an independent agency of the federal government tried to suggest that supporting “Black Lives Matter” isn’t political or partisan.

Except now that’s even more demonstrably false. The slogan that trumps every argument — and the organization it represents — once implicitly belonged to the left, but now they’re explicitly owned and controlled by Democrats. Where once you couldn’t disagree with “Black Lives Matter,” now you can’t disagree with the Democrat establishment itself. It’s the ultimate power of narrative-setting.

What’s worse than Democrats with lots of power? Democrats with lots of power and lots of cash. When BLM founder Patrisse Cullors stepped down from her post and the two activists she appointed to replace her turned down the offer, she left behind BLM accounts full of roughly $60 million, and it was unclear exactly what would become of these massive finances and who exactly would be in charge of handling them.

“Given the money involved here, this is really unbelievable,” CharityWatch Executive Director Laurie Styron told the Examiner. “To not know who is in charge of $60+ million collected by the national charity arm of arguably the most prominent social justice movement in the country is the worst transparency issue I have seen in my 18 years as a charity watchdog.”

BLM’s newly reported charitable organization filing, however, states that its “books are in the care of … the organization” that is “located at … c/o Elias Law Group.” Bingo.

The sanitized cover that once applied to the activities of the “racial justice” organization will now surely apply in the same manner to the race-hustling Democrats shielded by “Black Lives Matter’s” sticky name — and it’s loads and loads of green.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/17/democrat-takeover-of-blm-means-a-new-multimillion-dollar-hub-for-race-hustling/,2022-02-17
"Lawmakers Are Waking Up To BlackRock's Dual Loyalty, And Taking Action","West Virginia Republican Treasurer Riley Moore axed his state’s relationship with BlackRock last month over the $10 trillion investment firm’s dual loyalty to Chinese interests and woke capitalism.

“As the state’s chief financial officer and chairman of the Board of Treasury Investments, I have a duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are managed in a responsible, financially sound fashion which reflects the best interests of our state and country, and I believe doing business with BlackRock runs contrary to that duty,” Moore said in a press release at the time.

Now the colossal Wall Street firm is void of oversight for the state’s investment fund, a liquid account worth approximately $1.5 billion. While it might not be much money to BlackRock, Moore tells The Federalist, it’s “a hell of a lot for the people of West Virginia,” and far too much to park with an investment firm infected by corporate wokeism working to defraud the state’s more than 1.7 million residents.

Despite holding $85 billion in coal assets as of January last year, BlackRock has emphasized its commitment to reaching net-zero carbon emissions, a near-term pledge incompatible with a flourishing energy industry reliant on instantaneous power provided by fossil fuels. The commitment while fostering Chinese investment has prompted well-founded skepticism about whether BlackRock has the best interests of its clients at stake.

Last week, the educational nonprofit Consumers’ Research unveiled a multi-million-dollar campaign to expose BlackRock’s close ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The watchdog published a new website on BlackRock’s CEO, WhoIsLarryFink.com, and debuted new ads for TV and radio complemented by mobile billboards in New York City, where the firm is headquartered.

“Larry Fink and BlackRock are really delivering a one-two punch to the American economy,” Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild told The Federalist. “On the right hand they’re using the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) scam to hamper American companies and make it harder to serve American consumers, on the left hand they’re funneling billions of dollars to the Chinese communist owned business to help them build the Chinese economy.”

The campaign comes on the heels of a letter Hild sent in December to 10 governors, including West Virginia, warning both consumers and governments about BlackRock’s relationship with China, where the leading investment firm has made cultivating Chinese assets a priority. Fink admitted that much in his 2020 letter to shareholders at the onset of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.

“I continue to firmly believe China will be one of the biggest opportunities for BlackRock over the long term, both for asset managers and investors, despite the uncertainty and decoupling of global systems we’re seeing today,” Fink wrote in a passage now deleted from the letter currently on the company’s website. By August of the same year, BlackRock was awarded the first entirely foreign-owned mutual fund operating in China.

“BlackRock’s funneling of billions in U.S. capital to China carries with it risks not present in other markets, risks that threaten the large wagers the company is putting on steep returns from the Middle Kingdom,” Hild warned governors late last year. “Chinese firms are not held to the same transparency standards as their western counterparts, so foreign investors are often hard pressed to appreciate the true risk profile of what they’re investing in.”

More than $75 billion in pension funds among the states reporting such data, meanwhile, remain in BlackRock’s hands, according to Consumers’ Research.

Some conservative policymakers have begun to heed Hild’s warning, motivated also by Wall Street’s growing ideological hostility to fossil fuels. Beyond Moore’s efforts in West Virginia, lawmakers in Texas and Florida have also made moves to counteract BlackRock’s undue influence.

In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis recently moved to strip proxy vote power over state finances from companies that foster investment in China while managing taxpayer dollars. That would include BlackRock, which oversees billions from Florida’s pensions and investment funds. According to Bloomberg, BlackRock held $227 million in a fund focused on Chinese markets in late June.

“The state pension plan has also invested in separate private equity and investment funds with exposure to China in particular,” Bloomberg reported.

Further west in Texas, the company hired a team of lobbyists in Austin to protect its more than $20 billion handled as legislators prepare to follow Moore’s lead in withdrawing state business from the New York firm. After years of railing against fossil fuels in the name of politically correct investment practices, corporate executives are now engaged in double-speak to protect its access to public funds.

In January, Alex Epstein, the founder of Industrial Progress and author of “The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” reported company leaders sent a memo reassuring lawmakers who govern the top oil producer in the country of BlackRock’s commitment to back the industry.

“We will continue to invest in and support fossil fuel companies, including Texas fossil fuel companies,” read the memo sent at the start of the year. Weeks later, Fink wrote again of the CEO’s desire for BlackRock to play a prominent role in achieving net-zero emissions.

BlackRock's Larry Fink is the #1 leader in the financial world for the economically baseless idea that the global economy should and will be net-zero by 2050. This idea would mean the rapid and total or near-total destruction of the oil and gas industry.https://t.co/BB6ld9fjzA pic.twitter.com/2SYMx93Tl3 — Alex Epstein (@AlexEpstein) January 18, 2022

It’s not just BlackRock beginning to feel the heat from proactive lawmakers moving to protect their constituents’ tax dollars from being used against them. All banks that spurn fossil fuels run the risk of alienating their relationships with state governments. In November, Moore led a coalition of 15 states pledging to park $600 billion in taxpayer assets in other institutions than those that bar investment in the industry.

“Just as each state represented in this letter is unique in its governing laws and economy, our actions will take different forms,” they wrote. “However, the overarching objective of our actions will be the same – to protect our states’ economies, jobs, and energy independence from these unwarranted attacks on our critical industries.”

While Moore’s $1.5 billion pulled from BlackRock last month might not be a sizeable figure for a $10 trillion-dollar firm, $600 billion remains nothing to blink at.

Race-Mad Leftists Don't Want To Talk About Abortions Of Black Babies,"In a hearing last week about racism in public school curriculum, Arizona state Rep. Walt Blackman said any “honest conversation” about America’s past of slavery and discrimination must also acknowledge the genocide of our present age: abortion.

“There are more black babies aborted than born every day,” he said.

State Representative @theWaltBlackman drops the mic on House Democrats today during the vote to approve Rep. Kaiser's #HCR2001, a measure to stop critical race theory and racial discrimination in schools. #azleg pic.twitter.com/vNihdA7o1K — AZ House Republicans (@AZHouseGOP) February 17, 2022

White leftist activists constantly talk about racism, but they conveniently ignore that their sacred cow of abortion is racist to its core.

Abortion should never have become a political football. It used to be something every American, Democrat and Republican, agreed was wrong.

Democrat politician and activist Jesse Jackson is a good example. In 1975, he compared the Roe v. Wade decision to slavery: “There are those who argue that the right to privacy is of a higher order than the right to life … That was the premise of slavery.” But after Jackson ran for the Democrat presidential nomination in 1988, he conformed to the pro-choice party line.

Since then, a tragic dissonance has ensued in the black community over party affiliation and abortion. While most black Americans (54 percent) think abortion is morally unacceptable, they are still more closely associated with the Democratic Party and its abortion-friendly platform. Many black voters find themselves out of step with Democrat candidates seeking their votes, especially on social issues, similar to blue-collar voters who feel Democrat policies have left them behind.

Democrats can easily reconcile with their voter base on this issue. Restoring respect for all life would win the hearts of many in the black community.

A recently released report from an organization we work with, the Center for Urban Renewal and Education (CURE), shows the devastating effects of abortion on generations of black Americans. The report details the abortion industry’s predatory practices — how abortion providers seek out minority women, advertise directly to them, and sometimes perform illegal procedures, like the infamous late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell. This multi-billion dollar industry isn’t trying to protect anyone’s rights; it’s trying to profit off desperate women, especially black women.

In 2012, the Life Issues Institute reported that “79% of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities are strategically located within walking distance of African-American and/or Hispanic communities.” In 2017, they updated these numbers to include 25 new abortion mega centers, 100 percent of which were within walking distance of minority neighborhoods. With each abortion bringing in hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on whether they are early- or late-term abortions, it’s clear that abortion providers are engaging in a grisly sort of supply-side economics.

Worse still, abortion has always been a tool of racial eugenics, the ideology that seeks to limit “undesirable” black births. Star Parker, the founder of CURE and author of the report, argues that “From its inception, the abortion industry has sought to control and hinder the growth of the Black population, a core objective of the movement’s founders.”

This is a historical fact. Margaret Sanger, the founder of abortion giant Planned Parenthood, was a racial eugenicist who was concerned that “the mass of Negroes … still breed carelessly and disastrously,” and hired black pastors lest “word go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.” Many other early abortion activists, such as Hugh Moore and Edward Ross, sought to expand abortion to prevent non-white population growth. Today, there are still abortion activists who behave like the black community needs more abortions.

The politicization of abortion — an issue that is moral to its core — is a wound in our national fabric that we feel deeply and personally. One of us was born to a single mother and later adopted, but many others in the exact same situation were aborted. We work with CURE to support policies that help mothers with unplanned pregnancies avoid the grievous act of abortion. Black mothers especially face intense manipulation and pressure because of the politics of abortion.

We must restore bipartisan moral common sense and offer hope to these women. There is no hope without justice, and there’s no justice without truth. We can’t talk about racism without talking about the dark stain on our society that abortion represents. Black Americans, who suffer disproportionately from abortion, deserve equal rights, including the right to life. The unborn deserve racial justice too.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/25/race-obsessed-leftists-dont-want-to-talk-about-the-abortion-rate-of-black-babies/,2022-02-25
"Jussie Smollett's Black, Gay, Anti-Trump Privilege Continues To Save Him","No matter what leftists in the national media say, the Jussie Smollett saga has nothing to do with criminal justice and everything to do with “social justice,” contemporary America’s greatest plague.

In the latest development of this exhausted story, an Illinois appellate court on Wednesday ruled that Smollett be released from his 150-day jail sentence that began last week, while his legal team appeals his conviction.

That same day, Washington Post columnist Paul Butler, who is rumored to have a law degree, wrote that Smollett’s dinky lock-up time was the result of racists persecuting a black man.

“I don’t believe Jussie Smollett but I recognize when a Black man gets railroaded through a justice system that is out to get him,” said Butler, who is also Black with a capital B. “A rich entitled actor is hardly the most sympathetic face of reform. Still, Smollett’s case demonstrates that when powerful elites decide they want a Black man locked up, nothing and nobody — not even the elected prosecutor — will stop them.”

He proceeded to deliver a tortured logic on how punishing Smollett for lying about being the victim of a homophobic and racist hate crime would mean that real victims decline to prosecute their attackers.

“Sending a Black gay man to jail for lying about being attacked will not encourage hate crime victims to come forward,” Butler wrote. “Instead, it sends the message that they, rather than their assailants, are subject to being incarcerated if authorities don’t believe their stories.”

I hope Paul didn’t sprain his back with that obscene reach. And I hope an editor at the Post wasn’t fired for allowing something so stupid to be printed.

The lesson in prosecuting a liar for lying is to abstain from lying, especially with regard to the police. If anyone looks at Smollett and is filled with crippling fear that he might find himself on trial, he should probably think twice about hiring two Nigerians to call him the n-word while hitting him with harmless face taps in the middle of the night.

But the most absurd point in Butler’s piece is his assertion that Smollett’s claim was investigated so thoroughly because he was a “celebrity.” That is the exact opposite of the truth. If only the reality were so harmless.

No— the reason why Smollett’s 2019 allegation that he was violently assaulted on a Chicago street garnered so much attention, thus pressuring police to act with haste, was not because he was a relatively unknown TV actor. It was because his story — and what a story! — aligned perfectly with the insidious narrative the national media had been pushing during the entirety of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and presidency.

Smollett is a black man. He’s also gay. That makes him, as dictated by the media and our entertainment industry, an unjustly oppressed person. By default. But compounding the issue was Smollett’s claim that his attackers were white males who supported Trump (otherwise known by the Biden administration as “Enemies of the State.”) That a black, gay man was violently assaulted by Trump supporters was all the press needed to make this a national story. It reinforced their narrative that Trump had unleashed a re-inspired mob of white supremacists to terrorize innocent minorities across the country.

Who could associate themselves with a president who does that? You certainly couldn’t vote for him.

Again, this isn’t criminal justice. It’s social justice — the pursuit of power, money, and fame by claiming (usually falsely) to have been oppressed on account of race, gender, or sexual identity.

Smollett was caught in a repulsive lie. A jury convicted him and a judge sentenced him. That’s justice. It’s just not the kind leftists in the corporate media like Paul Butler are looking for.

Smollett didn’t go to jail because he’s black or gay. He got one more out because he is.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/17/jussie-smolletts-black-gay-and-anti-trump-privilege-continues-to-save-him/,2022-03-17
Marsha Blackburn Previews GOP Strategy To Vet Kentanji Jackson,"All the way back in 2008, Marsha Blackburn recalled an anecdote from her first congressional campaign. A man in a coffee shop asked, “Little lady, what qualifies you to run for the United States House of Representatives?”

Blackburn, so the story goes, “quickly ticked off her time as a choir director and Girl Scouts cookie mom.”

After a brief exchange, the man asked another question. “Little lady, if you win this thing, what we gonna call you — congresslady? Congressgirl?”

“Sir, congressman will be just fine,” Blackburn replied.

And it was. In the House, Blackburn famously went by “congressman” instead of “congresswoman,” although she never made a big deal of it.

When I asked the senator on Tuesday why it matters that she’ll be the only Republican woman on the Judiciary Committee during Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Blackburn’s answer was that she plans to “give voice to the questions and concerns that conservative women have as they look at the federal bench and the individual that is going to take the seat.”

Those concerns, according to Blackburn, involve Jackson’s “respect” for the Constitution and rule of law. She’s convinced Democrats’ reprehensible conduct during the Kavanaugh confirmation is “why now people want it to be focused on the issues. They want it to be very thorough, they want to go into someone’s record.”

Blackburn, a mother of two who’s been married to her husband since the 1970s, worked her way from a career in sales and marketing up to Tennessee’s state senate and then to the House of Representatives, where she served from 2003 until voters sent her to the upper chamber in 2019. (Against the wishes of Taylor Swift.) In the Senate, Blackburn has become a reliable voice for the new GOP, zeroing in on big technology companies and America’s enemies in the Chinese government.

The Kavanaugh confirmation undoubtedly marked a turning point for many Republicans, not just in Washington. Blackburn joined the judiciary committee in time to question Amy Coney Barrett and, ultimately, vote in favor of her advancement to the court. In an empty meeting room on Capitol Hill, spring sunshine pouring through the windows, Blackburn and I briefly revisited those ugly confirmations during an interview less than a week before the start of Jackson’s time in the hot seat.

“Tennesseans,” Blackburn told me, “were just shocked at the conduct of some of the Democrats” during Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation. They watched Barrett’s confirmation “intently.”

Rightfully so, given how Democrats and their allies in media accused Kavanaugh of gang rape with no credible evidence. Justice Barrett faced heinous attacks on her faith and family from the press. One best-selling author implied she was akin to a “white colonizer” for adopting black children.

With that in mind, I asked for Blackburn’s response to an increasingly popular sentiment on the right. “If Democrats are going to break all of these norms, why should we not fight their norm-breaking with our own norm-breaking? If they’re fundamentally transforming the country with activist judges—and I think it Judge Jackson’s record suggests that’s the kind of jurist that she is—if they’re doing that, is the only way to stop it not breaking norms on our own?”

“The way to stop it is to show the record,” said the senator, “of the individuals, whether it is Judge Jackson, whether it is nominees for any of the other federal courts. Sunlight is the best on this. And to bring attention to the records, to the writings, the rulings, the opinions, the number of times that have been overturned, respect for the Constitution, respect for the rule of law. That is the best way to bring attention to an issue and preserve this nation’s founding and the fundamentals of the Constitution which have kept us as a democratic republic.”

I then asked Blackburn about the particular norm I had in mind as a potential sticking point for Jackson’s confirmation. Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee killed Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination to the Federal Reserve this week by boycotting a committee vote, denying Democrats the quorum needed to advance her nomination. Raskin pulled out of the running.

Months ago, Rachel Bovard explained in The Federalist how Senate Republicans could use the same rule to leave Biden’s Supreme Court nominee in procedural limbo.

“By failing to show up to vote on the nomination in committee, Republicans could prevent the nomination from reaching the Senate floor by appealing to the Senate’s Rule 26, which requires that a majority of members, physically present, report the bill out of committee,” Bovard wrote.

Referencing the Raskin case, I asked Blackburn, “Are there any circumstances in which you could envision Republicans denying Judge Jackson a quorum depending on how the hearing goes?”

“The best thing for us to do right now is to prepare for opening statements, prepare for our questions, and approach next week in a thorough vetting mindset process,” she told me.

I started to push one more time on the question of norms, noting how Senate Republicans haven’t forced Vice President Harris to break many ties and even voted to confirm some of President Biden’s nominees. Blackburn politely interrupted me. (It was fair, I was rambling.)

“Republicans,” she said pointedly, “should lead the way in saying, ‘This is the Constitution. This is what we’re required to do by the Constitution. This is where the Constitution places responsibility. And this is what is required of us.’ And I think that it is a very good thing for Republicans to show that we believe in the Constitution and the rule of law and have respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.”

Somewhere in the middle of our conversation, I asked Blackburn about another norm, one she’s challenged very effectively. When Justice Breyer announced his retirement, I noted, some voices on the left were lamenting the corporate bias in Breyer’s record on antitrust, an issue on which Blackburn has become a major leader in challenging GOP orthodoxy.

“We are looking very closely at her record with companies and anything that she has written or said about antitrust,” the senator replied.

The effort to vet Jackson is an “all-hands-on-deck operation for us,” Blackburn explained.

Democrats are scrambling to confirm the judge before Easter. “Democrats really want to push this forward,” said Blackburn. “They are afraid. We’re at a 50-50 Senate. And they may not have the votes at some point. So they’re wanting to get the hearing out of the way and get her ready to go to the floor while they still have the votes.”

SCOTUS Nominee's School Teaches Kids To Attack 'Cisgender Privilege',"Georgetown Day School, where Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson serves on the board of trustees, recently hosted a critical race theorist to indoctrinate pre-K students as part of a “Black Lives Matter at School’s Week of Action,” a campaign that seeks to turn children into extremist political activists.

Fox News recently reported that the school promotes critical race theory books and that the board of trustees, of which Jackson has been a member since 2019, is “involved with executing their ‘anti-racism action plan.’”

One section of the school website, archived here, displays that Georgetown Day School recently hosted Dr. Denisha Jones, a critical race theorist, to indoctrinate pre-K students with the corrosive left-wing theory. Jones joined the children via Zoom to discuss the guiding principles of Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action, where Jones has been a member of the steering committee since 2017.

The Georgetown Day School website includes a link to a Google Drive folder containing several graphics associated with the Week of Action, which described the mission of the campaign.

One graphic explains that one of the Week of Action’s principles is to be “Transgender Affirming,” which means working to “dismantle cisgender privilege and uplift Black trans folk.” One of the principles is also titled “Black Villages.” The poster continues “We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family.”

Another document in the folder is titled “Black Lives Matter Guiding Principles,” and is specifically noted as “Kid-friendly.” One of the principles is “globalism.”

Yet another document outlines the demands of the campaign, among which are “fund counselors not cops” and “mandate black history and ethnic studies.”

Jones has also openly defended critical race theory. In a panel discussion, called “In Defense of Critical Race Theory,” Jones remarked that “Without critical race theory, people will fall back on those old tropes that we know continue to harm students.” Jones, who has promoted black trans prostitutes on Twitter, also took part in an event titled “Standing Up To CRT Attacks: Strategies and Actions.”

Jones is also an editor of a book called “Black Lives Matter At Schools,” which received glowing praise from various critical race theorists. Michael Bennet, author of “Things That Make White People Uncomfortable,” called it “a playbook for undoing institutional racism,” while the infamous Ibram X. Kendi described it as an “essential resource.”

"To America’s Virtue Signaling Elite, Ukraine Is The New ‘Black Lives Matter’","Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began several weeks ago, America’s ruling elites have wasted no time in letting you know how much they so deeply care about the conflict.

Embark on a journey to your favorite social media network or news outlet, and you’ll find some of the country’s biggest corporations, media figures, and celebrities wrapping themselves in the blue and gold of Ukraine’s flag. While companies like Google and Skype employ their ubiquitous presence to encourage users to support relief efforts in Ukraine, American politicians have taken virtue signaling to a whole new level.

Skype is allowing its users to make free calls to Ukraine

As a callback to the viral clip of Ukrainian soldiers telling a Russian warship to “go f-ck yourself,” for instance, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse has not only etched the infamous statement in his Twitter bio, but has written it in Russian. Since the outset of the invasion, the Republican senator’s personal Twitter feed has been filled with tweets and retweets pertaining to the conflict, including a reposting of a tweet falsely claiming that the Ukrainians who told off the Russian warship “held their ground” and “were killed.”

Screenshot of a Google ad encouraging users to support Ukraine relief efforts

Democrats have also been just as unbearable in flaunting their self-righteousness on the issue, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reading a poem written by U2 frontman Bono on St. Patrick’s Day last week that pays tribute to Ukraine and the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Oh St. Patrick, he drove out the snakes with his prayers, but that’s not all it takes. With the smoke symbolizes an evil that arises and hides in your heart as it breaks,” Pelosi said. “And the evil risen from the darkness that lives in some men, but in sorrow and fear, that’s when saints can appear. You drive out those old snakes once again, and they struggle for us to be free from the psycho in this human family. Ireland’s sorrow and pain is now the Ukraine and St. Patrick’s name is now Zelensky.”

The bizarre moment quickly prompted comical reactions from major conservative figures, including a tweet from Federalist publisher Ben Domenech that questioned whether the performance was “a prank.”

“Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this?” Domenech asked.

Is this a prank? Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this? — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) March 17, 2022

While not uncommon for America’s elite to attach themselves to the latest cause that pops up on their Twitter feed, the overwhelming and collective rush to voice support for Ukraine is unlike anything the country has witnessed since the death of George Floyd in May 2020.

Within days of Floyd’s death, Black Lives Matter (BLM) became a universally recognized group and phrase, with nearly every major well-known business and public figure announcing their commitment to the Marxist group’s mission. Companies like Nike were quick to pledge their financial support to BLM’s cause, which included $40 million directed towards “organizations that put social justice, education and addressing racial inequality in America at the center of their work.”

Major entertainment platforms also joined in on the frenzy, with Netflix tweeting that “To be silent is to be complicit. Black lives matter” and Hulu proclaiming they “support Black lives.”

“Today, and every day. You are seen. You are heard. And we are with you,” Hulu’s official Twitter account tweeted.

Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris decided to take her support for the BLM movement a step further, saying that “All Black Lives Matter—that includes Black trans women.”

Ukraine Has Become Black Lives Matter 2.0

While it’s one thing to genuinely care about the plights of Ukrainians suffering from a Russian military onslaught, it’s another to utilize the ongoing invasion to project one’s own moral superiority. Americans need to realize that for elitists like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who previously marched with Black Lives Matter and now seemingly worried more about Ukraine’s borders than America’s, the conflict in Ukraine doesn’t represent a tragedy, but an opportunity for self-aggrandizement.

Much like publicly backing Black Lives Matter, repeatedly pronouncing support for Ukraine has become the latest form of virtue signaling that permits America’s ruling class to place themselves on a moral pedestal and demonstrate to the country how “tolerant” and “accepting” they are, without doing anything actually useful to their neighbors. Whether it’s posting a black square on their Instagram or slapping a Ukrainian flag emoji in their Twitter bio, the goal is always the same: to elevate their own social status.

Moreover, as part of their attempt to exemplify how truly committed they are to the cause, these same individuals will vilify anyone who dares question their narrative. Oppose Black Lives Matter? You’re a racist. Prioritize your own country’s needs above Ukraine’s? You’re a puppet of Putin. Whatever the subject, the tactics never change.

And just as America’s elites ignored the increase in black Americans killed in homicides after the BLM riots and defunding of police in major American cities, expect them to ignore the suffering endured by millions of Ukrainians after the fighting in their country has ceased. While those displaced by the war are left to pick up the remains of their fractured lives, America’s elites will move on with theirs, all the while patting themselves on the back for either doing nothing or making the situation worse.

Sen. Blackburn Sells ’Define A Woman’ Shirts Amid Media Attack,"Capitalizing on controversy, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., plans to sell “Define A Woman” t-shirts on her campaign website this week. According to a preview shared with The Federalist, the hot-pink shirts include a dictionary definition of the word “woman” and will sell for $35.

Blackburn took heat from the media last week for asking Kentanji Brown Jackson whether she could provide a definition of “woman” during the judge’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Jackson, nominated to the Supreme Court by President Joe Biden, declined to define the word, replying, “I’m not a biologist.”

Asked about Blackburn’s decision to lean into the controversy, a senior GOP communications official told The Federalist, “When the lunacy of the left has infiltrated every aspect of American life — corporations, sports, media, and politics — it shouldn’t surprise anyone that Republicans are leaning into moments like this.”

“The culture war is being waged by the left on battlefields that were unthinkable just a few years ago — what is a woman, teaching sex to kindergarteners,” the GOP official continued. “Republicans are well within the mainstream for suggesting a woman is, well, a woman.”

The New York Times claimed Blackburn’s question “added another social issue to the list of cultural grievances the G.O.P. is foisting upon [Jackson] in her confirmation hearings.” Jimmy Kimmel called Blackburn “a horrible woman” on his late-night show, and a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist called her a “bigot.” The Washington Post’s national correspondent claimed the question was asked in “remarkable bad faith,” while feminist blog Jezebel said the senator’s inquiry served as “a shining example of how white women help uphold white patriarchy.”

Perhaps most memorably, a USA Today correspondent wrote a story headlined, “Marsha Blackburn asked Ketanji Brown Jackson to define ‘woman.’ Science says there’s no simple answer.”

Almost none of the coverage mentioned that Blackburn asked the question in the context of U.S. v. Virginia, a landmark Supreme Court case that dealt with sex differences. Jackson said she was “not familiar” with the case.

In a statement to The Federalist, Blackburn referenced the case again. “It is absurd that Joe Biden pushed for a female nominee who cannot even define the word ‘woman.’ As Justice Ginsburg said in United States v. Virginia, there are physical differences between men and women that are enduring,” said the senator. “It is frightening that, if confirmed, Judge Jackson will be expected to rule on cases involving women — in schools, in sports, and in the workplace — yet refuses to comment on the fundamental difference between a man and a woman.”

Blackburn further framed her pushback as a fight “against the radical Left’s attempt to destroy our nation and our values.”

While the pro-trans agenda may be popular in legacy media, it remains unpopular among Blackburn’s constituents. A Vanderbilt University poll of Tennessee voters conducted last year “found that 60% of respondents support requiring students in middle and high school to play on the sports team corresponding with their sex at the time of birth,” according to The Tennessean.

BLM Co-Founder: Asking About Profiteering Allegations Is Racist,"It sure does pay to sow racial division in this country. Just ask Black Lives Matter (BLM) co-founder Patrisse Cullors, but don’t criticize her alleged financial mismanagement and questionable spending decisions while you’re at it.

At an event in Washington state last week, as part of a week-long residency with the Vashon Center for the Arts, Cullors made clear that if you criticize her or the movement, you’re a racist standing in the way of black women organizers. The comments were captured on an exclusive video posted below.

“We didn’t figure out how to protect ourselves. And what’s true often, especially for black women is we don’t protect ourselves first,” Cullors complained in what she described as “straight-up attacks” in the controversy over BLM finances.

The comments came days after a bombshell report that Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation donations were used to purchase a 6,500-square-foot, nearly $6 million mansion in southern California.

According to New York Magazine, the home was secretly acquired by a shell company in October 2020 when Cullors served as executive director for BLM. It makes sense why they’d want to keep it secret: Marxists are not supposed to be swimming in dough, and contributions were supposed to go to helping the BLM cause.

This type of purchase wasn’t new for Cullors: she started spending a fortune back in 2016, three years after she co-founded BLM. As her movement’s evangelists claimed police were murdering innocent black people, she was on a real estate shopping spree, buying up four opulent digs for a reported total of $3.2 million.

One of the secluded homes was purchased in early April 2021, according to the New York Post. The self-proclaimed Marxist ended up resigning from her post a month later, amidst reports on the controversial spending habits.

Cullors may want to abolish police and prisons, but certainly not the wealth built on the backs of a divisive movement that demonizes police and white people. And when she’s called out, she leans into a strategy of demonizing her critics as racist.

It’s unclear how much Cullors was paid for the residency at the Vashon Center for the Arts on Vashon Island, Washington, as the center’s executive director tells me she doesn’t disclose artists’ fees. But the Vashon School District confirmed it offered $4,000 from an anonymous donation made to Vashon Schools Foundation. The King County government offered another $3,000 grant towards the residency.

The residency included an art installation, Q&A with students at the local high school, and a one-on-one on-stage conversation with radical abolitionist and two-time failed Seattle political candidate Nikkita Oliver.

The event, held on April 8, was a masterclass in grievances and identity politics, told to a mostly affluent white audience — BLM’s core demographic of supporters in the Pacific Northwest. There, according to newly obtained video, Cullors complained about the criticisms against her:

[My legal team] said to me when I got attacked last year, they said they had never seen that level of attack towards anyone except for a presidential candidate. And that, clearly, the right was polling me and trying to see ‘Okay, what’s going to be the pressure point for this movement?’ And that was very hard for me to understand. I’m literally just thinking I’m still like, a young, you know, organizer from the valley, with a target on my chest. I’m like, ‘Why do you care about me?’

The idea of financial transparency is a new concept and unduly burdensome to black women, Oliver claimed.

“What does it look like to set a standard for accountability and transparency that’s maybe not existed before, and it’s probably unfairly placed upon us. But it is still an opportunity to do something different,” Oliver said.

She questioned why anyone would look at BLM’s IRS Form 990, but not that of the American Civil Liberties Union or United Way. This document allows the IRS to ensure compliance with tax law requirements for exempt nonprofits. It was lost on Oliver that both the ACLU and United Way post their 990 forms online, unlike BLM.

Cullors admitted to not knowing what a 990 was, even though it’s a standard document for nonprofits. She claimed it’s “being weaponized against” black women because “many people don’t even know and honestly don’t care about” the form.

It appears Cullors doesn’t believe any of the criticism is legitimate and that her work is more important than following basic rules governing nonprofits. Her goal is to abolish police and prisons, so she should be able to operate as she sees fit. She seems to view any rules that she doesn’t like (or claims to never have heard of) as an undue burden only experienced by black women.

After Cullors complained about the “attacks” against BLM as a nonprofit entity, Oliver said the criticism is “why so many folks avoid the nonprofit industrial complex.” Cullors agreed.

“This 990 structure, this nonprofit system structure, this is like, deeply unsafe,” Cullors said. “Like this is being literally weaponized against us, against the people we work with. I can’t tell you how many people are like, ‘Am I next? Like, are they going to do this to me?’”

If other nonprofit leaders mishandle millions in funds, it likely would happen to them.

The WA Secretary of State Corporations and Charities Division warned BLM to cease fundraising efforts in the state because the nonprofit had not submitted its registration or renewal paperwork. Even after the warning, BLM continued to fundraise in Washington, according to a February 2022 Washington Examiner report. At the time, they noted BLM was out of compliance in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Virginia.

Despite the ongoing claims of BLM financial mismanagement, Cullors argues there is a “right-wing” attack that she labels “a misinformation and disinformation effort to not just challenge Black Lives Matter and the organization,” but all black organizers.

“But it’s an experiment. If they win, then it’s the next black-led organization. And then there’s the next black-led organization, and it’s the next black person who’s leading that. And so it’s so important that we pay attention to what’s happening,” Cullors warned.

But all that’s happening is Cullors working to carve out a new class of privileges. And when things don’t go as planned, she has an audience happy to support her claims of victimhood.

Given that victimhood is a core tenet of race hustlers — Didn’t get that job or raise? Stuck in poverty? Grades not where they should be? Institutionalized racism! — her position makes sense.

"No, ‘Survivor,’ Not Everyone Is ‘Subconsciously’ Racist","Conversations about race on the hit TV show “Survivor” are becoming more frequent, and this season proves to be no exception. In the reality show’s latest race-based controversy, black castaways Drea Wheeler and Maryanne Oketch became emotional after seeing that the first two contestants voted onto the Season 42 jury, Chanelle Howell and Rocksroy Bailey, were also black.

“I was so proud because we have four black contestants in Survivor,” Drea said during tribal council after Probst prompted her to explain her reaction. “And then it always happens where at one point the black contestants get booted out — Boom! Boom! Boom! — and then that’s exactly what this is right now. So yeah, I’m pissed.”

When Probst asked if she thought the votes that put Chanelle and Rocksroy out of the game were “race-related,” Drea invoked language reminiscent of the ideology expressed by critical race theorists such as Robin DiAngelo and Henry Rogers (a.k.a. Ibram X. Kendi).

“Subconsciously, a little bit of that, unfortunately,” she said. “I see now I have to play the game a little harder. I can tell you right now, I’m playing my idol tonight so that I can stay in this game. I’m not gonna let that happen to another one of us. Point blank. It’s a reset for me. This was a game-changer.”

Coming into the tribal council, Maryanne was one of the four “blue” tribe members who had agreed with castaway Jonathan Young’s plan to vote Drea off the show. Jonathan made it clear to his allies during conversations earlier that he was concerned about keeping Drea in the game because she had an immunity idol, which, if played, made her safe from being voted off the island.

After hearing Drea’s thoughts, however, Maryanne changed course.

“I can’t write Drea’s name down [now],” Maryanne said. “I literally cannot. I walked into tribal, I saw two black people. I cannot write her name down. I’m so sorry.”

Maryanne went on to say that “if I write Drea’s name right now, that means that I’m a part of a perpetuating problem.”

It’s similar to the rhetoric castaway and “all-black alliance” member Liana Wallace used to describe her feelings about voting off another black player last season. At the time, Liana claimed that black “has this currency that can kill you” and playing “Survivor” “is about uplifting other black people and giving black people something to root for, [aside from] everything else that’s out there that’s killing us.”

The difference between last season’s race moment and this season’s moment is that Drea and Maryanne’s comments got pushback from a tribemate in the moment. When Jonathan heard Drea and Maryanne say the three white people in her tribe might vote her off because a small part of their brains biased them against her skin color, he was visibly upset.

“I don’t feel this is right, because y’all are coming at this like we’re racists,” he said.

The rest of the tribe seemed taken aback by Jonathan’s blunt reply, but he doubled down. When Maryanne also brought up “subconscious bias,” he pointed out “that’s saying I’m subconsciously racist.” Both Maryanne and Drea vehemently denied believing their white teammates were racists.

Drea and Maryanne may not have explicitly called Jonathan, Lindsey, and Tori racists, but the underlying message is the same. Both Drea and Maryanne automatically believed that because their tribe members were white, they harbored deep and possibly even unknown biases towards black people even though they had no evidence of this.

The idea that everyone has implicit bias is widespread and often spoon-fed to woke corporations, schools, and universities but it’s a lie backed up by weak studies and propped up by people with political agendas. According to that ideology, you’re a racist unless you’ve taken drastic steps to become an anti-racist because everything must be viewed through a race-based lens.

You must “educate yourself” by paying for “anti-racist” grifters or purchasing their books. And even after all of that, you might still be called a racist simply because you were born a certain way. It’s a scam ideology that indicts people for their skin color. That’s why parents and Republican legislators all over the nation have rejected its presence in classrooms.

Simply put: Jonathan was right to reject the premise that he has a “subconscious bias” against black people that pushed him to vote out Drea, because it’s a lie. “Survivor” may be an accelerated “social experiment,” but no one has the standing to accuse other strangers he met less than a month ago of being something that gets people fired, censored, and canceled in the real world simply because they are white.

Jonathan’s motivations to target Drea were clear from the beginning, and they had nothing to do with her skin color.

Similarly, his fellow castaways also had legitimate reasons to vote out Rocksroy, who was charged by his tribemates as bossy, inconsiderate, and hard to negotiate with, and Chanelle, who caught heat for being repeatedly untrustworthy. Rocksroy and Chanelle were voted off the island fair and square, not because one of the most racially, culturally, and religiously diverse casts in “Survivor” history was too privileged or too reliant on mental messages from some biased parts of their brains to decide who to get rid of.

In the end, both Drea and Maryanne chose to play their idols, which prevented them from receiving any game-ending votes. They claimed they didn’t want their “stand” to be made into a “race thing,” but it’s a little too late for that.

Kevin Samuels Took On Hyper-Feminist Society In YouTube's Manosphere,"In the face of our rampant cancel-crazed culture, recently deceased YouTube sensation Kevin Samuels carved out a place in the media landscape by fearlessly speaking his mind in his observations on modern men and women — even when those observations scraped against our society’s hyper-feminist grain.

Samuels was a salary man turned cultural critic who took the internet by storm, particularly American black audiences. Samuels’ YouTube and Instagram following is more than 1 million, thanks to his decision to address the plight of romantic relationships in the West. Samuels primarily focused on issues with the black family, but even a cursory glance at his videos shows a man well aware of the way liberal polity influences every aspect of our lives.

Samuels often discussed many talking points that conservatives would be familiar with in regards to the breakdown of the black family structure, and now the structure of American families in general. He highlighted in particular the reality that black Americans had been more likely to be married than white Americans until the 1960s.

Bearing out these statistics has led many, including Samuels, to emphasize how deleterious left-wing social policies have been to the fabric of the black community. Another of Samuels’ favorite statistics to banty was the large number of black men who are both single and childless while earning a middle-class salary.

One must consider Samuels’ journey a real study in the power of internet algorithms. Samuels was a part of the corner of YouTube known as the “manosphere.” The manosphere serves as a catch-all category for content geared specifically towards addressing male issues.

YouTube corners suffer the same woes as any other kind of labeling or genre tags. Some might even include Joe Rogan in the manosphere because he’s a dude who primarily talks to other dudes, but let’s reserve the label for those who would claim it — and Samuels was one of its early adopters.

For the sake of brevity, I’ll explain the manosphere based on my experience with it as a millennial male. Reddit now serves as the punching bag for most countercultural content, but it hasn’t always been this way. A once-popular, now-deleted subreddit was called the Red Pill.

Inspired by the Matrix film series, the subreddit existed to teach men how to protect themselves while dating modern women. Inspired by people like the late comedian Patrice O’Neal and an old pick-up artist named Rollo Tomassi, the forum had several hundred thousand subscribers. This about sums up what has spiraled into what many consider YouTube’s “misogyny zone.”

Samuels, like all the other members of misogynist YouTube, started by gearing his content toward young men. I can remember a Samuels video that came up in my feed years ago while I was watching old clips of Patrice O’Neal; it was an innocuous video about cologne.

At the time, I could never imagine that in just a few short years during the Covid pandemic in 2020, this random black guy I remembered for some kitschy videos about what blazer to wear would become a viral sensation by telling a black woman she was “average at best” in this video that catapulted Samuels to stardom.

He quickly became perhaps the most polarizing figure in the black internet world. And his audience didn’t just stop at black people; as his show grew he began to field calls from men and women all over the world.

When he decided to speak to women, Samuels became the manosphere’s largest figure. This was his innovation, and it worked because of his unique vantage point as a black Gen X male subjecting primarily black women to the pro-patriarchal social views that he believed were the foundation of marriages and communities.

Samuels’ detractors came with all the vitriol one would expect, but he carried himself well through it all. Agree or disagree with his points, Samuels was a brave thinker and his content leaves an excellent legacy of one very interesting American.

Black Prosecutor Brings No Charges Against Cop Who Killed Amir Locke,"The name Amir Locke probably sounds only vaguely familiar at the moment, but rest assured that it is now one more piece of the Black Lives Matter movement’s great white supremacy myth. With, of course, a helpful assist from the ready-to-lie national media.

Recall Locke as the 22-year-old black man shot dead earlier this year by police during a no-knock warrant raid in Minneapolis. The incident naturally sparked city-wide riots and outrage from leftist journalists eager to pour more kerosine on our race bonfires.

The illiterate Ben Crump was quick to say at the time that Locke’s death was another example of black Americans unable to “sleep safely in their beds at night” because of a racist police force.

Eugene Robinson of the Washington Post wrote with feverish melodrama, “How many times have we rolled this damn rock up the hill? And how many times has it rolled right back down, snuffing out the life of yet another innocent Black victim?”

Locke had been asleep on the couch of an apartment he was visiting that early morning when police came in through the front door yelling, “Police search warrant!” “Get on the ground!” and, “Get on the f-cking ground!” Body camera footage showed that Locke had been underneath a blanket and began to emerge with his hand in possession of a gun. One officer, identified as Mark Hanneman, fired three shots that ultimately killed Locke.

Locke wasn’t the subject of the search warrant and wasn’t wanted for any crime. Police were searching for his cousin, Mehki Speed, who was suspected of killing a man just a few days prior. Speed lived with his mother in the same apartment building but also had key access to the apartment where Locke was staying. (Speed this week pleaded guilty to the murder.)

Authorities opened an investigation of the incident to determine whether Hanneman was justified in firing on Locke. That probe wrapped up a month ago. Despite the initial extensive media coverage of Locke, I would bet our next multi-billion-dollar “aid” package to Ukraine that not a single person reading this has a clue as to what the conclusion of the investigation was.

That’s because, other than a couple obligatory mentions from the New York Times and the Washington Post, the national media showed virtually no interest in the decision by the Minneapolis attorney general not to bring any charges against Hanneman or the police force.

That’s right. The officer who shot Locke dead is no legal jeopardy. He is under no threat of time in prison.

Really? Yet “another innocent black victim” killed by police but nothing from the media? Why might that be? I know! Maybe because the prosecutor who made that decision, Keith Ellison, is black!

Ellison released his decision on April 6, stating that his office would be unable to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt a criminal charge against any … officer involved in the decision-making that led to the death of Amir Locke.”

With specific regard to Hanneman, Ellison said, “Under current law – and as awful as the circumstances of this tragedy are – there is not sufficient admissible evidence to support a criminal charge.”

The law in Minnesota provides that a police officer is justified in using deadly force against a target should he reasonably perceive in the moment, without the benefit of hindsight, that “such force was necessary to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm.”

A statement by Hanneman about the shooting during the raid said he did believe Locke posed a threat, given the circumstances related to the high-risk search order, and that Locke was non-compliant with police orders to drop his weapon and place himself on the floor.

“The individual was crouched and beginning to rise from behind the ottoman,” Hanneman said. “As that individual did so, I noticed that the individual had a handgun in their hand and was brandishing it, and pointed it at me. In this moment, I feared for my life and the lives of my teammates. I was convinced that the individual was going to fire their handgun and that I would suffer great bodily harm or death.”

It’s certainly a tragedy. For that very reason, the use of no-knock warrants is facing legal restrictions in Minnesota and elsewhere. But you know what it’s not? Racism.

It’s not a blind leap of faith to know that’s exactly what it would have been called had Ellison been anything other than black. Thank God we were spared.

None of this is about to matter, though. Locke’s name is already one more piece of BLM’s great white supremacy myth.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/12/black-prosecutor-brings-no-charges-against-cop-who-killed-amir-locke-doesnt-get-called-white-supremacist/,2022-05-12
Blackouts Inevitable As Renewables Struggle To Replace Reliable Energy,"Americans will need to brace for deadly blackouts under a hotter-than-usual summer, warned a major energy non-profit in a sobering report last week.

On Wednesday, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) released its annual summer assessment covering June through September with grim predictions of repeated blackouts throughout the country. The entire western United States, along with a majority of the Midwest, Texas, and the western south, face “high” or “elevated” risks of “energy emergencies” brought by severe drought, unreliable solar, and supply chain issues hampering conventional sources.

“We’ve been doing this for close to 30 years,” NERC Director of Reliability Assessment and Performance Analysis John Moura told CBS News. “This is probably one of the grimmest pictures we’ve painted in a while.”

Last week, the summer outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast temperatures above what the agency considers normal compared to the prior 143 years with relatively low precipitation across much of the west and the plains.

Lack of water and higher-than-normal temperatures are expected to stress the nation’s power grid beyond capacity. Low water levels, the NERC emphasizes, will limit plants’ ability to keep cool while directly reducing power generated by hydroelectric dams.

“Energy output from hydro generators throughout most of the Western United States is being affected by widespread drought and below-normal snowpack,” the authors wrote.

Solar panels, on the other hand, will be unable to generate power from the sun once clouded out by smoke from wildfires, seemingly worse every year as a consequence of negligent land management. Critically, Moura told BNN Bloomberg the early retirement of fossil fuel plants shares much of the blame for this year’s vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy infrastructure.

“The pace of our grid transformation is out of sync,” Moura told the paper as President Joe Biden rushes to promote unreliable renewables in the place of reliable, lower-cost coal and natural gas. At the same time, the Biden administration is shutting down domestic energy projects in the form of fossil fuels even as gas prices continue to reach new records daily.

Larry Behrens, the communications director for the energy non-profit Power the Future, blamed the coming blackouts on “the failed green agenda,” highlighting New Mexico as a prime example.

“In New Mexico, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has forced the state to embrace her own ‘mini’ Green New Deal and now the state faces blackouts as reliable power is abandoned while hard-working men and women lose their jobs,” Behrens told The Federalist.

Grisham signed the climate package in 2019 during her first year in office. It mandates state electricity completely carbon-free by 2045. PNM, the state’s largest power provider, warned of outages in February.

“Make no mistake,” Behrens added, “this is all a man-made energy crisis on the part of leaders who worship at the altar of the green agenda while plunging our country into the dark ages.”

California and Texas have already begun to experience periodic blackouts as a consequence of a rushed transition to intermittent power sources by wind and solar. The rolling blackouts in California fueled in part the September recall effort against Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Power outages are deadly episodes, especially during heat waves when air conditioning no longer becomes available to the elderly. Last summer, officials in Washington attributed the deaths of two women in their 60s to overheating as regional energy distributors implemented rolling blackouts due to overwhelming demand amid a heatwave. Legacy outlets wrongly blamed climate change for the high temperatures.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/24/report-deadly-summer-blackouts-inevitable-as-renewables-struggle-to-replace-reliable-energy/,2022-05-24
Read This Book To Counter The Lies Of '1619 Project' Racial Determinists,"In an op-ed for The Washington Post last month entitled “For African Americans tired of U.S. hostility, Ghana is still calling,” columnist Karen Attiah discusses the trend of African Americans moving to Africa, or what she calls “black asylum from white supremacy.” Attiah, of Nigerian and Ghanian descent, declares that “leaving is the most powerful form of resistance,” and cites prominent African Americans who move to Africa to “feel mentally and spiritually free from White America’s psychic violence.” Because, you know, Africa doesn’t suffer from much violence.

I suppose one shouldn’t be surprised to read such nonsense from a writer who two years ago blamed the “lies & tears of white women” for violence against black Americans and claimed white women were “lucky” blacks were not “calling for revenge.” But Attiah’s blinkered thinking on race in America is sadly commonplace among prominent black intellectuals on the left.

Nikole Hannah-Jones, whose “1619 Project” curriculum is now taught across the United States, has claimed America was “founded … on an ideal and a lie” as a “slavocracy,” and that “anti-blackness” is “at the core of so many of our institutions and really our society itself.” Ibram X. Kendi, perhaps the most prominent black intellectual in America, has claimed that “racial discrimination is the sole cause of racial disparities in this country and in the world at large.”

It is these theories — and the often erroneous stories that reinforce them — that define much of the discourse on race in America, especially during national Juneteenth celebrations, which commemorate the effective end of slavery. But the story doesn’t have to be told this way.

There is an alternative approach to understanding (and celebrating) black life in the United States. “The State of Black America: Progress, Pitfalls, and the Promise of the Republic,” edited by emeritus professor of political philosophy at Michigan State University W.B. Allen and featuring essays from several prominent black scholars, offers a much-needed corrective to the cynical (and false) thinking peddled by people like Attiah, Hannah-Jones, and Kendi.

In Touch With Reality

In an essay entitled “Whose Fourth of July: Black Patriotism and Racial Inequality in America,” the erudite and rhetorically effective Brown University economics professor Glenn C. Loury calls for an “unabashed black patriotism” and “forthright embrace of American nationalism by black people.” One of the keys to doing so, as Loury has regularly explained, is to “keep in touch with reality.” By that, the economist means that, whatever racism still exists in America, we must not allow that to obscure the remarkable, even unprecedented success black Americans have experienced in the United States.

“Here in America,” writes Loury, “we have witnessed since the end of the Civil War the greatest transformation in the status of an enserfed people … that is to be found anywhere in world history. Some forty million strong, we have become by far the richest and most powerful population of African descent on the planet.”

He notes several important developments for blacks in the last 75 years: the development of a large middle class, the existence of black billionaires, and the influence of blacks on American culture. “Black Americans are the richest and most powerful people in large numbers of African descent on the planet. … [African Americans] have access to five times the income of a typical Nigerian.” He also argues that the success of people like Hannah-Jones and Kendi “gives the lie” to their cynical pessimism.

Bluffs and Bludgeons

“Structural racism,” says Loury, is largely a fabrication employed as a “bluff and a bludgeon.” It is a bluff in the sense that it is presented as an explanation that is not a legitimate one, and a bludgeon in that it is leveraged as a rhetorical weapon to shame and defeat one’s opponents.

An example of the bluff is the left’s obsessions with the narrative of police brutality against black victims. Yet more whites are killed by police every year, and although blacks are overrepresented in that statistic, they are far less than the majority (about one-fourth of just over 1,000 fatal shootings by police annually).

The left-wing narrative also typically elides that many of the persons killed are engaged in violent conflict with police officers, and that, as Loury notes, almost half of the 17,000 homicides in the United States every year involve black perpetrators. “For every black killed by the police, more than twenty-five other black people meet their end because of homicides committed by other blacks,” writes Loury.

The bludgeon, of course, is even easier to identify. That weapon is employed every time someone claims that this or that institution is permeated with systemic racism, or claims systemic racism explains some news event. The reaction to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock is explained by structural racism; gun rights are based on it, and the disproportionate number of black Americans killed by Covid is because of it.

These are either overly simplistic or fallacious. Although the use of this weapon is pervasive and quite damaging, Loury is hopeful: “I believe we are already beginning to see the collapse of this house of cards.”

A More Complicated History

The introductory essay by W.B. Allen and Mikael Rose Good exposes yet another problem with the “systemic” and “structural” racism narratives on the left. For, contrary to what many have been led to believe, substantial progress toward parity with whites for black Americans occurred before the civil rights movement, and during Jim Crow — quite an achievement, given what blacks were up against. Yet the sharpest drop in intergenerational economic mobility in the United States since 1965 has been among African Americans — quite counterintuitive given this was coeval with desegregation and other race-related policies like increased government subsidies for black communities, affirmative action, and busing.

What then explains the stagnation, and even decline of black fortunes in America? Allen and Good blame, in part, administrative cantonment, by which they mean the policy of the U.S. government treating blacks as separate and apart from everyone else.

Precious D. Hall and Daphne Cooper in their essay note that “on the whole, public policies have had a negative effect on African Americans, contributing significantly to a persistent state of poverty … and causing them to face unemployment, underemployment, and inadequate access to health care, housing, and education.” Stan Parker and Robert Borens in the summary of their essay note that poverty correlates strongly with family structure, that since the 1960s marriage and the traditional family dramatically deteriorated (in large part because of changes in attitudes toward religion and government), and that these changes were bolstered, accelerated, and enabled by Supreme Court decisions such as Roe v. Wade.

Ian V. Rowe in another essay observes that “overwhelming data and common sense suggest that family stability matters significantly in virtually every facet of a child’s future life.” Yet about half of black children are living in a home headed by a single parent, increasing the likelihood of all manner of negative outcomes, including failure to graduate high school, underemployment, or prison time. As Parker and Borens mourn: “It is an unfortunate historical fact that the civil rights movement coincided with the prevalence of a certain cultural arrogance which emphasized religion and pretended like the federal government could solve all social ills.”

Which Story Will We Tell?

In other words, the very same trends that have devastated all American demographics since the 1960s — the breakdown of the family, declining religious observance and attendance, failed federal social welfare programs, and increased rates of substance abuse — have hit the black community. Many of the economic and social gains patiently and diligently accumulated among multiple black generations since emancipation — which were leading them closer to parity with white Americans — stalled, or even evaporated.

A few years ago, Hannah-Jones asserted: “None of the actions we are told black people must take if they want to ‘lift themselves’ out of poverty and gain financial stability — not marrying, not getting educated, not saving more, not owning a home — can mitigate 400 years of racialized plundering.” The story told by the contributors to “The State of Black America” quite decisively repudiates Hannah-Jones’ claim and the broader racialist accounts offered by her and others like Attiah and Kendi. This Juneteenth, which story we tell ourselves, and allow to inform our imaginations, will in large part determine the future trajectory of blacks in America.

Historically Black Colleges Should Not Be Exempt From Market Forces,"Upon his death in 1832, the Quaker philanthropist Richard Humphreys bequeathed one-tenth of his estate for the founding of the African Institute. That Pennsylvania academy would eventually become the nation’s first HBCU, Cheyney University. Since that time, Historically Black Colleges and Universities have educated millions, filling a gap caused by racial prejudice and serving as a source of pride for African-Americans and the country at large.

A quick look at the numbers reveals that HBCUs as a class remain on firm financial ground today. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, HBCU enrollment rose 25 percent between 1976 and 2020. Prominent HBCUs like North Carolina A&T and Howard University have seen particular growth in recent semesters, with the former experiencing a rising headcount every year since 2014 and the latter enjoying a 28 percent gain in student matriculation since 2019.

Additionally, federal assistance to HBCUs during the Covid-19 pandemic was disproportionately generous. As S&P Global Ratings reported earlier this month, the average American university received $3,319 per full-time student, while HBCUs received a massive $18,000 for each full-time enrollee. Indeed, as S&P bluntly stated, many HBCUs “are better positioned now than prior to the pandemic.”

The Call for Increased HBCU Funding

Yet, despite these encouraging figures, black scholars and activists have begun to call for more—and permanent—funding for HBCUs. Writing in Inside Higher Ed earlier this month, University of Baltimore president Kurt L. Schmoke and Chicago State University president Zaldwaynaka Scott argued that Predominantly Black Institutions and HBCUs should be part of “the national higher education equity conversation.” Specifically, Schmoke and Scott contended that federal support should be “increased to adequate levels through proper funding streams that remain funded year after year.”

Appearing before Congress this past March, Jackson State University president Thomas Hudson trod similar ground when he asked what it would take “to ensure the long-term protection of … the historical assets that are HBCUs.”

Not to be neglected is the Biden administration’s fiscal year 2023 budget, which requests an HBCU funding increase of $65 million, a demand cited by the United Negro College Fund as its “top [budgetary] priority.” Moreover, while the House version of the doomed Build Back Better bill would have funneled $2 billion to HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions, reporting in the New York Times and elsewhere suggests that administration officials initially hoped to award a sum 10 times as great.

HBCUs’ Dangerous Futures

To the extent that this bailout chorus is growing louder, it is doing so in part because of the perception that HBCUs may soon face mounting financial challenges. As the American Association of University Professors noted last year, “only a handful” of black colleges have endowments in excess of $200 million. Furthermore, while the graduation rate for all American colleges was 60 percent in 2019, HBCUs reported a rate of only 35 percent, a figure that suggests a failure to retain students and student dollars.

Like other institutions of higher learning, HBCUs are susceptible to so-called demographic cliffs, which reduce dramatically the number of freshman prospects available for recruitment. (An example: The 2008 recession saw a baby “bust” that could cause enrollment declines of up to 15 percent in 2025.) In fact, HBCUs are arguably more sensitive to demographic shifts than are other institutions. As reported by the American Council on Education, private HBCUs “are slightly more tuition-dependent than their non-HBCU counterparts.” Put simply, a significant number of black colleges rely on a fresh crop of 18-year-olds every fall. If the enrollment “harvest” were ever to fail, such institutions could not long endure.

The Case Against Bailouts

Though concerns such as these are entirely valid, the government should not attempt to shield HBCUs from market forces with an infinite supply of federal largesse. The case against doing so may seem insensitive, but it is built on reason rather than emotion, a correct understanding of the Constitution, and a proper grasp of historical and contemporary realities.

To begin with, let us concede that to declare every HBCU an unclosable “historical asset” is a kind of special pleading. Though a society may rightly protect the treasures of the past, not every old house can be saved, nor can every battlefield escape the plow. In the last six years alone, at least 75 American institutions of higher learning have shut their doors or merged with larger competitors. To be sure, HBCUs have played a crucial role in America’s educational history. Yet that alone does not justify granting them a status denied to other august institutions.

For those who might argue that HBCUs should be safeguarded precisely because of their race-specific missions, a second hurdle remains. While American jurisprudence has lamentably strayed from the 14th Amendment’s promise of “equal protection of the laws,” a plain reading of the Constitution precludes enriching some citizens on the basis of their skin color. Whatever a court may hold on any given day, the practice of singling out black universities, for good or ill, is a clear violation of the spirit of that text.

Finally, there is the matter of cultural evolution — the welcome and necessary elimination of bigotry in college admissions. When Cheyney University first opened its doors, African-Americans were largely barred from attending established colleges. Today, wonderfully, no such formal barriers remain, and black students have begun to vote with their feet. Between 1976 and 2020, black enrollment across all postsecondary schools more than doubled, while the percentage of black students choosing HBCUs fell by half.

Without question, this is due in part to the preferential treatment that non-HBCU institutions have long given black applicants. Yet any downscaling of affirmative action (via next year’s Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, for example) would likely bolster the fortunes of black colleges. That irony will not be presented to the justices of the Supreme Court, but it is nevertheless real.

None of this is to say, of course, that Historically Black Colleges and Universities have no role to play in the 21st century, or that black institutions should willingly close up shop. Rather, HBCUs should do everything in their power to remain as vibrant and necessary as they have always been.

In that quest, Americans of all races will cheer them on. But we shouldn’t bail them out.

Correction: This story incorrectly named Judson College as a historically black university.

Why Democrats Oppose Emancipation For The Unborn,"The end of Roe v. Wade is perhaps the greatest political and cultural event in a generation. It will change American politics forever, and — what’s more important — it will save the lives of countless unborn children. The Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs is a great victory for the U.S. Constitution, for the American people, and for justice and truth and the common good.

It is also a turning point. We should now expect Democrats and the left to call more explicitly for violence, initially against places like crisis pregnancy centers and Catholic churches, as we have already seen, and eventually against ordinary people who disagree with them. We should expect not just calls for physical attacks against the justices in the Dobbs majority, but, as we have also already seen, attempts to carry out such attacks.

This violence will likely be accompanied by rhetoric that more explicitly posits abortion not just as a positive good — “shout your abortion” — but a necessary one for women to enjoy their full rights as citizens under the Constitution. The argument, already gaining steam in public discourse, is that without a constitutional right to kill the unborn, women are relegated to a kind of second-class status, stripped of their full humanity. This rhetoric will be used in part as a justification for violence, but it also reflects the actual views of Democrats and the left on abortion.

Indeed, the very first paragraph of Justice Stephen Breyer’s dissent in Dobbs makes this claim: “Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions.” Note the phrase “full equality.” Without a right to abortion, women do not have full equality, goes the argument.

It is not the first time Democrats have asserted absolute constitutional rights that for their vindication require the total abnegation of rights or even personhood of entire classes of people. The modern Democratic Party’s stance on abortion rights is almost indistinguishable from its antebellum stance on the constitutionality of slaveowner rights.

Prior to the Civil War amendments, Democrats asserted that the inherent rights of white men, not just property rights but all of them, required the complete denial of the rights of black Americans. Today, Democrats assert that the inherent rights of women require the complete denial of the rights of the unborn.

Chief Justice Roger Taney in his infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision perhaps captured this view best when he argued that when the Founding Fathers wrote “all men are created equal,” they did not really mean it. They only meant white men are created equal. If they had really meant that all men are created equal, including black men, wrote Taney, the Founders “would have been utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the principles they asserted; and instead of the sympathy of mankind, to which they so confidently appealed, they would have deserved and received universal rebuke and reprobation.”

Taney’s view, and the view of all pro-slavery Americans at the time, was that the Constitution held no protections whatsoever for black people. They had zero rights, and indeed only the formal recognition of this could fully vindicate the constitutionally protected rights of southern slaveowners. After all, if a white man could be equal to a black man, then a white man was nothing: he could be enslaved, segregated, subjected to all the deprivations the black man was subjected to. The inherent rights of the white man depended on the denial of all rights to the black man.

That’s why, three years after the Dred Scott decision, the southern slave states seceded from the Union following the election of Abraham Lincoln. If slavery were to be curtailed or prohibited, even in the territories, southern slaveowners believed their entire way of life would be destroyed, and with it their constitutional rights. Given the stakes, and the principles in question, they felt they had no choice but to secede.

For example, Mississippi’s declaration of secession, passed on January 8, 1861, states the case plainly:

Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world… Utter subjugation awaits us in the Union, if we should consent longer to remain in it. It is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property. For far less cause than this, our fathers separated from the Crown of England.

Lawrence Keitt, a congressman from South Carolina, expressed the same idea in a speech to the U.S. House of Representatives on January 25, 1860:

African slavery is the corner-stone of the industrial, social, and political fabric of the South; and whatever wars against it, wars against her very existence. Strike down the institution of African slavery and you reduce the South to depopulation and barbarism.

Those quotes are broadly representative. Southern Democrats believed the denial of all rights to black people — and indeed the denial of their personhood — was integral to what they understood to be their constitutionally protected rights, without which they would cease to be citizens with equal rights as their northern counterparts.

The exact same thing can be said of today’s pro-abortion Democrats. They believe that the denial of all rights to the unborn is integral to what they understand to be women’s constitutionally protected rights, without which they will cease to be citizens with equal rights as their male counterparts. If women are not allowed to kill their unborn babies, they will be stripped of their full humanity, just as stripping slavery from southern whites meant, to them, stripping full humanity from white people.

The Dobbs decision and the end of Roe have exposed the Democrat view of the Constitution for what it is: not, as Frederick Douglass called it, “a glorious liberty document,” but a slave Constitution that relies for its operation on the total subjugation, indeed the extermination, of an entire class of people whose very humanity must be denied for the rights of women to be vindicated.

We should rejoice in the end of Roe, but we should also be realistic about what lies ahead. It took a civil war and three constitutional amendments to correct the Supreme Court’s error in Dred Scott. This time it took 60 million unborn dead before the Supreme Court corrected the error of Roe.

In the coming days and weeks, expect Democrats to sound the same notes of secession their forebears sounded. A constitutional order that vindicates the rights of the unborn is not a constitutional order they want to be a part of. We will hear the same arguments we heard in the 1850s and 60s, but instead of objecting to the emancipation of black Americans they will object to the emancipation of the unborn. Understand what this means. The last time Democrats openly made these kind of arguments, war soon followed.

Black Abortion Rates Are As Disproportionate As Incarceration,"Unborn black babies are aborted at the same disproportionate rate as black men are incarcerated in the United States. Black Americans make up 13 percent of the U.S. population while comprising about 38 percent of the prison population, fueling the argument by leftists that the criminal justice system is inherently unfair to blacks.

Yet black babies are aborted at more than three times the rate of white babies and constitute more than one-third of all abortions (38 percent), and their deaths are defended by leading leftists who claim to be champions for women and blacks, like Michelle Obama.

The former first lady penned a letter released upon the announcement that Roe v. Wade had been overturned by the United States Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, in which she described herself as “heartbroken” over the loss of a woman’s power to choose what happens to her own body. Her letter, however, expressed no heartbreak over the loss of little lives, particularly little black lives that also matter.

Neither Mrs. Obama nor the radical wing of the Democrat Party dares to mention the correlation between race and abortion, and race and black imprisonment.

If blacks going to prison at several times the rate of whites supports a racism thesis, would not the fact that black pregnancies are terminated at several times the rate of whites, qualify as racist too? If abortion is so empowering for black women, why aren’t more white women getting them?

Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris, and legions of radicalized Democrats continue to mischaracterize the court’s reversal as an assault on a woman’s rights, as they gloss over the more than 60 million human lives, including some 20 million black lives, lost to abortion since 1973.

In overturning Roe, the Supreme Court simply returned the issue of abortion to the people, preferring that the people, through their elected representatives, decide what to do about abortion rather than the court.

Thus Mrs. Obama, Biden, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the rest of the decidedly pro-abortion crowd can go on ignoring the disproportionate deaths of unborn black babies in states that prohibit the protection of blacks until sometime after they are born. How is it that Democrats, who claim exclusive guardianship over the welfare of blacks, can ignore the genocide of black babies before they are born?

It is no different than Democrats ignoring that 50 percent of the murder victims in the United States are black, or that these same black murder victims suffer their deaths at the hands of other blacks roughly 90 percent of the time.

It cannot be politically advantageous to black Americans, who make up only about 43 million of the U.S. population, to have lost more than 20 million in additional human capital in the name of a woman’s “right” to abortion. Black political capital is dying right along with the lost black human capital.

Yet Democrats trot out their prize heroine to show that all blacks are on board with abortion. Well, all blacks are not!

Democrats in angst over the Dobbs decision believe that aborted babies, including black babies, are something less than human requiring no protection. This would not be the first time that Democrats treated blacks as something less than human.

Why The Racist Left Smears Clarence Thomas As An ‘Angry Black Man’,"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is “a person of grievance” harboring “resentment, [and] anger,” reported no less an authority than Hillary Clinton during an appearance last week on CBS. In ignoring Thomas’s ideas to smear his temperament, Clinton pulled from the same playbook leftists have been using against Thomas since even before his 1991 confirmation hearings.

The New York Times once called Thomas the Supreme Court’s “youngest and angriest.” Times columnist Frank Rich accused him of “rage” and “unreconstructed racial bitterness.” His colleague Maureen Dowd has over the years variously described the justice as “barking mad,” dishonest, and “angry, bitter, self-pitying.” In the article, “Why Is Justice Thomas So Angry?,” CNN legal correspondent Jeffrey Toobin concludes, “His fulminations … are hurtful to the court’s mission and reputation.”

Forming something of a bitter consensus, his critics exhibit behavior every bit as intriguing as that they claim to condemn.

Let’s Go to the Source

The best place for insight into Thomas’s “anger” is with the man himself. In his autobiography, “My Grandfather’s Son,” Thomas says his bouts with anger in early life were at their most intense when, during his college years, he grew “drunk with revolutionary rhetoric.”

Black-nationalist ideas didn’t suit him long, however. As his life evolved, so did his thinking. The hostility he once directed at a racist American society for mistreating blacks found new targets.

His personal anger can be interpreted in the context of its inverse relationship with happiness. Alongside his brother, Thomas was raised by their grandfather, Myers Anderson, whom, taking after their mom, they called Daddy. A self-employed deliveryman and farmer with an inexhaustible work ethic, Thomas portrays Anderson as akin to a drill instructor.

As the price of their shelter, the two boys labored so intensively in maintaining the farm that Clarence once reminded his grandfather slavery had ended. “Not in my house,” Anderson answers. Without hard work, self-reliance was impossible, Anderson taught the boys, and only through self-reliance can men earn their freedom. That was to be his gift to them.

“He knew that to be truly free and participate fully in American life,” Thomas writes, “poor blacks had to have the tools to do for themselves.” Very few would argue that, absent this individual liberty, personal happiness is even possible.

Clarence Thomas Meets Karl Marx

Thomas credits self-reliance for his success as a student. Raised Roman Catholic, his elementary school years were spent at St. John Vianney Minor Seminary, where he excelled athletically and academically. With plans of becoming a priest, he left Georgia to attend high school at Immaculate Conception Seminary in Missouri.

After a change of heart, he returned to Georgia, where one of his grammar-school nuns persuaded him to apply to Holy Cross. Before heading back north to attend college, a friend introduced him to “The Communist Manifesto.” This introduction to Marx soon blossomed into something else.

As a child Thomas had been taught that a man’s life is his own responsibility, but according to Marxist theories of racial oppression, progress comes through “revolution.” To black nationalist Marxists, white racism explained every problem, Thomas says. It was “the trump card that won every argument.” He co-founded the Black Student Union, a leftist group whose advocacy included anti-Vietnam protesting.

At one BSU rally, he says that after the crowd worked itself into a frenzy with leftist sloganeering, “We drank our way to Harvard Square, where our disorderly parade deteriorated into a full-scale riot.” It went on through the night. After returning to campus early the next morning, Thomas became horrified: “I had let myself be swept up by an angry mob for no good reason other than that I, too, was angry.”

In the whirlwind of irrational violence, the BSU students, he realized, had perpetuated an unwelcome stereotype, that of the angry black man. This anger was sanctioned. Thomas describes black students flagrantly violating the student code of conduct and making tall demands, only for the administration to cave every time.

Black students also bonded through black-nationalist politics. Mixing radical politics with the entitlement mentality the administration encouraged quickly proved toxic. Already unprepared for living among whites, Thomas says, many of these unprepared black students gave up class in favor of drugs and “cultlike Eastern religions.” Others dropped or failed out.

Thinking Freely Makes Vicious Enemies

In his senior year, Thomas read the uber-individualist books of Ayn Rand and began questioning the groupthink of his black peers. But to embark on free thinking meant making enemies of “the government, the racists, the activists, the students, even daddy.”

Yet free thinking yielded an immediate payoff for his temperament, for he was also being liberated of ideologically imposed passions that universities countenanced: “I already knew that the rage with which we lived made it hard for us to think straight. Now I understood for the first time that we were expected to be full of rage. It was our role — but I didn’t want to play it anymore.”

Graduating cum laude in English, Thomas was accepted to Harvard Law, but opted instead for Yale, which he felt was less conservative. Yale was further down the racial-preference road than Holy Cross, which cast suspicion over the entire black student body, as author John Greenya quotes Thomas: “You had to prove yourself every day because the presumption was that you were dumb and didn’t deserve to be there on merit.”

Affirmative Action Destroys Opportunities

To put his abilities beyond doubt, Thomas eschewed classes on civil rights and constitutional law in favor of corporate, tax, and antitrust law, seeking out professors with a reputation for hostility to blacks, where he strived still. Aspiring a return to his Atlanta-area hometown where an elite law degree could be of service to needy blacks, his plans were frustrated after every application was rejected, and his anger was born anew.

“Prospective employers dismissed our grades and diplomas … assuming we got both primarily because of preferential treatment,” Thomas told the Macon Telegraph. Believing his Ivy League education was overvalued, he affixed a $.15 stamp to his degree, the value of a Yale education when it “bore the taint of racial preference.”

In The New Yorker, Toobin wonders whether Thomas overplays this notion, asserting perhaps these rejections stemmed from simple racism, the very thing “affirmative action was designed to combat.” Perhaps. But would an already racist employer be any less skeptical of a black applicant owing to admissions’ racial preferences?

‘That Stopped Me Cold’

At Yale, Thomas had worked for the social-services group New Haven Legal Assistance, where he encountered the “beneficiaries” of government welfare programs. Many of those seeking eligibility feigned poverty and victimization and called for assistance.

Thomas nonetheless believed that as American society condemned blacks to an outlook of scant hope, redressing social imbalances was legitimate government work. Around this time he happened to befriend future U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who introduced Thomas to a new set of ideas.

In a debate over whether mandating helmets for motorcyclists was meritorious policy — Thomas felt accident-related health care costs demanded such a rule — Bolton asked him: “Clarence, as a member of a group that has been treated shabbily by the majority in this country, why would you want to give the government more power over your personal life?”

“That stopped me cold,” Thomas writes:

I thought of what Daddy had said when I asked him why he’d never gone on public assistance. ‘Because it takes away your manhood,’ he said. ‘You do that and they can ask you questions about your life that are none of their business. They can come into your house when they want to, and they can tell you who else can come and go in your house.’ Daddy and John, I saw, were making the same point: real freedom meant independence from government intrusion, which in turn meant that you had to take responsibility for your own decisions. When the government assumes that responsibility, it takes away your freedom — and wasn’t freedom the very thing for which blacks in America were fighting?

Thomas’s worldview made a prodigal return “to the real world.” In many eyes, though, this made him a traitor, for it positioned him as an opponent of programs advertised as pro-black.

Clarence Thomas Meets Thomas Sowell

Thomas was soon recruited by Missouri’s attorney general, John Danforth, a Yale alum. Danforth’s Republican affiliation posed a near-crisis of conscience for a man who’d recently voted for George McGovern and felt there was no such thing as a self-respecting black Republican.

After being assured of the same treatment as every other staffer, Thomas accepted a job offer, to the derision of his Yale classmates. While the position was intellectually satisfying, its meager salary soon sent him into the private sector, where he encountered the opposite dilemma: satisfying pay but meager opportunities for intellectual challenge.

Thomas then stumbled upon a book review of Thomas Sowell’s book, “Race and Economics,” which ended with this passage:

Perhaps the greatest dilemma in the attempts to raise ethnic minority income is that those methods which have historically proved successful — self-reliance, work skills, education, business experience — are all slow developing, while those methods which are more direct and immediate — job quotas, charity, subsidies, preferential treatment — tend to undermine self-reliance and pride of achievement in the long run. If the history of American ethnic groups shows anything, it is how large a role has been played by attitudes — and particularly attitudes of self-reliance.

Finally, Thomas knew he wasn’t alone: “I felt like a thirsty man gulping down a glass of cool water.” But with newfound confidence came another challenge: Danforth had recently been elected Missouri’s junior senator and wanted Thomas to join his staff. A job that could be used to benefit other people was appealing, but Thomas knew his heretical thinking would make him a target in scandal-hungry D.C.

Being a Target Almost Scared Thomas Off

Not long into his tenure on the Hill, the Reagan administration asked if Thomas would serve as the assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education. He almost didn’t. Washington Post reporter Juan Williams had recently published an article quoting Thomas as asserting welfare ruins blacks, mentioning his sister’s experience. The torrent of criticism that followed made him think twice about accepting a prominent executive branch position.

“Having felt the lash of public criticism, I questioned whether I had the strength — or the courage — to stand in the eye of the howling storm that surrounded civil-rights policies,” he writes.

He was likewise beset when later nominated to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As chairman, Thomas oversaw a massive increase in anti-discrimination litigation, and ideologically driven attacks against his character intensified. These began exacting a toll, especially as a longstanding fondness for alcohol turned into a form of escapism. He even nursed thoughts of suicide, Thomas writes:

I [asked] myself whether I might do better to back away from my political beliefs. Life, I knew, would be so much easier if I went along with whatever was popular. What were my principles really worth to me? As I gazed out my office window at the Potomac River, the answer came instinctively: They’re worth my life. I spoke the words out loud, knowing at once that they were true.

When Thomas was later offered the nomination for Supreme Court justice, he knew it meant subjecting himself to abuse for not thinking as white senators thought black men should. He says he accepted only out of loyalty to then-President George H.W. Bush: “By then I’d shed the last of my illusions about white liberals: I knew that their broad-mindedness stopped well short of tolerating blacks who disagreed with them.”

The campaign against him featured charges of tax fraud, Confederate sympathies, anti-Semitism, patronizing a cult-like church, and, of course, sexual harassment. These wild allegations obscured the motivation behind the campaign. According to Thomas: “I refused to bow to the superior wisdom of the white liberals who thought they knew what was better for blacks. Since I didn’t know my place, I had to be put down.”

‘A Few Crumbs from the White Man’s Table’

For noting the correlation between welfare services and an entitlement mentality, Thomas has endured beyond-the-pale personal attacks. After defending himself against a Playboy article (“Reagan and the Revival of Racism”) with a letter to the editor, the article’s white author responded: “As a Southerner, Mr. Thomas is surely familiar with those ‘chicken-eating preachers’ who gladly parroted the segregationists’ line in exchange for a few crumbs from the white man’s table. He’s one of the few left in captivity.”

Not even civil-rights leaders criticized this racist broadside. “What I found inexplicable,” Thomas writes, “was that so many of the people who went out of their way to tell me how strongly they disapproved of my views seemed to think that the mere act of pointing out the human damage caused by welfare policies was wrong in and of itself. Would they have felt the same way if I’d said that I was opposed to drunk driving because my sister had been hit by a drunk driver?”

In Grutter v. Bollinger, a 2003 Supreme Court case that upheld the constitutionality of the University of Michigan Law School’s admissions policies that favored some races over others, Thomas issued a dissent imbued with personal experience:

The majority of blacks are admitted to the Law School because of discrimination, and because of this policy all are tarred as undeserving. This problem of stigma does not depend on determinacy as to whether those stigmatized are actually the ‘beneficiaries’ of racial discrimination. When blacks take positions in the highest places of government, industry, or academia, it is an open question today whether their skin color played a part in their advancement. The question itself is the stigma — because either racial discrimination did play a role, in which case the person may be deemed ‘otherwise unqualified,’ or it did not, in which case asking the question itself unfairly marks those blacks who would succeed without discrimination.

After this decision New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd said Thomas’s failure to appreciate racial preferences was hypocritical: “It’s impossible not to be disgusted at someone who could benefit so much from affirmative action and then pull up the ladder after himself.” Toobin abused Thomas as a race traitor for his “intense resentment of efforts to help African-Americans.”

In 2002, five black law professors at the University of North Carolina boycotted a Thomas appearance, claiming: “[A]s a justice, he not only engages in acts that harm other African Americans like himself, but also gives aid, comfort, and racial legitimacy to acts and doctrines of others that harm African Americans unlike himself — that is, those who have not yet reaped the benefits of civil rights laws, including affirmative action, and who have not yet received the benefits of the white-conservative sponsorships that now empower him.”

Is the ‘Angry Black Man’ a Projection?

How could good-faith efforts at furthering blacks’ progress be met with such derision? Much of it stems from his critics’ perception of what motivates his opposition to their social-engineering experiments. Toobin, Dowd, and others ascribe this heterodoxy to a perceived servility to “powerful” “conservative” elites.

Dowd, imagining herself as Thomas, wrote of his opinion in Bush v. Gore: “I used to have grave reservations about working at white institutions, subject to the whims of white superiors. But when Poppy’s whim was to crown his son — one of those privileged Yale legacy types I always resented — I had to repay The Man for putting me on the court even though I was neither qualified nor honest … But having the power to carjack the presidency and control the fate of the country did give me that old X-rated tingle.”

Others interpret Thomas as an ideological devotee to the take-it-as-it-comes judicial philosophy sometimes called “originalism” — a notion he’d reject.

“A philosophy that is imposed from without instead of arising organically from day-to-day engagement with the law isn’t worth having,” he writes. “Such a philosophy runs the risk of becoming an ideology, and I’d spent much of my adult life shying away from abstract ideological theories that served only to obscure the reality of life as it’s lived.”

Still, Thomas’s Supreme Court career is often blithely dismissed as the work of his ideological puppeteer, Scalia, supposedly because they often vote alike. In fact, according to ABC legal correspondent Jan Crawford Greenburg’s book “Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story for Control of the United States Supreme Court,” it is Scalia who often changed his opinions to more closely reflect Thomas’s.

In 2005, University of Iowa Law Professor Angela Onwuachi-Willig reported the court’s leftist justices were more likely to vote alike than Thomas and Scalia did, “with Justice Ginsburg agreeing in full with Justice Souter 85% of the time, Justice Souter agreeing with Justice Stevens 77% of the time, and Justice O’Connor agreeing with Chief Justice Rehnquist 79% of the time while Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia agreed in full only 73% of time.”

This notion that blacks choose not to think for themselves is not entirely foreign to these critics; The Times’s Dowd and Rich have joked that blacks who spoke at the Republican 2000 convention participated in a “minstrel show.”

It’s Old Racism in New Clothes

Thomas’s own explanation for his ideas is less conspiratorial. He thinks too many of these policies are premised on the idea that blacks are an inferior race. In 1995, the Supreme Court heard Missouri v. Jenkins, where the Kansas City school district was attempting to, in part, correct racial imbalances by opening schools catering to whites in a neighborhood they had long ago abandoned. In a concurring opinion, Thomas writes:

It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are willing to assume that anything that is predominately black must be inferior. Instead of focusing on remedying the harm done to those black schoolchildren injured by segregation, the District Court here sought to convert the Kansas City, Missouri, School District (KCMSD) into a ‘magnet district’ that would reverse the ‘white flight’ caused by desegregation. … Racial isolation itself not a harm; only state-enforced segregation is. After all, if separation is a harm, and if integration therefore is the only way that blacks can receive a proper education, then there must be something inferior about blacks. Under this theory, segregation injures blacks because blacks, when left on their own, cannot achieve.

It’s unclear whether affirmative action supporters’ professed ideal of racial equality better represents their actual thinking than preferences’ implications of black inferiority. President Biden certainly didn’t help the former case when he speculated aloud to The Washington Post about why Iowa’s public schools outperform D.C.’s: “There’s less than 1 percent of the population of Iowa that is African American. There is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities. What is in Washington? So look, it goes back to what you start off with, what you’re dealing with.” More recently Biden said, “Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”

Hurting Black Kids to Make White Adults Feel Better

The preoccupation with means over ends exacts a toll on blacks, says Thomas. By pursuing busing programs meant to intermix students usually at the expense of quality education, blacks are essentially being used as guinea pigs in the experiments of white social scientists. This not only is demoralizing, but suggests that without whites, blacks are hopeless.

Once more, blacks become reliant on whites, and a theory that tacitly assumes black inferiority helps make it real. A 2019 Pew Research Center poll finds that, with the Great Society 57 years deep, black Americans are historically pessimistic, with more than 80 percent viewing their race as an impediment. Curiously, the more educated the respondent, the more likely he was to see his race as an obstacle, and half say America will never achieve racial equity.

Whites, too, see less progress, per Pew, but are twice as likely to be optimistic. This suggests efforts at racial redress atone for white guilt twice as well as they do boosting black progress. For this reason, Thomas sometimes says, racial preferences are intended more for their sponsors than their recipients.

Perhaps conventional repulsion for Republicans explains why more blacks haven’t had similar re-appraisals to the government’s efforts to improve their lot. While skepticism of government social work may well be an aspect of conservative political philosophy, for Thomas, it’s merely an affirmation of his life’s experiences. He is “conservative,” in other words, because he is black.

I Don’t Care What You Think. I Think for Myself

And it no longer matters what anybody says, a declaration he made in a 1998 Memphis speech. Speaking before the National Bar Association, a black lawyers group, Thomas did not apologize for his heretical beliefs. Instead, he said this:

I have come here today, not in anger or to anger, though my mere presence has been sufficient, obviously, to anger some. Nor have I come to defend my views, but rather to assert my right to think for myself, to refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though I was an intellectual slave because I’m black. I come to state that I am a man, free to think for myself and do as I please. I have come to assert that I am a judge and I will not be consigned the unquestioned opinions of others.

This attitude is clearly unhelpful to those promoting preferences. Thomas, after all, is right: Racial preferences tar reputations. He has achieved the uttermost prominence, yet no matter what he achieves, it seems, his critics still argue he owes everything to preferences.

Dowd began an article, “He knew he could not make a powerful legal argument against racial preferences, given the fact that he got into Yale Law School and got picked for the Supreme Court thanks to his race.” Of Thomas’s nomination to the EEOC, Toobin says, “Though Thomas doesn’t say so directly, it’s clear he was given the job because he was black.”

Stripping pride from a man’s achievements is certainly an indecent thing. One wonders how Toobin would feel if it were constantly alleged that the only reason he got his job at CNN was because he’s a dyed-blue-in-the-wool Democrat. And how would Dowd respond to accusations that the only reason she owns premier real estate on The New York Times editorial page is because she’s a woman?

This claim effectively imparts ownership of racial-preference recipients’ achievements to those administering these programs. If that’s the choice — diminished personal sovereignty, or liberty — Thomas would rather be free, even if it means he fails. This is why Thomas began his Grutter v. Michigan opinion with a quote from his hero, Frederick Douglass:

Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are worm-eaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! … And if the negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone! … [Y]our interference is doing him positive injury.

Thomas’s life has been a struggle to stand alone, and he knows there are others. He’s long nursed an urge to return to Georgia and help his old neighborhood. At a book-signing party, he was asked whether he’d prefer any job over his current assignment. He could think of only one: “a small or medium-sized business” somewhere in the South where he could “be a part of my community.”

Thomas has often passed up these opportunities on the belief that positions of greater prominence held greater capacity for reform. Yet each step has met ever greater condemnation — sometimes infected with accusations of racial traitorship, always leading to the same regrettable conclusion: Black minds aren’t ready to be free.

But having untangled himself from the pull-strings of racial groupthink, leftist social dogma, political ideology, and popular opinion, Thomas was recently able to proclaim himself “the freest man on the court.” It’s this, his intellectual emancipation, that most infuriates his leftist critics. In proving their entire worldview fraudulent, Thomas continues to attract racist abuse because that’s all they have left to hurl.

Witnessing the way white progressives resort to racism the moment a black man breaks free from his intellectual shackles, surely younger black thinkers will realize there’s no value in accepting a set of beliefs simply because they were born a certain race. That would surely make Justice Thomas happy.

Jayland Walker Was Not An ‘Unarmed Black Man’,"In this week’s edition of “George Floyd is Jesus and All Cops Are Pigs…”

The Akron, Ohio, police department on Sunday released camera footage showing the deadly pursuit and shooting of 25-year-old black man Jayland Walker. Naturally, more “mostly peaceful” protests followed (that ridiculous phrase was used verbatim in The Washington Post) along with media coverage framing the incident as another unarmed-black-man-gunned-down-by-police story.

NBC News: “Ohio police officers shot fleeing Black man dozens of times, lawyer says.”

New York Times: “Videos of Jayland Walker Shooting by Police Raise More Questions.”

Washington Post: “Akron police release video of officers shooting Black man dozens of times.”

PBS: “After police kill unarmed Black man Jayland Walker, Akron police release bodycam footage.”

MSNBC: “Protesters demand justice after bodycam video released shows fatal shooting of Jayland Walker.”

To their credit, the media got at least some things right. Walker was “fleeing” when he was shot. He was hit apparently “dozens” of times. But Walker’s story is less about racial injustice and more about: Attempting to evade police in a high-speed chase while firing a gun endangers the lives of countless innocent people, and getting shot for it is sometimes a thing that happens.

In the early morning hours of June 27, law enforcement attempted to stop Walker for an unspecified traffic violation. He floored it, reaching up to 85 miles per hour in a 35-miles-per-hour zone, according to police body camera footage. Surveillance video and body camera audio show Walker firing a gun out the driver’s window. After several minutes of the high-speed chase, which climaxed in a residential neighborhood, Walker exited the still-moving vehicle from the passenger door, his face covered in a black ski mask, and continued his attempt to escape by foot.

Police first tried subduing Walker with tasers but were unsuccessful. After merely seconds into the chase, according to camera footage and police testimony, Walker turned toward the cops and that’s when he was fired upon multiple times by eight officers.

Authorities said he sustained as many as 60 injuries, though it remains unclear how many were bullet wounds.

An attorney for Walker’s family told The Washington Post, “I ask you, as he’s running away, what is reasonable? To gun him down? No, that’s not reasonable.”

So here we go. Rioters took to the streets in Akron, shouting, knocking over police barriers, and lighting a dumpster on fire. All because Democrat mayors, governors, and attorneys general have insisted for two years now that crime be legalized.

As was the case with Andrew Brown in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, last year, Walker was not simply trying to escape an arrest. He was recklessly maneuvering a vehicle in ways that jeopardized his own life, the lives of the police, and the lives of any potential pedestrians, including children. Even worse than in the Brown case, Walker fired a gun in the chase. Police found the firearm and a loaded magazine in his car.

True, Walker didn’t have the gun when he began his foot race, but why should that make a difference? Describing him as “unarmed” because he, unknown to police, tossed his gun is like describing Joe Biden as a “genius” because he trashed his press conference notecard instructions after having read them.

Evading police in a high-speed chase is, in every way, a highly dangerous and potentially violent crime. A child walking home in her own neighborhood could have been killed, thanks to Walker’s choice to speed off into the darkness. Again, he reached up to 85 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone.

It’s long past time for the media and the Black Lives Matter crew to give up the knee-jerk reaction to defend every single black male who puts everyone in danger by fleeing the police — unarmed or, in this case, not.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/06/jayland-walker-was-not-an-unarmed-black-man/,2022-07-06
NAACP To Black LG Winsome Sears: You’re A 'Pawn' In White Supremacy,"On May 10, Virginia’s newly elected Lt. Governor Winsome Sears released an amicus curiae brief siding with a fairer, merit-based admission system and limiting affirmative action programs.

Sears showed support for the Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) vs. Harvard and SFFA vs. University of North Carolina cases, in which SFFA sued both universities for unlawfully discriminating against Asian American applicants in violation of Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance (Harvard receives at least $500 million annually).

Under current precedent, universities are legally allowed to use racial preferences in admissions in order to ensure “diversity” on campus, an allowance that highly disadvantages qualified Asian applicants. Sears also argued the Supreme Court should overturn the case Grutter vs. Bollinger, which ruled that Michigan Law School’s use of racial preferences in admissions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Essentially, Sears filed to eliminate race as a factor in admissions evaluations. “The right to a good education doesn’t come at the expense of denying another the right as well… We are not about to deny educational rights to Asian children. Rather, we are to ensure that all children have access to educational opportunities,” Sears said in a press release.

Sears is very courageous to explicitly protect Asian Americans from being unfairly penalized in the admission process, as Asian students have been the ones most negatively affected by affirmative action. It’s a reasonable statement — students should be evaluated for their endeavors in and outside the classroom, instead of uncontrollable factors such as race.

NAACP’s Response

However, the Virginia NAACP, the state’s “largest nonpartisan civil rights organization in the Commonwealth,” attacked Sears for advocating that merit should be valued over race. On May 14, the NAACP released a statement claiming that overturning Grutter vs. Bollinger will hinder minority access to education and that “mass incarceration” of minorities and “opportunity gaps” in K-12 education proves there is an ongoing racism problem in America. Amy Tillerson-Brown, chair of the Education Committee for the Virginia NAACP, stated in response to the Sears amicus curiae: “Any American who values racial equity or opportunity, should not allow themselves to be used as pawns in the larger game of White supremacy.”

Tillerson-Brown seems to be implying that Sears, a black woman, is in fact a “pawn” in the white supremacist agenda. This is, of course, a ludicrous idea in the sense that all Sears is really advocating for is to stop racism, particularly against qualified Asian and white candidates who just want to be judged in admissions based on their individual merit.

This is not the first time prominent liberal organizations like the NAACP have gone after black Americans who step out of line. Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley is one of the most notorious mind guards of her party. She says about black nonconformists: “We don’t need black faces that don’t want to be a black voice.” Of course, to Pressley, being a black voice means voting and advocating according to the way Pressley wants you to vote. This is not about black representation, but the raw power of the identity politics lobby.

Sears Says Affirmative Action Has Morphed

Sears pushes back against the idea that she is in any way endangering the interests of black Americans, saying that affirmative action was a policy first championed by a Republican, President Richard Nixon, and that its goal was “to give everyone an opportunity” to prove themselves on their merits, regardless of race. She maintains that the original intention was to facilitate equal opportunity: “don’t give the white candidate the better opportunity, don’t give the black candidate the better opportunity,” she said in an interview.

However, now affirmative action have morphed into something else. “It’s morphed now into a quota system,” Sears says.

In fact, so blatant is the quota system nature of affirmative action today that there have been multiple lawsuits filed by qualified candidates for being rejected from higher educational opportunities for their race in the name of “diversity.” Take the Harvard case, for example. The Asian Americans suing Harvard simply want the college to admit students based on applicants’ academic and extracurricular achievements, and not for uncontrollable factors, such as race. Yet Harvard argues that they should be able to cut Asians from the applicant pool for the sake of “diversity,” which one estimate shows has decreased the Asian population at Harvard by as much as 50 percent.

True Equality

Do American admissions systems really advance white supremacy when they objectively disadvantage white and Asian applicants via affirmative action? The answer is no — valuing applicants’ past achievements and their endeavors is not white supremacy, and in fact, valuing individual merit advances true racial equality, which is judgment based on individual characteristics regardless of race.

The NAACP “remains committed to protesting any efforts to disable educational access for minority citizens who are guaranteed equal protection under the law.” However, where was the protest for SFFA vs. Harvard? Where was the outcry for qualified Asian students who may have lost their spots in the name of “diversity” to satisfy a racial quota? Sears courageously chose to side with Asian Americans to protect them from policies that penalize them in college admissions. The NAACP reacted by calling her a “pawn” in white supremacy.

Asian American students do not uphold white supremacy nor take away educational opportunities from other minority students. Affirmative action only causes students of different races to be put up against each other and be evaluated for factors they have no control over for a “diverse student body.” Advocating for policies that discriminate against Asian students is not going to help the cause of minority solidarity or minority rights. Instead, it will only create more unnecessary friction between the races in an America that could use as little of that as possible.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/08/when-black-lt-gov-winsome-sears-tried-to-help-purge-racism-from-school-admissions-naacp-called-her-a-pawn-in-white-supremacy/,2022-07-08
"As We Become Harder To Shock, 'The Black Phone' Thrills With Simplicity","Some spoilers.

Anticipation grows as “the Grabber” walks into his basement dungeon where he stores his kidnapped victims. But when half of his mask is removed and the audience sees that it’s Ethan Hawke, the tension eases. “The Black Phone” isn’t much like Hawke’s other famed works (including the “Before Sunrise” trilogy), that’s for sure.

In his first villain role, Hawke plays the part of a serial killer known as the Grabber, a magician who snatches neighborhood kids up in a black van. Audiences watch Finney Shaw, the killer’s most recent would-be victim, as he struggles to escape his captivity. His holy grail is a disconnected phone mounted to the wall through which the spirits of past victims communicate with him.

“The Black Phone,” directed by Scott Derrickson and written by C. Robert Cargill, is an expansion upon Joe Hill’s 2005 original short story. Similar to the horror stories of killers like John Wayne Gacy, “The Black Phone” isn’t a new story. And yet, the film currently holds an 82 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has been received well by audiences. What’s so special?

It’s the film’s supposed simplicity.

After seeing “The Black Phone,” I was left with a feeling of unconnected dots. The film wraps up with the Grabber meeting his end, but there is no backstory. No deep dive into the killer’s history. No breakdown of his family dynamic or disastrous romantic sagas. Instead, audiences are left with a classic story of good versus evil with the good prevailing in the end. The only characters given backstory are the victims. There is no attempt to drastically humanize the Grabber.

As a consumer of a lot of true crime media, it’s only natural for me to want more from a story like “The Black Phone.” From podcasts to Netflix series, the modern wave of true crime media has created a strong desire for logic within evil. A large part of consuming this type of content is a need to make sense of the senseless. If we study enough cases, perhaps we can prevent future ones from happening. An even bigger factor in this equation is the shock factor.

Thriller and horror films have been around for decades. The thrill of being scared and getting that adrenaline boost are not new desires. It’s only with the dawn of the internet that those desires get trickier. With the amount of content bombarding us on the daily, there’s a certain universal numbness that has an iron grip on us. Whether it’s terrorist organizations posting beheading videos on YouTube, unrestricted internet access to hardcore pornography, or the ability to look up anything you desire, “shock factor” is more arbitrary than ever.

Even within the film industry itself, mainstream horror films are more intense and graphic. Audiences seem to be waiting for the next film to be even fouler than the ones before. While this poses a dilemma for filmmakers and writers, it also opens a huge opportunity for creativity. This dilemma can be seen as a challenge: a challenge to do more with less and still accomplish the same effect.

This is why “The Black Phone” has been received so well. It offers a simpler story without losing any of its spark or edge. Don’t get me wrong, there are a few graphic scenes — the movie is still a “scary movie.” But instead of relying on gore or audiences’ empathy, it offers us a story in which good triumphs over evil with zero wiggle room for the latter.

The film’s nuance emerges in its details surrounding abuse, trauma, and connectivity. Finney’s life is characterized by violence even before he is kidnapped. Whether it’s intense bullying in the schoolyard or the abuse inflicted by his alcoholic father, Finney’s character development is quick. He is forced to be an adult before his voice has even dropped.

With the help of a spiritual realm, the preteens of “The Black Phone” lead this story. From Finney’s clairvoyant sister Gwen leading the investigation to the deceased victims giving him clues to escape, the connectivity of the young characters adds both an endearing and haunting element to the film. The adults are consistently out-of-touch. Cops won’t listen. The dad is never without a belt or a bottle in hand. The Grabber doesn’t know how to deal with a competent hostage. Peer support and faith in whatever powers-that-be are what prevail in the end.

“The Black Phone” is the perfect example of a thriller that eloquently tells a story without saying that much. All viewers need to do is pick up the phone.

Leftists Are Trying To Redefine Race Riots As Righteous Rebellions,"A St. Louis man was recently found guilty of murdering David Dorn, a retired police captain, during the riots and looting that broke out in the summer of 2020. But that doesn’t mean the wounds this country endured during that summer are healing. In fact, many on the left are actively working on gaslighting the American public about the nature of these riots and redefining the role that race riots play in our collective history.

The latest effort may be found in Elizabeth Hinton’s book, “America on Fire.” Hinton says the African American riots of the 1960s were really political protests. In fact, she goes much further and claims that all of the predominantly black disturbances since the ’60s were revolts against racial injustice. “The so-called urban riots from the 1960s to the present,” she says, “can only be properly understood as rebellions.”

This claim has won approval from the leftist media, and it might resonate with those who are intuitively sympathetic to the long black struggle for equal treatment, but it simply does not square with the facts.

Some of the more significant mass violence events were anguished cries in response to shocking events. The assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968, which touched off a spasm of violence, was one such event. In that same category are the fatal police beating of a black businessman in Miami in 1980 and the brutal police assault on Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1992. One can debate whether the behaviors during the ensuing mass violence in Miami and Los Angeles should be called “riots.” However, the assault on innocents and the wanton destruction of property give credence to the designation.

It is nonetheless true that perceived racial injustices triggered these events. The same could be said about the violent events following the death of George Floyd in 2020. But going back to the events of the late 1960s, most disturbances had no clear cause or the incidents that triggered them were utterly banal and the responses totally disproportionate.

In one of the worst disturbances in 1967 in Detroit, where 43 people died in four nightmarish days of turmoil, the trigger was a police raid on a club serving alcohol after 2 a.m. in violation of state law. The club was located in a dingy second-floor apartment in a rundown black area of the city and had been raided several times before without incident. But it was unusually hot and crowded on the Saturday night when the violence began, and the raid ended in a melee. Crowds quickly formed outside as the arrestees were removed and two black youths urged the onlookers to violence. By 6 a.m., 30 windows had been broken, and looting had begun. The first store victimized was the black-owned Hardy’s Drug Store. By 8 a.m., the mob had swelled to 3,000, and the outnumbered police did nothing to stop the spreading window breaking and theft. Ultimately, 2,500 stores were looted, burned, or destroyed. Subsequent charges of police brutality during the raid never were substantiated.

Was this a rebellion? Clearly not. Whatever the initial resentment of the police raid, the subsequent behavior, mostly stealing and burning, was unquestionably a riot or a rampage without any political message. And there were hundreds more just like it in this period. A careful quantitative analysis by Susan Olzak and Suzanne Shanahan found that 60 percent of these events “had no clear-cut target or symbol,” and only 27 percent were in response to some police incident. Furthermore, another quantitative study found that economic conditions bore no relation to the disturbances. In his classic study of disorders in 673 cities between 1961 and 1968, Seymour Spilerman found that no deprivation factors were positively or strongly related to the violence.

The looting and burning of shops were not unusual behaviors in many of the areas where these violent events occurred. In Detroit, two-thirds of all arrests were for theft. In Newark, more than $8 million in inventory was lost due to stealing and damage to stock.

A quantitative study of shopkeepers in riot areas found that the rioters were selective, targeting the better quality stores. The quality of the merchandise had more salience in explaining the choice of targets than any other factor, including retaliation for perceived abuse by the merchant or sheer proximity to the civil disorder. Setting shops ablaze was common during the riots. In 1967 and 1968 alone, there were over 10,600 arson incidents. Even black store ownership afforded no protection. Approximately 27 percent of the stores destroyed in Detroit were owned by African Americans.

The 1960s were a period of great ferment when the youth of the day (the same Baby Boomers who are now passing from the scene) dominated both demographically and culturally. There were countless protests against the Vietnam War and overt Jim Crow racism. This rebellious atmosphere surely had something to do with urban violence.

But for African Americans, it also was a period of tremendous progress in terms of rights and economic benefits. Black family income had doubled since 1940. By 1970, black unemployment had fallen to a mere 4.2 percent, and poverty levels had sunk to 34 percent of the population. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations fully supported civil rights laws and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dealt a mortal blow to Jim Crow. Congress then passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ensuring African American influence in the political system. Johnson also got Congress to adopt his War on Poverty legislation which was intended to primarily benefit low-income African Americans. What a strange time for a “rebellion” If there was a broader underlying cause, raised expectations of immediate material gain is the most likely candidate.

Young black radicals espousing revolution provided a rationalization for the disturbances. H. Rap Brown, Stokely Carmichael, and the Black Panthers reaped great media attention with their inflammatory remarks. But they did not gain much traction with the average African American. When Carmichael spoke at Detroit’s Cobo Arena one year before the riot, 500-600 people heard him denounce moderate civil rights groups. Only a month earlier, Dr. King had preached nonviolence in the same 12,000-seat hall to a standing-room-only crowd. And in a 1968 poll of more than 5,000 people in 15 big cities found that only 15 percent of black respondents favored violence to gain rights, whereas 39 percent preferred laws and persuasion, and 38 percent favored nonviolent protest. Moreover, 90 percent of African Americans did not think that police brutality caused riots.

It’s understandable that the black public didn’t endorse violence. They paid a terrible price for the disorders. One careful analysis of the period 1964 through 1971 counted an extraordinary 752 riots, resulting in 228 deaths, 12,741 injuries, 69,099 arrests, and 15,835 incidents of arson. And this does not address the enormous monetary loss: the total destruction of businesses, mostly small shops; the concomitant loss of jobs; the millions expended by all levels of government in attempts to control the mayhem; and the millions more lost in tax revenues. Cities like Detroit and Newark took decades to recover; some say they never really recovered.

When the facts of mass violence are studied without ideological assumptions, the complexities become apparent. No one cause fits all, and the claim that they are all rebellions for racial justice is belied by the historical details.

Media Ignore Muslim Mayor's Racism And Alleged Election Fraud,"The mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, Ameer Haiderah Ghalib, was recently exposed for mocking black political demonstrations and endorsing comments that referred to African Americans as “animal” and “inhuman.” He also accused Arab world leaders of being secret Jews and “liked” a Facebook post calling Jews “monkeys” who tax “the air we breathe.”

Ghalib, the first Muslim mayor in Hamtramck’s 100-year history, even admitted to committing a potential case of voter fraud by filling out absentee ballots for about 20 families during the 2020 presidential primary. Both the FBI and the Michigan secretary of state’s office have looked into the allegation.

Yet, in the era of “cancel culture,” when activist reporters have all but abandoned investigative reporting in favor of opinionated call-outs, not a column inch has been devoted to documenting the misdeeds of an internationally known public official. Black political activists have failed to march a single city block in opposition to Ghalib’s anti-black racism, and Jewish rights organizations are silent in the face of antisemitic dog whistles.

Ghalib’s ability to escape consequences for statements that would ruin another elected official — or for that matter, a private citizen — is indicative of a broader societal trend that privileges Islamists and lets them off the hook for bad behavior.

Recent history presents many examples. Islamists who slander Jews or call for their extermination are offered jobs on government anti-racism commissions. Muslim extremists whose social media accounts are littered with anti-black commentary have been invited to speak at Black Lives Matter rallies or selected to host discussions on Muslim-black solidarity.

Ghalib is no exception. The 42-year-old Caribbean medical school student shared an offensive meme on Facebook that is frequently traded in white supremacist chat rooms and racist message boards. The image portrayed an African American overloaded with liquor bottles after presumably looting stores during the George Floyd protests.

Ghalib captioned the meme to suggest that the black man, whom he calls “Mr. Heineken,” considered looting alcohol a “duty” to acquire “essential nutrition.” He endorsed comments in the same thread describing African Americans as alcoholics who “will never behave unless they are governed by law, force, and the police who know them very well.”

Since Ghalib’s offensive statements were first published in an article at Focus on Western Islamism, a specialty news publication from the Middle East Forum (MEF), Detroit-area print and television media have been entirely uninterested in the story. In fact, MEF even tried prior to publication to hand over screenshots and professional translations of Ghalib’s posts to local and national media, granting exclusive rights to the story without any takers.

When it comes to anti-black racism, no town is too small and no politician is too insignificant for the media to splash career-ending headlines across their front pages. At least, this was the case recently for mayors in Clarke, New Jersey, and East Hampton, Massachusetts, who provoked frenzied news coverage of their racially insensitive comments.

In May, a city councilor from Everett, Massachusetts, was outed for sharing an anti-black meme and exchanging racist text messages with a city employee. Local high school students walked out of class in protest, and the pair resigned in shame.

Why, then, do Ghalib and other Islamists get a free pass?

There were high hopes for Hamtramck after its citizens elected the first all-Muslim city council in American history. The town motto: “The world in two square miles,” reflects Hamtramck’s diverse cultural landscape, where the remaining Polish families mix with more recently settled Bangladeshi and Yemeni immigrants.

In this manner, Hamtramck is a proving ground for progressive multiculturalism. To acknowledge the mayor’s bigotry is to recognize that some ideologies from the Middle East and South Asia are undesirable, such as Arab discrimination of black Yemenis, who are treated as second-class citizens and confined to menial, low-paying jobs.

In addition, Ghalib fails to fit a carefully cultivated narrative peddled by Islamist “civil rights” groups and recognized as canon by the left: Muslims are the victims, never the perpetrators, of bigotry and xenophobia. They face daily harassment from government authorities, right-wing bigots, and Zionist Jews, according to Islamists that claim to document so-called “Islamophobia.”

Some celebrities and journalists even claim, “Muslim is the new black,” a tone-deaf and offensive refrain that demonstrates just how far identity politics inform views of the Muslim American experience. As a result, there is little interest in holding Ghalib accountable for his racist views.

This stark indifference extends beyond the media to government institutions and nonprofits expected to protect minorities from discrimination. Hamtramck’s all-Muslim city council has so far refused to discuss the matter publicly, even as Ghalib decries the “racist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic people” who dared to expose him.

Meanwhile, Hamtramck’s own chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is keeping quiet as well. The chapter was not established by an African American, but by a Bangladeshi Muslim with a history of anti-gay bigotry.

Black activist groups in surrounding Detroit, including the NAACP and Black Lives Matter, have failed to respond to official complaints regarding the mayor’s racist comments, and the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish watchdog group with offices in Michigan, has refused to comment.

Where does this leave Hamtramck’s African American community, a group that has endured discrimination from city leaders going back to the 1960s, when urban revitalization projects intentionally forced out dozens of black families? With just two black city council members in the past century, black Hamtramckans have lacked the representation necessary to assert themselves politically.

Furthermore, if the establishment media and civil rights organizations are unwilling to stand up to the mayor, who will hold him responsible for potentially committing multiple cases of voter fraud?

“I did my duty and voted early for [Senator Bernie] Sanders. There were twenty people around me planning to vote for [Joe] Biden because they loved Obama…” Ghalib wrote on March 8, 2020. “I got them to vote for Sanders and did their families’ ballot cards myself. Pray for the Jewish guy, don’t let him down,” he joked, apparently pointing out the irony that he would support a Jewish political candidate.

In Michigan, it is a felony to influence an absentee voter who is filling out their ballot. It is also illegal when completing another person’s absentee ballot to instruct them on how to vote.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel recently prosecuted a grandmother for filling out her grandson’s absentee ballot. With so much attention directed at Michigan elections in recent years, Ghalib’s shocking admission should be enough to warrant at least a passing mention in Detroit newspapers.

Then again, perhaps this explains why reporters are unmoved. Pointing to Ghalib’s racist online statements requires also mentioning his alleged election abuses, and there is a concerted effort among establishment newsrooms to downplay and ignore allegations of voting irregularities — however insignificant — especially among immigrant communities and non-citizens.

Ultimately, activist and media indifference to Ghalib’s Facebook posts provides a pessimistic outlook on the future of social justice, racial equality, and election integrity in Detroit and Hamtramck. Equally troubling, it shows that there is little pressure for Islamists to abandon radical and supremacist views.

Even More Evidence The 1619 Project Lies About History,"In August, history professor James H. Sweet wrote that the 1619 Project illustrated the problem of “presentism” in history. In an American Historical Association essay, “Is History History?” he argued The New York Times’s 1619 Project looks at “the past through the prism of contemporary social justice issues—race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, capitalism.”

Sweet almost immediately found himself attacked by a mob of historians for not adhering to the standards of “presentism.” He quickly groveled with a public apology and a walkback of his gentle initial observations.

Yet he wasn’t wrong at all. To make the case that all white people should pay black people for what the 1619 Project calls (white) America’s “Original Sin” of slavery, one needs to present all white people as complicit in the enterprise and all black people as innocent and blameless victims. Certainly, the false idea that slavery was unique to America and practiced only by white people is a commonly held belief.

1619 Project creator Nikole Hannah-Jones is not a historian, but a journalist specializing in race issues. So she might be excused for not knowing about the African role in the slave trade, the ubiquitous nature of slavery throughout history (in which no ethnic groups, races, or faiths are exempt), and the fact that many free black people also owned slaves. But Hannah-Jones does not accept correction; she attacks every critic as a racist or race traitor.

As I’ve learned from researching for my new book, “Debunking The 1619 Project,” Hannah-Jones knowingly presents falsehoods about American history and slavery, such as that all white people are morally culpable for slavery and that all black people are blameless. In this episode, she helped the Twitter mob pile onto Sweet, while making the very same point for which he was being attacked.

Hannah-Jones revealed in a Los Angeles Times interview that her favorite novel was “The Known World” by Edward Jones, which is about a black slave-owning family in antebellum Virginia. So she’s aware black slave ownership happened. Yet she insulted and then blocked me on Twitter when I pointed out the racially inconvenient fact that a significant percentage of free black Americans owned slaves. That was one of two lies I have caught her in.

After she blocked me, she scolded another tweeter who complained that the left sees American “exceptionalism” in the practice of slavery as “uniquely or distinctly American.” “You should do more reading,” she lectured. “Because there is a difference between a society that permits slavery and engages in slavery, and a slave society, where the entire society is organized around slavery.”

She pointed out that what made American slavery “exceptional” was that “American slavery took place in the only country FOUNDED on the God-given equality and rights of mankind.” She mocked the idea of “using 1,000-year-old history to justify downplaying 150-year-old history”—an admission that American slavery is deliberately being presented in isolation and therefore distortedly.

One of Sweet’s thought crimes had been criticizing the claim of the forthcoming movie, “The Woman King” that “Dahomey’s female warriors and King Ghezo fought the European slave trade.” Sweet, a specialist in African history, pointed out that, on the contrary, “they promoted it” (emphasis added).

While Hannah-Jones was retweeting attacks on Sweet, she was also commenting on “The Woman King.” She noted, “It will be interesting to see how a movie that seems to glorify an all-female military unit of the Dahomey deals with the fact that this kingdom derived its wealth from capturing Africans for the Trans-Atlantic slave trade.”

Some commentators on Hannah-Jones’s thread mentioned Zora Neale Hurston’s “Barracoon: The Story of the Last ‘Black Cargo,’” which was based on Hurston’s interviews in 1927 and 1928 with Cudjo Lewis, one of the last survivors of a cargo of slaves brought to American shores illegally in 1860. He had been captured at the age of 19 in a raid employing female warriors from Dahomey—the very subjects of “The Woman King.”

As I discuss in “Debunking The 1619 Project,” Cudjo, of “the Isha subgroup of the Yoruba people of West Africa,” then known by his native name, Kossola, had been undergoing initiation for marriage when his town of Bantѐ was raided in the early morning hours “by Dahomey’s female warriors, who slaughtered [townspeople] in their daze.’”

As Hurston recorded, Cudjo Lewis’s account tells of seeing the severed and rotting heads of family members and being “yoked by forked sticks and tied in a chain” with other villagers on a three-day march to the stockades at Abomey. He was then incarcerated in the barracoons at Ouidah. She commented, “Kossula was no longer on the porch with me. He was squatting about that fire in Dahomey. His face was twitching in abysmal pain…”

As Alice Walker said in her foreword to the book, which was published in 2018, “many black people, years ago, especially black intellectuals and political leaders,” had a problem with the book, which “resolutely record[ed] the atrocities African people inflicted on each other, long before shackled Africans, traumatized, ill, disoriented, starved, arrived on ships as ‘black cargo’ in the hellish West.” She asked, “Who could face this vision of the violent cruel behavior of the ‘brethren’ and the ‘sistren’ who first captured our ancestors?”

Such questions, which defy the facile and false categorization of people as evil or good based on race or ideological inclination, also occupied the novelist Jones in his resonant and beautifully written “The Known World,” which is also a favorite of mine. Good novelists present characters realistically, as having both good and bad characteristics.

Good historians similarly recognize the complexity of human beings. All are all capable of good and evil. Historians do not alter the evidence to make it appear differently.

Historians do not make sweeping, incendiary statements like this one from Hannah-Jones’s lead essay in both the original and book versions: “In response to black demands for [their] rights, white Americans strung them from trees, beat them and dumped their bodies in muddy rivers, assassinated them in their front yards, firebombed them on buses, mauled them with dogs, peeled back their skin with fire hoses and murdered their children with explosives set off inside a church.”

As professor Lynn Uzzell noted, out of the 77 times the term “white” appears in Hannah-Jones’s 1619 Project, 35 times white people are presented as holding “some kind of power or privilege (almost always unearned or illegitimate)” and in 32 cases, “the word is associated with oppression, injustice, or cruelty.”

Kindergartners are being read the 1619 Project picture book, “Born on the Water.” They will be told that people in Africa were “kidnapped” exclusively by “white people,” who “traded another’s child / another’s momma and daddy” whom they viewed as “not human” and to be “bought and sold … alongside horses and chairs.” That is not an accurate depiction of this complex situation, and simplifying in this way encourages racial bitterness.

We know Hannah-Jones knows that white people are not all to blame and that black people also participated in the horrors of slavery, but she pushes such lies anyway. With Hannah-Jones revealing herself to be a liar over and over, there should be no more doubts about the need to take the 1619 Project propaganda out of our schools.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/06/not-convinced-the-1619-project-lies-about-history-look-at-this-professors-forced-confession/,2022-09-06
How Classical Education Can Liberate Black America,"Two African American professors, Angel Adams Parham and Anika Prather, have written a well-conceived and timely book, The Black Intellectual Tradition: Reading Freedom in Classical Literature. Parham and Prather argue that a classical Christian education grounded in the great books of the Western intellectual tradition, far from being racist, elitist, or oppressive, has the power to liberate the minds of black Americans from every socioeconomic class.

For instance, you’ve likely never heard of Anna Julia Cooper, but her work and words play a central role in The Black Intellectual Tradition:

It is well known that the power to think, the power to appreciate, and the power to will the right and make it prevail, is the sum total of the faculties of the human soul. Education which is truly ‘educative’ must strengthen, develop, ‘lead out’ these faculties in preparation for those special activities which may be called ‘occupative,’ because they give the one line of training necessary for the occupation or trade of the individual…. The old education made him a ‘hand,’ solely and simply. It deliberately sought to suppress or ignore the soul…. [but] for all men—whether for white men, red men, yellow men, or black men, whether for rich men or poor men, high or low, the aim of education for the human soul is to train aright, to give power and right direction to the intellect, the sensibilities, and the will.

These words were written in the 1930s, and serve as marked contrast to the educational vision of rich white liberal progressives offering a progressive, John Dewey vision of education. Cooper was a poor black woman who was born into slavery in 1858 and devoted her life to providing classical Christian education to “Black Americans [who] were two generations out of slavery, but still struggling mightily with the disadvantages of Jim Crow segregation and the sometimes latent, sometimes overt, violence against Black people of all backgrounds.”

By telling the stories of a half dozen black writers whose faith in Christ and study of the great books equipped them with the rational, rhetorical, and religious power to overcome oppression and fight for internal and external freedom, Parham and Prather demonstrate that the writings of such dead white men as Homer, Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Virgil, Plutarch, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Locke, and Mill comprise a legacy that transcends race, class, and sex. Such time-tested wisdom unites diverse groups of Americans by providing a common language and vision for human virtue and growth.

In the case of all these writers, their interactions with the great books and with Christ did not rob them of their black identity or negate the suffering they endured because of their race. Rather, it opened the doors for them to participate more fully in what America stands for when she is worthy of herself. It allowed them “to grieve injustice while shunning bitterness and working for healing and justice in our land.” Some of the notable figures discussed include the following.

Olaudah Equiano (c. 1745-1797) was born in Africa but was ripped away from his homeland, his culture, and his name and sold as a slave to many masters before buying his freedom, moving to England, and becoming an abolitionist whose best-selling autobiography awakened European hearts to the evils of slavery. Although “his trust was betrayed by White men who professed to be Christians … Equiano embraced the Christian faith and called on White Christians to live up to what they professed to believe.” His education taught him that the fight against slavery could be waged within the classical Christian tradition, a truth wielded by Frederick Douglass in the nineteenth century and Martin Luther King Jr. in the twentieth as they fought their own battles against racial injustice.

Phillis Wheatley (c. 1753-1784) was sold as a slave but ended up being essentially adopted by a kind woman who treated her as a daughter, raised her in the gospel, and saw that she was well educated. Wheatley matured into one of the finest early American poets, composing from within the classical Christian tradition and using it to speak for freedom of body and soul.

Like Equiano, “Wheatley was both deeply steeped in her Christian faith and highly critical of the slave system and the hypocritical expressions of Christianity exhibited by many of the European and White American Christians she encountered. … Both were able to see past the misuses and abuses of the Christian faith to the liberating message at its center. There is, then, in Phillis Wheatley’s writings, a consistent call for liberty that speaks powerfully both to freedom from physical chains and from sin.”

Frederick Douglass (c. 1817-1895), like Equiano, wrote a harrowing autobiography of his journey out of slavery that was a bestseller and that greatly bolstered the abolitionist cause. Like Wheatley, he devoured the Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian classics and became a virtuous person and a strong communicator because of it.

Like both, he “looked to the Christian scriptures both to bolster his faith and to critique the injustice around him. His critique is always aimed at pointing toward the good that could and should come of Christian faith were it to be lived out correctly.” In his writing and speaking, he urged his audience “to hold on to their hope in a better future” and pointed them “toward the innate desire for freedom and human dignity placed by God in everyone, whatever their color.”

Anna Julia Cooper (1858-1964) fought first for a full classical Christian education for herself (including the learning of Latin, Greek, and French) and then for her fellow black Americans. To achieve her goal, she not only needed to fight blacks who thought a liberal arts education was elitist and useless for finding a job, but white liberals who promoted a tyranny of low expectations, thinking blacks only capable of manual labor. Resisted, slandered, and shunned, Cooper fought on; her “deep faith in God caused her to see her work as an educator as a missionary work, in that everything she did was to promote bringing a classical Christian education to underserved populations.”

Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) needs no introduction, although we need to be reminded of the centrality of the great books to his mission of creating a unified and integrated America, such that “Both Anna Julia Cooper and Martin Luther King, Jr., received an education in classic and canonical writings that profoundly shaped their individual lives as well as their visions of the good society.”

Even a cursory reading of his seminal essay “Letter from Birmingham Jail” will make clear the depth and breadth of his learning and how the good dream that he dreamed for America flowed naturally out of his meditation on the dual legacy of Athens and Jerusalem. King’s education freed him to imagine “an aspirational world toward which we can strive,” and then to take “us with him up to a summit from which we are able to catch a vision for the kind of society toward which we can work if we dedicate ourselves in a spirit of prayer, service, and goodwill.”

Toni Morrison (1931-2019), who won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel Beloved, was as steeped in the history of her own people as she was in the great books. In fact, her novel Song of Solomon offers a “beautiful and bittersweet work of poetic prose rooted in African American history and culture and intricately interwoven with classical and biblical themes.” Her well-trained ear was sensitive to a multitude of voices, and she allows her readers, both black and white, to hear and sympathize with “the deepest desires of the natally dispossessed: the quest for freedom from oppression; the desire to know one’s name; and the deep longing for rootedness, home, and family.”

While Parham’s half of The Black Intellectual Tradition focuses on the educations and accomplishments of these six unique writers, Prather’s half narrows its focus to the life and work of Cooper, even offering in the appendices three of her most important essays. In order to provide a context for Cooper’s vision for classical Christian education, Prather helpfully situates her between Booker T. Washington (1856-1915), founder of the Tuskegee Institute, and W. E. B. Du Bois (1868-1963), editor of the NAACP’s monthly magazine The Crisis.

“Washington believed that the best way to secure Black people’s progress, well-being, and acclimation into American life would be to focus on developing certain skills and trades and to not pursue political or intellectual progress,” Prather observes. Du Bois, in contrast, “supported providing a classical education to Black people, seeing higher education in classical studies as a way of helping them to fight for their place of equality and progress in American society.”

Certain that American blacks could only become full members of American society if they spoke the language that gave shape to our nation, Cooper favored Du Bois’s approach. Still, she advocated, like Washington, for vocational training that would secure for African Americans jobs that they could perform with dignity and skill.

What she ultimately desired was an education that would train the whole person, body, mind, and soul. “[C]lassical education, in combination with learning skills to make a living,” she believed, “could be restorative” for souls that had been ground down by a long history of enslavement and racism.

“Anna Julia Cooper,” Prather explains, “was an advocate for making sure Black people were no longer educated just to be the ‘help’; she wanted to see Black people educated instead to be colaborers and coleaders in the work of making America a more perfect union. … After hundreds of years of oppression and enslavement, cultivating a new mind was essential for the progress and integration of Black people into American society, and classical education was the tool to bring that into being.”

We live in a time when King’s dream of a unified and integrated America where people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin seems to be coming apart at the seams. Rather than follow the lead of Douglass and Du Bois, Cooper and King and invite African Americans into a classical education that will train them to think critically and empower them to enter fully into the ongoing American experiment, a growing number of voices from academia and the public schools are claiming that black people are not liberated but oppressed by reading the great books.

When Prather told her dissertation advisor at the University of Maryland that she wanted to devote her “doctoral research to uncovering the Black classical tradition and to showing the effects of classical studies on modern K-12 Black students,” she was soundly and condescendingly reprimanded: “Why are you researching classical education in the Black community? Don’t you realize that those books are not for your people? This research topic is irrelevant to the Black community!”

Thankfully, Prather, like Cooper before her, persisted in her God-given calling. Also thankfully, Prather and Parham have done the yeoman labor to bring this important book to fruition.

It is my hope and my prayer that The Black Intellectual Tradition will help all American educators and students, whatever their race, sex, or creed, to reclaim our Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian heritage and enter again into the Great Conversation. The future of our civil society just may depend on it.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/16/how-classical-education-can-liberate-black-america/,2022-09-16
'Uncle Tom II' Shows How Marxism Decimated Black America,"It’s no secret that, as a group, black Americans are not exactly thriving. Despite the decades of social welfare policies, activist campaigns, and changing public attitudes, the black community suffers the most dysfunction of any racial group in the U.S.

There’re two popular explanations for this. Those on the left usually blame this situation on systemic racism and unequal opportunities. Those on the right tend to blame the collapse of the family and decadent culture.

Both these views are explored in the documentary “Uncle Tom” directed by Justin Malone and produced by Larry Elder. But there’s a third major factor that has hurt the black community, and it is the focus of the new sequel “Uncle Tom II.” Yes, historical setbacks and the proliferation of broken homes have much to do with the current struggles of black Americans, but there’s also something else that affected the course of black liberation: Marxism.

As “Uncle Tom II” illustrates, nearly all black liberation movements of the past century have been co-opted by Marxists. It was never a simple matter of giving blacks the same rights as whites while otherwise maintaining the American liberal order. The problem is usually framed as the system itself being inherently exploitative and unfair. This has become so prevalent that racism (i.e., the belief in the superiority of one race over another) and oppression (i.e., restricting the freedoms and limiting the power of another) have become synonymous. Consequently, for most people today, fighting racism means fighting the power structures that hold down people who are not white.

As if to debunk this Marxist narrative from the outset, the film begins with images of black families in the past prospering. They are attending church, fathers are present, and everyone’s well dressed. Some of the older commentators of the film, all of them black conservative Christians, recall this time nostalgically.

This is then contrasted in the film with images of chaos and desperation of activists during the George Floyd riots two years ago. Black Lives Matter and Antifa mobs scream at the police, harass bystanders, burn down buildings, loot stores, vandalize public property, and trash city squares. Somehow, by the end of it, Floyd and other famous victims of police violence are sanctified and extolled in a strange cult of black victimhood.

The whole sequence prompts the question: How did the black community go from prosperous and stable to poor and violent? Why are they idolizing these people? For Malone and the other black conservatives commenting on the issue, it is the philosophy of Karl Marx.

Although Marxism began as a class struggle, men like Antonio Gramsci realigned the ideology to suit cultural struggles. From here, it was easy for American Marxists to subvert the path for black prosperity and make it an endless struggle for racial justice.

This can be seen with every new iteration of racial activism. At the head of each campaign is a “trained Marxist,” as the BLM founders memorably put it. Many of them have adopted the tactics of leftist social activist Saul Alinksy, taking to the streets and organizing. Even BLM’s founders were brainwashed by an Alinksy disciple Eric Mann, an old white radical with a long criminal record.

Indeed, one has to go back to the very end of the Civil War with Booker T. Washington to find a black leader who was not a Marxist. As the film makes clear, Washington embodied the very best of the black community by moving past his former life as a slave through education and hard work. He would later make speeches encouraging fellow blacks to do the same and to be productive members of society and would found the Tuskegee Institute to help in this endeavor.

Using footage and photos from those decades following Emancipation, the film makes the point that many black Americans followed the program of Washington and prospered as a result. They attended school, started businesses, went to church, and even gentrified certain neighborhoods. The recent outcry against the Tulsa Massacre in 1921 ironically obscured this important fact that blacks in the segregated South actually had a kind of Wall Street in the first place. The commentators in the film also point out just how quickly Tulsa and the black business community recovered from this supposed devastation.

Unfortunately, Marxist intellectuals like W.E.B. Dubois, a contemporary of Booker T. Washington, set out to undermine Washington’s legacy. As one of the first leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP), he pushed the Marxist narrative that black Americans must unite in a common struggle and seize power from their white oppressors. As for Washington’s message for becoming productive citizens and finding equality this way, this was secondary at best.

This Marxism of Dubois eventually won out against the optimism of Washington during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Most civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., had endorsed Marxism views and won a great victory with Lyndon B. Johnson’s war on poverty. Ever since then, the black community has deteriorated in countless ways. Nevertheless, the black conservatives who call this out are still labeled traitors (“Uncle Toms”) to their community.

On the whole, “Uncle Tom II” raises some important questions and explores a neglected dimension of black history. However, one drawback of the film is its slow pacing and excessive length. Malone has amazing footage of past events and people, but there’s simply too much content that needs to be better edited. Furthermore, the film tends to meander through its claims, which themselves aren’t too clear, making it difficult to follow the line of reasoning.

The end of the film hints at a sequel, which takes specific aim at the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. Such a documentary would be welcome, and Malone has proven himself the man to do it. As it stands, “Uncle Tom II” is a great documentary that not only reveals just how pernicious Marxism has been for black Americans but also how this fate can easily befall all Americans.

Marxism is an idea with the power to ruin even the most prosperous communities. It must be aggressively rejected by every generation.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/28/uncle-tom-ii-shows-how-marxism-decimated-black-communities/,2022-09-28
"As State Energy Interests Clash, BlackRock Is In An ESG Bind","Hell hath no fury like a comptroller scorned; just ask Larry Fink. The CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is currently embroiled in an uncomfortable ménage à trois with Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar and NYC Comptroller Brad Ladner. Embrace fossil fuels, says Texas. Denounce them, says New York. So far, BlackRock has inexplicably tried to do both, hoping that the promises whispered in the ears of certain states wouldn’t be heard by others. But these whispers have now become political rallying cries, and BlackRock is paying the price.

Two weeks ago, the Texas comptroller — who oversees the state’s finances, including regulations affecting its $300 billion pension funds — accused BlackRock of “doublespeak” by “engaging in anti-oil and gas rhetoric publicly yet present[ing] a much different story behind closed doors.” NYC’s Ladner largely agrees, though from the opposite side. He noted an “alarming” “contradiction between Blackrock’s statements and actions” and accused the financial titan of “backtracking on its climate commitments” in a letter the day before.

Mr. Fink’s reasons for backpedaling are clear: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing now faces a dual crisis of public backlash and investment underperformance. But as BlackRock backs away from its ESG commitments, states like New York are saying you’d better make good on your promises or face the consequences, thus creating an inescapable bind.

Since 2018, Larry Fink has demanded corporate America embrace so-called “stakeholder capitalism” by considering the broader “societal impact” of its activities. He has called for companies to reduce emissions, increase diversity, and commit to other ESG goals. And the strategy has paid off: BlackRock’s ESG funds went from a niche investment category to over $500 billion in assets under management. “Sustainable assets” more than doubled in 2021 alone.

But in 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, gas prices surged, inflation soared, and recession fears materialized. Because of this and a host of ill-conceived domestic energy policies, ESG funds underperformed, especially in sectors they had shunned, such as oil, gas, and coal. Clients missed out on those gains while watching their investments sharply decline.

So, as ESG-linked strategies underperform, Larry Fink tiptoes away. This past May, BlackRock announced it would “support fewer” climate proposals after Fink proclaimed that BlackRock “is not ‘woke.’” At the Chevron Corporation, BlackRock’s investment team opposed a carbon emissions cap it supported in 2021, citing the environmental progress Chevron had already made; Larry Fink pretended BlackRock had not supported the 2021 proposal at all and shockingly said that he had always been against Scope 3 emissions caps.

Behind closed doors, there’s another reason for the change: Republicans threaten to pull business. In the past year, red states have been incensed over BlackRock’s “net zero” strategy that harms the coal, oil, and gas sectors on which their state economies rely. Texas passed a law punishing fossil fuel boycotters and later barred new investments in BlackRock by name. West Virginia pulled its BlackRock investments entirely.

In response, BlackRock has been scrambling to assure red state pension fund managers that it never really meant what it said. One Texas official memorialized such a discussion, saying it was “nice to hear that BlackRock didn’t mean — or no longer believes — many of the disagreeable things the company and Mr. Fink have said.” Publicly, BlackRock’s retreat has been no less pronounced: “BlackRock does not boycott energy companies,” it now claims. Nor does it “dictate to companies what specific emission targets they should set or what type of political lobbying they should pursue.”

But washing one’s hands of ESG commitments is not so easy. New York, for one, has held BlackRock’s feet to the fire, threatening to pull its pension funds from BlackRock’s control. And the SEC has been equally clear that once ESG promises are made, firms must follow through, as recent investigations at Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have shown.

Large asset managers like BlackRock can manage investments for either socially minded clients or financially minded clients — but not both — especially if they push ESG principles in corporate boardrooms. BlackRock cast its die on the side of signaling virtue and profited handsomely.

Now it must own the consequences of that choice. If states like New York mandate BlackRock shun fossil fuels, while Texas demands otherwise, a bifurcated market becomes inevitable. That’s bad news for BlackRock but good news for society: Everyone loses when a single asset manager wields undue power over $10 trillion of capital representing diverse client interests.

Leftist Group Tells How To Target Voters In 'Deeply Racist South',"As the 2022 midterms approach, a leftist dark money group is advising volunteers on how to write postcards to potential voters in the “deeply racist south.”

The Center for Common Ground, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, is leading a massive campaign targeting black voters in Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida. The group is advising volunteers sending postcards to would-be voters that their “unique mission in reaching out to Black voters in southern states … is to write with heartfelt respect.”

In its guidelines on “Deep South Etiquette” for writing postcards, the group claims that “racism” is “just normal behavior” to “average southern white folks” and that “respect is still a difficult commodity for Black voters.”

Except for “enlightened” white families, the group argues, it is “very common for southern white folks to call every Black domestic or other employee, customer or neighbor of any age simply by her first name,” and “every Black male employee by his abbreviated first name.”

The guidelines then instruct volunteers to use “Miss” or “Mr.” when addressing black voters, to even out “the racist language differences” and show “proper respect.”

“You are not writing to YOUR [white, liberal] neighbors, you are writing, respectfully, to get the attention of Black voters who are living in a deeply racist South,” the guidelines conclude.

The Center for Common Ground began sending out postcards to potential voters in 2019. During the 2020 election cycle, the nonprofit sent out 9 million postcards written and mailed by its volunteers. According to its website, the group exists to educate and mobilize “Black and Brown voters in voter suppression states to take action and protect their right to vote.”

Targeting would-be voters via postcards has become a popular tactic of leftist nonprofits. Vote Forward, a Democrat-aligned PAC and 501(c)(4) organization, believes “writing letters to voters is one of the most effective ways to help increase election turnout.” On its website, the group claims “Vote Forward letters can boost voter turnout by as much as 3.4 percentage points.” During the 2020 election, Vote Forward claimed that its 200,000 volunteers sent over 17 million letters to voters across 21 states.

Paid for by the Progressive Turnout Project, the group Postcards to Swing States argues “voters who receive handwritten postcards are significantly more likely to vote.” Leading up to the 2022 midterms, it expressed plans to send 4.9 million postcards to states with key Senate races. Activate America also writes postcards to “mobilize voters in close races.”

How do these groups figure out which voters to target? By analyzing key swing districts for Democrat candidates, they determine which districts have the closest margin for a Democrat victory and send out targeted mailers to likely Democratic voters, thereby boosting voter turnout — and it’s all technically legal.

This is all part of a larger effort by Democrats to capitalize on dark money nonprofits to swing elections in their favor. As The Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel notes, Silicon Valley-based leftist super PAC Mind the Gap has pushed its donors to give money to 501(c)(3) get-out-the-vote organizations because they can be “2 to 5 times more cost-effective at netting additional Democratic votes.”

A 2019 memo published by Mind the Gap explains that “the single most effective tactic for ensuring Democratic victories” in 2020 would be “501(c)(3) voter registration focused on underrepresented groups in the electorate.”

Ben Crump thinks he has another George Floyd on his hands,"Benjamin Crump must be getting desperate. He’s not only defending drug-addled miscreants in his grand race hustle but now a man who randomly choked a woman.

Crump parachuted into Little Rock, Arkansas, this week to host a press conference calling on the Biden Justice Department to investigate the death of 30-year-old black man Terence Caffey, who died in December last year while in police custody.

Crump apparently thinks he’s got a winner on his hands because, like George Floyd, patron saint of Hennepin County, video footage of Caffey’s arrest shows him pinned to the ground saying he can’t breathe shortly before dying. But unlike the Floyd footage, the Caffey tape shows him attacking workers at a movie theater for no reason and then fighting police officers who were trying to subdue him.

Security cameras caught the entire thing. Caffey is first seen exiting a theater into a hallway at Movie Tavern around 9:30 p.m. A second person joins him for a moment before Caffey pulls on a different door that doesn’t open. A staff member then enters the scene and Caffey quickly approaches him, puts his hand on the staff member’s chest, and then goes around his back to put his hands around him from behind like a hug. Two others exit the same theater into the hall and then more staff appear, at which point Caffey walks on his own to a wall and slides down to sit.

There is now some kind of commotion with staff members moving about, one of them directly speaking with Caffey, who remains seated. The staff member walks a few steps away from Caffey and speaks into a walkie-talkie, before posting up against the wall opposite of him. Caffey then starts pulling things from his pockets and tossing them across the floor as he continues to sit.

Another staff member, who is black, then enters the scene, at which point Caffey jumps to his feet and lunges at him. A separate member on staff, who is also black, gets between the two and attempts to push Caffey back. A struggle ensues with multiple staff members attempting to subdue Caffey.

Caffey is then seen kicking one of them and is eventually brought to the ground, with multiple staff members on top of him before a security guard arrives. The crowd breaks and the guard, an off-duty cop, attempts to put Caffey in handcuffs. Caffey jumps up and tries to escape, first bumping into a wall and then falling again to the floor. He gets up once more and faces the guard who advances on Caffey, eventually getting him back on the floor. Caffey continues to struggle and multiple staff members attempt to secure his flailing hands and legs.

Several minutes later, two police officers arrive and manage to quickly cuff Caffey’s hands behind his back, while he remains lying face down. Everyone else stands up and Caffey is eventually seated against a wall.

More officers arrive and two hoist Caffey to his feet to walk him outside. That concludes the theater’s security footage. But wait! Thanks to Crump, there’s more!

Crump called for the police department to release the officers’ body camera footage as well. And so they did.

When the police arrived and Caffey was cuffed, seated upright against the wall, he is heard panting and mumbling, looking around in a confused state, but not panicked. Someone asks what he’s “on” and Caffey appears to say “weed.”

When the officers pull Caffey up to his feet to take him outside, he says, “I can’t breathe” and struggles to balance. Because Caffey either can’t or won’t use his feet to walk, the cops then lift them up to carry him.

Caffey then attempts to struggle free and the officers place him back on the ground outside. “Quit grabbing me!” one yells. Another says, “Quit grabbing my partner.” Caffey at one point yells, “Let me go!”

The police attempt to further restrain Caffey with more cuffs while one officer has his knee bearing down on Caffey’s left shoulder.

Caffey continues to occasionally cry out in his manic state. One officer says, “He’s definitely on sherm,” a slang term for a joint that’s been coated in PCP, which is known to cause delirium and aggressive behavior.

When paramedics arrive, one cop says, “We’ve got a female that was choked that’s inside, and then there’s a young black male that he was in there talking to his mom when we were getting him (Caffey) out, that he said he was elbowed in the face. This is the suspect.” One medic asks if Caffey has any injuries and the cop tells him only there’s “a scratch on the face.” Caffey is heard throughout the exchange continuing to yell and grunt on the ground.

Caffey was eventually hoisted up to be placed in the squad car, his legs limp. It looks like he may have fallen asleep before coming to when he’s seated. At about 10:20 p.m., nearly an hour after the affair began, an officer checks on Caffey in the car, about three minutes after he was placed there.

Caffey appears unconscious and a medic attempts to awaken him. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he was ultimately pronounced dead after being transferred to a hospital.

Arkansas state law keeps autopsies confidential, but the district attorney, Larry Jegley, said that the medical examiner determined that Caffey’s death was basically due to a freak medical episode called sickle-cell trait which, under extreme physical stress, can result in sudden death.

In short, black men can sometimes have sickled cells, and be completely fine, until one day, under unique circumstances, they’re not.

Did Caffey deserve to die? No. Did the police mistreat another “unarmed black man”? Also no. But is this another one of Ben Crump’s shyster cases with perhaps his most unsympathetic dead client yet? Absolutely.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/20/ben-crump-picks-another-winner-a-black-man-who-died-after-attacking-a-black-man-and-choking-a-woman/,2022-10-20
Todd Bowles To Woke Whites: Stop Yapping About Skin Color,"Separated by almost two decades, Tampa Bay Buccaneers Head Coach Todd Bowles and award-winning actor Morgan Freeman have issued a plea that woke whites refuse to heed even when issued by the blacks they wish to be perceived as caring about: Please stop dragging race into every public space. It’s not necessary, it’s often out of place, and it’s not helping.

Bowles’ Bucs were set to face the Pittsburg Steelers led by their black coach Mike Tomlin this past weekend, and Steve Wilks, also black, was just named interim head coach of the Charlotte Panthers. So, unsurprisingly, a reporter asked Bowles on Wednesday ahead of the game, “You and Mike Tomlin are the few black head coaches in the league. I wonder what your relationship is like with him and your thoughts on Steve Wilks joining that [group]?”

No doubt the reporter fully expected to draw from Bowles some race-speak role play such as, “I am so proud that blacks are finally gaining these opportunities in the National Football League. It’s been a long time coming, but we’ve still got a long way to go.”

Instead, Bowles responded:

We don’t look at what color we are when we coach against each other. … I have a lot of very good white friends that coach in this league as well, and I don’t think it’s a big deal as far as us coaching against each other. I think it’s normal. … We coach ball, we don’t look at color.

Bowles’ response so discombobulated ESPN’s Jenna Laine, who is white, that she decided to school Bowles on how she thought he should handle race-speak questions posed to him: Did Bowles, Laine wanted to know, “understand that [racial] representation matters” across the league? “You have aspiring coaches and football players, they see you guys — they see someone that looks like them, maybe grew up like them. … That has to mean something.”

Unfazed and unbowed, the soft-spoken Bowles explained, “Well, when you say, ‘They see you guys,’ and ‘look like them and grew up like them,’ it means that we’re oddballs to begin with. … I think the minute you guys stop making a big deal about it, everybody else will as well.”

In Laine’s mind, standard race-speak liberates blacks and advances social justice. But Bowles thinks Laine’s ideas caricature, demean, and infantilize black people. But Bowles’ general complaint, and the one sure to go unheeded by those in the elite chattering classes, is that the news conference participants and their television audience would be better served if race were not mentioned at all.

Morgan Freeman delivered the same message during his 2005 interview with Mike Wallace during Black History Month. Wallace’s reputation as the cool, courageous, and unflappable questioner of the highest-profile interviewees on the planet is well-earned. But Wallace looked lost when Freeman said bluntly that he thinks Black History Month is “ridiculous.”

Black history is “American history,” Freeman said. He asked if Wallace wants a month to celebrate his history, to which Wallace said no. Freeman responded, “Neither do I?” An exasperated Wallace demanded to know from Freeman, “Well, then how are we going to improve race relations?” To which the actor retorted, “Stop talking about it.”

Neither Bowles nor Freeman believes race should never be discussed. But both also believe the wisdom of the ages and thus have learned that sometimes in some places in certain circumstances and on certain subjects, silence is golden. Where the totalitarian application of the Ibram X. Kendi/Robin DiAngelo brand of anti-racism is underway, silence cannot satisfy the virtue-signaling needs of those who seek approval from the regime.

Far-left whites expect blacks to play their dutiful role as the oppressed victims and celebrate the woke whites’ public engagement in the never-ending battle against the systemic racism of the nation we all inhabit. Bowles’ and Freeman’s plea to please just give it a rest runs into the brick wall of urgency endemic to the Kendi/DiAngelo diagnosis of America’s race disease.

As Columbia professor John McWhorter has observed, inclusion among the enlightened (the woke!) requires the catastrophizing of race generally and the seizing of every opportunity to always exhibit exquisite sensitivity to people of color as people of color — whether they want it or not.

Bowles and Freeman know they are black. But both also know there is much more to them, the work they do, and the world around them than the color of their skin. But woke whites have no time for all that. Both Bowls and Freeman are highly accomplished professionals in their respective fields, but conversations about their areas of expertise or just their thoughts and feelings as human beings do not interest woke whites. That’s the frustration that lies behind Freeman’s and Bowles’ refusal to play ball with them.

Proper race-speak has achieved Orwellian levels of enforcement within the sub-cultures so-called “anti-racists” inhabit. Their superiors expect them to talk about skin color at every opportunity, or else. For some woke whites, race-speak has achieved the status of common sense that Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci deemed necessary to a successful cultural revolution — uncoerced, reflexive conformity.

Are reporters like Laine teachable on this subject? Time will tell. But if so, the first requirement will be to heed the pleas of Bowls and Freeman: Be quiet about race for a while. Talk about something else. Or be quiet and just listen. You might marvel at what you’ll learn.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/20/todd-bowles-to-woke-whites-stop-yapping-about-race-every-chance-you-get/,2022-10-20
"Clarence Thomas's Duty Is To The Constitution, Not A Constituency","MSNBC host Tiffany Cross recently went on a rant about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in which she referred to him as “Tom” (short for the derogatory term “Uncle Tom”) and invoked a series of other ugly and disrespectful names. But while Cross and her fellow leftwing TV hosts have been spewing hatred, Thomas has been laying out a jurisprudence of faithfulness to the text of the Constitution that now represents a view held by the majority of justices on the Supreme Court. This view does away with the nonexistent constitutional “right” to abortion while reigning in out-of-control federal agencies and giving the Bill of Rights the respect it deserves.

Cross criticized Thomas for not representing black men in his jurisprudence, but where did she get the idea that a supreme court justice is supposed to represent a constituency? In our system of government, a judge’s job is to decide cases according to the Constitution and the law, without regard to any person. Take, for instance, Justice Sonya Sotomayor’s views on affirmative action. It is certainly not her job to represent the median views of Hispanics, 68 percent of whom oppose race being a factor in college admissions, yet she continues to support racially preferential admissions systems that categorize people by their heritage and not their merits.

Contrary to Cross’s claim, working-class black Americans historically have been in agreement with Thomas’ views on virtually every contentious issue. Thomas has long been opposed to affirmative action and racial preference programs, and so are most black Americans. According to a 2022 poll from Pew Research Center, 59 percent of black Americans are against race factoring into college admissions. It is unlikely Cross is a part of this 59 percent.

Justice Thomas has opined for thirty years that there is no constitutional right to abortion. According to a 2020 Gallup article, from 2001-2007, only 24 percent of black Americans believed abortion should be legal in all circumstances. From 2017-2020, only 32 percent did. In a May 2022 YouGov poll, 81 percent percent of black respondents said that abortion should be banned after the 25th week. Cross likely is unwilling to tolerate any limit on abortions up to the moment of birth, which would put her far outside the mainstream of black Americans.

Thomas has ruled that there is no constitutional right to same-sex marriage. While that is wholly different than whether one supports or supports same-sex marriage, it is notable that a large percentage of black Americans have, until very recently, been opposed to the practice. According to Pew Research, only 21 percent of black Americans supported same-sex marriage in 2004, only 30 percent in 2010, and 51 percent in 2019, and now it is 59 percent.

On topics where Thomas has not ruled from the bench, it is noteworthy that 81 percent of black parents support school choice, but the NAACP opposes school choice. Sixty-nine percent of black Americans support Voter ID laws. Only 28 percent of black Americans support leftist calls to defund the nation’s police.

Why do Cross and black leadership groups, like the NAACP, continue to be so out of touch with the black Americans they claim to represent? Why do they prioritize the goals set by rich white socialists? Perhaps it is because the NAACP receives significant funding from a majority of white leftwing organizations and labor unions and, therefore, may feel obligated to parrot the views of their funders. Certainly, that’s what happened in 1991 when the NAACP opposed Justice Thomas’ nomination at the insistence of the white labor unions, despite his support in the black community. Cross works for, in her own words, “a white-run media” company, and she pushes far-left views, whereas Thomas has a lifetime appointment and answers only to the Constitution and his conscience.

Elites have worked to destroy Thomas for years because, among other things, he exposes how out of step they are with the concerns of everyday black Americans. Thomas has argued for affirmative action programs that help students of all races from disadvantaged backgrounds, but the major beneficiaries of racial set-aside programs are wealthy blacks and Hispanics. A recent analysis showed that 71 percent of blacks and Hispanics at Harvard were from wealthy families. These wealthy individuals prevent the truly disadvantaged members of their communities from getting ahead.

During her tirade, Cross also attempted to smear Thomas by mentioning the ridiculous “pubic hair on a Coke can” comment that Anita Hill bizarrely claimed Thomas made to her many years ago. But the majority of the American people – men and women – did not believe Anita Hill’s testimony at Thomas’ confirmation hearings in 1991. A New York Times/CBS News poll showed people believed Thomas by 58-24 percent. Only 26 percent percent of women believed Anita Hill.

In 1998, Anita Hill was interviewed by Tim Russert on “Meet the Press,” where she trashed two women who claimed to have been sexually harassed or assaulted by then-President Bill Clinton, one of whom Clinton later settled with out of court for $850,000. After Hill had zealously defended Clinton, Russert asked if there were a double standard on harassment allegations for liberals and conservatives. Hill said there is a double standard, saying, “We live in a political world, and the reality is that … there are … larger issues other than just individual behavior.” Hill meant that if you are pro-abortion, women’s groups will give you a pass if you sexually assault or harass women. Despite Hill being a blatant fraud, Cross still used her antics to smear Thomas.

The left and the out-of-touch black leadership have attacked Thomas since he joined the Reagan administration forty years ago. Nevertheless, he does not care what they think or say. Cross’s attacks may play well to her leftist audience, but that’s not a lot of people, given she is the second lowest-rated show on the lowest-rated cable news network.

Nevertheless, it’s important to respond to these attacks to demonstrate how out of touch she and her colleagues are. On the other hand, Thomas will continue building a long-lasting legacy by writing well-reasoned opinions and persuading a majority of his colleagues to join him in ruling in a manner that is faithful to the Constitution.

"Black Celebs Hate Herschel Walker's Ideas, Not His Privilege","With the 2022 midterms right around the corner, more and more celebrities are stepping into the political arena to make their opinions heard.

Steve Harvey recently took to the airwaves during his morning radio show to express his opposition to Herschel Walker’s candidacy for the U.S. Senate. The rant was so dynamic that it circulated on TikTok, where it quickly garnered thousands of views. According to Harvey, Walker has lived a privileged life of fame and fortune resulting from his successful football career, so he could not possibly relate to the lived experience of most black Americans.

Such criticism from Harvey is ironic, given that Harvey himself has gained fame and fortune through a highly successful career as an entertainer. Per the comedian’s own logic, his success should also render him unable to empathize with the average black person.

In fact, Harvey and Walker, to some degree, share similar paths from humble beginnings to great success. If wealth or fame automatically disqualifies blacks from being “connected” to the larger black community, then Oprah, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and countless others share the same detachment from those they claim to represent.

Harvey’s actual issue isn’t with Walker’s wealth; it is with Walker being an outspoken black conservative. Supposedly, Walker’s conservatism means he supports policies that are harmful to “our people,” and by “our people,” Harvey means black Americans.

Harvey’s pointed criticism of black conservatives as embracing policies harmful to black people is questionable, at best. After all, the policies routinely championed by Democrats have verifiably hurt black Americans.

For instance, black people receive a disproportionate amount of the country’s abortions. Data gathered by the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion NGO, confirms this; black women receive abortions at a rate five times higher than their white counterparts. How is protecting the life of the unborn, which is a conservative cornerstone, harmful to black people? Given the disproportionate number of unborn black children killed by abortion, it is really just the opposite. In 2019, nearly 40 percent of all abortions were performed on black women and their helpless babies.

Since 1973, when the Supreme Court wrongly ruled that the Constitution conferred a right to abortion, more than 60 million unborn children have been lost. Of that 60 million, a third were black.

Today, there are around 43 million black people in the United States. More than 20 million black babies — roughly half of this group — were intentionally killed before they were born. How many of these children could have gone on to do extraordinary things if given a fair shot at life?

If conservative policies pertaining to abortion prevailed, the result would be a dramatic increase in the number of black children born in this country. Would that be a bad thing?

Conservatives also believe that traditional marriage is the bedrock of society and that it is fundamental to economic prosperity. The Democratic Party’s insistence on destroying families is one of many things that has brought suffering to black America.

Prior to the 1960s, black Americans with children were more commonly married, with mothers and fathers raising their children in the same home. In 1965, following the Democratic implementation of large-scale social welfare programs, the percentage of black children raised in single-parent homes continued to rise while the rate of marriage steadily declined until 72 percent of black children were born to unwed mothers.

The decline in marriage and the increase in fatherlessness is reflected in our prison population, where the majority of black prisoners, and inmates in general, come from broken homes.

Are conservative social policies focused on repairing families not in tune with the needs of black Americans?

Black children are frequently negatively affected by the country’s public school system; in many ways, it fails them. Black children frequently underperform on standardized tests and are further disadvantaged by school systems that choose to politicize their existence instead of prioritizing their education.

Conservatives, like Walker, support school choice policies that would enable black parents to play a more direct role in identifying and accessing high-quality educational opportunities for their children. School choice policies are widely supported in black communities; Walker is perfectly in tune with black Americans in this regard.

Conservatives typically believe in limited government. Is a limited federal government harmful to black Americans? Leftists would say yes because, for the past 60 years, they have used the massive growth of the federal government to systematically trap black people into a myriad of programs that have made them dependent on the federal government. Limiting the government requires lessening black people’s dependency on social programs, which means the government — and the Democratic Party — has less power and influence over them.

Conservative policies aim to empower all Americans to exercise their freedoms so they can work and achieve success without having it handed to them on a silver platter. Race is not a factor in these equations.

When we look at successful black Americans, it seems reasonable to conclude that conservative policies have proven beneficial, not harmful, to them.

LGBT Bill In Congress Puts Selfish Adult Wants Over Kids' Needs,"The 12 Republicans who joined all 50 Democrats in the Senate to advance the deceptively named Respect for Marriage Act did much more than threaten religious liberty by agreeing to change the definition of marriage in federal law.

They are also making it much harder for conservatives to promote natural marriage — one man and one woman for one lifetime — as the cornerstone of the American family. This affirmative vision goes far beyond the romantic feelings of consenting adults.

It also puts the needs of children over the desires of adults, since we know that kids do best when they are raised by married biological parents in a loving household.

House Republicans are the only hope conservatives have now for preventing this bill from becoming law. A recent Washington Post article should give them a window into the future of American family life if they choose to follow their Senate colleagues.

The Post recently did a profile of black women who are concerned about the fact that fewer than 2 percent of sperm donors at cryobanks across the country are black men. One early quote belies the actual intentions of the speaker.

“There’s so many good African American men out there. … Maybe they just don’t know how much they’re needed to create families.”

This sounds like a rallying cry to reverse the 70 percent nonmarital birth rate among black Americans. But in fact, the woman speaking isn’t encouraging African American men who want to marry and have children. Her concern is for black women who want children but not husbands.

The intentional creation of fatherless children — and absent fathers — is a sad coda to 60 years of liberal social policy and shifting cultural norms around sex and sexuality. The passage of the (Dis)Respect for Marriage Act would only accelerate our current downward spiral by making adults the central focus of public policy and social norms related to marriage and family.

Scientific advances in reproductive technology have given ever more LGBT adults an opportunity to fulfill their desire for a biological connection to a child. Gay men like Bravo talk show host Andy Cohen and conservative comedian and podcaster Dave Rubin have used surrogates to carry their children.

The author of the Post profile takes readers on a journey through the other side of conception’s sex binary. One woman spent more than 800 hours scouring websites with hundreds of potential donors, only to see her options dwindle once she narrowed her search to black men. She eventually settled on a Peruvian donor and welcomed a healthy baby girl in 2021 shortly after breaking up with her girlfriend.

Another, described by the author as a “single lesbian,” was matched with a married father of four on a donor app. They met at a hotel and used an at-home insemination kit. When the first attempt failed, they used the kit and had sex to improve the odds of conception.

Concerns about the shortage of black sperm donors were not confined to women who identify as LGBT.

A 40-year-old author acknowledged the zero-sum nature of the black male donor market: “You know that if you get what you need, that means another sister won’t get what she needs if she wants a Black donor, too.” She added, “I’m crying, fasting, praying and believing for a donor.” Her appeal for divine intervention is one that women in an earlier era would have reserved for a husband.

The women in this profile saw men as a means to create the families of their dreams, not partners in love needed to raise a child. This nexus of feminism, human sexuality, and social justice is the context in which the concerns about redefining marriage and family are taking place. One of the women profiled in the Post who chose to pursue single motherhood said she believes “there is a true and divine right of women to create the lives of their choosing.”

But this worldview omits one key factor: children need the love and support of both their mothers and fathers.

Put simply, no adult has a right to someone else’s child or another adult’s reproductive capacity. If they did, it would create obligations on the part of individuals and governments to supply sperm, eggs, and wombs to hopeful parents. But every child has a right to love and support from the mother and father who created him.

Parents are expected to sacrifice for their children. We lose free time and personal space after a new addition to the family. We trade day parties for children’s birthday parties and spontaneous weekend getaways for carefully planned family vacations.

The prevailing wisdom today — rarely stated in explicit terms — is that children should be willing to sacrifice for our desires. This is exactly what happens when a child is deprived of maternal or paternal love so that adults can build the families of their dreams.

Our national priority should be promoting a culture where men and women commit to one another and the families they build together, not creating fatherless (or motherless) children for the sake of adult fulfillment.

Unfortunately, some of the most prominent voices in the fight to redefine marriage have been conservative evangelicals who applaud Martin Luther King Jr. for making distinctively Christian arguments about the nature of human dignity, but refuse to do the same in defending God’s design for the family.

Elected officials who reject this design — and the definition of sex itself — for the sake of political expediency are not showing respect for marriage. They are demonstrating contempt for the laws of God and nature.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/08/misnamed-respect-for-marriage-act-doesnt-just-gut-religious-liberties-it-puts-selfish-adult-wants-over-kids-needs/,2022-12-08
"High School African American Studies Is Marxism, Not History","This year, a new AP high school program was launched: Advanced Placement African American Studies (APAAS). The pilot program was introduced at 60 high schools across the country, with plans to add many more schools next year. “The curriculum will be an interdisciplinary look at the history of civil rights in the U.S., as well as African American music and other topics,” NPR benignly reported earlier this year. Except a number of reports — including a Dec. 2 Washington Post article featured on the front page of the print edition — indicate AP African American Studies is far from harmless, promoting, among other things, voodoo.

Though the College Board, which manages the AP program, has been oddly secretive about the content of APAAS, National Review reporter Stanley Kurtz acquired a copy of the course’s curriculum framework. His report on that framework demonstrates the aggressive anti-American, Marxist content of the course.

APAAS features readings from scholar Robin D. G. Kelley, who argues that authentic black studies requires revolutionary study and activism outside of academics. Kelley posits that norms of objectivity must be rejected in favor of Marx’s call for “a ruthless criticism of everything existing” and a subsequent struggle against power structures. Though the topics in the curriculum sound neutral, Kurtz observes that “the readings almost uniformly consist of neo-Marxist agitation — pleas for a socialist transformation of America.” That includes the anti-American Frantz Fanon, who called the United States “a monster, in which the taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions.” Critical race theory (CRT) advocates Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and Patricia Hill Collins are also on the reading list.

We also know that APAAS’s curriculum “content writing team” is staffed by leftist racial ideologues such as Joshua M. Myers of Howard University, who believes that “Black radical tradition” should be synonymous with black studies. Moreover, a significantly large portion of the APAAS curriculum is devoted to the history of black studies, vice the history of black people (imagine, by comparison, an AP European History course that focused on the history of European historical scholarship). “This seems oddly self-referential, until you realize it’s a strategy for teaching about radicalism without quite seeming to do so,” writes Kurtz.

A Lot of Theory and Fluff, Not Many Facts

“I don’t teach theory. I teach facts,” Patrice Frasier, a Baltimore-based APAAS teacher, told The Washington Post. “The purpose is not to indoctrinate them or guide them in some kind of political philosophy. … The story is so much more complex than simply White people versus Black people,” Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, a professor of African American Studies at Harvard University, told the Post.

Yet plenty of reporting on the APAAS curriculum indicates that’s hardly the case. APAAS content, according to a Time article, includes “the significance of the Marvel Black Panther movie” and an opportunity to study “the reparations movement and Black Lives Matter activism.” Intersectionality is reportedly “a key tenet of the class,” according to the Smithsonian Magazine. “Students will learn how to advocate for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) — in and outside of postsecondary environments,” notes a report from Best Colleges.

Forgive me if APAAS sounds like a course aimed at further engendering woke activism among American high schoolers. Indeed, that same Best Colleges report on APAAS adds: “By studying America’s past and present mistakes, society can create a future that is free of social disparity, bias, and discrimination.” A future free of social disparity? Isn’t that a key tenet of Marxism? It’s also entirely blinkered, given that social and economic hierarchies, though often unjust, are a natural human phenomenon. Even the most communist nations cannot extinguish such hierarchies — in fact, they inevitably aggravate them, through corruption and policies that vitiate human freedom.

Moreover, as the WaPo’s report on Frasier’s APAAS lesson shows, the course invests a lot of energy trying to persuade students that voodoo is not strange or evil, but a legitimate religion suppressed by white supremacists. After a pro-voodoo video, students regurgitate details, including, “White people felt like it was empowering to Black people.” Another student declares: “It made me think that not everything has to be bad. … There could be alternate ways of looking at things.” Voodoo, readers should remember, involves adherents becoming possessed by spirits, engaging in divination, causing harm to other people, and even ritualistic cannibalism.

If APAAS were actually a serious, neutral study of the black experience in America, one would think there would be readings from thinkers across the political and ideological spectrum rather than entire lessons about voodoo. Yet there is no indication that critics of CRT or black radicalism — such as John McWhorter, Glenn Loury, Robert Woodson, or Shelby Steele — are included in the APAAS curriculum.

“Those courses [such as APAAAS] will siphon off students from American history and other more conventional subject areas, bringing campus-style balkanization and politicization to K–12,” argues Kurtz. That, unfortunately, seems the likely result of an APAAS coming to a school district near you. And if your high schooler comes home expressing interest in learning more about how they too might participate in voodoo rituals, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

West Virginia Treasurer Calls On BlackRock's Larry Fink To Resign,"West Virginia Republican Treasurer Riley Moore became the second state chief financial officer to call on Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset management company, BlackRock, to resign.

Moore called for Fink’s resignation during an exclusive interview with The Federalist over a recent letter from North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell to BlackRock’s board of directors demanding Fink step down. Last Friday, Folwell admonished Fink for placing personal political priorities, of the kind embedded in so-called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, over the best interest of the company’s clients.

“Unfortunately, Larry Fink’s pursuit of a political agenda has gotten in the way of BlackRock’s same fiduciary duty. A focus on ESG is not a focus on returns and potentially could force us to violate our own fiduciary duty,” Folwell wrote. “Having lost confidence in his leadership to responsibly steward investors’ resources, I request, quite simply, that he resign or be removed from the asset management firm’s leadership team immediately.”

When asked whether Fink should step down, Moore agreed.

“Yes, I think Larry Fink should resign,” Moore told The Federalist, adding, “I don’t think he’s obviously somebody who’s too concerned about what policymakers in the United States think.”

In October, Fink took a victory lap for antagonizing American politicians on both sides of the aisle as head of the global financial management behemoth, which has roughly $8 trillion in assets. While Republicans charge BlackRock with manipulating their constituents’ tax dollars to pursue anti-energy policies against them, Democrats say BlackRock doesn’t do enough to tackle the left’s climate priorities.

“I’m now being attacked equally by the left and the right, so I’m doing something right,” Fink said at the annual membership meeting for the Institute of International Finance in October.

“That’s an interesting way to think of that,” Moore told The Federalist about the comment. “I think what he’s done is make everybody mad.”

The West Virginia treasurer pointed out that BlackRock lost $2 trillion under Fink just this year. The day after Fink’s remark about bipartisan frustration, Reuters reported BlackRock’s assets fell below $8 trillion following a $10 trillion high in January.

“Does that sound like a guy who’s doing something right?” Moore said. “If anything, it’s a cautionary tale to focus on the maximization of your return for your beneficiaries and your shareholders.”

Last year, Moore led a coalition of 15 GOP state treasurers who threatened to yank $600 billion in taxpayer assets away from firms that refuse investment in fossil fuels. Now several are following through on their pledge to protest “woke capitalism” with divestment from BlackRock, a Wall Street pillar of ESG investing to reach net-zero carbon emissions. Fink’s desire to conduct and maintain business with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the detriment of U.S. security has also drawn the ire of lawmakers.

In his letter to BlackRock’s board of directors last week, Folwell informed the firm’s leadership that the financial giant may no longer oversee the state’s $14 billion from the North Carolina Retirement Systems fund. Moore already pulled the plug in January and became the first state treasurer to block BlackRock from managing $8 billion in tax dollars from West Virginia’s Board of Treasury Investments. Other states have begun to follow suit.

In March, Arkansas Republican Treasurer Dennis Milligan pulled $125 million from BlackRock’s management. Milligan’s move was followed by Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks moving $100 million away from BlackRock to different asset managers in September. In October, Louisiana divested nearly $800 million from the New York firm, South Carolina withdrew $200 million, and Missouri pulled out $500 million.

Earlier this month, Florida gutted $2 billion from BlackRock’s management following a resolution from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who overwhelmingly won re-election in November by a nearly 20-point margin.

Arizona Republican Treasurer Kimberly Yee, who was the only Republican to win statewide this cycle without a contested result, announced last week that the Copper State would join the growing movement of divestment from BlackRock. Yee said in a statement that the decision is the result of a review from the treasurer’s Investment Risk Management Committee (IRMC).

“Part of the review by IRMC involved reading the annual letters by CEO Larry Fink, which in recent years, began dictating to businesses in the United States to follow his personal political beliefs,” Yee wrote in a press release. “In short, BlackRock moved from a traditional asset manager to a political action committee. Our internal investment team believed this moved the firm away from its fiduciary duty in general as an asset manager.”

The Arizona treasurer added that her office already stripped $543 million from BlackRock’s oversight in February “and reduced our exposure to BlackRock by 97 percent this year.”

In Texas, where lawmakers have banned state and local governments from conducting business with firms that boycott fossil fuels, senators grilled a BlackRock executive on Thursday over the firm’s promotion of ESG standards and membership in Climate Action 100+.

Climate Action 100+ is a coalition of investors pushing strict environmental standards to eliminate fossil fuels through public and private policy. Last week, House Republicans on Capitol Hill launched an antitrust probe into the group, describing the coalition as a “cartel” aiming to undermine a reliable power grid with intermittent wind and solar.

Bud Brigham, the first witness in Thursday’s Texas state Senate hearing, explained to lawmakers that he was denied a loan from a bank restricting capital to firms that might bring down the financial institution’s ESG score.

“I knew there was no way we were going to do the deal,” Brigham said after the bank demanded Brigham capitulate to the firm’s left-wing talking points on climate change.

The first witness, @BMBrigham, told the story of how Wall Street's ESG scam has affected him and his business personally, outlining how @CreditSuisse ( $CS ) indicated that they would deny him for a loan if he didn't tweet out various points praising the green energy agenda: pic.twitter.com/f8cPq5Z9MF — Will Hild (@WillHild) December 15, 2022

In August, the Texas comptroller ordered a divestment of state pension funds from BlackRock.

Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, has repeatedly warned about BlackRock’s mission to drive left-wing ESG standards as the default standard among Western financial institutions. Earlier this year, Hild’s watchdog group published a new website detailing Fink’s dual loyalty to the CCP in particular, WhoIsLarryFink.com.

Hild told The Federalist that Americans can expect to see more divestment from the firm in 2023, on top of additional oversight from congressional Republicans after they reclaimed the House. More hearings in state legislatures over BlackRock’s practices are also likely over the next year.

“The big thing you’re going to see is a continued amount of divestment,” Hild said, with states passing anti-ESG legislation to strip more tax dollars from Wall Street firms such as BlackRock that use those tax dollars to wreak havoc on constituents’ industries.

“They’ve been using the power of those assets to push political objectives,” Hild explained, fueling the cascade of divestment from state policymakers.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/16/exclusive-west-virginia-treasurer-riley-moore-joins-calls-for-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-to-resign/,2022-12-16
"With 'Ain't No Mo,' It's Clear Racist Pandering Won't Sell Broadway Seats","Image Credit Theatrely/Youtube

Playwright Jordan E. Cooper may have been a little too on the nose when he said “this is not a play that’s supposed to be on Broadway,” as “Ain’t No Mo,” Broadway’s recent attempt to virtue signal, announces closing not two weeks after its opening night.

With a star-studded cast of producers (Lee Daniels, Gabrielle Union, RuPaul Charles, and Dwayne Wade, to name a few) and a mostly positive response from theater critics, the play, on paper, should have succeeded. Its content was just too abrasive to ignore.

Cooper’s Broadway debut is an absurd political satire and lamentation of the black American experience. The premise of the 90-minute play is an alternate reality in which the United States government attempts to solve racism by repatriating black Americans back to Africa on the not-so-subtly named Flight No. 1619. Comprised of a series of vignettes, the story follows the descendants of slaves set to board Flight No. 1619 and Cooper in drag as Peaches, the sassy flight attendant coordinating the whole thing. “Ain’t No Mo” depends upon the exploitation of white guilt and condescending pandering to the black community to achieve its desired effect on the audience.

The show opens with a funeral — Pastor Freeman (Marchánt Davis) eulogizes Brother Righttocomplain — and it is explicitly stated that the funeral is the death of black people’s right to complain following the inauguration of President Barack Obama.

One vignette (which would do the ghost of Margaret Sanger proud) attempts to justify black abortion and make fun of black conservatives all in one. A black female Fox News reporter interviews and guilts a black woman who’s waited in line for 40 days to get an abortion because she is fearful for the future of black Americans.

Another vignette stands to shame affluent black people in a scene in which an actor who is supposed to represent “true” blackness pops up from the floorboards and scares the white-washed family during their fancy dinner. Breaking loose from literal shackles, she scares the family by haphazardly parading around the room, hopping up on furniture, and forcing them to recognize their roots. The scene more so sends the message that the well-mannered and successful black person isn’t really black at all, and true blackness is unhinged and animalistic. Yikes.

Other storylines include a Rachel Dolezal-type character and how the law enforcement system strips black people of their joy. One particularly disturbing scene shows a black woman getting lynched on stage. No corner of non-black, non-affluent America is safe from scorn.

While some may argue that discomfort was the intended result of the art piece, it is obviously unsustainable as the show cannot afford to continue to run. Deadline reports only 47 percent of seats were filled, even with tickets on the cheaper side. Before the masses cry racism, let’s look at the reality of producing a Broadway show. Despite the high ticket prices, most Broadway shows struggle to break even due to the sheer cost of production.

Compare this to “The Lion King,” one of Broadway’s longest-running shows. It is a musical with an all-black cast, set in Africa, and celebrates African culture and a classic story. This show has run for decades with minimal advertisements, only a powerful story, and an award-winning score that speaks for itself.

Aside from logistical costs, the average age of Broadway attendees is between 40 and 45 years old, and an estimated 67 percent of theater-goers are Caucasian. What interest does this demographic have in buying a ticket to be reprimanded for the sins of their ancestors?

“I ain’t going down without a fight,” Cooper said on Instagram. “There is an audience for plays like this.”

If there is, they are not traveling to Manhattan to see it. It’s true the cast, crew, and supporters are not going down without a fight. Will and Jada Smith recently bought out a performance of “Ain’t No Mo,” and Cooper started the hashtag #SaveAINTNOMO on social media in an effort to garner support. Unfortunately, hashtags don’t fill seats, and “Ain’t No Mo” is still set to depart the Great White Way on Dec. 18.

Update: After this article was published, Cooper announced the show was granted a one-week extension and will go on through Friday, Dec. 23.

'South Side' Is A Comic Reflection On Black Chicago Communities,"There have been a lot of TV shows set in Chicago. Maybe its big-shoulders reputation, mixed in with the cultural panache that earns it the title of Capital of the Midwest, makes it alluring to Hollywood writers. Not many shows get it right, though.

Certainly not “Joanie Loves Chachi,” maybe a near miss for “The Bob Newhart Show,” and let’s call it almost there for that recent critics’ darling, the au jus-spattered, frenetic, and heartfelt “The Bear.” Even that last one, though, doesn’t feel homegrown. The shots show us this neighborhood or that, maybe the Tribune Tower here, the Sears Tower there, but it lacks a sense of place. If it weren’t about an Italian beef joint, it could be anywhere. You can tell it was made by a suburbanite, not a real Chicagoan.

For this expat West-sider, it’s clear that HBO’s comedy “South Side,” is by South-siders, about South-siders, and for — well, anybody who likes a joint that’s hilarious, self-aware but not self-conscious, topical without being preachy, and as grounded in a real place as ever a show I’ve seen. Even better is the unstated undercurrent that the place’s potential was ground down under statist central planning decades ago and has yet to recover.

“South Side,” which just wrapped its third season, exemplifies that Chicago is all about the hustle. It doesn’t matter if you’re a cop wearing braids, a lazy repo man, a guy selling sno-cones on the corner, or an alderman in suits just a little too shiny to be tasteful. It’s Chicago, and you do what you gotta do. You can’t expect anybody to help unless they get something back.

The two repo man main characters, the studiously unglamorous Simon James (Sultan Salahuddin) and Kareme Odom (Kareme Young), made their way through community college only to have to scrape by taking every piece of furniture from a family’s home. And when that family didn’t keep up on the payments to Kareme’s brother, Quincy (Quincy Young, his real-life twin), of course they’re going to get up to some nonsense like selling black-market Viagra just to get a little more ahead. And it’s damned funny when things don’t work out for them, like they never do.

“South Side” is the brainchild of Bashir Salahuddin, who plays the hapless Officer Goodnight, and his Harvard theater pal Diallo Riddle. A native of the South Side, Salahuddin keeps the show in the family: his wife, Chandra Russell, stars as the capricious Sgt. Turner, who’d much rather be going to Lollapalooza than tracking down a killer; his brother, Sultan, is our sorta-hero, Simon; and their sister, Zuri, plays another, probably smarter, employee at the Rent-T-Own store.

When Sultan Salahuddin’s official Comedy Central bio notes that he spent his childhood “buying Now and Laters from the candy lady,” you believe it. Didn’t we all do the same? When the sno-cone man says, “We finna make this happen,” get that mix of syrups just right, this is someone talking real, even if it’s scripted. These people know Chicago.

And they know Chicago is a damned hard place. “Yes, our neighborhoods have challenges, but we also have a lot of hope and love. And importantly, we love to laugh.” So Bashir Salahuddin and Diallo Riddle told The Root back in the show’s first season.

Yes, Chicago’s neighborhoods have challenges, its black neighborhoods almost uniquely so. It’s for a simple reason: City hall didn’t like that all of these black folks were coming up in the Great Migration. They weren’t only black, but they had the audacity to create thriving neighborhoods, right up against the borders of such sacred white Democratic enclaves as the Bridgeport of Mayors Kelly, Kennelly, and (eventually) R. J. Daley himself. Their response was the evil but cleverly named strategy of slum clearance, or its twin, “urban renewal.”

Starting in the late 1940s, exercising the powers of eminent domain granted it by state law, the city of Chicago razed black communities, dropped down the Dan Ryan Expressway to keep the blacks away from the white enclaves, and shunted the former residents of those neighborhoods into the open arms of the Chicago Housing Authority and the finest high-rise projects it could offer. In short, the city of Chicago, as an institution, saw black people doing well, found them some sort of existential threat, and went about re-enslaving them by doing its best to make them serfs.

Ten years ago, the estimable Kevin D. Williamson wrote a piece for National Review on how the razing of the projects had broken the cohesion of Chicago’s drug-peddling gangs, resulting in a proliferation of violence throughout the city. It’s a good analysis, and is written in Williamson’s best on-the-ground prose, but he doesn’t go back quite as far as he should.

These days, the Englewood neighborhood where “South Side” is set and mostly filmed has a murder rate roughly 15 times higher than the rest of the nation. It’s not the stuff of comedy, even if you’re a Beckett fan. Even still, that’s not the whole story of the place.

Like Salahuddin and Riddle said in their press-junket statement to The Root, “There is joy on the South Side.” But that joy exists almost as an act of defiance: of the city that destroyed the communities that could have fostered the dreams of betterment all of these bumblepreneurs sketch out for themselves every morning; of the people around them who should be helping them get to a better place but don’t, because they’re likewise treading water; of the unacknowledged but ever-present threat of stupid, pointless violence, which maybe you can parody in an episode about a killer iPad-cum-file-cabinet-robot, but you can’t escape.

So what’s to do about the South Side? Williamson advocates for tougher penalties for straw buyers of guns. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has called for coordinated federal efforts to combat the “illegal scourge of gun violence.” Neither one of them gets to the heart of it the way “South Side” does. It’s about the people. And Salahuddin and Riddle have created, however idealized it may be, a picture of what Chicago needs to do just to get started.

It needs to relax a little, maybe take a sip or a puff, laugh at itself, and start pulling itself up by its own bootstraps, one person at a time but with all of your friends along for the ride, all of you up to your own thing. Just make sure there are plenty of Now and Laters to go around.

Pour One Out For BLM Believers Finally Discovering The Scam,"As much as leftists should be hated for agitating racial conflict and violence, there’s something kind of sad, in a pathetic way, in witnessing the disillusionment of true believers finding out they’ve been conned by the very movement they helped push forward.

Such has been the case in recent weeks, between Rihanna’s “sellout” half-time performance at the Super Bowl and the muted response (i.e. no deadly rioting) to the death of Tyre Nichols, leaving some of the Black Lives Matter faithful with heavy hearts.

The Washington Post’s resident race hustler Karen Attiah on Monday bemoaned Rihanna’s “selling out” by performing at the Super Bowl. The ungrateful immigrant singer had said in 2019 that she turned down a previous invitation from the NFL because, “For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn’t be a sellout. I couldn’t be an enabler.” She was presumably referring to the league’s punishment of Colin Kaepernick and others who protested by kneeling during the national anthem on game days.

“With Rihanna’s performance and her silence on the issues she claims to have stood for, the true winner of the night was the NFL,” wrote Attiah. “She has shown them, and all racist institutions, that if they can withstand Black protest and outrage for a few years, put on some cool shows and donate to charities, then everything will be hunky-dory…”

Charles Blow wrote similarly in The New York Times last month after a national story about a young black man who died in police custody, following his attempt to flee arrest. Arrests were made of the officers involved, all of them black, and they’ve been charged with the death of Tyre Nichols. This is formerly known as “the judicial process,” but because Nichols’ death didn’t result in another round of calls for reparations and the eternal subjugation of whites, Blow was miffed.

“It was more snuff porn with Black victims, in a country becoming desensitized to the violence because of its sheer volume,” he wrote. “America — and the world — had the realization that police violence was a problem, and then it simply walked away before the work was done and the war was won. … What fell away were the evanescent allies, poll-chasing politicians and cooped-up Covid kids who had used the protests as an opportunity to congregate.”

Wait a second. You mean to tell me the 2020 summer of horror was a manufactured hysteria for political purposes and that once its goal was achieved — the unseating of Donald Trump as president — it all seemed to disappear? No way!

Cold reality is finally setting in. Santa isn’t real after all.

Blow and Attiah might be the last people in America to realize that BLM as a national entity is nothing but a scam — even in the literal sense of the word, as endless stories have come out since 2020 exposing the group’s leaders as frauds and money embezzlers using innocent donations to enrich themselves with expensive homes and private jet travel.

And celebrities like Rihanna who promoted the notion that black athletes, who are paid millions of dollars, are also victims of white supremacy aren’t serious and should never have been taken seriously. Is the NFL in any way noticeably different today than it was in 2020? Of course not. But Democrats have the bulk of the power in Washington, so that put Rihanna and others in a much better mood.

It’s too bad Blow and Attiah had to find out this way.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/14/pour-one-out-for-the-black-lives-matter-true-believers-who-are-finally-discovering-the-scam/,2023-02-14
"Diversity Industrial Complex Dominates Everything, Fixes Nothing","Little more than a decade ago, DEI was just another arcane acronym, a clustering of three ideas, each to be weighed and evaluated against other societal values. The terms diversity, equity, and inclusion weren’t yet being used in the singular, as one all-inclusive, non-negotiable moral imperative. Nor had they coalesced into a bureaucratic juggernaut running roughshod over every aspect of national life.

They are now.

Seemingly in unison, and with almost no debate, nearly every major American institution — including federal, state, and local governments, universities and public schools, hospitals, insurance, media and technology companies, and major retail brands — has agreed that the DEI infrastructure is essential to the nation’s proper functioning.

From Amazon to Walmart, most major corporations have created and staffed DEI offices within their human resources bureaucracy. So have sanitation departments, police departments, physics departments, and the departments of agriculture, commerce, defense, education, and energy. Organizations that once argued against DEI now feel compelled to institute DEI training and hire DEI officers. So have organizations that are already richly diverse, such as the National Basketball Association and the National Football League.

Many of these offices in turn work with a sprawling network of DEI consulting firms, training outfits, trade organizations, and accrediting associations that support their efforts.

“Five years ago, if you said ‘DEI,’ people would’ve thought you were talking about the Digital Education Initiative,” Robert Sellers, University of Michigan’s first chief diversity officer, said in 2020. “Five years ago, if you said DEI was a core value of this institution, you would have an argument.”

Diversity, equity, and inclusion is an intentionally vague term used to describe sanctioned favoritism in the name of social justice. Its Wikipedia entry indicates a lack of agreement on the definition, while Merriam-Webster.com and the Associated Press online style guide have no entry (the AP offers guidance on related terms).

Yet however defined, it’s clear DEI is now much more than an academic craze or corporate affectation.

“It’s an industry in every sense of the word,” says Peter Schuck, professor emeritus of law at Yale. “My suspicion is that many of the offices don’t do what they say. But they’re hiring people, giving them titles and pretty good money. I don’t think they do nothing.”

It’s difficult to know how large the DEI Industrial Complex has become. The Bureau of Labor Statistics hasn’t assessed its size. Two decades ago, MIT professor Thomas Kochan estimated that diversity was already an $8 billion-a-year industry. Yet along with the addition of equity, inclusion, and like terms, the industry has surely grown an order of magnitude larger. Six years ago, McKinsey and Company estimated that American companies were spending $8 billion a year on diversity training alone. DEI hiring and training have only accelerated in the years since.

“In the scope and rapidity of institutional embrace,” writes Marti Gurri, a former CIA analyst who studies media and politics, “nothing like it has transpired since the conversion of Constantine.”

Yet in our time, no Roman Emperor has demanded a complete cultural transformation. No law was passed mandating DEI enactment. No federal court ruling has required its implementation. There was no clarion call on the order of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “military industrial complex” warning. No genuine public crisis matched the scale of the response.

The sources of this transformation are both deep and fairly recent. On one level, they can be traced back to the egalitarian movements that have long shaped American history — from the nation’s founding, through the Civil War and Reconstruction to the battles for women’s suffrage, the civil rights movement, and same-sex marriage. In other ways, the rapid transformation can seem no more explicable than an eccentric fashion trend, like men of the late 18th century wearing periwigs. However, a few pivot points of recent history bent its arc in DEI’s direction.

The push for affirmative action is the most obvious influence, a program first conceived during the Reconstruction era but then abandoned for nearly a century. Although triumphs for social justice, the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights acts of the late 1950s and 1960s didn’t stop discrimination; the country would need to take more affirmative steps toward assisting minority groups and achieving more equitable outcomes, proponents argued. A controversial policy from the start (with the Supreme Court expected to curb its use in college admissions this term), affirmative action was further complicated by immigration reforms that allowed for more non-European immigrants, setting off a seismic demographic shift that continues to reverberate.

The diversity movement of the early 1990s was in part an attempt to capitalize on the new multicultural reality. Stressing individual and institutional benefits rather than moral failings, early corporate diversity training programs hewed to traditional values of equality and meritocracy. Creating a diverse workplace, R. Roosevelt Thomas wrote in the Harvard Business Review, in 1990, “should always be a question of pure competence and character unmuddled by birth.”

And in many ways it appears to have worked. Just look at the tech industry, where immigrants from East and South Asia have flourished. Nigerian immigrants are perhaps the most successful group in America, with nearly two-thirds holding college degrees. Doors have opened wide to the once-closeted LGBT community.

But in other ways, the recent explosion of DEI initiatives reflects shortcomings of earlier efforts, as suggested by the headline of a 2016 article in the Harvard Business Review, “Why Diversity Fails.” Even as high-achieving first- and second-generation immigrants have thrived in certain industries, particularly STEM fields, people of color remain scarce in senior institutional positions. There is also the deeper issue of what many in the post-George Floyd era have taken to calling systemic or structural racism, citing major disparities for black Americans in education, health care, homeownership, arrests, incarceration, and household wealth.

More recently, a spate of widely publicized police killings of unarmed African Americans has galvanized a growing belief, especially among progressives and especially since Donald Trump’s election, that America is an irredeemably racist nation. In 2020, in the wake of the Floyd murder and in advance of a fraught election, a moral panic set in. Having increased their ranks, social justice entrepreneurs and bureaucrats were poised to implement an ideological agenda and compound their institutional power.

Although no hard numbers exist on the exact size of the industry, the “DEIfication” of America is clear. From Rochester, New York, to San Diego, California, cash-strapped municipalities have found the funds to staff DEI offices. Startups and small companies that once relied on their own employees to promote an inclusive culture now feel compelled to hire diversity consultants and sensitivity trainers to set them straight.

The field is so vast it has born a sub-field: recruiting agencies for DEI consultants. So-called “authenticity readers” tell publishing companies what are acceptable depictions of marginalized groups and who is entitled to tell their stories. Master’s degree and certificate programs in DEI leadership at schools like Cornell, Georgetown, and Yale offer new and lucrative bureaucratic careers.

At Ohio State University, for example, the average DEI staff salary is $78,000, according to public information gathered by economist Mark J. Perry of the American Enterprise Institute — about $103,000 with fringe benefits. Not to be outdone by its Big Ten conference rival, the University of Michigan pays its diversity officers $94,000 on average — about $124,000 with benefits. Until he retired from the position last summer, Michigan’s chief diversity officer, Robert Sellers, was paid over $431,000 a year. His wife, Tabbye Chavous, now has the job, at the vice provost rank and a salary of $380,000.

For smaller organizations that cannot afford a full-time equity officer, there are other options for shoring up social justice bona fides — namely, working with any of the hundreds of DEI consulting agencies that have risen like mushrooms after a night’s rain, most of them led by “BIPOC” millennials. With some firms, the social justice goals are unmistakable. The Racial Equity Institute is “committed to the work of anti-racist transformation” and challenging “patterns of power” on behalf of big-name clients like the Harvard Business School, Ben & Jerry’s, and the American Civil Liberties Union. With others, the appeal has less to do with social change than exploring marketing opportunities and creating a “with-it” company culture, where progressive politics complement the office foosball tables and kombucha on tap.

“Diversity wins!” declares the management consultancy McKinsey & Company. Certainly diversity officers have been winning, although opposition is building in Florida and elsewhere, where the wider woke agenda that includes DEI has advanced. Even minimally trained practitioners are in high demand, and signs of their influence abound.

Wells Fargo offers cheaper loans to companies that meet racial and gender quotas. Private equity and venture capital firms like BlackRock and KKR declare their commitment to racial “equity.” Bank of America tells its employees they are implicated in a white supremacist system. Lockheed Martin asks its executives to “deconstruct their white male privilege.”

Major tech companies like Google publicly chart the “Black+ and Latinx+” people they’ve hired and assure the public that Artificial Intelligence will prioritize the DEI political agenda. ChapGPT, an AI model that can generate remarkably cogent writing, has been designed with a liberal bias, summarily rejecting requests that don’t conform to the algorithm’s notions of “positivity, equality and inclusivity.”

Disney instructs employees to question colorblind beliefs espoused by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and others. Fire departments are told to lower their physical fitness requirements for women. Similarly, universities are dropping standardized tests to yield more admissions of certain minorities (typically not Asians). And the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, hoping to award more “films of color,” inspects Oscar-nominated films for cast and crew diversity. (Netflix has been a notable exception, last May laying off dozens of employees working on such issues. Under Elon Musk, Twitter is also flouting woke orthodoxies.)

In education, college students are required to take DEI-prescribed courses. Community college employees in California are evaluated on their DEI competencies. Loyalty oaths to the DEI dogma are demanded of professors. Applicants to tenure-track positions, including those in math and physics, are rejected out of hand if their mandatory DEI statements are found wanting. Increasingly, DEI administrators are involved in hiring, promotion, and course content decisions.

“Academic departments are always thinking, ‘We need to run this by Diversity,’” says Glenn Ricketts, public affairs officer for the National Association of Scholars.

The industry’s reach can also be seen in the many Orwellian examples of exclusion in the name of inclusion, of reprisals in the name of tolerance. Invariably, they feature an agitated clutch of activists browbeating administrators and executives into apologizing for an alleged trespass against an ostensibly vulnerable constituency. When that has been deemed insufficient or when senior executives have sensed a threat to their own legitimacy, they’ve offered up scapegoats on false or flimsy pretexts. That might be a decades-long New York Times reporter, a head curator at a major art museum, an adjunct art history professor, a second-year law student, or a janitor at a pricey New England college. (The list is long.)

Often enough, the inquisitions have turned into public relations debacles for major institutions. But despite the intense criticism and public chagrin, the movement marches on.

The expansion “happened gradually at first, and people didn’t recognize the tremendous growth,” Perry says. “But after George Floyd, it really accelerated. It became supercharged. And nobody wanted to criticize it because they would been seen as racists.”

Not playing along with the DEI protocols can end an academic career. For example, when Gordon Klein, a UCLA accounting lecturer, dismissed a request to grade black students more leniently in 2020, the school’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion office intervened to have him put on leave and banned from campus. A counter-protest soon reversed that. However, when Klein also declined to write a DEI statement explaining how his work helped “underrepresented and underserved populations,” he was denied a standard merit raise, despite excellent teaching evaluations. (He is suing for defamation and other alleged harms.)

Scores of professors and students have also been subject to capricious, secretive, and career-destroying investigations by Title IX officers, who work hand-in-glove with DEI administrators, focusing on gender discrimination and sexual harassment. As writer and former Northwestern University film professor Laura Kipnis recounts in “Unwanted Advances,” individuals can be brought up on charges without any semblance of due process, as she was, simply for “wrongthink” — that is, for having expressed thoughts that someone found objectionable.

With activist administrators assuming the role of grand inquisitors, “the traditional ideal of the university — as a refuge for complexity, a setting for free exchange of ideas — is getting buried under an avalanche of platitudes and fear,” she writes. And it would appear that students and professors would have it no other way. By and large, they want more bureaucratic intervention and regulations, not less.

As more institutions create DEI offices and hire ever more managers to run them, the enterprise inevitably becomes self-justifying. According to Parkinson’s Law, bureaucracy needs to create more work, however unnecessary or unproductive, to keep growing. Growth itself becomes the overriding imperative. The DEI movement needs the pretext of inequities, real or contrived, to maintain and expand its bureaucratic presence. As Malcolm Kyeyume, a Swedish commentator and self-described Marxist, writes: “Managerialism requires intermediation and intermediation requires a justifying ideology.”

Ten years ago, Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg found that the ratio of administrators to students had doubled since 1975. With the expansion of DEI, there are more administrators than ever, most of whom have no academic background. On average, according to a Heritage Foundation study, major universities across the country currently employ 45 “diversicrats,” as Perry calls them. With few exceptions, they outnumber the faculty in history departments, often two or three to one.

At Michigan, Perry wasn’t able to find anyone with the words “diversity,” “equity,” or “inclusion” in his job title until 2004; and for the next decade, such positions generally remained centralized at the provost level, working for the university as a whole. But in 2016, Michigan president Mark Schlissel announced that the university would invest $85 million in DEI programs. Soon after, equity offices began to “metastasize like a cancer,” Perry says, across every college, department, and division, from the college of pharmacy to the school’s botanical garden and arboretum, where a full-time DEI manager is now “institutionalizing co-liberatory futures.” All the while, black enrollment at Michigan has dropped by nearly 50 percent since 1996.

Despite the titles and the handsome salaries, most DEI administrative positions are support staff jobs, not teaching or research positions. In contrast with the provisions of Title IX, DEI is not mandated by law; it is entirely optional. DEI officers nevertheless exert enormous influence, in part because so few people oppose them. The thinking seems to be that if you’re against the expanding and intrusive diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda, you must be for the opposite — discrimination, inequality, and exclusion.

“By telling themselves that they’re making the world a better place, they get to throw their weight around,” says Ricketts. “They have a lot of money, a lot of leverage, and a lot of people who just don’t want to butt heads with them — people who just want to go along to get along. People who are thinking, ‘If we embrace DEI, nobody can accuse us of being racist or whatever.’ They’re trying to cover their backsides.”

Some organizations, it seems, are merely trying to keep up with cultural trends.

Consider Tucson, Arizona, where diversity is not a buzzy talking point but an everyday reality. With a population that is 44 percent Hispanic, 43 percent white, and only 4.6 percent black, the city has had no major racial incidents in decades. Yet like hundreds of others communities, Tucson suddenly decided in direct response to the Floyd murder 1,600 miles away that it needed an office of equity.

To many observers, it seemed that the city was just “getting jiggy with it,” pretending to solve a problem that didn’t exist. After a two-year search, it hired Laurice Walker, the youngest chief equity officer in the country, at age 28, with a salary of $145,000 — nearly three and a half times what Tucson’s mayor, Regina Romero, earns.

Not that the mayor is complaining. “I think this position is about putting an equity lens into all that we do,” Romero said in May, by which she means — well, nobody is quite sure what “equity” means, particularly with respect to federal legislation clearly prohibiting positive and negative discrimination alike.

But trying to get out in front of the DEI train can also result in getting run over by it.

When the city council of Asheville, North Carolina, hired Kimberlee Archie as its first equity and inclusion manager, its members probably didn’t anticipate being accused of having a “white supremacy culture.” After all, city manager Debra Campbell is black, as are three of the seven women making up the city council. The council had cut police funding and unanimously approved a reparations resolution.

Archie nevertheless complained that her colleagues still weren’t doing enough to advance racial equity. “What I describe it as is kind of like the bobblehead effect,” she said in 2020. “We’d be in meetings … and people’s heads are nodding as if they are in agreement. However, their actions didn’t back that up.”

The drama in western North Carolina illustrates a dilemma that organizations face going forward. They can pursue an aggressive political agenda in which white supremacy is considered the country’s defining ethos (per The New York Times’ “1619 Project“) and present discrimination as the only remedy to past discrimination (see Ibram X. Kendi). Or they take the path of least resistance, paying rhetorical tribute to DEI enforcers as the “bobbleheads” that Archie disparages but doing little more than that. After all, they still have universities, businesses, and sanitation departments to run, alumni and investors to satisfy, students to teach, research to pursue, roads to be paved, sewage to be treated, costs to be minimized, and profits to be maximized.

Perhaps, too, senior administrators and executives are beginning to realize that, despite the moral panic of 2020, the most culturally diverse country in the world might not be irredeemably racist, even if it’s no longer acceptable to say so. The United States twice elected an African American man named Barack Hussein Obama as president. His first attorney general was a black man, who would be replaced by a black woman. His vice president would pick a woman of mixed race as his running mate. The mayors of 12 of the 20 largest U.S. cities are black, including the four largest cities.

Likewise, many of the people whom Americans most admire — artists, athletes, musicians, scientists, writers — are black. Lately, most winners of MacArthur Foundation “genius” grants are people of color. Gay marriage is legal, and enjoys wide public support, even among conservatives. The disabled, neurodivergent, and gender-divergent are applauded for their courage and resilience. And nonwhite groups, particularly Asians, Latinos, and African immigrants, have been remarkably upwardly mobile (often without official favoritism).

Clearly, troubling disparities persist for African Americans. What’s much less clear is that racism, systemic or not, remains the principal cause of these disparities or that a caste of equity commissars will reverse them. And now, it would seem that narrowing these disparities runs counter to their self-interest.

“I don’t want to deny that there’s genuine goodwill on the part of some of these programs,” says Prof. Schuck, stressing that he hasn’t examined their inner workings. “But some of these conflicts are not capable of being solved by these gestures. They have to justify their own jobs, their own budgets, however. And that creates the potential for a lot of mischief. They end up trafficking in controversy and righteousness, which produces the deformities we’ve been seeing in policies and conduct.”

Still, to hear DEI officers, it’s they who are beleaguered and overwhelmed. Yes, they have important-sounding jobs and rather vague responsibilities. They are accountable to nobody, really. Rather than fighting “the man,” they now are the man, or at least the gender-neutral term for man in this context. But this also means that they are starting to catch flak, particularly as the evidence mounts that the institutions they advise and admonish aren’t actually becoming more fair, open, and welcoming. They’re not even becoming more ethnically diverse.

Like other DEI advocates, the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education has declined to answer questions for this article. Its officers are too busy traveling to conferences to do so, a spokeswoman said.

But at a recent association meeting, Anneliese Singh of Tulane University invoked Rosa Parks’ refusal to take a back seat to discrimination. Although Parks was a housekeeper and diversicrats have comfortable university sinecures, their struggles are analogously distressing, Singh suggested. The latter, too, are on the “front lines” in a harrowing war. However, she said, her colleagues needed to remember what mattered most: Looking out for themselves.

“It is not self-indulgence,” she said, now quoting the feminist and civil rights activist Audre Lord. “It is self-preservation. And that is an act of political warfare.”

For the moment, it’s a war Singh and her DEI colleagues are clearly winning.

Dems' Arguments Against A Clarence Thomas Statue Fall Apart,"Local leaders and state elected officials of Georgia rightly want to honor Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas with a statue on the state Capitol grounds to celebrate a native son who was born into poverty during segregation and now serves on the Supreme Court and is its most influential member. But because Justice Thomas is a principled black conservative, he triggers many Democrats into a rage, exposing their racism. Every Democrat state senator voted against authorizing this statute, and all their arguments opposing it are false.

Democrats claim Thomas’ views on issues are anathema to the black community. They say Anita Hill’s 1991 allegations of sexual harassment are disqualifying and complain that Thomas has failed to recuse himself from certain cases. And they insist it’s not appropriate to honor someone with a statue while they are living.

State Sen. Emanuel Jones made news last week by despicably calling Thomas an “Uncle Tom” because of his views and decisions that, according to Jones, betray his fellow black men to white people.

Thomas is indeed a ferociously independent thinker and has never bowed to any of these racist attacks. In 1998, when a retired left-wing, black federal judge tried to prevent him from speaking to the National Bar Association, the nation’s largest association of black lawyers and judges, Thomas responded in his speech by saying:

I have come here today not in anger or to anger, though my mere presence has been sufficient, obviously, to anger some. Nor have I come to defend my views, but rather to assert my right to think for myself, to refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though I was an intellectual slave because I’m black. I come to state that I’m a man, free to think for myself and do as I please. I’ve come to assert that I am a judge, and I will not be consigned the unquestioned opinions of others.

The role of a justice is not to vote according to the popular will of the American people or a particular constituency. It is to interpret the law as written, regardless of who is before you.

In contrast to what is portrayed by black leaders and their allies in the media, a majority of black Americans actually agree with Thomas on most issues. On affirmative action, 59 percent of black Americans oppose any form of racial preference in college admissions. Democrats support racial preferences in higher education. On abortion, 81 percent of black Americans oppose third-trimester abortions, but Democrats want abortion on demand up to birth. Eighty-one percent of black parents support school choice, but the NAACP opposes school choice. And 69 percent of black Americans support voter ID laws despite Democrats insisting that requiring an ID to vote is racist. Prominent black leaders attack Thomas because he exposes how they are more in line with white leftists, who fund many of these powerful organizations like the NAACP.

When Anita Hill made her last-minute allegations during Thomas’ Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1991, the overwhelming majority of Americans (by more than 2-1) did not believe her. Nearly everyone watched those hearings and judged the credibility of the witnesses, and they came to similar conclusions. Only 26 percent of women believed Anita Hill, and only 31 percent of black Americans believed her. Every one of her witnesses was not credible to support her charges, Thomas’ witnesses were credible, and her memoirs and her subsequent conduct make those points even more clear.

Even then-committee Chairman Joe Biden did not believe her. In fact, he called Thomas on the night he was confirmed to congratulate him, to tell him not to let the charges get him down, and told him he was a man of character. I know because I was there.

Hill used sexual harassment charges as a political weapon and admitted as much in a 1998 interview on “Meet The Press” with Tim Russert when she defended President Bill Clinton from credible sexual harassment and assault charges. (He later settled one of the cases.) Hill said she was willing to give Clinton’s behavior a pass based on his political views. She never said anything timely to hold Gov. Andrew Cuomo accountable, despite his harassing and assaulting scores of women, nor did she do anything meaningful to hold Biden accountable for Tara Reade’s allegations of sexual assault. Hill’s allegations were not credible, and she is not a credible spokeswoman.

The recent so-called ethics attacks on Thomas are another partisan double standard. Thomas has complied with all ethics and recusal laws to date. Democrats have invented new ethics “standards” after having no problem with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sitting on cases involving her lawyer husband’s law firm’s clients (and voting in favor of the client) and defending a liberal federal circuit judge sitting on a case involving a ban on same-sex marriages even though his spouse had spoken out against the ban and her organization had filed an amicus brief in the court below. And any criticisms about Jan. 6 are not serious, especially after the House Select Committee issued a comprehensive, 845-page report on the challenges to the 2020 election that did not mention Ginni Thomas once.

There have been many statues and buildings named after living people. Georgia dedicated a statue of former President Jimmy Carter in 1994 that is on the state’s Capitol grounds, and a statue of former President George H.W. Bush was dedicated in 2014 at his presidential library several years before he passed. There are more than 20 schools named after President Obama, five after President Clinton, and two after President George W. Bush. Justice Sonia Sotomayor even has a statue of herself in her hometown of the Bronx. There is nothing unusual or inappropriate about naming a school or dedicating a statue after a living person.

Thomas has led an inspiring and consequential life. He was appointed as our nation’s second black justice and is now the 12th longest-serving member of the court in history. He has written more than 700 opinions over his 30 years on the Supreme Court, setting forth an originalist jurisprudence that is principled and faithful to the Constitution. Many of his opinions are now the law of the land. He has been a mentor to many, most especially his law clerks, including Andrew Pinson, now a justice on the Georgia Supreme Court, and Bo Rutledge, the dean of the University of Georgia Law School.

But above all, Thomas is a kind and giving person. Here is what Sotomayor had to say about Thomas:

[W]e share a common understanding about people and kindness toward them. … That’s why I can be friends with him and still continue our daily battle over our difference of opinions in cases. Justice Thomas is the one justice in the building that literally knows every employee’s name, every one of them. And not only does he know their names, he remembers their families’ names and histories. He’s the first one who will go up to someone when you’re walking with him and say, ‘Is your son okay? How’s your daughter doing in college?’ He’s the first one that, when my stepfather died, sent me flowers in Florida. He is a man who keeps cares deeply about the Court as an institution, about the people who work there, but about people.

In a beautiful commencement address in 2008 at the University of Georgia, Thomas shared his advice to the graduates on how to live a good life: “First, show gratitude and appreciation. None of you, not one of you, made it here entirely on your own. … Help others as you wanted and needed to be helped. If you want to receive kindness, respect, and compassion, you must first give them.”

And he has never forgotten the importance of a helping hand when you are from a disadvantaged background. For years, Thomas has been very active in the Horatio Alger Association, an organization that, since 1984, has provided more than $245 million in college scholarships to more than 35,000 at-risk students. Every year, Thomas meets and spends hours with the students, providing advice and mentorship.

The state of Georgia should vote now to erect a statue to honor this Georgia native. In fact, I encourage state legislators and other leaders to read Thomas’ moving memoir, “My Grandfather’s Son,” or watch the fantastic documentary “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in his Own Words,” or read the book of the same name (for which I am a co-editor). You will understand even more why Thomas should be honored with this statue.

Mark Paoletta served as a lawyer in the George H.W. Bush White House Counsel’s office and worked on the confirmation of Justice Thomas. He is a senior fellow at Center for Renewing America, and partner at Schaerr Jaffe.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/22/all-georgia-democrats-angry-arguments-against-a-clarence-thomas-statue-fall-apart/,2023-02-22
