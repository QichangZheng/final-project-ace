Couch: The Tokyo Olympics can fix Kevin Durant's image problem and LeBron James fixation,"Kevin Durant is always shopping for a legacy. He can't seem to buy one.



He says he isn't moved by such things, or by talk of being basketball's GOAT, Greatest of All Time. But his actions scream something else entirely: An obsession with being LeBron James.

Durant has made all his moves and done all he can to be seen as the leader of this generation. He has made the big shots, won two championships. After sinking the game-winning shot over LeBron to pull within one game of winning the 2017 championship, Durant joyfully said that LeBron had ""passed the torch'' to him.

Durant's moves never seem right, never quite work.

This is his chance.





He is leading the U.S. Olympic basketball team, which has a historical legacy of its own in jeopardy. It was only a few weeks ago in an Olympic warmup that the U.S. lost to Nigeria, with Durant saying to give Nigeria credit for playing well.

Uh, no. Americans will never accept losing a basketball game to Nigeria, never understand how Durant could've let that happen.

The U.S. lost to Australia in a warmup, too, and then lost to France in the first round in Tokyo.

The U.S. has managed to improve — mostly because of Durant and weak opponents — and will play Spain Tuesday (shortly after midnight Eastern Time) in the quarterfinals.

Durant can't hide behind Steph Curry anymore, or James Harden and Kyrie Irving.

Maybe for the first time, his legacy is naked in front of the basketball world.

This should be everything he has dreamed of. If not, then he's a fraud. We'll know by Friday, after the gold medal game.

My pick is that he'll do it. Durant will win his third Olympic gold, one more than LeBron has, and he'll do it while LeBron is back home promoting ""Space Jam 2.""

It will be the best look Durant has ever had.

This is a team and program without a definition. U.S. basketball has gone from amateurs to the Dream Team of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. When the next generation of pros lost interest, and the U.S. lost the gold medal, a new system was put in to drive commitment under coach Mike Krzyzewski.

That system is gone now, Krzyzewski is gone, many of the top players decided not to show up.

LeBron, who stands up for his version of America any chance he gets, decided this summer, instead, to stand up for ""Space Jam,"" promoting his movie and leaving Tokyo to ...

That's right: Durant. This is his team. USA basketball is Durant's.

The criticism so far has been focused on coach Gregg Popovich. That's fine. The team hasn't dominated since Popovich took over. Players have grumbled about his offense.

After all that Popovich did in the NBA, five NBA championships and three coach of the year awards, his legacy is actually being challenged, too. The Olympics will do that to you, just ask John Thompson. For all Thompson's success as a college coach, social changer, and great human being, he had a hard time living down the 1988, bronze-medal Olympic team. A team flawed by a lack of outside shooting finished in third place. Thompson was never forgiven. America sent Michael, Larry, and Magic to the next Olympics.

The current team is lacking a strong presence under the basket. Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton all showed up at the last minute after the NBA Finals.

If a team can be rag-tag with a bunch of NBA players, then this is it. Durant scored just 10 points in the opening loss to France and didn't seem overly interested.

For some reason, critics found relief in the U.S.' blowout win over Iran. But the blowout over the Czech Republic, with Durant scoring 23, started to resemble an actual team playing as if it cares.

Durant is going to have to take this over from here. By chasing super teams all the time, it's never clear if he can do that.



In the 2016 Western Conference Finals, Durant and Oklahoma City blew a 3-1 series lead over Golden State. Durant then left for a ready-made championship team, Golden State, seemingly thinking titles there would build him a legacy.

Instead, he won two titles that were seen as Curry's. So Durant chased another super team, joining Irving and Harden in Brooklyn.

When Brooklyn lost Game 7 to Milwaukee in the playoffs this year, Scottie Pippen, an all-time great and former Jordan teammate, told GQ that Durant was no LeBron. Pippen said that LeBron would've found a way to win that game. Durant fired back on Twitter, ridiculing Pippen for his playing days.

The U.S. team still has more talent than anyone else. Durant is three games from a legacy. It's no ""Space Jam,"" but Olympic gold will do.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/couch-the-tokyo-olympics-can-fix-kevin-durant-s-image-problem-and-lebron-james-fixation,2021-08-02
Jason Whitlock says Hollywood wants to erase Christianity,"This weekend, I watched the movie ""One Night in Miami."" I know I'm late. It's been out since January. I'm reluctant to watch any movie made in the last decade. I can't take the woke narratives.

Anyway, friends, including Uncle Jimmy, promised me I'd like ""One Night.""

I didn't.

""One Night"" fictionalizes boxer Muhammad Ali's activities after he beat heavyweight champion Sonny Liston on February 25, 1964. Ali, along with NFL great Jim Brown and legendary singer Sam Cooke, is summoned to the hotel room of then-Nation of Islam spokesman Malcolm X. The four men engage in a robust and provocative conversation about race, America, their responsibility to bring about cultural change and their future plans.

It's a terrific premise that fails because the script ignores the elephant in every American room in 1964 — Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

Six months after King led his historic March on Washington and unveiled his ""dream,"" Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Jim Brown, and Sam Cooke spent hours confined in a hotel room combatively debating race and no one mentioned MLK. Really? I'm supposed to believe that?

This is not a small slight. It's yet another reimagining of history, a depiction of history that downplays the role of Christianity. The intent of the New York Times' 1619 Project is to demonize this country's Judeo-Christian roots and ethos. Judeo-Christian signifies America's Old Testament and New Testament biblical principles.

You didn't talk about race in 1964 without mentioning Martin Luther King. It's the equivalent of debating national-anthem protests without mentioning Colin Kaepernick. Christians, led by MLK, forced America to change for the better.



""One Night"" cleverly taps into a theme that all movies directed at black audiences now seemingly require — angry black radicals forced America to change for the better.

""One Night"" is the kindred spirit of Netflix's ""Judas and the Black Messiah,"" a movie that celebrated Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton. A movie painting Hampton, an unapologetic Marxist and atheist, as the messiah is both ironic and sacrilegious.

Hampton was called the ""chairman"" in honor of Chairman Mao Tse-tun, the founder of the People's Republic of China, an authoritarian ruler credited with killing millions through mass executions, starvation, and political persecution.

Hollywood movies subtly and overtly entice black Americans to abandon our Christian beliefs. Malcolm X is the protagonist of ""One Night."" Sam Cooke is the antagonist. Cooke is the godless, money-hungry proxy for Martin Luther King. Cooke represents hope and faith in the American dream. X and Cooke verbally spar throughout the movie. X chides Cooke for failing to make protest music the equal of Bob Dylan's classic ""Blowin' in the Wind.""

The movie concludes with Cooke performing ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" on ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" and Malcolm X seated on a couch at home nodding approval.

Here's my problem. In real life, Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, inspired Cooke to write ""A Change Is Gonna Come."" Cooke said so. Cooke performed the song on Carson's show on February 7, 1964 — 18 days before Ali fought Liston in Miami.



I like Malcolm X. I've read the Autobiography of Malcolm X several times. It's my favorite book. But Malcolm X had nothing to do with Cooke writing ""Change."" X and the Nation of Islam did not cause America to erase its Jim Crow laws. The Nation should be celebrated for rehabilitating incarcerated men such as Malcolm Little (X). I'm all for that celebration.

But let's be clear on who were the primary drivers of the eradication of slavery and other forms of legalized discrimination.

Christians did that. They're rewriting history, making movies glorifying angry bigots and atheists, so they can convince you that you don't need the real messiah, and neither does America.

Hollywood wants to make Jesus and all his disciples disappear.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/hollywood-1619-project-christianity-whitlock,2021-07-18
"Whitlock: Faith conquers fear, powers the American dream, and fuels my Blaze Media project","In the absence of religious faith, fear reigns and freedom recedes.

Discerning the origin of the current, fear-based American social climate is not difficult. Don't blame scientists in China for releasing the angst virus assaulting traditional American liberties.

Blame the tech engineers operating in Silicon Valley laboratories. They invented the social media apps that amplify fear and empower ""cancel culture,"" the nuclear weapons dislodging America from its Judeo-Christian values.

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey are Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Douglas S. MacArthur ending America's 60-year culture war with an unparalleled bombing campaign. What started with President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society initiative is closing with repression of speech, corporate media propaganda, and an evisceration of America's Judeo-Christian ethos.

Facebook and Twitter finished the mission of turning America secular, godless, and shamelessly immoral. The apps allegedly intended to bring us together have torn us apart. We should not be surprised. The apps urge self-worship, celebrity worship, and consumerism, which lead to hedonism, idolatry, and materialism.

A secular society always produces chaos and division.

Branded as racists, Uncle Toms, coons, homophobes, transphobes, hypocrites, and misogynists, American Christians fear publicly identifying themselves by their faith. They've placed their political identity and racial identity above their religious identity.



They're conservatives. Or Republicans. Or nationalists, both white and black. Or libertarians. Or liberals. Or social justice activists. Or, worse, Trump supporters and Trump resisters.

They avoid saying the name that made John Brown and Frederick Douglass abolitionists, compelled Thomas Jefferson to write that ""all men are created equal,"" comforted Union soldiers during the Civil War, and inspired Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. They avoid directly referring to the name that made America great in the first place, the name that forced us to overcome our superficial differences and transform those differences into our greatest strength.

Jesus.

He's been canceled, crucified by a toxic secular culture that bullies His believers with threats to expose their sins on the Satan-con Valley social media platforms and/or the Satan-con Valley-catering corporate media outlets.

Fear is the enemy of truth, freedom, and the American dream.

I signed a contract to partner with Blaze Media on a digital media project dedicated to pushing back against the corporate-supported, systematic effort to undermine America through racial division and fear. I joined Blaze Media because I wanted to partner with people who wouldn't look at me funny when I referred to Jesus as part of my journalistic worldview and platform.

I joined Blaze Media because Glenn Beck smiled when I said Jesus is the only solution for what ails America, because Steve Deace wears his faith publicly, and so do Phil Robertson, Allie Beth Stuckey, and others.

I am not a sports journalist-turned-preacher. I'm not a finger-wagging hypocrite looking down on the people who don't share my beliefs. I'm a sinner. I'm the same guy who wrote hilarious Pussy Galore columns for Fox Sports, the same guy who used to waste his time and money drinking and carousing inside the Spearmint Rhino in Las Vegas, Tootsie's in Miami, Diamond Joe's in Kansas City, and Magic City in Atlanta.

I'm someone who knows that in order for me to make better decisions — in all aspects of my life — I need Jesus.

I'm someone who recognizes that any success I've achieved in a 30-year career is a byproduct of the values my grandmother, a tiny church in Indianapolis, my parents, and my siblings instilled in me as a young boy.

My testimony is amazing. It's further evidence of the power of faith and the availability of the American dream.

My brand and approach to journalism and broadcasting are fearless. My courage is rooted in faith.

Fear is destroying America. It locked us in our homes, forced us to cover our faces, and forbade us to worship together for more than a year. It stole freedoms we took for granted. It allowed Colin Kaepernick to polarize our national anthem. It turned rare incidents of deadly police misconduct into a fictional genocidal pandemic. It spawned race hoaxes and a generation of race-baiting grifters. It diminished sports' ability to unify.



That's why we are launching the Fearless platform, which will start with my show, ""Fearless with Jason Whitlock,"" and a second podcast showcasing my friendship with my right-hand man, ""Uncle Jimmy"" (Dodds), and will eventually include a Fearless writing vertical.

We're going to fight back. We're going to be the abolitionists of fear. From my new hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, we're joining hands with Beck, Deace, Robertson, Mark Levin, Steven Crowder, Dave Rubin, Allie Beth Stuckey, and the rest of Blaze Media to stand as an example of what Americans can accomplish when we put our differences aside and work together.

On the surface, Fearless will look a little different from the rest of the Blaze Media family. But our love of country will be just as strong, our appreciation for this nation's founding documents just as sincere, and our search for liberating truths just as intense.

The 400-year African American journey is this nation's most compelling and powerful narrative. It's proof the American dream is real and attainable. That's why our adversaries abroad and within are perverting, manipulating, and weaponizing the African American narrative. Black Americans' fight for freedom made the United States live up to the ideals espoused in the Declaration of Independence — the equality of man and unalienable rights bestowed by our Creator.

Our relentless pursuit of freedom was the iron that sharpened American iron.

The Chinese Communist Party knows this. The revolutionaries in Satan-con Valley know this. The editors at the New York Times know this. The trained, self-described Marxists who founded Black Lives Matter know this.



In order to destroy America, you must cripple belief in the rags-to-riches American dream and the conviction that America is a force for good. Reshaping the African American narrative into a journey that damns this nation — rather than one that illuminates our unprecedented resolve to do better — hastens our decline.

The black journey fueled American exceptionalism. The elite architects of chaos cleverly and covertly attack this obvious truth.

""Black Twitter"" is not an organic construct. It's a social media algorithm designed to paint any truth-speaking public figure as a racist or a race traitor. The New York Times' 1619 Project isn't journalism. It's the companion of academia's virus, critical race theory, propaganda designed to foster racial animus and erode black patriotism. Black Lives Matter isn't concerned with the welfare of black men. It's a fundraising arm of the Democratic Party and a lobbyist for the LGBTQ agenda.

The racial conflict BLM, Antifa, and social media influencers promote smokescreens a far more insidious plot — the plot to cancel Jesus and impose a cultural Marxism on the United States. Global elites prefer China's system of authoritarian governance and worker exploitation. Backers of the Great Reset and Build Back Better prefer that America function the way China does. Jesus and communism cannot coexist. Karl Marx, the father of Marxism and the proponent of communism, explained that in his political theory.

The racial smokescreen is working. We're losing the faux race war and surrendering the freedoms that made America the envy of the world.

We're losing because we've sidelined our best soldier — Jesus. The original combatants of the Civil War drew on Jesus as their primary power source. Have you ever studied the lyrics of the Battle Hymn of the Republic?

Here's my favorite passage:

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was borne across the sea

With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me

As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free

His truth is marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah

Julia Ward Howe, a white abolitionist, wrote those words in 1861. The words spurred men to sacrifice their lives for the freedom of others. Mine eyes have seen the glory of what Americans can accomplish when we come together as one nation under God, when we conquer our fears.

Your sin does not nullify your Christianity. It justifies it. Let go of that fear. Your sins, no matter what they are, do not prohibit you from speaking truth, standing on biblical principles, and being heard.

The enemies of truth, the elites rewriting history and redefining American freedom, are not silent or scared. Their immorality (sin) emboldens them. Our sin silences us. Not any more. Not if I can help it.

The mission statement of the Fearless Project is simple: We're a digital media platform dedicated to promoting a culture of fearlessness, free speech, truth-seeking, and American patriotism.

We will accomplish our mission by critiquing, lampooning, and probing the events shaping conversations around sports, race, and popular culture.

You will not have to believe what I believe to enjoy and benefit from ""Fearless."" That's the gift of a Judeo-Christian culture. It works to ensure that non-believers receive the same opportunity to pursue their dreams as everyone else.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/jason-whitlock,2021-06-08
"Nike and LeBron serve China, not America, says Jason Whitlock","Late last week, Nike CEO John Donahoe inadvertently explained the difference between NBA legends Michael Jordan and LeBron James.

In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Donahoe described the shoe brand's commitment to China.

""Nike is a brand that is of China and for China,"" said Donahoe, who joined Nike in January 2020. According to Yahoo News, Donahoe spent his first weeks as CEO ""scoping out Nike's operations in China.""

The Bible and common sense have spoken authoritatively on the Portland, Oregon-founded and based company's dilemma.

""No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other."" —Matthew 6:24

Nike cannot serve America and China. It has chosen its master, and it is not us.

China is a communist-run, authoritarian, racist country. America is (or has been) a democratic republic pursuing freedom and fairness. You can't be of China and for China and serve America.

For the past decade, American sports fans, sports writers, and sports broadcasters have debated the on- and off-court differences between 1990s NBA superstar and Nike pitchman Michael Jordan and 2010s NBA superstar and Nike pitchman LeBron James.



The off-court difference could not be more clear. Jordan spoke for Nike when the company was a brand of America and for America. James speaks for the company that now serves China.

Keep in mind, Nike is Jordan's and James' primary employer. The $40-billion-a-year shoe company pays Jordan and James far more than the $8-billion-a-year NBA. The reality is the NBA is the marketing department of Nike. The NBA's main purpose is to sell sneakers in general and Nike's in particular. No other major sports league is as dependent on and under the control of a single sponsor as the NBA is to Nike.

Former NBA commissioner David Stern is credited with hatching the league's plan to take the game international. The truth is Nike founder Phil Knight devised the plan. After conquering the U.S. market, Knight wanted to colonize and overtake China.



""We've always taken a long-term view,"" Donahoe told Wall Street analysts on Thursday. ""We've been in China for over 40 years. Phil (Knight) invested significant time and energy in China in the early days and today we're the largest sports brand there.""

Knight instructed Stern to prioritize international growth. That's why the NBA has had zero interest in preserving and protecting college basketball. America's college stars do not resonate in China. Unlike the NFL, which benefits from the ready-made stars that enter the league from college, the NBA hasn't authentically supported rules that would keep its future players on college campuses for three or four years.

But let me get back to Jordan and James.

Michael avoided politics because the American market was still important to Nike during his heyday. LeBron is an anti-American, far-left political activist because that messaging serves China, Nike's master.

Of course, you've been led to believe James is outspoken on police shootings because he's a voice for voiceless poor and working-class black people. James is Nelson Mandela in gym shorts, according to Nike and corporate media.

James is a businessman doing business with Nike. So are Colin Kaepernick, Serena Williams, Megan Rapinoe, and all the other multi-millionaire woke warriors.

Let me tell you which poor and working-class black people have no voice: The parents of young men slaughtered daily by random gang violence. Who speaks for them?

Ben Crump? Al Sharpton? Black Lives Matter? Don Lemon? Van Jones? Joy Reid? Anderson Cooper? Antifa? Kamala Harris? Barack Obama? Colin Kaepernick? Charlamagne tha God? John Legend? Cardi B? Maxine Waters? Nancy Pelosi? Shaun King? Jemele Hill? Max Kellerman?

Who? Anyone you see regularly on a national platform?

The police kill on average approximately 250 black people (and 450 white people) per year. According to Statista, in 2019, approximately 14,000 Americans were murdered and 7,500 of the victims were black.

The 250 black people killed by police have about 250 national spokesmen appearing on television weekly. Who do the 7,500 murder victims have?

I'll wait here as you Google an answer. Let me give you a hint. LeBron James' name ain't gonna pop up.

China doesn't allow it. China is a racist country that has no use for black people who can't sing, dance, or dunk a basketball at the very highest level. This is an open secret. American-based global corporations know how China treats black and brown people.



This is personal for me. A former Ball State football player (my alma mater) spent more than two years in Chinese prisons on bogus assault charges. Look up the story of Wendell Brown. While you're at it, look up the story of Jeff Harper, the former Iowa Wesleyan basketball player who spent five months in a Chinese prison because he came to the defense of a Chinese woman being assaulted on the streets by a Chinese man.

Nike, the NBA, LeBron James, and countless other American businesses and businessmen are trying to serve two masters – America and China. Guess which master they hate.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/nike-lebron-china-america-bible-whitlock,2021-06-27
Squires: Afghanistan failure demonstrates America’s identity crisis hurts the world,"The fall of Kabul and the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan are a stark reminder of how much identity matters to a country. Unfortunately, America's identity obsessions are major vulnerabilities that have been met with aggression from our adversaries and threaten the stability of our own nation.

The longest war in United States history is concluding in the worst way possible. A suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. servicemen and at least 60 Afghans in an attack on Aug. 26 outside Kabul's airport. This is yet another reminder of how quickly the situation in Afghanistan has descended into chaos, despite the best efforts of President Biden and top military officials to assure Americans that everything was under control.

Most Americans assume that the world's mightiest military would be able to train up a national Afghan Army over the course of nearly twenty years and prepare it to fight religious insurgency in its home country. Despite the U.S. military's best efforts, the Afghan Army disbanded once the national government collapsed earlier this month. The Taliban's blend of fundamentalist Islam and Pashtun cultural norms is a combination that would be completely foreign to the average American. Part of the reason the Taliban recaptured the country so quickly is because it is a lot clearer about who it is and what it believes than either the Afghan Army or the American politicians and military brass who are winding down the war.

America is battling an identity crisis because our ruling class and the people who identify with their beliefs have forgotten who we are. This is most clearly seen in our domestic political fights about CRT and vaccine passports, but it also has implications for how we engage the world. The American experiment of representative government, expressed through our constitutional republic, is not the default across the globe. We have enjoyed stable, orderly transitions of power for so long that we underestimate how hard it is to build a nation. We are equally unappreciative of the effort it takes to hold one together, especially one with such ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity.



The Taliban has deeply held religious principles, and its adherents are willing to die for them. Our leaders have trendy beliefs and don't even have the courage to debate them. American politicians included $10 million for gender programs in Pakistan — paid for by a COVID-relief spending bill last year meant for Americans — but deny the gender binary even exists back home.

The Biden administration is busy trying to fashion a woke utopia by parroting trendy equity-speak, insinuating someone other than women can get pregnant, doing land acknowledgements before official government meetings, and promoting recruitment videos for the military and intelligence agencies that focus more on personal narrative than national identity. Our military leaders focus on ""white rage"" in congressional hearings; our embassies hoist the LGBT pride and BLM flags across the globe; and our current president rescinded regulations that blocked taxpayer-funded foreign aid from being used for abortions overseas. We assume our positions on these issues are the correct ones and export them to other countries without considering how they square with their customs, cultures, and beliefs.

We are a country divided by race, confused about the biological reality of gender, ashamed of our complicated national history, and paralyzed by fear. The Afghan Army surrendered its country because its identity and resolve were no match for the Taliban's. We are losing our country because our national identity is being taken over by narcissistic identitarianism. Our nation of over 330 million is splitting into factions held together not by timeless truths rooted in our own Judeo-Christian heritage and founding documents but by superficial tribal similarities.

Many Americans have concluded that nation-building is a misuse of American military and financial resources. I would argue that nation-sustaining is just as difficult when you're in the midst of an identity crisis. A country that sees itself and the world through a set of lenses clouded by skin color, sex, sexuality, and party affiliation will always have difficulty understanding the complexities of tribe, religion, sect, and ethnicity that are a fundamental part of life in other parts of the world. Even worse is a country whose leaders have disdain for half its citizens. That type of country is unstable and could collapse at any time, because no empire lasts forever.

"Squires: Americans need truth, logic, and courage to free our institutions from 'pregnant men' and 'female penises'","The recent exchange between Professor Khiara Bridges and Senator Josh Hawley provides an important lesson about the state of America’s most important institutions. Bridges, who teaches at the University of California's Berkeley School of Law, was invited to testify at hearing on abortion access. Hawley asked her whether her repeated use of the phrase “person with the capacity for pregnancy” was her way of saying “woman.”

Over the next minute, she claimed “trans men” and “non-binary” people are also capable of pregnancy, stated Hawley’s line of questioning was “transphobic,” and claimed his refusal to affirm the idea of male pregnancy was tied to the suicide rates among trans people. The media outlets that hailed Bridges for “owning” Senator Hawley make our current state of affairs even clearer.

America’s most important institutions have lost public trust because of the corruption, incompetence, and political ideology of the people leading them.

We live at a point in human history when the most wealthy, educated, and powerful people in the country will not acknowledge the most basic truths about men and women. Their attempts to redefine reality cannot build or preserve anything. Destruction, both literally and figuratively, follows them like a shadow.

Attempts to rationalize the sudden acceptance of “pregnant men” and “women with penises” have two certain outcomes: brain rot from the inability to think logically and spiritual demoralization from the unwillingness to speak truthfully. Neither one is healthy for the future of the republic.

Smugness and self-importance aside, the power the ruling class exerts over our lives makes these changes even harder to accept.

In 2021, Americans were told that COVID vaccines would prevent infection and transmission. This claim was repeated by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, as well as Bill Gates and President Biden. They were obviously wrong.

Leaders with humility and wisdom would admit their error and chart a new course. The people who run our institutions did the opposite. Over the next year, Merriam-Webster changed the definition of “vaccine,” people were fired for disobeying mandates, and the media attempted to silence dissenters.

My trust in our national COVID response was shaken much earlier. On June 5, 2020, more than 1,000 public health professionals signed an open letter arguing that large protests against racial injustice should be allowed, even as some people still couldn’t leave home to work.

The letter stated, “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.” The signatories clearly understood COVID’s political leanings, because they later clarified that their letter should not be taken as an approval of all protests, particularly ones against stay-home orders.

Their message was clear: Visiting your family may prove deadly, but having 10,000 people crammed cheek by jowl into the town square is fine if they have the right political views.

If the public health establishment was COVID’s biggest loser in public trust, the public education system took the silver medal. One year of unions fighting to keep schools closed and parents seeing what their children were being taught did more to advance school choice than decades of conservative political rhetoric.

Likewise, police abolitionists wish they could be as effective at undermining conservative confidence in law enforcement as images of an Ohio mom being tased and handcuffed at an outdoor football game and a New York City man being assaulted by police officers for violating social distancing rules. The videos of police inaction in Uvalde have only compounded the damage COVID did to the public image of police.

The leaders of our institutions have a vested interest in slowing – and reversing – their decline. In the near future, saying that you graduated from Harvard or Stanford won’t confer any prestige. It will be an indication that you’re a sucker who could have paid half the price to a state university if your goal was to “learn” that men can get pregnant.

Professor Bridges has an impressive set of credentials, but her attempts at linguistic and emotional manipulation during her congressional testimony were a lesson in trans activism 101. Any institution that lends its reputation, whether through credentialing or employment, is implicated in her attempts to frame biological truth as an existential harm to trans people.

The truth is that higher rates of suicide, anxiety, and depression should be expected among people whose minds are in conflict with their bodies. Civil wars – whether within the body politic or the human body – always have casualties. The mental health concerns associated with transgenderism are caused by a denial of reality, not insufficient affirmation. It is neither loving nor kind to encourage a person to live by lies.

External attacks often strengthen institutional resolve. Internal arguments are rendered insignificant in the face of an advancing enemy. Survival always trumps unanimity. Conversely, no amount of external whitewashing and advocacy can prop up an institution that is dead on the inside. No amount of browbeating can convince people that up is down or 2+2 = 5. They may mimic the right words, but that does not mean they believe the lies.



College professors, elected officials, CEOs, journalists, and activists assume their advanced degrees, hefty salaries, and political power are enough to justify the trust we place in their words. They are clearly mistaken. They blame the public for being insufficiently compliant, but their criticism is being aimed in the wrong direction. This problem won’t be solved by putting us under a microscope. If correction is what they seek, it is time they look in the mirror.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-america-needs-truth-courage,2022-07-15
Squires: COVID-19 has created American god-kings – but we don’t have to serve them,"The author of a recent column in the Los Angeles Times titled “Mocking anti-vaxxers’ deaths is ghoulish, yes — but necessary” perfectly captures the current direction of American social life.

The author argues that people who raise questions about government orders should be publicly ridiculed if they die from the coronavirus in order to teach others a lesson.

The entire column reflects the ethos of a nation whose fading faith in God has been redirected toward an unholy trinity of big government, big business, and big media more than willing to be the object of our affection, veneration, and obedience.

COVID-19 has ushered in America’s “god-king” era.

By any reasonable measure, it is clear that Americans are less religious than we have ever been. One Gallup survey found that church membership fell below 50% for the first time in 80 years. Another study from the Pew Research Center found that the percentage of Americans who identify as Christians fell from 78% in 2007 to 63% in 2021, while the percentage of religious “nones” who identify with no particular faith rose from 16% to 29% in the same time period.

At the same time, Americans seem to be defining ourselves by our politics more than ever before. The infusion of race, gender identity, and sexuality into every aspect of the culture has intensified this change. People wear their political beliefs on their sleeves and seek out others with the same views. One survey found that 30% of Democrats in 2020 are unlikely to have friends with very different political views. This is up from 16% in 2016. The percentage of Republicans unwilling to have friends across partisan lines increased from 16% in 2016 to 20% in 2020.

These trends are two of the most important cultural developments facing our America today.

It is no wonder that as our country grows more secular, the citizenry has become more comfortable with being ruled by god-kings, who have been aided by the crisis in faith brought on by the pandemic. Impending doom and fear of death often push people to seek out religion.

Big government, big business, and big media have filled that void.

Elected officials have grown comfortable issuing orders in the name of public health and safety about what medical treatments people must take. Disobedience is met with the threat of financial and social punishment. They have also taken on the role of provider for more Americans. We understood it in 2020 when temporary payments went to workers forced out of their jobs by the lockdowns. Now there are calls for more permanent payments for people who think the existence of any risk due to COVID is a reason not to work.

Large corporations in the god-king era have become unelected, unaccountable instruments of public policy. They are the implementation arm of government mandates related to masking and vaccination – threatening to terminate the employment of their workers and withhold service from customers who do not comply. They also insert themselves into contentious political debates around voting laws, abortion, and even gender.

Their influence often has the effect of subverting the will of the people. This is why the Republican governors of Arkansas and South Dakota were harshly criticized by Tucker Carlson and other conservative personalities for allowing Walmart and other business interests to pressure them into opposing bills that would have restricted girls’ sports to biological females.

The third, and often most influential, part of this alliance is corporate media. Journalists whose job should be to challenge the powerful and hold them accountable now challenge the powerless and hold us responsible for social outcomes they don’t like.

The recent L.A. Times column that argues for mocking the deaths of “anti-vaxxers” captures this phenomenon perfectly. It is much easier to find opinions like this in liberal news and media sites than an editorial that is critical of any aspect of the current administration’s response to the pandemic.

The ruling class in a constitutional republic with democratic elections should acknowledge an authority higher than the civil government, respect civil liberties and individual rights, encourage debate, and respect the principles embodied by the phrase “consent of the governed.”

What we have in America today is very different. The unholy trinity thinks it is the highest authority, echo chambers have replaced debate halls, and individual rights are trampled.

They do all of these things with the help of minor prophets who craft sacred texts – and tweets – that are used to separate true believers from infidels. These people change the definition of gender, convince us men can become pregnant, tell us which protests are righteous, and enforce compliance with all the new rules of society.

The god-kings and their supporting institutions obsess over race, but a person’s skin color tells you nothing about their values and beliefs. But what a person believes about God – if anything – can give you some clues. People who think Caesar is the highest authority in the land must look to him, his oracles, and vice-regents for meaning, protection, and provision.

The only way to end this era is to put our faith in something higher than the government. Jesus did that when he told his disciples, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” As a Christian, I acknowledge that civil government is a creation of God. The Bible teaches that the government’s authority, like all human authority, is derived from God to reward good and punish evil. That doesn’t mean its authority is unlimited, as evidenced by biblical examples of people defying government orders.

Finding those limits can be difficult at times, but the lines become much brighter when an elected official–or unelected bureaucrat–claims the power to make unilateral health decisions for millions of people without any debate. The same goes for politicians who forbid churches to meet in person while encouraging thousands of people to take to the streets for their approved protests.



The decision before us is clear. Some will continue to grow even more dependent on our god-kings who reject absolute truth, only speak the language of transactional politics, and believe moral problems are answered with material solutions. Others will put their faith in the true and living God who is worthy of all honor, glory, and praise.

Squires: The gun control debate proves hypocrisy is a bipartisan feature of our political system,"Thousands of Americans gathered in Washington, D.C., for the March for Our Lives rally this past weekend to call for additional gun control laws in the wake of the high-profile mass shootings in Buffalo, Uvalde, and Tulsa. Other rallies took place across the country as gun violence survivors, activists, politicians, and celebrities intensified their demands for Congress to “do something” about guns.



The difficulty of passing gun control legislation reflects a broader reality in American political life: The U.S. Constitution itself has become a political Rorschach test that both parties cling to or discard depending on how it fits their goals and serves their constituents. One photo from the D.C. event explains this phenomenon on the political left.

It read “Outlaw Guns, Not Abortion.”

This sentiment captures the worldview differences that fuel our political divisions. When it comes to a procedure that has a 100% death rate, Democrats do not want any legal restrictions and claim to be protecting a constitutional right that isn’t mentioned anywhere in our founding documents.

When it comes to firearm ownership, which actually is in the U.S. Constitution, they favor enough restrictions to render the right inaccessible. Democrats also seem immune to the “they’ll just get them illegally” argument that has become a familiar retort in our national abortion debates. When it comes to made-up constitutional rights, waiting periods, age restrictions, and parental notification all get cast aside.

This explains why Democrats have been promoting the “Protecting Our Kids Act,” which recently passed in the House, without any hint of irony. It also highlights the reason the March for Our Lives receives so much more media coverage than the March for Life rally that has taken place every January since 1973 to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision.

As is often the case when it comes to politics, hypocrisy is a bipartisan feature of the system.

The Second Amendment is the golden child to constitutional conservatives. The Fourth Amendment is the red-headed stepchild. This is why red-flag laws are rejected as a strategy to combat mass shootings but stop-and-frisk is accepted as a solution to street crime. Conservatives used the standard of “reasonable suspicion” mentioned in the Terry v. Ohio Supreme Court case to defend violating the civil liberties of American citizens in the name of public safety.

Some conservatives and libertarians, including Maj Toure and Dana Loesch, have consistently rejected threats to both constitutional rights. They have been the exception.

The editors at National Review defended stop-and-frisk in New York City in 2013, and most conservative commentators spent more time in 2016 talking about athletes kneeling during the national anthem than reports of unconstitutional police practices in Baltimore.

One of the cardinal rules of gun safety is never to point your weapon at something you don’t want to destroy. Public policy can function in a similar fashion. In both instances the person wielding power has to ensure that their sights are set on the correct target.

Being young, black, and male in a low-income neighborhood is not a crime. Neither is being middle-aged, white, and a legal gun owner in the suburbs. Asking both groups to accept significant impositions on their civil liberties because a small subset of people who look like them break the law is a dangerous proposition. The erosion of constitutional rights for the masses for the sake of targeting a small minority is the slipperiest of slopes in a constitutional republic.

Mass shootings in schools, churches, and grocery stores are often carried out by people who have purchased their firearms legally. The majority of homicides in large cities (e.g., Philadelphia and St. Louis) are committed with guns that are not legally owned and registered to the shooters. Suicides by gun actually constitute the largest number of gun deaths but generate the least amount of media coverage. Accidental shootings that occur when firearms are not stored and handled properly typically get local media attention because they often involve children.

The problem with our gun debates is that political talking points on both sides are used in ways that fail to account for important nuances.

Raising the age to purchase an AR-15 from 18 to 21 could keep those weapons out of the hands of disaffected, troubled teenagers and prevent a future mass shooting. Those would obviously be good outcomes, but outlawing AR-15s would also put millions of gun owners in a very tenuous legal position and prevent law-abiding citizens from accessing a popular means of self-defense.

One Florida woman used an AR-15 to defend her family after burglars broke into her home and pistol-whipped her husband. She shot one of the men, who died in a ditch near her home.

She was eight months pregnant.

This is not an anomaly. Firearms are used for defensive purposes thousands of times per year. This is an important part of the gun control debate that needs to be highlighted, even as we can acknowledge the pain of families and fellow citizens who have lost loved ones to self-inflicted or deliberate acts of violence.

American politics are at an inflection point. Identity politics is on its deathbed. Conservatives have the opportunity to craft a strong, sustainable multi-ethnic base founded on common values and the protection of constitutional rights. The left will counter and say it is doing the same thing, but its political constituency is built on the assumption that the main goal of politics is the procurement and provision of resources.

Those two political philosophies are not the same.

Protecting rights is not a zero-sum exercise. The politician who fights for Second Amendment rights is helping the black man in Philadelphia as much as he is the white man in Peoria.

Promising and providing resources is very different, because favoring one group often implies holding something back from another. Racial discrimination in the GI Bill’s implementation after World War II is one commonly cited example. The effects, both on specific groups and national cohesion, are no different today.



The Second Amendment is an anti-tyranny measure, whether that oppressive rule is expressed through direct government force or the abdication of appropriate state power. That doesn’t mean guns are idols to be worshiped, but it does mean both sides should recognize that feelings of helplessness and hopelessness can quickly lead to calls for more state power. This is true whether it’s the left talking about random acts of violence using guns or the right complaining about the concerted effort to confuse and sexualize young children in K-12 schools. When families are falling apart and church pews are gathering dust, the government inevitably takes on the role of both father and priest. That is a future we should all want to avoid.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-gun-control-hypocrisy-parties,2022-06-14
"Squires: If Democrats peeked under the hood of ‘white supremacy,’ they’d find a mirror, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama","Democrats have accused white conservatives of being racist for decades, but now they have identified an even more dangerous group of advocates for white supremacy: black people.

That line of attack was used against Larry Elder during his recall election, Condoleezza Rice after she criticized critical race theory, and Winsome Sears after she became the first black lieutenant governor in Virginia's history.

Most people don't believe a black person running for public office would do anything to intentionally hurt himself, family, or community. Part of the problem is the extent to which the term ""white supremacy"" has been stretched to encompass things that no American associates with race.

White supremacy has historically meant the belief in the inherent superiority of white people (i.e., people of European descent) over non-whites. The use of that term was applied to the justification for American chattel slavery, Jim Crow laws, and racial discrimination. White supremacy was also associated with intense racial violence, including lynchings, church bombings, and other racially motivated attacks carried out by white people against black citizens throughout American history.

No group epitomized the ideology of white supremacy in this country more than the Ku Klux Klan, and no image captured their moral deprivation and spiritual bankruptcy more than a burning cross. What makes the ideology of white supremacy so toxic is that it assumes some of God's created beings are better than others because of something as insignificant as skin color.

Using white supremacy to describe political opinions Democrats don't like is immoral. It trivializes real acts of racial terror in the past and minimizes the progress the country has made on race. It also incentivizes Americans to attack the very things (e.g., strong families, quality education) we need for the republic to survive.

That is why it is worth honestly assessing major positions on the Left and Right, expressed through culture and policy, to determine whether any of them advance notions of white superiority or black inferiority today.

Regarding the family, the 2020 Republican platform states, ""Traditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children and instilling cultural values.""

The 2020 Democratic platform only mentions marriage one time, in connection to the practice of forced marriages in other cultures.

Democrats do not see the nuclear family as a necessary ingredient for positive social and economic outcomes. Their platform and rhetoric reflect a worldview that believes the government can play the role of provider that has traditionally been the responsibility of husbands and fathers.

Another issue closely linked to the family is abortion. The differences between the two parties could not be clearer. Republicans are generally opposed to abortion and want to repeal Roe v. Wade. Democrats seek to codify the landmark Supreme Court decision to prevent state laws from restricting abortion. Several states, including New York and Illinois, have legalized abortion up until the point of birth.

Education is another area where distinctions are clear. Conservative support for school choice, including public charter schools and voucher programs, is based on the belief that parents know what education options are best for their children. Some liberals are in favor of school choice, but many others want to limit charter schools and oppose vouchers because both are seen as competition by the teachers' unions that overwhelmingly support Democrats.

The left also believes in injecting race essentialism and gender ideology into K-12 classrooms. Large urban school districts across the country are eliminating entrance exams for specialized schools, gifted programs, and grades in the name of equity.

Crime also provides an opportunity to see the differences between conservatives and leftists, both in rhetoric and policy. The conservative response to an increase in crime, including violent offenses, is typically a call for more police officers and law enforcement resources. The left's response in recent years has been defunding, decriminalization, and de-incarceration. Democrats see American policing as a leading cause of racial disparities in incarceration but ignore the fact that black people are disproportionately the victims of violent crime.

The differences in worldview extend to culture as well. The left completely supports public displays of sexuality in music, movies, television, or awards shows. Leftists even promote it to children through Drag Queen Story Hour and LGBTQ messaging in shows for toddlers. Conservatives typically support parents who see these things as inappropriate for young children.

Prominent liberal outlets like Teen Vogue also support prostitution, pornography, and other forms of sex work. Conservatives have been on the other side arguing that the body was made for more than performing degrading sex acts for money.

My question to any Democrat who cynically accuses conservatives of promoting white supremacy is simple: Whose worldview would a grand wizard endorse?

Would he applaud a pro-abortion agenda that leads to half of all black babies in New York City being aborted or support a pro-life platform that would lead to a larger black population in America?

Would he call for defunding the police in response to the murders of black people living in high-crime neighborhoods? Perhaps he would be like Democratic Rep. Cori Bush and call for defunding the police for the black citizens being killed at a rate seven times higher than white while paying $70,000 over two months for private security.

Given the link between family structure and social outcomes, would he want more children raised by single mothers or nuclear families? Would he see strong black men who love their wives and are dedicated to their families as a threat or an asset?

Would he endorse a hip-hop culture that uses black artists to promote murder, misogyny, and drug abuse to black teens enticed by money and fame? If he did, would he also volunteer his daughter to have her body groped on camera by artists?

Would he think being white is a ""privilege""? Would he see anything that is all-black as segregated and inherently inferior?



Would he want black students subjected to lower standards in school by teachers eliminating high standards for the sake of equity? Would he be happy to learn that wealthy liberals like the Obamas and Bidens send their children to expensive private schools while blocking similar opportunities for low-income black students?

These are all questions Americans should ask themselves if one party is committed to using a term as loaded as ""white supremacy"" as a rhetorical cudgel. I bet many would be surprised to find out who's behind the sheets.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-if-democrats-peeked-under-the-hood-of-white-supremacy-theyd-find-a-mirror-joe-biden-and-barack-obama,2021-11-09
"Squires: January 6, 2021, was a political inversion, not an insurrection","Like many Americans, I viewed the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, as a source of national embarrassment. It was an event marked by violence, chaos, and disorder. It was also the culmination of a post-election, pre-inauguration period characterized by serious claims of election fraud that were not substantiated.

That doesn’t mean skeptics didn’t have legitimate issues. An essay in Time magazine entitled, “The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election” detailed efforts by a group of business leaders, left-wing activists, and political operatives to “save” the election by, among other things, changing voting laws and pressuring social media companies to censor content.

The essay made it clear that a bipartisan coalition of the country’s most powerful people did not want another four years of a Trump presidency. But at a time when we needed seriousness, sobriety, and specificity to instill confidence in our elections, the public was bombarded with spectacle and silliness about rigged voting machines and promises to “release the kraken.”

As the nation reflected on those events one year later, I was reminded of another reality from that day.

Jan. 6, 2021, was also an inflection point in American politics that was more about political inversion than insurrection. It was the day that the protest went from laudable to condemnable, violent mobs went from agents of liberation to foot soldiers for fascism, and fatal police shootings went from racist to righteous.

Prior to that day, Democrats described riots as the “language of the unheard,” which is why their response to political protests that occasionally turned violent in the summer of 2020 was very different. From the time of George Floyd’s death until the 2020 election, Americans were bombarded with images of angry mobs getting into violent clashes with police, statues being defaced and torn down, businesses being ransacked and destroyed, buildings being burned, and citizens being assaulted.

All of this was done in the name of racial justice, and all of it was minimized by the people whose only concern was getting President Trump out of office.

Conservative politicians and media figures condemned the behavior, but the response from their political peers across the aisle and leading voices in the culture was a mix of defense and denial.

Democrats spent the summer of 2020 condemning the police as systemically racist and using terms like “defund,” “disrupt,” and “dismantle,” in reference to America’s political, civic, and cultural institutions.

Sen. Tom Cotton’s op-ed in the New York Times argued that the Insurrection Act could be invoked to deploy the military to assist local law enforcement to quell the unrest sparked by the death of George Floyd. The paper later disavowed the op-ed after writers at the Times claimed Cotton’s idea would endanger the lives of black staffers.

Nikole Hannah-Jones, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at the Times and creator of the 1619 Project, appeared on CBS and stated, “Destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.” She also tweeted that she would be honored to have the violent protests of 2020 called the “1619 riots.”

Elected officials on the local level also played a significant role in legitimizing 2020 chaos and anarchy for political ends. Former Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan allowed activists to overrun a police station and establish the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone in her city. She shocked former CNN host Chris Cuomo when she said Seattle could have a “summer of love” in response to a question about how long she would allow CHOP to exist.

People who use political violence to disrupt the normal functioning of government or achieve a political goal – regardless of the cause – inject chaos and disorder into a stable society.

We are a nation whose government was created of the people, by the people, and for the people. Our republic only exists to protect and preserve the safety, freedoms, and interests of its citizens. We elect people to office to serve those interests.

Our political culture has been completely inverted.

Politicians and their advocates in the media behave as if the citizenry exists to serve them. People, families, and small businesses are not individuals and institutions worthy of legal protection and cultural preservation. They are merely opportunities for more votes and more tax revenue, both of which give our rulers more power.

In an election year, all that power had to be marshaled to defeat Trump. He is the star of our idolatrous political culture – whether as an object of adoration and fealty on the right or contempt and scorn on the left.

Jan. 6 epitomized everything that is wrong with the American ruling class. Its members only care about things that directly impact them and serve their interests. As long as the chaos, disorder, and destruction achieved their political goals, it didn’t matter who suffered. Journalists stood with straight faces and told viewers that a protest where buildings were set on fire was “mostly peaceful.”

Liberal politicians and pundits accused the Trump administration of using excessive force when law enforcement cleared Lafayette Square after protesters clashed with police near the White House. The same people mocked Ashli Babbitt after she was shot and killed in the Capitol.

John Adams stated, “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”



This is why the secularization of American culture has had such a corrosive effect on our society. We rarely talk about morals, values, and principles. Our debates are all about material goods, resources, and votes. Nothing is transcendent. Everything is transactional.

The book of Proverbs says, “When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.” Dishonest, intemperate, self-interested leaders – regardless of party – who defend chaos and disorder will only make our groaning grow louder.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-january-6-2021-was-a-political-inversion-not-an-insurrection,2022-01-07
Squires: John Adams told us the US Constitution is ‘only designed for a moral and religious people’,"The mass shooting at an elementary school that claimed the lives of 19 children and two adults in Uvalde, Texas, was the second killing in less than two weeks carried out by a disaffected, disconnected teenage male. The nation grieved together and tried to process the unspeakable pain of grieving parents, families, and school staff in Uvalde.



It is hard to understand why the shooter, Salvador Ramos, would kill innocent children at school. Unlike the Buffalo shooter, Ramos did not attempt to justify his actions in a political manifesto or seem to be motivated by any racial grievance.

Based on firsthand accounts from family and others who knew him, Ramos was a high school dropout with anger issues, an unstable family life, and few friends. In the absence of a clear motive or politically beneficial racial dynamics (e.g., white shooter and nonwhite victims), the national conversation has quickly shifted to guns.

There have been calls to ban ""assault weapons"" and pass stronger background checks. Ramos had no criminal history and legally purchased his AR-15-style rifles after turning 18, which required a background check. It is hard to say what, if any, specific changes to our current laws would have prevented this tragedy. The demand for new laws after every mass shooting and viral street crime reveals a much deeper issue that goes back to our nation’s founding.

John Adams, a leader of the American Revolution and our second president, was clear about the limitations of state power.

We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution is designed only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for any other.

Adams’ words reveal a belief that morality and self-government are preconditions for liberty and freedom. People who cannot control their own feelings, passions, and behaviors require control from external sources. This is why some families can’t have a holiday dinner without a visit from the local police department.

Our nation feels increasingly unstable because we have no moral center. The Founding Fathers had diverse beliefs about religion, but they never saw themselves as omniscient mini-gods able to control an entire nation. This was a thoroughly Christianized nation for much of our history. Several states had established churches at the time the U.S. Constitution was ratified, and prayer in public schools was common until the 1960s.

Some people see these types of overt religious expressions as a slippery slope to theocracy, but a separation of church and state does not necessitate the separation of faith and public life. The truth is that we are no less religious now than we were in previous generations. The only difference is that we have a new source of faith and outlet for spiritual fervor.

Joe Biden said he saw his campaign for president as a “battle for the soul of the nation,” but the replacement of religion with politics is a bipartisan symptom of cultural sickness.

There are people on the right who hold to the words of the last president as if he were a pope endowed with infallibility when making political claims ex cathedra. True believers on the left prefer a flavor of political protestantism that is always ready to take to the streets. Their souls will never rest as long as there is some issue to protest, whether racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia or abortion, climate change, and sexual modesty.

A nation that lives by the tenets of the Ten Commandments, including prohibitions against stealing, murder, and adultery, will produce a more stable, orderly culture than one that attacks God’s design for the family, calls killing the unborn “reproductive justice,” and promotes the mutilation of adolescents as “gender-affirming care.” The leaders who run our largest cities are much more supportive of tax dollars funding drag queens teaching children about preferred pronouns than pastors reading from the book of Proverbs.

We often hear about the dynamics of a big fish in a small pond. That metaphor speaks to the size of the surrounding environment. We should think about what happens to a big fish in a polluted pond. Air and water quality are not just issues pertaining to our physical environment; they also apply to culture.

As is often the case, the spread of immorality and dysfunction ultimately lead back to the first institution created by God – the family. The decline in marriage and two-parent homes has had a significant impact on the health and wellness of American children. Absent and uninvolved parents – especially fathers – often lead to unprotected children who struggle with feelings of unworthiness and abandonment. Even parents who are physically present but preoccupied with work, their own relationships, or social media can be completely unaware of all the forces attempting to ensnare their children.

Children – especially boys – need a sense of identity and purpose. They need close relationships, a meaningful mission, and goals that orient them toward the future. This is why the “success sequence” – finishing high school, working full-time, and marrying before having children – should be the foundation of all policy discussions about young adults. Young people need to know they have agency, despite the circumstances of their birth and the families into which they were born.

The Bible teaches that the institution of government was created by God. Problems arise when civil magistrates think they are the highest authority and arbiter of morality. Governing officials who believe they can single-handedly control entire economies, save the planet, and eradicate sin have delusions that eventually lead to despotism, the very outcome the founders wanted to avoid. Like the false gods described in the scriptures, their viciousness is a function of their impotence. Anger results when people realize the chasm between their perceived power and their ability to actually change the world around them.

Laws are important, but they must be kept in their proper perspective. Without an objective, external standard of morality, they devolve into an expression of the majority’s perceived virtues and preferred vices. They demonstrate our values, but they cannot make us moral.

Previous generations spoke of the world in transcendent terms, openly acknowledging a Creator and the fallenness of human nature. Leaders today speak in transactional terms, framing the presence of evil as a reflection of unmet material needs.



The most unique element of the American experiment isn’t the racial and ethnic diversity of our country; it’s the twin concepts of self-government and individual liberty. People who use their liberty to kill innocent children, abuse the elderly, steal from hard-working neighbors, promote drug use, degrade the human body through sex work and pornography, and deny human biology are in deep spiritual bondage. No amount of money or power can purchase freedom from the shackles of sin. Only repentance and faith in Jesus Christ can change a man’s heart and deliver freedom from sin to pursue good works. That kind of liberty lasts for eternity.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-john-adams-us-constitution,2022-05-27
"Squires: The push for reparations should prompt hard questions, not emotional reactions","The state of California made news last week when its reparations task force voted to limit any future reparations programs to the descendants of free and enslaved black people who were in the United States in the 19th century. The move was controversial because some people wanted all black people, regardless of lineage, to be included.

Eligibility is one of many contentious issues tied up in the push for reparations. What makes the debate so difficult is the reality that emotion acts as the primary driver of any discussion, even among people who are in favor of monetary compensation.

The push for reparations is not new. Rep. John Conyers first introduced the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act in 1989 and reintroduced it in subsequent congressional sessions over the next 30 years until his retirement.

Others have made the argument in the broader culture, including lawyer and activist Randall Robinson’s book ""The Debt"" in 2001 and the 2014 essay in the Atlantic by Ta-Nehisi Coates entitled “The Case for Reparations.”

The issue picked up steam in the 2020 Democratic primary, and now a bill to study reparations – building on the work of Rep. Conyers – is stalled in the House.

The public conversation around reparations today includes proposals for everything from direct cash payments to free college tuition, land, business grants, and tax exemption. It also rests on lineage distinctions between American descendants of slavery (ADOS) and black immigrants from the Caribbean and Africa who came to America in the latter part of the 20th century.

Black Americans who support reparations feel they should be able to collect the recompense their ancestors were owed for the hundreds of years of labor that were uncompensated through legalized slavery. They would also argue that even after the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment, efforts to grant freedmen full citizenship rights were consistently blocked, whether by the premature termination of the Freedmen’s Bureau or the enactment of Jim Crow laws that made segregation the norm through public policy and social custom.

They can also point to the fact that slave owners in the nation’s capital were provided with reparations under the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act. The net effect of these decisions was the legal prioritization of white Americans and disadvantage of black Americans that, having accrued over centuries, has led to disparities in social and economic outcomes from wealth to incarceration.

Those who oppose reparations generally agree that the United States has a bloody and ugly racial history. Their arguments would be that much has been done to remedy the sins of the past, from the establishment of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to the enactment of civil rights legislation, starting with the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and culminating with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Their other argument is that neither slave owners nor the enslaved are currently living, which undermines the legal and ethical justifications for reparations, and it is unfair to ask American citizens today who have no family connection to slavery to pay for the sins of the past.

Both sides make compelling arguments, but moving the debate forward requires honest answers to rarely asked questions.

People who support reparations based on continued wealth disparities and the impact of government policy should be prepared to answer whether they would support financial remedies that are concentrated on black Americans who are currently living in poverty or black senior citizens who lived through the Jim Crow era. Would reparations supporters sign off on payments of $50,000 to ten million poor and elderly black people instead of $15,000 to 32 million black people, including CEOs, doctors, and lawyers?

The financial eligibility issue leads another important question: Is the inevitable disruption of social cohesion in the future worth the cost of paying for the sins of the past? Anyone who denies the possibility of backlash to programs that prioritize the needs of middle-class black Americans over all other groups, especially the poor, is either in a state of self-delusion or has no understanding of human nature. Disputes about who is entitled to money and land after the death of a parent have been causing family discord for centuries, even when legally binding documentation is in place.

People don’t always express their frustrations publicly, but that doesn’t mean the Guatemalan woman who cleans the homes black families in leafy black suburbs won’t ask herself why people who send their children to expensive private schools need more resources from the government. The same goes for the Vietnamese nail technician who spends hours doing mani-pedis for black women who make three times her wages.

Even the guiltiest white liberal may start singing a different tune when they see the federal treasury providing checks to their black manager who spends his days running the marketing division and his nights tweeting about the oppression he experiences in corporate America.

Reparations proponents may be tempted to wave these concerns away as distractions, but there is a big difference between the philosophical debates about the ethics of compensation and the political realism of getting 90% of the population to support legal and financial programs specifically targeted at 10% of the population.

Those who oppose reparations have their own set of questions to answer.

One is whether they would support a Truth and Reconciliation Commission similar to the one created by South Africa after the fall of apartheid that did a full accounting of the implementation and impact of racist laws and social customs but promised no financial compensation.

Would the types of people who think any honest, public discussion of historical racism is unnecessary in 2022 be willing to have public testimony on family separation during slavery, Reconstruction-era racial violence, land theft, convict leasing, debt peonage, redlining, blockbusting, restrictive covenants, and all the other ways in which the government either enacted policies that treated black people as second-class citizens or protected private actors who did the same?

These are just a few of the questions that would need to be addressed, but the central question is this: Would a reparations grand bargain be enough to satisfy what advocates believe is owed to the descendants of freedmen?

The reparations debate is framed as a debt the country owes its black citizens, but paying a debt is different from opening a line of credit. Once the former is paid, the debtor is released from financial obligation to the debtee.

The ultimate question for both sides is whether reparations are worth pursuing if it means that debt is stamped “paid in full” and future claims of America’s inherently racist nature would go ignored.

The impact of that reality would be put to the test when LGBTQIA+ activists piggyback on the efforts of black Americans to push for their own compensation program. They would undoubtedly use similar arguments about the wealth that could have accrued to individuals if not for laws that banned same-sex marriage up until the 2015 Obergefell decision.

Part of what reparations advocates want is exclusive resource allocations, which is why a national proposal to provide universal basic income would not suffice.

I don’t expect any of these questions to persuade the most entrenched actors on either side of the debate. I do, however, hope that everyone else would take a few seconds to consider them.



There is no doubt that race is still one of the central realities of American life and will likely continue to be so in perpetuity. Even Will Smith’s slap at the Oscars was framed through the prism of America’s racial history.

The question is what is the best way to move forward in a country that looks drastically different in 2022 than it did in 1822. America in 2022 is a large, diverse nation with people who have different ethnic backgrounds, religious traditions, political priorities, and economic interests.

Any major reparations package would have to involve our normal democratic processes and would require coalition-building to withstand opposition. We must all answer whether it is more important to provide compensation for the injuries of previous generations or to pass on a functioning republic our descendants will want to inhabit.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-the-push-for-reparations-should-prompt-hard-questions-not-emotional-reactions,2022-04-05
Squires: The ‘Richard Snipp’ letter proves the assault on the black mind and man has been decades in the making,"I recently came across the text of a letter from a man named Richard Snipp. I'm assuming the name is a pseudonym, although he occasionally refers to himself as Dick in other letters. Mr. Snipp's letter appears to be written to political officials who wanted to know how to reach, influence, and ultimately control the minds of black voters.

The letter sounds like a cross between the mythical ""Willie Lynch"" letter on how to make a slave and C.S. Lewis' ""Screwtape Letters,"" which were fictional instructions from a demon on how to lead a man to damnation. The author's candor and prescience are striking. I invite everyone to read it. Much like the Willie Lynch letter, I can't prove its authenticity (or deny writing it myself), but no one can refute its recipe of total mind control and emasculation of black people.

*******************

July 14, 1986

Greetings to all:

I write to you today to help you understand strategies to capture and control the African-American mind. Like a body with an autoimmune disease or a majestic edifice with a cracked foundation, the goal is to get these people to collapse in on themselves, because brute force has never worked on them. The external pressure forced them to fight like a balled fist. We tried to break their families during slavery, but they only grew stronger in emancipation. We banned them from reading and writing so that they would stay ignorant. That only made them thirst for knowledge even more. We tried to keep them from voting. They marched and showed up in droves. We can't pry their fist open. We must make them open it themselves if we want them to lose their power.

Listen to me and I will teach you how.

The first rule you MUST understand: ALWAYS and in EVERYTHING, keep them fixated on race. The second rule is equally straightforward: Teach them to make white people the center of their world. We want them to respond to our views, opinions, values, and actions while they ignore their own.



The goal of the first two rules is to use their pain against them. They know that ""race"" is a fiction. Some of their scholars even admit as much when they call it a ""social construct."" This fiction is the central part of their identity since they were stripped of their ethnic heritage through enslavement. It continued to be the central part of their identity when they were assigned second-class citizenship during Jim Crow. Use that history against them. Once you make them see themselves as negro FIRST, even ahead of being human, you can get down to business.

The first place to attack is the family. Start by pitting the men and women against each other. Teach them that the natural family unit should NOT be promoted in public and that marriage is part of white cultural norms. Fill their women's heads with the same feminist propaganda ours have been indulging for some time. Tell them they are fighting oppression on two fronts: men like us in the workplace and their own husbands in the home.

Teach the men that they are oppressors as well. Make their views on children and family sound more like the works of Gloria Steinem than Malcolm X. If we convince them to mimic their women who say unwanted babies are a burden, they'll come to see killing them as freedom and attempts to stop it as bondage. That's exactly what we want.

Convince their women that the government is just as suitable a father as their men. When you do that, men will start to withdraw. They'll realize they are no longer responsible for the children they father. That is good. That one change alone will provide a tremendous return on our investment.

Convince them that ""conservatism"" is really a code word for racism and conservatives are really closet Klansmen. Dismiss any ""bootstrap"" talk as conservative so that they reject it. Convince them they have no boots and that their feet don't even work. That will make them easier to carry. That is what we all want. We want them to be sustained by the strength of OUR hands, not their own.

Again, remember the cardinal rule: ALWAYS and in EVERYTHING, keep them fixated on race.

Teach them to be alienated from THEIR country. Frame the country's history with enslavement as the CENTRAL point of this great republic. That way, when they hear ""patriot,"" they'll think of the Italian immigrant before their own kinsmen who fought in every war since this country's founding. Teach them that a government focused on protecting rights is racist but that one focused on providing resources is righteous.

Convince them that their image only matters when we diminish it. Portraying them as oversexed, violent brutes in the early 20th century was thoroughly rejected. We had the wrong messengers. Replace whites promoting that message with their own artists, entertainers, and even civic leaders, and it will stick for multiple generations.

Don't worry about their preachers. They have proved so effective at their job of social transformation that they have abandoned the transformative power of the Gospel for the transactional power of politics. Others are too compromised to be effective moral leaders. Both groups are ill-equipped to deal with the challenges that come with broken families and a culture that rewards dysfunction. As I said before, they have made us the center of their world. They ONLY pay attention to the things WE do, which means the enemies within meet little resistance. Their leaders are watchmen who can't see, warriors who won't fight, and guard dogs who don't bark. We are always looking for those types to put on our payroll.

ALWAYS and in EVERYTHING, keep them fixated on race.

Make them think someone else's opinions of them are more important than how they see themselves. Condition them to see race-hate, regardless of how infrequent it is, as a much more urgent concern than self-hate, regardless of how common it is.

They are starting to murder each other at alarming rates. Good. That's part of the plan. We didn't expect it to start so soon, since they constantly talk about being black and proud. Don't believe it. Make them think cold stares from us are more harmful than hot lead from their own.

These things are useful for any people. Anyone is susceptible to propaganda and misinformation, but those who have dealt with serious trauma, passed on through the generations, are particularly vulnerable to a deeper, more powerful force level of emotional manipulation and spiritual capture.

Police their borders of thought and public opinion with ruthless tenacity. Call any who stray house negroes, Toms, coons, sellouts, and any other name that strikes at what they value most — their racial identity. We CANNOT allow them to start challenging our ideas. Total fealty to THE MESSAGE is what we want.

Condition a Pavlovian response to their skin color. Link their history of being black to being downtrodden and oppressed. Get them to believe anything that is all black is ""segregated"" and inferior. Don't be fooled by the superficial expressions of race pride. Those only last until a prominent white person says he doesn't want to marry a black woman or won't send his child to their schools. Eventually when they hear the word black, they'll fill in the other words subconsciously. That way you teach them to hate themselves. We need that because a self-hating person is an easily controlled person.

Eventually they'll be torn between viewing race as a socially constructed phenomenon and the essence of their very identity. They will hate the way race has been used against them yet resist any attempts to reduce its social significance. Like a child who needs solid food but can't bring himself to release his mother's teat, they will return to what is comfortable and familiar whenever their social equilibrium is disturbed.



In closing, remember the cardinal rule: ALWAYS and in EVERYTHING, keep them fixated on race. Never let them know that these ideas started in the very institutions they clamor to send their children to. Always make them think this is propaganda from the Klan, not the Ivy League. Do this long enough and even when we all leave for the moon, they'll claim that racism is what's holding them back. Well, at least the ones who stay will. Half will follow us because they want to be wherever we are.

In Control,

Dick",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-the-richard-snipp-letter-proves-the-assault-on-the-black-mind-and-man-has-been-decades-in-the-making,2021-09-08
Squires: ‘What Is a Woman?’ proves godless hedonism – not Christian nationalism – is America’s biggest threat,"""What is a Woman?,"" the documentary film from Daily Wire podcast host and political commentator Matt Walsh is not primarily about women. It’s not even mainly about transgenderism or the excesses of leftist dogma related to sex and gender.



The documentary is about the nature of truth and as such, it's ultimately about theology more than biology. Walsh is an outspoken Catholic, but he never tackles the subject from a religious perspective. That may have been a strategic choice, given how left-of-center media outlets are trying to convince Americans that the biggest threat to the future of the republic is the growing number of conservatives who advocate for policies informed by their faiths.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The biggest problem our culture faces is godless hedonism, not Christian nationalism.

Matt Walsh asked a simple question – “what is a woman?”– to college professors, medical professionals, elected officials, activists, and ordinary citizens. Very few even attempted to give a straightforward, logical answer. It is hard to give an answer when your mind has been conditioned to think in terms of “your truth” or say that a person’s self-perception is “their reality.” One college professor in the film said Walsh’s use of the word “truth” itself was “transphobic,” “condescending,” and “rude.”

This is why our entire culture has come to believe that a person can change their sex simply by claiming they identify as the opposite sex. The reason Lia Thomas is a household name is because activists and journalists focus on hormone levels and fairness for trans athletes instead of basic definitions. If women’s sports are for women and men can’t become women, then there is no reason whatsoever for a man to be competing in women’s sports.

The elevation of the self above all rational objective thinking is also why there seems to be a sudden explosion of drag queens engaging with young children. The ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" programs in local libraries have morphed into drag queens reading and performing in public schools as well as drag events for young children in adult clubs. These events are posted online as if men twerking and gyrating in front of young children is perfectly normal and acceptable, but only if those men are dressed up as women.

The modern left has no limit on the types of content and activities adults can introduce to children in the name of LGBT progress. That became crystal clear by how liberal entertainers, lawmakers, and journalists responded to a bill prohibiting schools from discussing matters of sex, sexuality, and gender identity with young children. They said “gay” for weeks in their state houses, on news broadcasts, and at awards shows because they believe the desires of adults should always take precedence over the needs of children.

The denial of objective truth is a rejection of God. There is a straight line from biological evolution to political revolution to cultural devolution.

If human beings have no creator who provides our standards of morality, then human flourishing is a function of having the right people in power to control our lives, not a matter of spiritual health. Societies don’t suffer from too much sin; their problem is not enough Caesar.

The problem with that worldview is that chaos ensues when the concept of objective truth is rejected, people believe they can create their own realities and feelings become the final arbiters of good and evil.

What we are seeing in the West is the inevitable collapse of this way of thinking. Leftist dogma regarding the value of life, the human body, biological sex, human sexuality, and the definition of family are all part of the same death spiral. According to the Bible, God wants humanity to “be fruitful and multiply” and build order into our world that allows us to fulfill that command. Reproduction requires male and female participation. Marriage provides the ideal context for the provision and protection of women and dependent children. The scriptures declare the value of human life is inherent because of our common creator.

The practitioners of progressive politics disagree. They believe abortion up until birth of is a human right and think toddlers can change their genders. The family structures they prefer promoting cannot reproduce offspring without external assistance. Their command to fellow humans is, “be fruitless and destroy.”

This is the dystopian future of butchered babies, harvested eggs, rented wombs, and sterilized adolescents. Charles Darwin would probably describe this entire agenda as “artificial selection” because there is nothing natural about a species that sees the death and destruction of its young as a sign of social progress.









We live at a time where we have more financial resources, technological advances, and access to knowledge than at any point in history. We also seem more despondent, depressed, nihilistic, disconnected, and narcissistic than ever. That’s because material wealth does not give life meaning, and education is not the same as wisdom.

A lifetime of expensive formal education from the most elite institutions is worthless if it makes a person deny objective truth. None of the Maasai tribesmen Matt Walsh encountered studied medicine, law, or philosophy at Harvard, yet they understand the difference between men and women better than the people who have.

The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 3:19, “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: 'He catches the wise in their craftiness.'”

Our inability and unwillingness to answer the question “what is a woman?” has caught us in a trap we can’t escape with more worldly wisdom. Only time will tell whether we will continue following the path of man’s wisdom or embrace the peace that accompanies God’s truth.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-what-is-a-woman-proves-godless-hedonism-not-christian-nationalism-americas-biggest-threat,2022-06-06
Whitlock: Memorial Day expresses gratitude while Juneteenth promotes entitlement,"One hundred, fifty-seven years ago, freed American black people inspired the Memorial Day celebration.



At a park in Charleston, South Carolina, approximately 10,000 Americans – led by black schoolchildren and church leaders – gathered to honor the sacrifice of 251 Union soldiers buried at the site of an outdoor Confederate prison camp.

It was May 1, 1865, just three weeks after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox and three months after Charles Macbeth, the mayor of Charleston, surrendered his city to Union forces.

A spirit of gratitude triggered the outpouring of remembrance and desire to give Union soldiers a proper burial.

Three years later, John Logan, the commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, a fraternity of Union soldiers, proclaimed May 30 as Decoration Day. A hundred years later, Congress renamed it Memorial Day.

The origin of Memorial Day is more important today than perhaps at any time in America’s history. It highlights a sad and tragic pivot in American culture. It speaks to black Americans’ unique and powerful influence on the zeitgeist.

America’s shift from a culture of gratitude to entitlement can be analyzed and explained by study of the attitude of black people. The Marxist forces seeking to topple American exceptionalism perverted the history, identity, and minds of black Americans.

They turned this country’s strength – black Americans’ faith-based journey toward freedom – into a weakness. They turned the African-American journey into a narrative arc that damned this country and its founding principles rather than one that celebrated America and the brilliance of the founding documents.

Black Americans’ pursuit of freedom caused this country to live up to its highest ideals and Christian values. Black men of faith – from Richard Allen, the founder of the African Methodist Episocal Church, to Frederick Douglass, the slave turned abolitionist, to Booker T. Washington, the educator and entrepreneur, to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. – stood as this nation’s moral compass.

The left undermined the black man, eviscerating his authority in the home with government assistance and financially rewarding him for betraying any allegiance to morality.

The history of black people has been redefined as a retelling of tragedy, oppression, and white supremacy victimization. This new narrative is focused on creating a sense of entitlement and inspiring other Americans to follow suit.

It’s worked beautifully. We’ve seen the formula work across popular culture. Nike rose to dominance selling Air Jordans to black inner-city drug dealers. The prevailing sentiment in fashion is to win the wallets of black consumers and white consumers will follow.

Black people made gratitude cool in 1865 the same way we’ve made entitlement cool in 2022.

Everybody is in constant search of victimhood. It’s the easiest path to power. It explains why Rachel Dolezal and Shaun King renounced their whiteness to identify as black. I’ve seen it happen within my own peer group. A former white friend of mine took on his mother’s maiden name so that he could benefit from being mixed-race. He spent his first 35 years on earth content as a white man. Now he’s not. He’s part of an oppressed minority group, which makes him more valuable in the workplace.

A couple of weeks ago, the comedian Bill Maher wondered why so many American young people are identifying as gay or trans. It beats being white. It qualifies you for entitlement.

Americans are in a race for privilege. We used to race toward freedom, and we were extremely thankful for the men who protected it. Now we’re locked in a death race for the undeserved privilege we think someone else benefited from, a privilege we pretend we despise.

We don’t despise privilege. We covet it. Worse, we don’t recognize or honor the privilege of being born American.

Instead of falling to our knees to thank God for raising ancestors who sacrificed everything for our freedom, we waste our time on social media trying to analogize our oppression to people who actually suffered injustice. That’s how a millionaire major league baseball player feels racially insulted when an opponent calls him Jackie Robinson.

The desire for entitlement and privilege is yet another sign of our cultural decay, our secular pivot. We’ve abandoned our biblical values and principles of gratitude and forgiveness and adopted entitlement and privilege.

Memorial Day has far less meaning. Many Americans don’t even know its purpose: the celebration of servicemen lost in battle.

Another leftist comedian, Jon Stewart, complained this weekend about our lack of reverence for Memorial Day.

“It’s hard not to be here today and not get frustrated again, because as I look out in the crowd, I see the same thing I always see – veterans and their families and caregivers,” he said. “But where are the American people? This is Memorial Day weekend.”



The American people are preparing for “Juneteenth,” the national holiday in remembrance of the George Floyd riots. Actually Juneteenth is a remembrance that black slaves in Texas were the last to be freed by Union soldiers. It became a national holiday two years ago in the aftermath of George Floyd.

Juneteenth is a celebration of oppression. Memorial Day is a celebration of sacrifice and an expression of gratitude toward those who made that sacrifice.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-memorial-day-expresses-gratitude-while-juneteenth-promotes-entitlement,2022-05-31
"Whitlock: MSNBC’s ‘Three Stooges’ — Maddow, Reid, and Wallace — invite election viewers to hell on social media’s earth","Last night I watched MSNBC's election coverage. It was anchored by Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid, and Nicolle Wallace, the Mo, Sha'Carri, and Shirley of the Alphabet Mafia.

The three stooges of sexual identity, racial identity, and gender identity presented a portrait of American reality far different from my interpretation.

In their view, critical race theory doesn't exist and certainly isn't being taught in American schools, an investigation into Thomas Jefferson's worldview is a high priority, Jan. 6 was a violent bloodbath that nearly toppled our republic, and Virginia's gubernatorial race was a referendum on re-instituting Jim Crow laws.

The picture painted by Maddow, Reid, and Wallace likely explains why Republican Glenn Youngkin won his race for governor and why he'll be joined in office by Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears, the first black woman to win a statewide election in Virginia.

It's difficult to retain and sustain power with lies. The political left and its propagandists in corporate media have been lying nonstop for the past year. A wise con man conceals his lies with occasional truths. Politics attract con men, both left and right.

Big Tech and its social media apps convinced Democrats to be unwise, to abandon truth completely. Big Tech believes its Twitter and Facebook algorithms are in control of truth.

Youngkin and Sears believe in a much higher power, a truth spelled out in the Bible and backed by the blood of Jesus.

Democrats and their pundits will spend the coming days and months trying to figure out how the state of Virginia elected President Joe Biden by a 10-point margin and 12 months later elected Youngkin and Sears. They will, of course, blame racism, Donald Trump, the Proud Boys, and Thomas Jefferson, and eventually they will shred Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe as a horrible candidate.

They will not admit that voters rejected their reliance on lies. They will not admit that Twitter and Facebook baited them into believing that lies supported on the social media matrix could be converted into real-world truths. It's not just comedian Dave Chappelle. Ordinary American citizens are snapping out of the woke coma induced by Twitter.

""Twitter isn't a real place.""

Twitter is where the Three Stooges go to have their lies confirmed. On social media, you can earn likes and retweets pretending that January 6 was the modern-day Pearl Harbor. Yesterday, Nicolle Wallace claimed police were ""maimed by flag poles"" during an insurrection.

The truth is a bunch of frustrated taxpayers, at the behest of FBI informants, staged a mostly peaceful protest inside the Capitol. An incompetent police officer shot and killed a tiny, non-threatening woman, Ashli Babbitt. In comparison to the riots, looting, and arson we witnessed across the country in the Summer of St. George Floyd, January 6 was a 1950s-style sorority panty raid.

On social media, you can garner likes and retweets firing off tweets claiming that 2021 America is no different from 1921 America. Late last night, as it became evident Youngkin would win, Jemele Hill tweeted: ""It's not the messaging, folks. This country simply loves white supremacy.""

The tweet has 16,000 likes and nearly 5,000 retweets. Hill thinks she's tweeting hard truths to power. She's just running to Twitter to get her insanity and lies confirmed. I'm sure Joy Reid did the same thing after ranting on TV that Republicans are a danger to our national security.

Is Winsome Sears a danger to America? She immigrated to America at age 6. She joined the Marines before she was an American citizen. She's lt. governor-elect of the state of Virginia. She's black. So is her husband. So are her kids. Are they all a danger?

MSNBC's Three Stooges argued that Republicans have constructed a fantasy world, an unfair political terrain that makes it difficult for Democrats to compete. Nicolle Wallace argued that schools are not teaching critical race theory. She backed Terry McAuliffe's lie that the state of Virginia was not implementing critical race theory into schools.

These lies are too easily debunked. While serving as governor in 2015, McAuliffe's department of education explicitly directed public schools to embrace critical race theory. The Virginia Department of Education website recommends CRT. Check out this string of tweets.

The left has abandoned the truth. Men are birthing people. Biden appointee Rachel Levine made history as the first female four-star admiral. Police pose a much greater threat to black men than gang violence. George Floyd is a hero. Biological men should be allowed to compete against women in sports. The only way to survive COVID is with three masks, six vaccines, and in constant isolation.



The world the Three Stooges believe exists is on Twitter. It's a satanic world where the truth is under constant attack. Virginia voters live in a different world, a world that answers to a higher power than Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-msnbcs-three-stooges-maddow-reid-and-wallace-invite-election-viewers-to-hell-on-social-medias-earth,2021-11-03
Whitlock: The fall of Afghanistan illustrates the utter failure of the ‘intelligence community’ President Eisenhower predicted,"America today isn't hard to understand. In his farewell address 60 years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower explained the destructive path the ""intelligence community"" planned for us.

His explanation went well beyond expressing fear of a military-industrial complex. He warned that secularism, technology, and academia beholden to government would conspire with the military to undermine the greater purpose of our nation.

Every failure we're witnessing today — from Afghanistan to Big Tech censorship to critical racism theory being taught in our schools — can be traced to the 15-minute warning Eisenhower delivered on Jan. 17, 1961.

The American people have been stripped of their power. A cabal of military, political, technological, media, and academic elites has seized control of our republic under the pretense of fortifying democracy. I call the cabal the ""intelligence community,"" the elites who are convinced their degrees, titles, fancy word salads, and wealth make them a superior breed of human being. They practice intelligence supremacy. They grab power in the sincere belief that their ascendancy assures the safety and prosperity of the world at large. They are the most high.

Everyone outside this country can easily see that America no longer serves a higher power or a higher purpose. The Taliban conquered our military might because they justifiably rejected the secular values we tried to impose on their country.



That is not written or said as an endorsement of Sharia law, the set of Islamic religious rules that denies women equal rights. It's stated to expose the folly of thinking secular values could unseat religious ones in Afghanistan. You can't subdue the Greater Middle East with guns and drones, bombs and airplanes. Muslims, and other highly religious people, do not fear death the way Americans do.

Our military-industrial complex cannot control the Taliban or end their belief in the patriarchy. They're not trapped in the American-made matrix President Eisenhower predicted six decades ago. Eisenhower's farewell address is too often solely reduced to his military warning. His speech was much more than that. The World War II hero outlined the threat of Marxist political ideology in layman's terms.

""We face a hostile ideology — global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method,"" Eisenhower said. ""Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle — with liberty at stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.""

That is Eisenhower, in 1961, telling us that a war is being waged in the minds of Americans. Would we remain one nation under God, or would a hostile, atheist ideology overrun our religious values and love of freedom?

Eisenhower then pivoted to discussing the dangers of an American society trapped by military expense.

""This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience,"" he said. ""The total influence — economic, political, even spiritual — is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.

""In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.""

From there, Eisenhower urged Americans to be suspicious of the federal government's influence on scholarly research and science. Sixty years ago, Eisenhower warned us about the Trust the Science movement. It's as if he knew one day America would provide funding for a lab in Wuhan, China.

""Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields,"" he said. ""In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.""

Finally, Eisenhower forecasted that Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, and the satans of Silicon Valley would become our rulers.

""Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect,"" he said, ""as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.""

Sixty years ago, our 34th president interpreted George Orwell's book, ""1984,"" which was published four years before Eisenhower ascended to the presidency.

Two years after Eisenhower left office, President John Kennedy was assassinated. Five years later, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated. President Kennedy defied our military commanders in his handling of Cuba. Bobby Kennedy's first presidential campaign speech, ""Conflict in Vietnam and at Home,"" centered on exiting the Vietnam War. Dr. King spoke against the Vietnam War.

I'm not wearing a tin-foil hat. Neither was Dwight Eisenhower.

The whole world, even Taliban soldiers hiding in mountain caves, can see that our military, academic institutions, politicians, spying agencies, media, tech billionaires, and celebrity class have been corrupted by a blind pursuit of power, money, and fame.



Long before we surrendered Kabul, we surrendered the moral high ground through fear and cowardice. As control of America was stripped from the people, a handful of public executions silenced dissent. No one should be surprised the Taliban embarrassed us abroad. Our intelligence community has been embarrassing us at home for 60 years.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-the-fall-of-afghanistan-illustrates-the-utter-failure-of-the-intelligence-community-president-eisenhower-predicted,2021-08-17
"Yes, it is called the Democratic Party","Part of the joy of having my name and email address on the masthead is that I get lots of emails from readers. Some of these comments and suggestions are quite helpful, even if they have nothing to do with the news division of this company.

Probably the most common complaint I get via email is that we refer to candidates and/or politicians as being members of the ""Democratic Party."" I get probably an email a day helpfully ""correcting"" us for using this term and informing us that there is nothing democratic about that party and therefore we should not use the word ""democratic"" and instead should only refer to them as the ""democrat party.""

I realize that the reason for this is that many talk radio hosts, including Rush Limbaugh, have made this claim for years. Talk radio hosts deal in entertainment and therefore they can call the Democratic Party whatever they want, including the ""Democrat Party."" The one and only issue I have with calling them the ""Democrat Party"" is that it's not correct.

Companies and political parties have the absolute right to call themselves whatever they want. When Cingular Wireless acquired portions of AT&T and rebranded as AT&T Wireless, in the news business we started calling them AT&T Wireless because that's how it works.

Similarly, the Democratic Party could start calling themselves the Pink Penguin Party and as long as they made the name change official it would be incumbent upon us, when covering news, to refer to their candidates as members of the Pink Penguin Party even though there isn't a pink penguin among them (at least, not this year).

The official name of the party is the Democratic Party, as determined by the Democratic National Committee. Calling the party by its correct, official name isn't an endorsement of their practices or a concession that any democracy is happening within the party, in just the same way that referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea doesn't indicate that you think that either of those countries is actually ""democratic"" (they are not).

If it bothers you to refer to the party by their proper name then you may of course refer to them however you like.

"VIDEO: Why President Trump is right to blame WHO, China for COVID-19 pandemic","On ""GlennTV,"" host Glenn Beck argued that the World Health Organization has been knowingly helping the Communist Party of China spread disinformation about the coronavirus.

Why?

Well, it turns out that the current WHO director-general is a politician from Ethiopia (the very first director without a medical degree) — and apparently Ethiopia owes China a lot.

""This outbreak has revealed the WHO as nothing more than a Chinese Communist front,"" Glenn said. China knew early on just how dangerous the coronavirus was, how it spread, how fast it spread, and the fatality rate, but were more concerned with getting the blame than protecting lives. So, they had their front man, the World Health Organization, tell the world there was nothing to worry about.

On Jan. 14, the WHO repeated the Chinese Communist Party's claim that the coronavirus does not travel human to human.

On Feb. 3, WHO Director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced there was no need for measures that ""unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade"" to combat the spread of COVID-19.

On the exact same date, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China released a statement criticizing President Trump for restricting travel to China.

""[S]ome countries, the US in particular, have inappropriately overreacted, which certainly runs counter to WHO advice. The US government hasn't provided any substantive assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers. What it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a very bad example. Even American media and experts doubted the government's decision, saying that the US government's restrictions on China are precisely what the WHO rejects, that the US is turning from overconfidence to fear and overreaction, and that banning the entry of visitors who traveled to China in the past 14 days is suspected to be violating civil rights instead of reducing risks of virus spreading,"" spokesperson Hua Chunying said.

Hua went on to say, ""As the WHO Director-General noted, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response.""

Indeed, Tedros has been very consistent in his praise for China's response to the coronavirus outbreak.

""The steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought to the world time,"" he told the Munich Security Conference in mid-February.

Mark Levin warns: We CANNOT allow the Left to abolish the Electoral College,"A recent Washington Post editorial titled ""Abolish the electoral college"" the Washington Post editorial board argued that ""the electoral college, whatever virtues it may have had for the Founding Fathers, is no longer tenable for American democracy.""

BlazeTV's Mark Levin warned that abolishing the Electoral College would mean that America's cities would control the government, which in turn means that Democrats would control the country. Alarmingly, this nightmarish scenario is just one Senate seat away from becoming a reality.

As Mark explained, if the Democrats win both of the two Senate runoffs in Georgia, the Senate's 100 seats will be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans with the deciding vote going to the vice president. If that vice president is Democrat Kamala Harris, the Democrats will almost certainly destroy the Electoral College, and with it, our future as a constitutional republic.

""I've told you many, many times that this is the objective of the Left and the media, which are one and the same, because by abolishing the Electoral College, the cities … all these heavy population centers, will control the government, meaning the Democrat Party will control the government,"" Levin said.

""What they [Democrats] are saying is what I've been warning you about,"" he continued. ""They don't want to represent republicans and they don't want to represent areas that they do not control ... and the fact is, if they destroy the Electoral College and do all these other things they want, we won't live in a republic, certainly not a constitutional republic any more. That's why Georgia is so crucial. If we lose Georgia, by one vote — because the vice president of the United States is the president of the Senate and breaks all ties — you'll have a 50/50 Senate. Kamala Harris will sit in that chair, she will rule over the Senate. Biden will rule over the executive branch. Pelosi ... will rule over the House. They will pack the Supreme Court. There will be no where to go, and then they're going to enshrine, as they did in California, their permanency as a party.""

Mark Levin warns: 'This is the election that determines if we REMAIN a Republic',"The 2020 election will determine the course of our republic. In fact, it will determine whether or not our nation will remain a republic at all.

In what he called the ""most important episode of Levin TV,"" Mark Levin warned Americans that the outcome of the upcoming election could alter our society, our liberty, and our lives by undermining the principles of the Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution.



""This is a different election. We need to keep the Senate. We need to take the House. We need to win the presidency. We need to send a message throughout the land and throughout the world, and we need to stand firm for our republic — or we're going to lose it,"" Levin said.

""In a few days, people are going to vote in the election that will be remembered for 100 years or more,"" he added. ""This is the election that determines the course of this republic. In fact, it will determine whether we remain a republic.""

Levin encouraged listeners to take a stand against tyranny by voting for the re-election of President Donald Trump, and encouraging friends, family members, and colleagues to vote. Then he traveled back in time to explore the history of our republic, the philosophy of the Founding Fathers, and how the progressives of the early 20th century have led us to where we are today.

Change My Mind: COVID numbers vs. flu season,"Benjamin Franklin once said, ""When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic."" Similarly, when hospitals learned that they could report themselves money, that would herald the end of the republic. In both cases, whether people vote themselves money or hospitals falsely report a patient's cause of death for money, one can't help noticing a common theme. Think about all of the lives affected by the COVID-19 mortality rate that set state lockdowns in motion. Lockdowns resulted in devastated families, small businesses, and communities. One must ask: Would you be angry over the millions left unemployed if it turns out the COVID-19 death rate is no worse than a typical flu season? One of the few conservative voices that challenged CDC statistics has been Steven Crowder.

Iran and Venezuela sign a 20-year agreement,"Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro and Iran’s hardline theocratic president Ebrahim Raisi recently signed a 20-year cooperation agreement.

The Associated Press reported that this new agreement came just one day after Maduro praised the Iranian Islamic Republic for sending badly needed fuel to Venezuela despite American sanctions.

In an interview with Maduro after he arrived for a two-day visit in Tehran, Iranian state media reported that Maduro heaped praise upon Iran’s efforts to send fuel tankers in support of his country.

Maduro said, “Tehran’s delivery of oil to Caracas was a great help to the Venezuelan people.”

Maduro’s visit to Iran comes as tensions heighten across the Middle East as negotiations over Iran’s nuclear deal fell apart and as U.S. sanctions and rising global food prices choke Iran’s suffering economy. This was Maduro’s first visit to Iran.

A high-ranking delegation from Venezuela comprised of political and economic officials joined Maduro on his visit to Iran after receiving an invitation from Raisi. Venezuela, like Iran, is under heavy sanctions from the U.S., which hinder its economic growth.

In a joint press conference on Saturday, Raisi and Maduro signed the 20-year agreement that solidified the country’s commitment to economic, political, and militaristic cooperation.

The Iranian English-language network, PressTV, quoted statements made by Maduro before the press conference indicating that the Venezuelan president and Raisi would discuss “the need to well inform the Iranian and Venezuelan nations about the war of sanctions and find ways to counter them with steadfastness.”

Maduro reportedly said that Venezuela and Iran are united by “a common vision.” The two presidents are aligned on international issues, and both have suffered economic difficulties, which are said to be caused by sanctions from America and its allies.

Maduro said, “Caracas and Tehran have shaped the strategy of [a] resistance economy and are working to expand it.”

On his website, Ali Khamenei, the former supreme leader of Iran, said that the experiences of Venezuela and Iran showed that the only way to face pressures from the U.S. is “to resist.” Khamenei thanked Maduro and the people of Venezuela for resisting American pressure.

Khamenei said, “Today, the United States views Venezuela differently.”

Maduro’s visit to Iran comes as he embarks on an individual Eurasian tour after President Joe Biden decided not to invite him to the Summit of the Americas which began this past week. Maduro’s stops will also include Algeria and Turkey.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657497477,2022-06-12
"124 retired generals and admirals say US in 'deep peril' under Biden, warn of his 'mental' condition","More than 120 retired generals and admirals have signed a letter saying that the U.S. is in ""deep peril"" under the leadership of President Joe Biden, specifically warning that the mental condition of the nation's oldest commander in chief ""cannot be ignored.""

What are the details?

The letter was released by Flag Officers 4 America, and was signed by 124 retired ""military officers entitled to carry a flag indicating their rank,"" The Daily Caller noted.

It begins, ""Our Nation is in deep peril. We are in a fight for our survival as a Constitutional Republic like no other time since our founding in 1776. The conflict is between supporters of Socialism and Marxism vs. supporters of Constitutional freedom and liberty.""

The retired military leaders went on to say that ""without fair and honest elections that accurately reflect the 'will of the people' our Constitutional Republic is lost,"" saying that ""aside from the election, the Current Administration has launched a full-blown assault on our Constitutional rights in a dictatorial manner, bypassing the Congress, with more than 50 Executive Orders quickly signed.""

At the end of a long list of bullet points citing ""additional national security issues and actions,"" Flag Officers 4 America wrote:

""The mental and physical condition of the Commander in Chief cannot be ignored. He must be able to quickly make accurate national security decisions involving life and limb anywhere, day or night. Recent Democrat leadership's inquiries about nuclear code procedures sends a dangerous national security signal to nuclear armed adversaries, raising the question about who is in charge. We must always have an unquestionable chain of command.""

The officials ended the letter with a call for action, urging ""all citizens to get involved now at the local, state and/or national level to elect political representatives who will act to Save America, our Constitutional Republic, and hold those currently in office accountable,"" concluding, ""The 'will of the people' must be heard and followed.""

What else?

Biden, 78, is the oldest American president to ever be elected, and he faced questions from opponents during both the Democratic primary and the general election over his mental fitness for office.

A White House spokesperson told People magazine Wednesday that Biden ""is planning to have a checkup later this year, and the results will be made public.""

The outlet noted that White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week that the administration ""will be transparent"" to reporters about the results of Biden's first physical when it happens.

People also reported that ""Biden similarly promised during the 2020 campaign to be 'totally transparent in terms of my health.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/124-retired-generals-and-admirals-say-us-in-deep-peril-under-biden-warn-of-his-mental-condition,2021-05-13
2 US soldiers captured 3 months ago while fighting in Ukraine to return home: Report,"Two men from Alabama who were captured after volunteering to aid Ukrainian forces against the aggressions of the Russian military will soon return home to their families, reports say.

Alex Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, were fighting together in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine on June 9 when they were apprehended and taken captive by a Russian-supported separatist group known as the Donetsk People's Republic, a quasi nation-state within Ukraine that has not been recognized by the United States.

""We are thrilled to announce that Alex and Andy are free,"" the families said in a joint statement. ""They are safely in the custody of the US embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the States.""

Because the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with the DPR, others had to negotiate for the release of Drueke and Huynh. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia announced that it had managed to secure from the DPR the release of 10 total foreign national prisoners, representing the U.S., the United Kingdom, Morocco, Sweden, and Croatia.

Drueke and Huynh are said to be ""in pretty good shape,"" according to Drueke's aunt, Dianna Shaw.

Drueke, an Army veteran, and Huynh, a marine veteran who originally hails from California, lived approximately 120 away from each other in Alabama when they both decided to enlist with Ukrainian forces back in April. Drueke, who first joined the Army after the attacks on 9/11, thought that his experience would be helpful. Huyhn, meanwhile, said that he could not get the plight of the Ukrainian people out of his mind.

""I know it wasn't my problem, but there was that gut feeling that I felt I had to do something,"" Huynh said before he left. ""Two weeks after the war began, it kept eating me up inside and it just felt wrong. I was losing sleep. ... All I could think about was the situation in Ukraine.""

During their captivity, the two men formed a friendship over their home state and their determination to help Ukraine. Drueke was able to have limited contact with family and friends while in DPR. If Huynh had contact with his family during that time, it hasn't been reported.

It is unclear when exactly the two men will return to the U.S. The U.S. State Department has not issued a comment about their release.

"70,000 take to the streets in Prague to protest Czech government, EU & NATO","An estimated 70,000 people protested in Prague against the Czech government over the weekend. The protesters expressed anger over soaring energy prices and voiced opposition to the European Union and NATO.

Czech inflation, according to Bloomberg, is currently the highest since 1993. The Czech central bank forecasts inflation to peak at around 20% in the coming months.

Those protesting represented a wide swath of the political spectrum, as supporters of groups ranging from the “major anti-migrant populist” Freedom and Direct Democracy party to the Communist Party showed up, ABC News reported.

""The aim of our demonstration is to demand change, mainly in solving the issue of energy prices, especially electricity and gas, which will destroy our economy this autumn,"" event co-organizer Jiri Havel told iDNES.cz news website.

In addition to questioning the Czech government’s ability to reverse the rise in energy prices, protesters condemned the Czech government for supporting sanctions against Russia. The demonstrators also criticized the European Union’s (EU) plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reach climate neutrality, according to the Associated Press. The Czech Republic is a member of the EU.

Zuzana Majerová Zahradníková of the anti-EU Trikolora party told protesters, “Fiala’s government may be Ukrainian, it may be Brussels, but it is definitely not Czech.” The EU is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The Czech Republic has been an avid supporter of Ukraine in its battle against Russia and has donated weaponry to the Ukrainian armed forces.

""The protest on Wenceslas Square was called by forces that are pro-Russian, are close to extreme positions and are against the interests of the Czech Republic,"" said Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala. Fiala criticized the demonstrators, claiming they were expressing pro-Russia views “that are not in the interest of the Czech Republic and our citizens.” Fiala’s collation government survived a vote of no confidence on Friday.

The Guardian reports that Pavel Blažek – the Czech Republic’s minister of justice and a member of Fiala’s party – warned last week of the risks involved in not addressing the country’s energy issues. “If the energy crisis is not resolved, the political system of this country is at risk,” Blažek said.

Organizers have vowed to stage further protests unless the government resigns by September 25.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/70000-protest-czech-government-eu-nato,2022-09-05
Activists want more than a disingenuous apology from Elizabeth Warren after DNA test gaffe,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is still under fire for claiming to be a Native American.

This time, Native American activists say that they want more than a half-hearted apology from the New England lawmaker.

What's a brief background?



Warren, who previously insisted that she was Native American, even went as far as to fill out her Texas state bar registration as a Native American.

Warren also took a DNA test to ""prove"" her Native American heritage in response to a challenge from President Donald Trump. The test returned findings that Warren was between 1/64 and 1/1024 Native American — clearly not enough to so vocally consider herself Native American. Warren blamed her family history for her belief that she descended from the Cherokee Nation.

In 2018, she apologized to the Cherokee Nation for the DNA test debacle.

The Cherokee Nation addressed Warren's DNA results almost immediately after she announced them, saying that the senator's ""continued claims of tribal heritage"" were ""undermining tribal interests.""

Chuck Hoskin Jr., the Cherokee Nation's secretary of state, added that Warren's use of a DNA test to ""lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong.""

Despite her apology, controversy continued to plague Warren with new findings of her Texas state bar registration card.

What are some Native Americans saying now?

On Thursday, The Washington Post reported that several Native American activists were very unhappy with the presidential candidate's conduct.

Rebecca Nagle, an activist and writer, told CNN that Warren didn't do much more than confuse the public about Native American tribes.

""Senator Warren caused a great deal of confusion with a republic that already doesn't know a lot about tribal sovereignty and how our tribes function,"" Nagle said. ""Private apologies do nothing to clear up that public confusion. And because of the harm she's caused, she owes us a public apology and clear statement of why she's not Cherokee and why that difference matters.""

Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) — who is one of the first Native American women to be elected to U.S. Congress — told the Post that Warren's ongoing Native American debate is nothing more than a distraction from real issues within the Native American community.

In 2018, Haaland said, ""We need to be talking about the need for more scholarships in Indian country and education opportunities. There are so many things we could be talking about to move our country forward.""

David Cornsilk, who is a genealogist, a historian, and also a member of the Cherokee Nation, added, ""I want to see [Warren's apology] in writing. I want her to go on national TV. I want her to do a video like she did to announce her DNA results.""

""It just seemed very lacking,"" he added.

NYC Mayor Adams says that 'Kansas doesn't have a brand',"New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, claimed on Tuesday that ""New York has a brand,"" but that Kansas does not.

Mayor Eric Adams Briefs Media on Trip to Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic youtu.be

The mayor's remarks were met with backlash by some on social media.

Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican who is currently running for governor, tweeted, ""Mayor who? Kansas isn't New York and we sure as heck don't want to be. I'll stay focused here in God's Country on making life more affordable and keeping communities safe, neither of which can be said about New York.""

Former Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai tweeted, ""Part of the Kansas brand is being nice and charitable toward people from other states who guffaw at how backward or inferior they think Kansas is—even when, most likely, none of them have actually spent meaningful time in the Sunflower State.""

Radio host Buck Sexton tweeted, ""I saw two shirtless homeless men throwing trash cans at each other last week at 10am in Times Square, and had a maniac threaten a family member with a stick this past weekend- while she was pushing a stroller. So yes, NYC has a brand.""

""I lived in Kansas for a number of years. 'Brand' is overrated. Safe streets, good neighborhoods, and politicians more concerned with substance than brand are what make Kansas special,"" tweeted Jason Whitlock, host of BlazeTV's ""Fearless with Jason Whitlock.""

""Kansas has KS wheat, Jayhawk basketball, KS beef, and the Wizard of Oz. What's New York Mayor Adams' brand? Violence, murder, homelessness, and high taxes? I'll take Kansas any day,"" GOP Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas tweeted.

""I'm choosing Kansas over New York City 100 times out of 100. See, I've never stepped over human feces in Kansas the way I have in NYC,"" Blaze Media's Keith Malinak tweeted. ""Wait....Is human fecal matter on the sidewalks of your city your brand, @ericadamsfornyc?""

While many Americans have been disturbed by the ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" phenomenon that involves drag queens reading stories to children, Mayor Adams has previously expressed support for the practice of holding events with drag queens at schools and libraries.

""Drag storytellers, and the libraries and schools that support them, are advancing a love of diversity, personal expression, and literacy that is core to what our city embraces,"" a tweet posted earlier this year on the @NYCMayor Twitter account read. ""At a time when our LGBTQ+ communities are under increased attack across this country, we must use our education system to educate. The goal is not only for our children to be academically smart, but also emotionally intelligent,"" another tweet stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adams-new-york-brand-kansas,2022-09-27
VIDEO: Afghan TV anchor tells residents 'don't be afraid' as Taliban fighters stand behind him with guns,"With Taliban fighters standing behind him brandishing guns, an Afghan news anchor nervously urged viewers over the weekend not to be ""afraid"" amid the fall of the Afghan government and the formation of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

The bizarre scene demonstrates the danger that Afghan journalists are likely to face under Taliban rule and foreshadows the end of journalistic freedom in the country.

What happened?

Armed Taliban militants stormed into the building of Afghan television network Peace Studio during a live recording on Sunday, proceeding to hold the anchor hostage while he granted favorable coverage to the new regime, Republic World reported.

""Don't be afraid,"" the anchor reportedly said during the broadcast.

""With the Taliban militants breathing down his neck, the TV anchor addressed the news bulletin, talking about the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani-led government and the formation of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,"" the news outlet reported. ""Visibly afraid and uncomfortable, the presenter then went on to tell the nation to not be scared of the Taliban.""

Video of the incident has since gone viral, having been viewed more than one million times on social media.

""Afghanistan TV - surreal,"" tweeted BBC World News anchor Yalda Hakim along with a video of the incident.

""This is what a political debate now looks like on Afghan TV, Taliban foot soldiers watching over the host,"" she added. ""The presenter talks about the collapse of the Ghani govt & says the Islamic Emirate says the Afghan people should not be afraid.""

A subsequent photo posted on Twitter by Afghan journalist Zaki Daryabi shows that at least eight Taliban fighters were involved in the news station storming.

This is what [we] can't accept,"" she tweeted along with the image. ""If so, we will stop our work.""



What else?

Amid its takeover of Afghanistan in recent weeks, Taliban leaders promised a ""lenient"" government and ""amnesty"" for individuals who worked with Western governments and organizations over the last 20 years of U.S. military occupation.

But their promises have been empty ones. In reality, Taliban fighters have been ""hunting down"" journalists and persecuting women and religious minorities, including Christians.

The bloodthirsty militants reportedly murdered the relative of an Afghan journalist partnered with German news outlet Deutsche Welle last week. They also killed a 33-year-old Afghan who had translated for U.S. Special Forces and who worked with newspaper Die Zeit.

Republic World added that ""the Taliban barred two women journalists ... who worked with the public broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan"" and ""also attacked two other members of the press for covering the anti-Taliban protests taking place in the eastern Nangarhar province.""

Their actions have reportedly caused many journalists and activists to flee the nation in fear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/afghan-tv-anchor-taliban-fighters,2021-08-30
'Seismic shift': Afghanistan replaces North Korea as worst country for Christian persecution after Biden's disastrous withdrawal,"Afghanistan sits at the top of a new ranking of the world's worst countries for Christian persecution after President Joe Biden's disastrous military withdrawal and the Taliban's subsequent takeover of the nation.

Open Doors USA, an organization that tracks global religious persecution, has published its 2022 World Watch List ranking the 50 countries where it is most difficult to be a Christian.

In what Open Doors USA CEO David Curry called the ""biggest seismic shift"" in decades, Afghanistan replaced North Korea as the most repressive and hostile country towards followers of Jesus. The communist North Korean regime had ranked as the worst country for Christian persecution for 20 years.

“This year’s 2022 World Watch List, we think, is the biggest seismic shift in over 20 years because Afghanistan is now the No. 1 country on the World Watch List, supplanting North Korea,” Curry told Faithwire in an interview.

In a bid to finally end the American war in Afghanistan, Biden set a deadline to withdraw U.S. combat forces from the country by the end of August 2020. But his pullout from the country was a colossal failure of planning and execution.

Despite the president's assurances that the Afghanistan government would be able to fight the Taliban on its own, the Islamic terrorist group swiftly took over the country, stunning administration officials. Thousands of U.S. residents and Afghani allies were stranded in the country after U.S. evacuation efforts failed to get everyone out before Biden withdrew troops. Those left behind included Christians who were in grave danger of persecution from the Taliban's Islamist regime.

“Many people are aware of what’s happened since August in Afghanistan,” Curry told Faithwire. “It has emboldened Islamic extremists in other parts of the world. We believe it’s going to have a ripple effect.”

He said that Christians, in particular Christian women, are ""targeted"" by jihadists.

“The Taliban’s interpretation of Islam considers Christians to be traitors, enemies of the state, enemies of the tribe and community. They are infidels from Islam, and in their mind, the punishment is death,” Curry explained at a press conference announcing the release of Open Doors USA's report. He observed that Taliban extremists obtained a list of prominent Christians in Afghanistan last September and began hunting them. “Every Christian who remains in Afghanistan is either on the run or in hiding.”

He cited reports that Islamic authoritarians are going door to door looking for ""unwanted elements"" in their country, including anyone who collaborated with Western countries and Christians.

“Progress made over the last two decades on rights and protections for women has dramatically deteriorated since the Taliban took over,” Curry said. “The world must speak out on the horrendous treatment of women in extremist Islamic societies and in particular, wake up to the fact that Christian women are the most vulnerable group in the world today.""

Open Doors USA says there are more than 360 million Christians living in fear of violent persecution, numbering 1 in 7 believers worldwide. The group's report counted 5,110 churches or Christian buildings attacked, 6,175 Christians detained for their faith, and 5,989 Christians killed for faith-related reasons last year.

While North Korea fell to number two on the watch list, the group said persecution there ""remains absolute in every area of life"" and has reached the highest levels recorded in the country.

“For 20 years, North Korea was number one. They have a post-communist … system that has been generational,” Curry told Faithwire. “They have lifted now Kim Jung Un as the dictator. People are forced to worship him.”

“It’s clear that they don’t want any other faith except the worship of their leader and the communist system…they control all the means of life,"" he added.

Sub-Saharan Africa ranked as the most violent place in the world for Christians, with jihadist violence in Nigeria, the DRC, and the Central African Republic accounting for 79% of the nearly 6,000 Christians martyred for their faith last year.

India, Myanmar, and China were also listed as countries where noteworthy persecution of Christians exists. Hindu nationalists in India have attacked Christians, and the state has advanced anti-conversion laws designed to penalize and even imprison anyone found to have used ""force"" or ""fraudulent"" methods to convert others from one religion to another.

Open Doors USA said the military coup in Myanmar has led to increased violence against Christians in that nation, as political paranoia has led military leaders to believe churches are gathering places for opposition to the regime.

"Desperate to add more pilots, US airlines are cutting training hours and dropping experience requirements","The U.S. pilot shortage has reportedly gotten so bad that airlines and carriers have started dropping experience requirements and cutting the number of training hours needed in order to fly their planes, Business Insider reported over the weekend.

What are the details?

Earlier this year, Delta joined other major airlines in announcing an end to its long-standing requirement that pilots possess four-year degrees in hopes of attracting more candidates to the industry. The achievement is now only a ""preferred"" criterion.

""While we feel as strongly as ever about the importance of education, there are highly qualified candidates — people who we would want to welcome to our Delta family — who have gained more than the equivalent of a college education through years of life and leadership experience,"" Delta wrote in its Jan. 6 announcement. ""Making the four-year degree requirement preferred removes unintentional barriers to our Delta flight decks.""

Republic Airways, the nation's second-largest regional carrier, which reportedly operates on behalf of several major airlines — including Delta, American, and United — took an even bolder approach by seeking to trim the number of required training hours for pilots in half.

In a petition filed with the Federal Aviation Administration in April, Republic asked permission to bring the number of mandatory flight hours down to 750 from 1,500 hours. Even now, the carrier has exemptions in place for candidates with degrees that cut the required hours down to 1,000.

Other airlines have adopted less drastic, though still strange, solutions. CNBC reported last week that airlines such as Frontier are hiring pilots from Australia, and American has even begun selling bus tickets for shorter routes.

What's the background?

The range of moves comes as the U.S. flight industry faces one of its greatest pilot shortages in recent memory, with U.S. airlines reportedly hoping to hire 12,000 pilots combined this year alone. The shortage has caused airlines to consistently ground planes and cancel flights and has sent the cost of air travel skyrocketing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, pilot training and hiring slowed along with flight traffic, and airlines handed out early retirement packages and trimmed staff in efforts to save money. But the budget-saving practices are reaping their consequences now. With travel demand returning to pre-pandemic levels, the palpable dearth of qualified pilots remains.

And at least one airline executive believes the shortage will take years to solve, even with drastic requirement reduction.

""The pilot shortage for the industry is real, and most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren’t enough pilots, at least not for the next five-plus years,"" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said on a quarterly earnings call in April, according to CNBC.

Anything else?

One senator is considering a different approach as an alternative to cutting training hours and dropping requirements for pilots, which could be viewed as dangerous by the public.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) recently floated introducing legislation that could raise the mandatory retirement age for pilots to at least 67 from 65, according to Bloomberg.

Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst and the president of Atmosphere Research Group, told Insider, ""Optically, cutting the number of required flying hours may look like a riskier approach than allowing a healthy pilot to continue flying a few more years.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/airlines-drop-pilot-requirements-training-hours,2022-05-23
"Alleged Al Qaeda terrorist leader arrested in Arizona, faces extradition to Iraq for murder","An alleged Al Qaeda terrorist leader was arrested this week in Arizona.

Ali Yousif Ahmed Al-Nouri, 42, was arrested in Phoenix on Thursday by the FBI, Homeland Security, and U.S. Marshal's Service.

Ahmed is accused of carrying out two operations in Fallujah in 2006 that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi police officers.

The Justice Department said in a statement:

According to the information provided by the Government of Iraq in support of its extradition request, Ahmed served as the leader of a group of Al-Qaeda terrorists in Al-Fallujah, Iraq, which planned operations targeting Iraqi police.



Ahmed and other members of the Al-Qaeda group allegedly shot and killed a first lieutenant in the Fallujah Police Directorate and a police officer in the Fallujah Police Directorate, on or about June 1, 2006, and October 3, 2006, respectively.

According to a Justice Department complaint, an Iraqi judge issued a warrant for Ahmed's arrest last May.

The Iraqi government subsequently issued an extradition request, which the U.S. government recently approved, resulting in U.S. Magistrate Judge John Z. Boyle issuing a warrant for Ahmed on Wednesday, the Arizona Republic reported.

"American flag mural, painted the day after 9/11, defaced with profane, anti-Trump graffiti. But two cops and a kid come to the rescue.","An American flag mural began greeting Phoenix motorists and pedestrians near the intersection of 40th Street and Cactus Road the day after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Arizona Republic reported.

Image source: KSAZ-TV video screenshot

The mural was painted on a home's wall, and the former homeowner Laura Giacoppo painted it with her son Brian and friend Patti, the paper said.

""It was just a thing that we did to honor all the people who died,"" she added to the Republic.

Defaced

But Mimi Hanna, who now owns the property, told KSAZ-TV she felt ""violated"" upon getting word that the flag mural had been defaced with the phrases, ""F*** Trump!!! F*** ICE!!,"" directed at President Donald Trump and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

David Bishop has lived in neighborhood for six years and told the station that he drives by the flag mural ""every day"" and that it ""really makes me feel sad that someone would do that.""

But the emotions run just a little deeper for Bishop, who's also a Vietnam veteran added to KSAZ that what he and other vets sacrificed makes the flag mural vandalism a slap in the face.

""I put my life on the line for that flag,"" he added to the station. ""Coming from Vietnam, we had a bad rep when we came back, so we really had to work on that to build up to where we are respected again.""

Two cops to the rescue

But on Thursday residents noticed a pair of Phoenix police officers re-painting the flag — and were understandably thrilled, KSAZ said.

""I was touched that they would be standing out there in 105-degree weather painting this flag,"" neighborhood resident Marcy Bobbitt told the Republic.

The cops who came to the rescue are Officer Mario Lozoya and Sgt. Matt Morgan — and they got some help from Lozoya's son, the paper added.

""Wonderful,"" Bishop told KSAZ about the cops' efforts. ""Absolutely wonderful. It's amazing.""

""I respect them so much,"" Hanna added to the Republic. ""I respect law and order, and I was very touched.""



""You have to have respect for it,"" Bishop added to the station. ""It's this country. It's what we all live for. It's freedom, and deface the flag, you are disgracing freedom.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-flag-mural-painted-the-day-after-9-11-defaced-with-profane-anti-trump-graffiti-but-two-cops-and-a-kid-come-to-the-rescue,2019-06-28
Amy Coney Barrett receives endorsement from very unlikely source: 'Highly qualified to serve',"Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman is a constitutional scholar and self-described liberal who testified during President Donald Trump's impeachment hearings that Trump was guilty of ""impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency.""

But even Feldman believes Amy Coney Barrett deserves to be a Supreme Court justice.

What did Feldman say?

Writing in an essay for Bloomberg, Feldman said he was ""devastated"" by Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death and ""revolted by the hypocrisy of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.""

But, Feldman explained, his personal missives do not remove the fact that Barrett is ""highly qualified"" to serve on the Supreme Court.

""Yet these political judgments need to be distinguished from a separate question: what to think about Judge Amy Coney Barrett,"" Feldman wrote. ""And here I want to be extremely clear. Regardless of what you or I may think of the circumstances of this nomination, Barrett is highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.""

In fact, Feldman acknowledged that he disagrees with much of Barrett's judicial philosophy — but even that fact does not disqualify her.

""I disagree with much of her judicial philosophy and expect to disagree with many, maybe even most of her future votes and opinions. Yet despite this disagreement, I know her to be a brilliant and conscientious lawyer who will analyze and decide cases in good faith, applying the jurisprudential principles to which she is committed. Those are the basic criteria for being a good justice. Barrett meets and exceeds them,"" he explained.

Feldman went on to say:

[A] Republican is president, and the Senate is Republican. Elections have consequences, and so do justices' decisions about when or whether to retire. Trump is almost certainly going to get his pick confirmed. Given that reality, it is better for the republic to have a principled, brilliant lawyer on the bench than a weaker candidate. That's Barrett.



To add to her merits, Barrett is a sincere, lovely person. I never heard her utter a word that wasn't thoughtful and kind — including in the heat of real disagreement about important subjects. She will be an ideal colleague. I don't really believe in ""judicial temperament,"" because some of the greatest justices were irascible, difficult and mercurial. But if you do believe in an ideal judicial temperament of calm and decorum, rest assured that Barrett has it.

""This combination of smart and nice will be scary for liberals,"" he added.

Regarding Barrett's devout Catholic faith, which some of those opposed to Barrett have claimed disqualifies her from serving on the Supreme Court, Feldman said Barrett's critics could not be more wrong.

""Barrett is also a profoundly conservative thinker and a deeply committed Catholic. What of it? Constitutional interpretation draws on the full resources of the human mind. These beliefs should not be treated as disqualifying,"" Feldman said. ""We have a Supreme Court nominee who is a brilliant lawyer, a genuine and good person — and someone who holds views about how to interpret the law that I think are wrong and, in certain respects, misguided. I hope the senators at her hearing treat her with respect.""

In the end, Feldman wrote that Barrett's likely confirmation is a consequence of Democrats losing elections.

""And when she is confirmed, I am going to accept it as the consequence of the constitutional rules we have and the choices we collectively and individually have made. And I'm going to be confident that Barrett is going to be a good justice, maybe even a great one — even if I disagree with her all the way,"" Feldman wrote.

Anything else?

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham confirmed Saturday that Barrett's nomination hearings will begin Oct. 12.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that he has enough support to confirm Barrett, meaning her confirmation will shift the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future.

Ostroy asked if GOP and independents would prefer cheap gas or democracy,"Self-described ""Proud Democrat"" Andy Ostroy issued a tweet on Saturday asking Republicans and independents whether they would prefer to have a democracy or fuel that costs $2.50 per gallon.

""Serious question for Republicans and independents: What would you rather have, $2.50/gallon gas or a democracy?"" Ostroy tweeted.

Americans have been getting slammed by skyrocketing gas prices — as of Monday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas has reached a whopping $5.014.

""I'll take $2.50 gas and a Constitutional Republic. C'mon man. You don’t even know what form of government the US is,"" one response to Ostroy's post read.



""This is, in point of fact, a very unserious question,"" someone else tweeted.

""I’ll take a Republic and non-Marxist economic policies that would make cost of living and gas affordable again. America isn’t a democracy,"" someone else tweeted.

""We had both under Trump. Now we have neither,"" another tweet said.

On Monday, Ostroy issued a tweet in which he said, ""As predicted, Republicans took the bait. Simple question. Obvious answer is democracy. If only these people got as angry about #Trump’s/the right’s assault on our elections and democracy as they do about gas prices perhaps a bunch of folks, incl Trump, would be in prison now…""

Ostroy has declared that Trump ""came in an incompetent, self-serving, corrupt, dangerous sociopath traitor & left even worse.""

The House Select Committee to probe the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot is holding hearings — Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois are the only two Republican members on the Select Committee, and both GOP lawmakers voted in favor of impeaching then-President Donald Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6 episode.



""It's impossible when watching insurrection footage not to conclude that that day was purely a manifestation of 157 years of white male racist rage which the evil genius #Trump masterfully exploited for personal gain.

"Angela Merkel: 70 percent of Germany is getting coronavirus, and there's not much we can do","German Chancellor Angela Merkel was blunt Wednesday in her assessment of how coronavirus will impact her nation: A vast majority of people in Germany will get coronavirus, and there is little or nothing anyone can do about that right now.

What did she say?

""When the virus is out there, the population has no immunity and no therapy exists, then 60 to 70% of the population will be infected,"" Merkel said, Reuters reported. ""The process has to be focused on not overburdening the health system by slowing the virus's spread ... It's about winning time.""

Potential impact

Germany has a population of about 82 million. Merkel is predicting that more than 57 million people in Germany will be infected with coronavirus. Mortality rates are hard to nail down right now due to the variables of different nations and a continuing lack of adequate testing capability in some places, but even a conservative death rate applied to Merkel's prediction means that more than a half a million Germans could die from the virus.

The virus is especially dangerous for elderly people and those with pre-existing respiratory or immune system issues. In many patients, especially younger ones, the virus may cause only minor symptoms and present no danger.

For some context, Italy has more than 10,000 cases right now, and 631 people have died. The virus is so uncontrolled in Italy right now that the entire country is now under quarantine. Germany has 1,565 cases and three deaths so far.

Don't panic?

Some, like Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis, feel that Merkel's alarming outlook on coronavirus will just create unnecessary panic, CNBC reported.



Preview of what's to come?

The dangerous situation in Europe has caused concern in the United States about what may be coming in the United States, where the virus appears to be spreading rapidly and the ability to test people for it has not yet caught up to demand.



In the U.S., 32 people have died of coronavirus, and there are more than 1,000 known cases.

""I can say we will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday morning according to CBS News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/angela-merkel-70-percent-of-germany-is-getting-coronavirus-and-theres-not-much-we-can-do,2020-03-11
Powerful videos show angry Iranian protesters flood streets of Tehran over downed jet: 'Death to the dictator',"Enraged protesters flooded the streets of Tehran on Saturday and demanded that Ayatollah Khamenei step down as supreme leader of Iran after the Iranian government admitted its armed forces shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board.

Video posted to social media showed protesters shout ""death to liars,"" ""death to the Islamic Republic,"" ""Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is also a murderer,"" among other chants.

According to Reuters, the protesters also chanted, ""Death to the dictator,"" a direct reference to Ayatollah Khamenei.

The protests reportedly began as vigils for the victims of PS752, but quickly descended into anti-government demonstrations.

The protests came the same day that Iran admitted that the Iranian Armed Forces shot down the passenger jet using surface-to-air missiles.

For days, the Iranian government claimed the plane crashed due to mechanical error. However, American intelligence disputed the claims, forcing the Iranian government to admit that it shot down the Ukrainian flight.

In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded an apology and compensation from Iran.

""Iran has pleaded guilty to downing the Ukrainian plane. But we insist on a full admission of guilt,"" Zelensky said Saturday. ""We expect from Iran assurances of their readiness for a full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, the return of the bodies of the dead, the payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels.""

President Donald Trump also spoke directly to protesters on Saturday, posting a message to Twitter in Persian, the native language of Iranians.

The message reads in English, ""To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/angry-iranian-protesters-flood-streets-demand-ayatollah-khamenei-step-down-over-shot-down-passenger-jet,2020-01-11
Ocasio-Cortez pushes bizarre conspiracy theory to explain why Republicans defeated motion for new witnesses,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory to explain why Republicans rejected a motion to call new witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on Friday.

""The Senate's abdication of responsibility to the rule of law represents a much deeper threat to our democracy, our institutions, and our republic,"" she claimed in a tweet.

""The GOP knows that its agenda is incompatible with democracy, so their larger project is to dismantle it,"" she added.



Ocasio-Cortez retweeted an article from Rolling Stones writer Jamil Smith claiming that Republicans didn't want to punish the president for trying to manipulate the election, because they wanted the opportunity to manipulate the election also.

""They did this for a reason. Not necessarily to give Trump ultimate power, though Republicans are okay with that,"" Smith said.

""It's about the fact that he was caught manipulating an election,"" he added, ""something that they too would like to continue doing without interruption.""



Ocasio-Cortez was responding to the vote on Friday that sealed the deal on closing the impeachment trial without any new witnesses. Democrats hoped that they would be able to see former Trump national security advisor John Bolton testify about the reported claims in his book that seem to corroborate the impeachment accusations.

The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to vote to acquit the president of two articles of impeachment on Wednesday.

Video shows AOC calling for a socialist 'revolution' at a Bernie Sanders rally in Iowa,"¿Viva la revolución?



A video released by the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign shows Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) animating a crowd at a rally in Iowa on Friday where the young democratic socialist yells ""Who here is ready for the revolution?"" and drawing cheers from supporters.

Presumably, the ""revolution"" that Ocasio-Cortez is referring to is the socialist vision that she and Sanders have promoted throughout their political careers.

'No thanks'

Ocasio-Cortez's comments were condemned by Americans of Latin American ancestry who found them reminiscent of the kinds of calls made by socialist strongmen in the region. Among AOC's critics was Alberto de la Cruz, the Miami-based managing editor of BabaluBlog.

""The last time my family heard a socialist say 'who's ready for a revolution!?' what little they had was stolen from them, some were tortured & imprisoned, and they had to flee Cuba to save their own lives,"" said de la Cruz on Twitter. Adding, ""No thanks, my family has been through enough socialism already.""

Many Latinos seem to agree. A recent national poll by Telemundo found that nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of Latinos say they would never vote for a candidate who describes him or herself as a ""socialist"" with only 21 percent saying they would.

What kind of revolution?

While some American journalists and media personalities have argued that democratic socialists like Sanders and AOC are akin to European social democrats, a close examination of their policies show they have more in common with Latin American leftists.

Politicians like Sanders and AOC have also tried likening their ideology to capitalist systems in countries like Canada and the U.K.; however, the Democratic Socialists of America, an organization that counts the freshman congresswoman among its members and is backing Sanders in the democratic primary, have been candid about their beliefs.

Additionally, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez — along with the progressive Democrats who appease them — have promised much more than free colleges and Medicare for All. For instance, both of them have called for “public ownership"" of private property and nationalizing key industries, for instance. Additionally, her Green New Deal, which is co-sponsored by five presidential candidates, promises to eliminate nuclear power and ban internal combustion engine vehicles in 10 years.

Meanwhile, this summer, an analyst at investment firm JP Morgan released a study of the democratic socialist platform and concluded that it was likelier to be found in practice in South America than northern Europe.

With Nordic countries firmly rooted in capitalism and free markets, if I wanted to find examples of democratic socialism in practice, I'd have to look elsewhere. … I couldn't find any country that ticked all these democratic socialist boxes, but I did find one that came close: Argentina, which has defaulted 7 times since its independence in 1816, which has seen the largest relative standard of living decline in the world since 1900, and which is on the brink of political and economic chaos again in 2019.

Last month, Argentina elected leftists Alberto Fernández and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as president and vice-president, respectively, to lead the South American nation. Both have expressed sympathies with the socialist regimes in Cuba and Venezuela. A 2013 article in The Atlantic noted that, during her own presidency, de Kirchner ""copied many of Venezuela's policies for her own country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc_bernie_socialis_revolution_iowa,2019-11-10
Appeals court stacked with Democrat-appointed judges rules Congress can seek 8 years of President Trump's tax returns,"A U.S. appeals court ruled Thursday to allow Congress to gain access to eight year's of President Trump's tax returns in a case that will likely reach the Supreme Court.

The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the president's request to rehear a previous ruling by a three-judge panel that allowed Congress to subpoena the president's tax records. In March, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee filed the subpoena.

The president's lawyers had asked that the full D.C. Circuit court reconsider the case, and on Wednesday the court voted 8-3 in favor of letting the earlier ruling stand.

According to an NPR report, of the 11 judges on the panel, seven were appointed by Democratic presidents:

Seven of the eight judges were appointed by Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, both Democrats. The eighth was appointed by President George W. Bush, a Republican. The three dissenting judges — those who sided with the president — were all Republican appointees. Two were appointed by Trump and the third by President George H.W. Bush.

The ruling comes alongside a federal appeals court ruling in a separate case on Nov. 4 stating that the president must turn over eight years of personal and corporate tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors.

The president's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said after losing the New York tax returns fight that ""the issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our Republic. The constitutional issues are significant.""

According to NPR, Sekulow will be seeking review at the Supreme Court.

Apple tells Taiwanese suppliers to obey Chinese communist rules,"Apple has reportedly told suppliers based in the Republic of Taiwan to comply with Chinese customs regulations, citing fears of trade barriers allegedly stoked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit to Taipei. According to Nikkei Asia, the company’s sense of urgency is heightened by the timing of the fall release of its iPhone 14 lineup, which will likely be delayed owing to tensions between Taiwan and China.

Per Apple's warning, labels on Taiwanese-made parts and components must conform to the language of the Chinese communist Party’s (CCP) “One China” policy, which asserts that the island nation belongs to Beijing. Accordingly, labels must read “Taiwan, China” or “Chinese Taipei.” Labels that read “Made in Taiwan” or “Republic of China” are forbidden.



This is at odds with requests made by the Taiwanese government that expects exports to be labeled with the island nation's official name.

Shipments that do not comply with Beijing’s conventions may be held, seized, rejected, or met with fines up to 4,000 yuan ($592). Apple recommended that suppliers take fast action to circumvent such disruptions and penalties.

One shipment of components from Taiwan to China was stopped on August 4 and held for review to ensure that the import declaration forms and containers were labeled to the CCP’s satisfaction.

On Saturday, the Chinese state media outlet Global Times amplified talking points issued earlier by the CCP's Ministry of Commerce, claiming that Pelosi's visit to the island nation has ""pushed the Taiwan question to the brink of a showdown"" and that ""the labeling rule is actually a message to businesspeople in Taiwan that they have to make a choice.""



That choice must be made against a backdrop of Communist Chinese forces conducting military exercises around Taiwan with the aim of demonstrating they ""can strangle the self-ruled island.""

Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, poked fun at Apple's warning to Taiwanese suppliers.



This is not the first time that Apple has policed language on behalf of the CCP.

A 2021 report produced by Citizen Lab indicated that Apple ""censors political content including broad references to Chinese leadership and China's political system, names of dissidents and independent news organizations, and general terms relating to religions, democracy, and human rights."" Additionally, researchers found that Apple's censorship in Hong Kong exceeded its legal obligations and that it had no legal justification for its political censorship in Taiwan.

Project director for AppleCensorship.com Benjamin Ismail told the Register that ""Apple has shown it is willing to go very far to secure the Chinese market, including violating sanctions by doing business with entities targeted by US sanctions.""

Apple boasts 23% market share in China, and as of last year, 156 of its 615 production facilities were based in China.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/apple-warns-taiwanese-suppliers-to-obey-communist-chinese-rules,2022-08-09
Arizona attorney general's office wants answers about 'myriad problems' faced by Maricopa County voters before results are certified,"Before the results are certified, the Arizona attorney general's office wants answers about the bungled administration of the 2022 general election in Maricopa County. On Saturday, the AGO wrote to the Maricopa County attorney's affice, raising problems voters faced in ballot tabulators and ballot-on-demand printers, along with potential election law violations.

The AGO's demand for transparency came a day after Arizona's Cochise County board delayed certifying the election results and amid Kari Lake's continued insistence that she might still win.

What are the details?

In a Nov. 19 letter addressed to the Maricopa County attorney's office, Arizona Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Wright noted that the AGO's Election Integrity Unit has received ""hundreds of complaints ... pertaining to issues related to the administration of the 2022 General Election in Maricopa County.""



""These complaints go beyond pure speculation, but include first-hand witness accounts that raise concerns regarding Maricopa's lawful compliance with Arizona election law,"" wrote Wright.

On the basis of these complaints and the problematic administration of the election, Wright underscored how Arizonans ""deserve a full report and accounting of the myriad problems"" that occurred in Maricopa County on Election Day.

In addition to voters' complaints, Wright indicated there was additional cause for concern, given that ""statements made by both Chairman Gates and Recorder Richer, along with information Maricopa County released through official modes of communication appear to confirm potential statutory violations of [Arizona election law].""

Having invoked Arizona Revised Statutes Section 16-1021, which allows the attorney general to ""enforce the provisions of this title through civil and criminal actions"" in any election for state office, the AGO demanded answers about:

Election Day ballot-on-demand printer configuration settings;

Election Day ""check-out"" procedures; and the

apparent contravention of statutory guidelines and failure to segregate, count, tabulate, tally, and transport ballots that voters were otherwise unable to have tabulated using on-site tabulators.

Wright requested that a response be given on or before Nov. 28.

Printer problems

Wright stated that at least 60 voting locations had problems with their ballot-on-demand printers, ""which appeared to have resulted in ballots that were unable to be read by on-site ballot tabulators.""

According to Votebeat Arizona, vote-counting machines had trouble tabulating ballots on Election Day ""because the timing marks on the ballot — the black lines on the sides that tell the machine where the contests are located so the machine can tally the votes — were not printing correctly. As a result, the machines were rejecting the ballots.""

Nearly 27% of the voting centers (60 of the 223) were affected, generating longer wait times and confusion.

Nearly 17,000 Maricopa County voters (7% of all in-person voters) were reportedly ""unable to watch machines tabulate their ballots on-site"" because of printing malfunctions.

Sworn complaints submitted by election workers employed by Maricopa County indicated the printers had been tested on Nov. 7 ""without any apparent problems,"" Wright noted.

Notwithstanding successful tests the night before, the printers started to malfunction within the first 30 minutes of voting on Election Day.

County Supervisor Chairman Bill Gates said at the time, ""There is no question this is frustrating. ... We don’t believe anyone has been disenfranchised.""

Gates claimed over the weekend that the printer problems did not disproportionately affect ""Republican-leaning areas.""

The AGO's election integrity unit expects a report detailing:

the voting centers that experienced these problems;

the specific problems at each location; any other printer issues that may have contributed to the problem;

a ""comprehensive log of all changes to the [ballot-on-demand] printer configuration settings (to include the identity of individuals making changes)"";

the county's standards for the printer configuration settings ""as specified in internal technical specifications and/or manufacturer technical specifications""; and

other concerns.

Although the AGO made no claims of fraud or guilt regarding the printer errors, the questions asked appear open to the possibility of malfeasance and meddling.

'Check-out' problems

Wright referenced sworn complaints received by the election integrity unit, which indicated that voters had trouble checking out of voting locations to cast their votes at functional centers.

""Not only have have poll workers reported that they were not trained and/or not provided with information on how to execute 'check out' procedures, but many voters have reported the second voting location required the voter to cast a provisional ballot as the [virtual pollbook] maintained the voter had cast a ballot in the original voting location,"" Wright wrote in her letter.

This is troubling, suggested Wright, given ""Arizona law specifically prohibits provisional ballots to be counted when a voter has signed multiple pollbooks.""

The AGO requested a report detailing whether poll workers were properly trained on how to ""check out"" voters so that they could ""lawfully vote in another location"" and all those voters who were provided a provisional ballot ""due to having already signed an e-pollbook at another Election Day voting location.

'Door 3'

Wright's letter also presses the Maricopa County attorney's office to report on the fate of ballots deposited at ""Door 3.""

Since tabulators were malfunctioning at multiple locations, affected voters were told to deposit their ballots into a slot on a secure box at each location. According to Votebeat Arizona, the boxes were labeled with a ""3"" sticker, hence the name ""Door 3.""

From there, Wright suggested that ""non-tabulated ballots were commingled with tabulated ballots at the voting location"" prior to being taken to the central elections center.

One sworn complaint suggested that thousands of non-tabulated ballots received at ""Door 3"" had been put in black duffle bags ""intended to be used for tabulated ballots.""



Liddy, Lake respond

Thomas Liddy, the civil division chief at the Maricopa County attorney's office addressed in Wright's letter, told Fox News Digital that he will convene with his clients ""and begin the process of gathering the materials necessary to respond. As you are undoubtedly aware, Ms. Wright is still working on the AG’s Final Report of the 2020 election. I am looking forward to receiving that as well.""

After the AGO's letter went out, Kari Lake told the Daily Mail that the ""way they run elections in Maricopa County is worse than in banana republics around this world.""

The Associated Press called the race for Hobbs on Nov. 14. Lake trailed Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs by fewer than 18,000 votes and has yet to concede defeat.

""I'll tell you what, I believe at the end of the day that this will be turned around, and I don't know what the solution will be, but I still believe I will become governor, and we are going to restore honesty to our elections,"" said Lake.

"Arizona Democrats want to get rid of ‘In God We Trust’ license plates, claim they fund ‘hate group’","Arizona Democrats want to get rid of ""In God We Trust"" license plates, which they claim supports a conservative ""hate group,"" the Arizona Republic reported.

A portion of the proceeds from the specialty plate goes to the Scottsdale-based Alliance Defending Freedom group, which the Southern Poverty Law Center designated as a ""hate group"" because it doesn't support same-sex marriages. ADF's mission is ""to keep the doors open for the Gospel by advocating for religious liberty, the sanctity of life, and marriage and family.""

State Sen. Juan Mendez (D) proposed legislation that would prevent the state's department of transportation from selling the plates.

""State dollars should not be funding an organization that works to strip residents of our state of their human rights and human dignity,"" Mendez told the newspaper. ""It's appalling that we've already sent over a million dollars to this extremist hate group.""

ADF has received $900,000 in proceeds from the sale of the license plates since 2014, the Republic confirmed with the transportation department.

""We were appalled by it,"" said Tory Roberg, director of government affairs for the Secular Coalition for Arizona. ""People really need to know where their money is going.""

The plates help promote the national motto, First Amendment rights, and the heritage of state and nation, according to ADOT's website.

What did ADF say?

Senior Vice President of U.S. Legal Division Kristen Waggoner defended the group's mission in a statement published on the group's website.

""It's disappointing to see elected officials become uncritical pawns in these ugly propaganda campaigns,"" Waggoner said.

Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel for ADF, told the Republic that the state hasn't violated any laws with the plates.

""Arizona is well within its rights to offer its citizens an opportunity to voluntarily purchase license plates affirming the First Amendment and contributing to ADF's work on behalf of the freedom of all Americans to live and work according to their beliefs,"" Tedesco said.

What else?

ADOT contributes $17 of the $25 purchase price of specialty plates to various causes and groups, according to the report.

Mendez proposed a second bill that would require more transparency by the transportation department about the groups receiving proceeds from specialty plates.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-democrats-want-to-end-in-god-we-trust-license-plates,2019-02-12
"Arizona GOP leaders demand audit of Dominion machines, but House speaker rejects calls to decertify results in separate statement","Republican leaders in the Arizona Legislature released statements at cross purposes in the ongoing fight over the certified results of the presidential election in the pivotal swing state.

Former Vice President Joe Biden won the state's 11 electoral states in the results that were certified by the state on Monday, but President Donald Trump and his allies have challenged the validity of the official count.

A joint press release from Arizona Senate President Karen Fann and Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers on Friday called for an independent audit of the ballot counting machines in Maricopa County.

""A significant number of voters believe that fraud occurred and with the number of irregularities it is easy to understand why,"" read the statement from House Majority Leader Warren Petersen. ""Especially concerning are the allegations made surrounding the vendor Dominion. It is imperative that the County immediately do a forensic audit on the Dominion software and equipment to make sure the results were accurate.""

Trump praised both Fann and Bowers over the statement, and said that he would win the state after the audit.

""Thank you to Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Russell Bowers – and all, for what you are doing in Arizona. A fast check of signatures will easily give us the state. Votes against have been reduced to a very small number!"" the president tweeted.

But in another statement released Friday, Bowers made it clear that he would not support any decertification of the election results, and said that he was being asked to disobey his oath of office.

""Even if such evidence existed, the Arizona Legislature simply couldn't do what is being asked. Under our state's Constitution, the Legislature can act only when it is in session, and the Legislature could call itself into a special session only with the support of a bipartisan supermajority of its members,"" Bowers wrote in the statement.

He went on to explain that because of laws passed after the 2016 election, the legislature did not have the power to appoint different electors. They could change the law but could not do so for an election already passed.

""I voted for President Trump and worked hard to reelect him. But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to reverse the results of an election,"" he added.

Bowers ended his statement with a quote from Ronald Reagan.



""Forty years ago next month, President Ronald Reagan reminded us that while the 'orderly transfer of authority' is a 'commonplace occurrence' for Americans, '[i]n the eyes of many in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.' Now Americans are reminded once again never to take for granted what President Reagan correctly described as 'the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic,'"" he concluded.

"Arizona Senate GOP to conduct full hand recount, machine audit of 2020 election results in Maricopa County","Republicans in Arizona's state Senate have announced that they are set to conduct a full review of 2020 election results in Maricopa County — including a machine audit and a hand recount of all 2.1 million ballots cast there — to ensure that President Joe Biden's victory was legitimate.

In a news release posted on the group's website last Thursday, the state Senate's Republican caucus announced that it had selected a forensic team to conduct the audit and is now finalizing details on how the review would be executed.

""As thousands of our voters continue to call for a thorough audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, I am pleased to report we have narrowed it down to a preferred forensic audit team. We are negotiating final details on the execution of the audit and hope to have an announcement soon,"" wrote Senate President Karen Fann in the news release.

""We've been reaching out to experts on election processes in Arizona and around the nation and hope to have the best and brightest involved in the audit,"" she continued, noting the audit ""will be broad and detailed.""

She further specified that the review will include, but is not limited to, ""testing the machines, scanning the ballots, performing a full hand count and checking for any IT breaches.""

Republicans in the Senate had been pushing for months for a ""full forensic audit"" of election results in Arizona's largest county, citing concerns among citizens over the integrity of the election. On Feb. 26, the audit was greenlit after a judge granted the state Senate access to ballots and tabulation machines.

According to the Arizona Republic, the county board of supervisors had ""argued the ballots were secret and the machines need to remain secure"" in fighting a subpoena issued by Senate Republicans. But Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason determined in his Feb. ruling that the Senate subpoenas were ""legal and enforceable.""

Throughout the process, Senate Republicans have insisted that a full review is necessary to restore trust in the state's election system. The Arizona Republic noted that two smaller audits of county election equipment were released last month, reportedly showing no evidence of malicious software or incorrect counting.

""When all the work is done, there will be a full report for the Senate and County to review. Our voters expect this audit, and it can be a big step in returning trust and confidence in our election process,"" Fann concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-full-hand-recount-machine-audit,2021-03-22
"Arizona governor changes his tune, welcomes Nike after slamming the company just last week over the Betsy Ross flag dust-up","Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has welcomed Nike's expansion in his state with open arms, just days after he went on a Twitter tirade slamming the company for reportedly scrapping a patriotic shoe design at the behest of activist Colin Kaepernick.

What are the details?

On Thursday, Ducey promoted an announcement on Twitter showing Nike had confirmed it would be expanding its footprint in Arizona next year with a $184 million project. ""This is good news for Arizona and for @GoodyearAZGov,"" he wrote, before touting the potential for 500 new jobs for the state and adding, ""Arizona is open for business, and we welcome @Nike to our state.""



That's an apparent about-face from what the governor said last week, when he scolded Nike after the Wall Street Journal reported the firm nixed a patriot shoe with a Betsy Ross flag on it in celebration of Independence Day because Nike endorser Colin Kaepernick ""reached out to company officials saying that he and others felt the Betsy Ross flag was an offensive symbol because of its connection to an era of slavery.""

Ducey unleashed on Nike in a series of tweets, first slamming the firm for its ""terrible decision"" before announcing he had ""ordered the Arizona Commerce Authority to withdraw all financial incentive dollars under their discretion that the State was providing for the company to locate here.""

The governor added, ""Arizona's economy is doing just fine without Nike. We don't need to suck up to companies that consciously denigrate our nation's history.""

Anything else?

The Phoenix New Times reported Friday that the financial incentives Ducey stripped from Nike last week have not been reinstated, but lawmakers and others have taken notice of the governor's changed tune. State Rep. Athena Salman (D) reacted to Ducey's ""welcome"" tweet by asking, ""Does @Nike make flip flops?""



Arizona Republic columnist Elvia Diaz wrote an op-ed Thursday, declaring, ""Really, the governor has gone nuts,"" saying Ducey was ""pretending that nothing happened, that he never rebuked Nike.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-governor-changes-his-tune-welcomes-nike-after-slamming-the-company-just-last-week-over-the-betsy-ross-flag-dust-up,2019-07-12
Arizona state House passes bill barring biological males from girls’ sports,"Lawmakers in Arizona moved a step closer to barring biological males from competing in girls' sports.

According to a report Tuesday from the Arizona Republic, the state's House of Representatives passed a bill that would close off designated female sports ""to students of the male sex"":

The emotional hours-long debate on House Bill 2706 culminated in a party-line vote of 31-29, sending the measure to the state Senate, where it will become another flashpoint in the culture wars at the state Capitol.



Rep. Nancy Barto, a Phoenix Republican who is sponsoring the measure, argued it is necessary in the face of a lawsuit in Connecticut brought by the conservative Scottsdale-based group Alliance Defending Freedom and students who argue they unfairly lost out in competition with transgender athletes.

H.B. 2706 would require sports or teams sponsored by educational institutions to be designated as either coed, male or female, with biological males not being allowed to compete in female-designated events.

The bill also says that in the event of a dispute about participation on a sport or team, ""A student may establish the student's sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that indicates the student's sex based on an analysis of the student's genetic makeup.""

The Arizona Republic story points out that a previous version of the bill had more stringent requirements for establishing biological sex in a dispute — which included determining testosterone levels — that were amended after pushback from Democrats, who said they were too invasive.

Language in the findings section of the bill declares that ""biological differences between females and males, especially as they relate to natural levels of testosterone, 'explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport,"" citing a paper from the Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy.

The proposed restrictions would apply to public schools and private schools that are part of interscholastic sports organizations, as well as public colleges and community colleges and other higher learning institutions that are members of national athletic associations such as the NCAA.

Naturally, the bill has drawn criticism from those who say that student athletes' biological makeup shouldn't trump their perceived gender identity in the realm of athletics.

""Transgender girls are girls, and transgender boys are boys,"" Amanda Parris, policy counsel for the ACLU of Arizona, said of the bill in a statement against the legislation last Friday. ""Transgender students participate in sports for the same reasons that other students do. They want enjoy the activities, challenge themselves and be a part of a team.""

""Trans athletes are not a threat. We need to protect trans kids—and all LGBTQ+ kids—and ensure they feel safe and welcomed at school,"" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said last month, urging lawmakers to reject the bill.

Meanwhile, legislators in several other states have also sought to address the question of transgender athletes in girls' sports. Similar bills have so far been proposed or filed in Idaho, Missouri, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Washington, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio and Alabama.

Arizona judge orders Maricopa County to turn over ballots to state Senate,"A judge in Maricopa County, Arizona, ordered county election officials on Friday to answer a subpoena from the state Senate to turn over ballots from the November election and provide access to its voting machines for audit.

Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason said that the Senate subpoenas were ""legal and enforceable"" in a ruling resolving a dispute between the Arizona Senate and county officials over how to interpret state law.

According to the Arizona Republic, the county had claimed it was illegal for the Senate to subpoena the ballots and contended that multiple audits of the election which had already been competed were sufficient. The Senate argued that there are still lingering questions about the validity of the ballots and the integrity of the machines and wants to commission its own audit of the election.

The dispute arose over two state laws, one defining the Senate's subpoena powers and another law that orders county election officials to seal the ballots for two years after an election.

From Arizona Republic:

First, state law gives the Legislature sweeping authority to issue subpoenas and conduct investigations. The Arizona Attorney General's Office weighed in on this, saying that legislative bodies or committee chairs can issue summonses either to inform future legislation or to ""investigate whether a particular governmental entity properly discharged its functions.""



But state law also requires that, after results are certified, ballots be kept ""in a secure facility managed by the county treasurer, who shall keep it unopened and unaltered for twenty-four months for elections for a federal office.""



That portion of the law also states that a court order could unseal the ballots.

Essentially, the county said that only a court order could request the ballots and contested the Senate's ability to subpoena. In his ruling, Thomason sided with the Senate and said the law ""does not immunize the ballots from being subpoenaed, let alone from being subpoenaed by the legislature, acting in its Constitutional role to ensure the 'purity' of elections.""

""This statute simply does not create a privilege, justifying non-disclosure,"" he concluded after a hearing Thursday.

Last December, Arizona state Senate President Karen Fann issued two subpoenas to the Maricopa County election board.

The first subpoena calls for an audit of scanned ballots to collect an electronic ballot image cast for all mail-in ballots counted in the November 2020 general election. The second subpoena calls for a full forensic audit of ballot tabulation equipment, the software for that equipment, and the election management system used in the 2020 general election, the Washington Examiner reported.

The county has already conducted multiple audits of the election, including logic and accuracy tests for the machines and a hand count of a statistically significant number of ballots. The audits found that the machines counted votes accurately.

Most recently, an independent audit of the election published its findings Tuesday. The audit found that the voting machines produced accurate numbers.

""The combination of these findings, along with the pre and post Logic and Accuracy Tests performed by the Arizona Secretary of State, the post-election hand count performed by the political parties, and the many security protocols implemented by the Elections Department confirm that Maricopa County Elections Department's configuration and setup of the tabulation equipment and election management system provided an accurate counting of ballots and reporting of election results,"" the auditors said in a statement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-judge-orders-maricopa-county-to-turn-over-ballots-to-state-senate,2021-02-26
Arizona mother assaulted children with covid for not wearing masks,"An Arizona woman has been accused of beating her children, who were COVID-positive. The 32-year-old mother assaulted her three children because they not wearing face masks in their Wickenberg home, according to police.

Sarah Michelle Boone was arrested on Dec. 26 after she purportedly abused her three children and step-children. Police responded to a call at Boone's residence, where they were informed that the mother had ""hit one child in the face, kicked a second one while he was on the floor and picked a third child up by the neck,"" according to the Associated Press.

The individual who called the police was one of the victims, who said Boone carried out the assault ""because the children all tested positive for COVID but were not wearing masks,"" according to the probable cause statement, as reported by KTAR-FM.



The ages of the children were not listed in the booking documents.

Boone reportedly fled the home before law enforcement arrived, but police officers caught up to her as she was casually walking down the street. She allegedly ignored orders to stop by the officers, did not cooperate with the police, and fought with them. Cops used a stun gun to subdue her, and eventually handcuffed her.



Authorities indicated that Boone was under the influence of alcohol when she struck the children, as reported by the Arizona Republic.

Boone was charged with three counts of child abuse, three counts of assault as well as disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

Boone was taken to a Maricopa County jail. On Tuesday, she was released on a $5,000 bond, according to Calbert Gillett, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.

Authorities encountered Boone on three previous incidents of domestic violence, police documents say. Wickenburg Police officers told KPNX-TV they have been responded to Boone's residence due to domestic violence situations involving the children once in September and twice in November. In those cases, she was cited for disorderly conduct, fighting, and knowingly touch with intent to injure/insult/provoke, Wickenburg Municipal Court records show.

Boone's next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 6.

Arizona parents and police respond after SWAT-style raid over toddler's fever,"The Chandler Police Department in Arizona has released new details regarding their overnight raid to seize three kids from a home because of a toddler's fever last month. The children's parents are speaking out, too.

What are the details?

Arizona's Department of Child Safety and the CPD have been accused of overreach after police used SWAT-style tactics to enforce a court-ordered temporary custody notice and take a couple's three children — which was prompted by the parents' refusal to take one of their kids to the emergency room in accordance with a doctor's orders.

On Feb. 25, Sarah Beck took her 2-year-old son, Heber Bryce, to the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine clinic in Tempe, where the attending physician, Dr. Bain (as revealed in a video released by police), determined the child had a fever of 105 degrees, KTVK-TV reported. Bain, fearing the child might have had meningitis, urged Beck to take Heber to the emergency room.

Beck agreed but changed her mind after re-taking Heber's temperature in the car and discovered it had dropped to 102 degrees. Once at home, Beck said, her son's temperature had dropped even further. She called the doctor to explain her reasoning, but again agreed to take the child at the physician's prompting.

After three hours went by, the hospital called Dr. Bain to inform her Heber never showed up and Beck wasn't answering her phone. So, the doctor called Department of Child Safety, which subsequently called the police. By the next day, Heber and both his siblings landed in separate foster care placements after the Chandler Police Department knocked down the door to their family home, guns drawn, to enforce DCS' wishes.

Surveillance footage released by Heber's father, Brooks Bryce, showed the police officers' use of force to take the children. After the story went viral, the CPD revealed their side of the story.

What did the police say?

In a Facebook post Thursday, the department released a statement explaining that after several attempts to speak face-to-face with Beck and Bryce, ""The residents were given a final opportunity to exit and take their child to the hospital. Upon their failure to do so, the front door was breached by patrol officers (NOT SWAT) and the family members were called out of the residence.""

The police posted footage of them knocking at the door of the home at 10:43 p.m. After that, Officer Tyler Cascio is shown leaving a voicemail for Bryce and calling Bain. Officer Cascio asks Bain to give him a ""rundown"" of what she was concerned about regarding Heber's condition, but the footage cuts out her response.

Officers are then shown purportedly making a second attempt rapping on the door at the Beck/Bryce home at 11:42 p.m. saying ""we just need to talk"" with no answer. Ten minutes later, according to the police video, Officer Cascio reaches Bryce via telephone. Bryce told the officer he'd be ""doing fine"" were it not for the ""banging on my door while my kids sleep.""

Bryce went on to assure the officer that Heber was ""doing just fine, his fever's broke, he's under 100 degrees, he's doing just fine.""

Officer Cascio explains, ""Well, we need to see it for ourselves,"" to which Bryce responds, ""No, you don't need to.""

After refusing the officer's request to speak outside, the father says, ""No, thank you.""

Officer Cascio again approached the door just before midnight and gave Bryce two options.

""You either come out here and talk to us so we can figure out how to get your kid to the hospital, or DCS is going to take temporary custody of your kids,"" the officer said. ""I'm giving you the opportunity to come out here and just talk to me.""

Cascio reiterated, ""We're not leavin'.""

In a second phone call between Cascio and Bryce, the father asks, ""Do you have a warrant to take my kids?""

The officer responds, ""We have DCS here that's going to take temporary custody of your kids if you don't come out and talk to us. You're making this way more worse than it needs to be.""

""No,"" the father responded. ""My kids are fine. You guys are making it way worse than it is.""

Officer Cascio then asked what Bryce's reservations were about coming outside to speak with the police, to which Bryce said, ""You aren't going to force me to go to the hospital and spend three grand on an emergency room visit right now,"" insisting that Heber's fever had broken and that the child would be taken to the hospital if his condition worsened.

Cascio then told Bryce that if he didn't comply, ""Then, those kids will be taken away and you guys are gonna be in some serious trouble,"" adding that the father knowingly defying the doctor's orders could be a felony charge.

The officer reiterated that the welfare of Heber was what authorities were concerned about, and the dad's explanation that his kids were not in danger was ""not gonna fly.""

Police stormed the family's residence around 1:25 a.m. the next morning, knocking down the door with guns drawn, handcuffing Bryce, and transferring all three children into the custody of DCS.

The CPD said their ""Special Victims Unit conducted a follow-up investigation and found probable cause to charge each parent with one count of Child Abuse,"" with their report noting messy conditions in the home and an unsecured firearm inside.

How did the parents respond?

Bryce told the Arizona Republic that officers' concerns over their kids' alleged messy room was due to ""laundry on our couch,"" and a shotgun noted in the police report ""actually is inert — it doesn't work.""

The father insisted police overreacted as if ""we're holding our kids hostage or they're deathly ill or barely alive.""

He said of his children, ""They were perfectly fine. [Heber] was in my arms, sleeping. As I'm on the phone with the police officer I took his temperature; it was 100 degrees. There's no reason for me to give up my kid because he has a temperature of 100 degrees and sleeping.""

He told the Republic, ""We love our children and are doing everything possible to get them back to us.""

Anything else?

When Heber was admitted to the hospital by DCS, he was found to have a respiratory virus, according to the Republic. The child did not have meningitis.

No charges were filed at the time. But police said detectives will follow up to determine if there are any criminal charges to pursue against the parents.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-parents-police-respond-following-raid-over-child-with-fever,2019-03-29
"Police knock down family's door, take their kids in overnight raid because mom didn't follow doctor's orders for child with fever","The Arizona Department of Child Safety and the Chandler Police Department in Chandler, Arizona, have fallen under scrutiny, after officers conducted an overnight SWAT-team-style raid on a family's home and took the children because an unvaccinated toddler had a fever.

What are the details?

When a 2-year-old little boy spiked a fever over 100 degrees late last month, his pregnant mother took him to the doctor around dinnertime. The physician — concerned over the fact that the child was unvaccinated and could have meningitis — told the mother to take the child to the emergency room.

The mother initially agreed, but changed her mind after leaving the doctor's office, because she said the boy began laughing, playing with his siblings, and his temperature dropped to where it was close to normal, the Arizona Republic reported.

Around 6:30 p.m., the mother called the doctor to explain the child was better and therefore she didn't want to take him to the emergency room. The mother also reportedly expressed fear of getting in trouble with the Department of Child Safety because the child wasn't vaccinated. The doctor assured the mother she wouldn't get in any trouble, and the mother once again agreed to take the toddler to the ER.

After waiting three hours, the hospital called the doctor to report that the little boy had not shown up and his mother was not answering her phone. The doctor called DCS, and DCS called the police.

At roughly 10:30 p.m., officers showed up at the family's home and knocked on the door several times, but the parents refused to open the door. The father told the police his son's ""fever broke and he was fine,"" according to police records obtained by the Republic.

The DCS then told police they were seeking a ""temporary custody notice"" from a judge in order to take the sick toddler for emergency medical aid, which was granted around midnight.

According to the police report, ""Based upon the court order, the intent of DCS to serve the order, and exigency to ensure the health and welfare of the child, the decision was made to force entry to the home if the parents refused to respond to verbal requests.""

So, after 1:00 a.m., after consulting with SWAT and the police criminal investigations bureau, the officers knocked down the family's door, with guns drawn. Surveillance footage released by the father shows the officers' use of force, which the family's attorney said should only be ""reserved for violent criminals,"" Fox News reported.

Police admitted there was no ""criminal incident,"" according to the Republic. Yet, DCS also obtained temporary custody orders for the sick toddler's two siblings, and the three kids were removed from the home and placed in the care of separate foster families, where they remain. DCS is conducting a review of the kids' grandparents to see if they can be entrusted to care for the children.

Neither parent was arrested, but they are being forced to undergo psychological evaluations and complete a ""family reunification plan"" before officials consider returning their children to them.

Anything else?

Legislators and parents' advocates are furious over the case. State Rep. Kelly Townsend (R) criticized authorities for conducting the raid, telling Fox News, ""At that point who now owns control over the child? And it seems like we've given that now to the doctor and the parent no longer has the say or they risk the SWAT team taking all of your children and potentially the newborn.""

Lori Ford, a member of a DSC watchdog group called Arizona DCS Oversight told the Republic, ""They (DCS) had no right to bust into this family's home and take their kids. But now, they (DCS) have control of this family. These children are traumatized, and all over a fever that wasn't even a fever anymore when they went to the hospital — just like the parents said.""

The family's attorney concurred, saying, ""All because of a fever. It's absolutely ridiculous.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-police-raid-home-over-kid-with-fever,2019-03-28
Arizona Republicans to seek more data and materials from Maricopa County as officials slam uncertified auditors,"Arizona State Senate Republicans will seek additional material and data from Maricopa County as part of a now three-month audit of the 2020 election results, Senate President Karen Fann (R-Prescott) said Thursday.

During a hearing at the state Capitol, witnesses from Cyber Ninjas, the uncertified Florida-based cybersecurity firm contracted by Fann to conduct the outside audit, told her and Sen. Warren Petersen (R-Gilbert) they have finished auditing the 2.1 million ballots cast in the November election but need wireless routers and voting machine tokens from the county, or else their review will be ""incomplete."" Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan also recommended that canvassers go door to door to question some registered voters on whether they actually voted by mail, the Arizona Republic reported.

""Based on the data we're seeing, I highly recommend we do the canvassing because it's the one way to know for sure whether the data we're seeing are real problems,"" Logan said.

Previously, the state Senate has held off on dispatching canvassers after the U.S. Department of Justice warned that such an effort might be directed primarily at minority communities and that it could be a form of voter intimidation and violate federal civil rights laws.

If Maricopa County officials refuse to comply with the requests for additional materials, it is likely the Senate will take them to court, which could delay the publication of a final report on the audit for weeks or months. Senate Republicans already sued once for access to ballots and tabulation machines from the county and were only able to begin the audit after a judge ruled in their favor in February. Republicans argued the delay brought on by more litigation might be necessary to deliver an accurate report.

""We need to get the additional information because how do you do a final report if you don't have all the information?"" Fann said.

County officials contend that they have already turned over everything a qualified auditor would need to complete an election audit and refuse to deliver further materials to auditors who are not certified by the Elections Assistance Commission.

Allegations of voting irregularities

Witness testimony on the findings from the audit raised several concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election. Logan testified alongside Ben Cotton, the founder of CyFir, a cybersecurity company that is subcontracting for the audit.

Logan claimed that nearly 4,000 Maricopa County voters who cast ballots in the presidential election registered to vote after a court-ordered deadline of Oct. 15.

""Based on the registration information that we found in the voting rolls, we have 3,981 individuals who show having voted in this election [who] were registered after Oct. 15,"" he said.

According to Logan, there were 11,326 individuals who did not appear on the version of the voter rolls made the day after the Nov. 6 election but did appear on voter rolls prepared on Dec. 7.

He also testified that 18,000 voters who cast ballots in November were removed from voter rolls after the election.

The auditor further alleged that 74,243 early votes were received, but ""there is no clear record of them being sent."" Logan emphasized that the discrepancy could be a ""clerical issue"" but added there is no real way to know without contacting voters directly.

""I think when we've got 74,000 it merits knocking on a door and validating some of this information,"" said Logan.

Officials from Maricopa County responded to several of these claims in real time on social media. The county pointed out that the 74,000 early ballots are explained by the fact that you can vote early by mail or in person at voting centers. Anyone who votes in person receives a ballot at the center, so ""it's not unusual that we would have more early votes than mail-in ballots sent.""

Logan also raised concerns over the way ballots were printed, explaining that because voters were provided with felt-tipped markers on Election Day, there was a possibility that the ink bled through to the opposite side of the ballot, which could alter how the vote was counted. County officials have insisted that this ""bleed-through"" effect is of no concern because the ballots are printed in such a way that the ""bubbles"" were aligned. If it did happen, poll workers would easily recognize it and correct the ballot, they said.

But Logan provided images that he says show that the ballots on Election Day were misaligned and that stray marks could have resulted in a ballot cast for the wrong candidate or an invalidated ballot because it appeared someone cast their vote twice. According to the Arizona Daily Star, as many as 168,000 ballots were printed and cast at voting centers on Election Day.



Concerns over security

Cotton testified that the voting machines used in Maricopa County had not received a security patch since 2019, when they were certified. He said it was ""critically important"" that the county turn over its routers for examination to determine what security risks were present on Election Day.

He noted that days before the election, the FBI raided a home in Fountain Hills as part of its investigation into a cyber attack on the county's voter registration system. The county had identified the attack and reported it to the authorities, but Cotton said the incident shows that at least one part of the county's election system had been ""hacked.""

Responding, county officials said Thursday that the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission prohibits uncertified individuals such as Cyber Ninjas and CyFir from handling certified election equipment, which is why they have refused to turn over the requested materials. The county added in a tweet that ""we cannot update our systems through security patches. That is why we maintained an air gapped system. Installing security patches would be changing the system that was certified.""

County officials have also previously said that turning over the information on its routers could compromise law enforcement data. If Fann presses for those materials, Maricopa County is almost sure to fight the request in court.

Republican Infighting



The controversy over Maricopa County's election results has pitted state Republican lawmakers against locally elected GOP officials in what was once a GOP stronghold.

President Joe Biden shocked Republicans by winning Maricopa County by more than 45,000 votes, narrowly defeating Donald Trump in the state of Arizona by about 10,000 votes total. Trump's insistence that the election was stolen despite multiple machine audits that verified the results has frustrated Maricopa County officials, who have defended the integrity of their election.

In a statement, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers blasted the Senate audit hearing and criticized Senate Republicans for contracting auditors who were not certified by the EAC.

""It's clear the people hired by Arizona Senate leadership to supposedly bring integrity to our elections are instead just bringing incompetence,"" Sellers said.

He accused Logan and Cotton of asking ""open-ended questions, portraying as suspicious what is actually normal and well known to people who work in elections.""

""In some cases, they dropped bombshell numbers that are simply not accurate,"" he added.

""What we heard today represents an alternate reality that has veered out of control since the November General Election. Senate leadership should be ashamed they broadcast the half-baked theories of the 'Deep Rig' crowd to the world today,"" he continued.

""To Senate leaders I say, stop accusing us of not cooperating when we have given you everything qualified auditors would need to do this job. Finish your audit, release the report, and be prepared to defend it in Court.""



Speaking at the hearing, Fann defended the actions of Senate Republicans from critics who say their efforts are a waste of time and are feeding conspiracy theories that the election was stolen.

""This is not about Trump. This is not about overturning the election. This has never been about anything other than election integrity,"" Fann insisted.

She cited a poll that found 45% of the people in Arizona thought there were serious problems with the election and reminded critics that as elected officials, lawmakers have a duty to respond to those concerns.



""Whether that is true or not, whether they are rumors and unfounded accusations or legitimate problems, for whatever reason, as a Senate body, we felt that it was our obligation and our duty to answer,"" said Fann.

""Our voters are constituents. Answer those questions and either confirm what they were afraid of or thought or heard, or that we prove that those things were not true so that they could go back to the polls and they could vote with confidence knowing that their ballot is sacred.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-republicans-to-seek-more-data-and-materials-from-maricopa-county-as-officials-slam-uncertified-auditors,2021-07-16
"Astronauts snub fellow astronaut Mark Kelly, a Democrat, endorse Republican Martha McSally instead","Astronaut Mark Kelly, who is running as a Democrat to take the late John McCain's former U.S. Senate seat in Arizona, was snubbed by fellow astronauts last week.

What is the background?

Kelly is running against Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) in a close race to take control of the seat that was left vacant by McCain's death two years ago. Sen. Jon Kyl (R), McCain's appointed successor, resigned in late 2018, and McSally was appointed to occupy the seat, taking office in January 2019.

The race is critical for Republicans, who are fighting to maintain their majority in the Senate. Republicans essentially hold a three-seat majority, and they cannot afforded to cede ground to Democrats.

The race has taken on even more importance in the wake of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. If Republicans cannot confirm Ginsburg's successor, Amy Coney Barrett, quickly enough, the party may have one less vote in Barrett's favor.

That's because McSally and Kelly are competing in a special election to fulfill the final two years of McCain's term. If Kelly wins, he could be seated as soon as Nov. 30 — not in January 2021 like all other election winners.

What are the details?

In an essay for the Arizona Republic, Tom Stafford, Charlie Duke, and Jack Lousma — who have spent about 2,400 hours in space combined — endorsed McSally and explained why Kelly is unfit for the job.

Of McSally, they wrote:

McSally delivered results for Arizona. Just look at the stats: She was ranked as one of the most bipartisan senators last year and tied for the most bills passed into law. Just this year, she introduced legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, started the national Veterans Treatment Courts to help improve the lives of veterans, and she helped write the legislation that gave families and small businesses help to get through the novel coronavirus. Whether it's helping secure funds for Fort Huachuca, leading on the Drought Contingency Plan or getting Congress to pass land exchanges that give local control back to Arizona, Martha springs into action when her constituents reach out to her with a problem.

On the other hand, the astronauts blasted Kelly, writing that ""having 'astronaut' on your resume does not mean you'd be a good U.S. senator.""

""Mark Kelly is hoping Arizonans are so impressed with his background that they ignore the fact that he's supported radical gun control activists, that his plan for the eventual government takeover of health care would end Medicare as we know it, and that he'd vote to raise our taxes,"" they wrote.

""On some of the more extreme policies of the Democrat Party, Mark has tried to stay quiet. We can only think of one reason: He doesn't want to answer for his liberal political views and policies and those of his party,"" the astronauts added.

The astronauts went on to write that Kelly must answer for the Democratic Party, which they noted has become more progressive in recent years.

""Mark Kelly has to answer for the policies of his party because if he were elected, that's what would become law in a Democrat-controlled government,"" they wrote. ""McSally has delivered for Arizona, while Mark Kelly embraces Democrat ideology that would be bad for our country — leaving us with less freedoms, less security and less control of our lives.""

What do the polls say?

Unfortunately for McSally, the polls have good news for Kelly.

According to the RealClearPolitics average, Kelly leads McSally by 6% in the run-up to the election, a gap significant enough to worry Republicans about losing the seat.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/astronauts-snub-fellow-astronaut-mark-kelly-a-democrat-endorse-republican-martha-mcsally-instead,2020-10-05
"Austria imposes full national lockdown, will become first European country to require COVID vaccinations for all eligible citizens","Amid rising COVID-19 cases, Austria announced it would implement a full national lockdown. The country will also require COVID-19 vaccinations for all eligible citizens – the first such measure in Europe.

Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg announced the latest lockdown and compulsory COVID-19 vaccinations on Friday after meeting the governors of Austria's nine provinces.

""We don't want a fifth wave. We don't want a sixth and seventh wave,"" Schallenberg said at a press conference. ""We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated. It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.""

""We have not managed to get enough unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. The most recent measures have increased daily vaccinations but not enough. For a long time, it was consensus in the country that a vaccine mandate is not necessary, but we have to face reality,"" Schallenberg — who was named chancellor last month after the resignation of his predecessor Sebastian Kurz over corruption accusations — said.

""This is a dramatic step,"" Schallenberg continued. ""In the long term, the way out of this vicious circle we are in — and it is a vicious circle, we are stumbling from wave to lockdown, and that can't carry on ad infinitum — is only vaccination.""

Starting on Feb. 1, Austria will make vaccinations mandatory – the most stringent measure to attempt to control the coronavirus pandemic through vaccination in Europe and of all Western countries. According to Reuters, the other countries that have vaccine mandates for all eligible adult citizens are Indonesia, Micronesia, and Turkmenistan.

Of Austria's population of 9 million, 65% are fully vaccinated.

The national lockdown goes into effect Monday. The stay-at-home order will initially last for 10 days, but can be extended for a maximum of 20 days if cases don't diminish sufficiently.

""Austrians will be asked to work from home, non-essential shops will close, and schools will remain open for children who require face-to-face learning,"" the BBC reported.

Austria launched a lockdown for unvaccinated people last week, but expanded the order to everyone after cases spiked.

A record 15,145 cases were reported in Austria on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In the past week, there were a record 88,315 cases. There were 55 reported COVID-19 deaths on Thursday and 302 deaths in the last week. The highest daily death toll during the pandemic in Austria was 218 on Dec. 17, 2020. The deadliest week was Dec. 13–Dec. 19, 2020, with 878 fatalities.

Austria is one of many European countries with surging COVID-19 cases. Germany experienced a record 68,366 coronavirus cases on Wednesday. The Czech Republic had a pandemic-high 22,585 cases on Wednesday. The Netherlands hit a record 23,641 cases on Thursday. Belgium had a record 32,708 cases on Nov. 3. As of yet, the record cases have not equated to record deaths.





Because of the latest COVID-19 wave sweeping Europe, countries have reimplemented coronavirus restrictions. Last week, the Netherlands established a partial three-week lockdown that closed down bars, restaurants, and supermarkets at 8 p.m.; sporting events will be played in empty stadiums. The government recommends no more than four visitors to one home.

On Wednesday, Belgium announced it would require employees to work from home four days a week into mid-December, Bloomberg reported.



Germany will implement restrictions for unvaccinated people. In areas with a hospitalization rate of more than three coronavirus patients per 100,000 people over the past seven days, only the vaccinated and those who have recovered from coronavirus will be permitted to access to public spaces like sporting events, cultural shows, and restaurants.

Even Sweden – which has pushed back against most COVID-19 restrictions – said it would introduce coronavirus vaccine passes next month for indoor events where more than 100 people attend.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/austria-covid-lockdown-germany-europe,2021-11-19
Authorities believe David Ortiz wasn't actually the target of the club shooting that left him hospitalized,"After former Boston Red Sox star David Ortiz was shot in the back in the Dominican Republic, reports surfaced that he was the target of a hit by a drug lord who thought Ortiz was having an affair with his girlfriend.

Now, authorities are saying something totally different.

The Dominican Republic's attorney general said this week that Ortiz was not the target at all, and that him being shot was a case of mistaken identity. ESPN reports:

The Dominican Republic's attorney general and national police director told reporters that the attempted murder was ordered from the United States by Victor Hugo Gomez, an associate of Mexico's Gulf Cartel. They said Gomez had hired a gang of killers to eliminate his cousin, whom Gomez suspected of turning him in to Dominican drug investigators in 2011.

The cousin, Sixto David Fernandez, was seated with the former baseball star on the night of June 9, when a gunman approached and fired a single shot at Ortiz, the officials said. Fernandez owned an auto-repair shop and was friends with Ortiz, according to Attorney General Jean Alain Rodriguez and Maj. Gen. Ney Aldrin Bautista Almonte, director of the Dominican Republic's national police.

Ortiz is recovering in a Boston hospital after he was shot in the back, and the bullet came out of his stomach.

Some in the Dominican Republic are skeptical that someone would mistakenly shoot a person as high profile as Ortiz, especially considering that reported intended target is much smaller with a lighter skin tone.

""He is big. He likes to attract attention. He wears a lot of jewelry. He's flashy all around, said Daniel Pou, an independent public security consultant, to ESPN.

Authorities have arrested 11 people in the case, including suspected gunmen, drivers and accomplices. One of the suspects, who tried to escape the scene on a motorcycle, was beaten by bystanders before being turned in to police.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/authorities-believe-david-ortiz-wasnt-actually-the-target-of-the-club-shooting-that-left-him-hospitalized,2019-06-20
I am thankful for the cornerstone of America's greatness: the rule of law,"There are innumerable reasons to be thankful to God for the many blessings we receive and enjoy at literally every moment of our existence. Not the least of these is the cornerstone for much of our blessed nation's incredible prosperity and success — the rule of law.

There are numerous causes for the greatness of America, but often the rule of law is ignored and not given enough credit for the nation's miraculous success.

That our society votes for representatives to debate and write our laws in order to protect us from taking advantage of another, is a pivotal development in the history of mankind. And the fruits of this achievement should be clearly obvious to everyone who has eyes to see.

Some might say the rule of law has been unequally shared in our nation's history. That is absolutely correct, and we should never pretend otherwise or forget the lessons from the ugliness in our past. But don't let perfect be the enemy of good, and don't let us throw out our blessings because they were imperfectly shared.

Others might say the rule of law is not sufficient to secure the blessings of liberty to every citizen. This is true. And we want it that way, and the founders designed it that way. Forcing the citizenry to decide their own good, and making them work to achieve it themselves is a feature, not a bug, of the health of our country. It is no accident that when the state begins to promise to deliver happiness the citizens should acquire for themselves, the rule of law is often an obstacle to be defeated in that endeavor.

Finally, it is important to be thankful for the rule of law because its nature is such that it is not self-perpetuating. This pillar of the Republic must be constantly attended to, constantly maintained and defended. There are enough examples of countries in the world which began with the right principles, but quickly fell into despotism and totalitarianism because a strong man leader ignored the rule of law and persuaded the citizenry that their lives would be better as peasants.

Yes, it's probably boring as heck to most people. But many important things are boring to the many.

This year, remember to be thankful for one of the greatest gifts the founders handed to their posterity: the rule of law.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/be-thankful-for-the-rule-of-law,2019-11-28
Republican resolution calls for US boycott of Winter Olympics unless it's moved from 'brutal dictatorship' of China,"Republicans in the House of Representatives called for the United States to boycott the Winter Olympics because it is being hosted in Beijing by China.

The resolution by Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida listed numerous outrageous acts by the communist government of China.

""The Chinese Communist Party has carried out a number of heinous acts in the last year alone that should disqualify them from hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics,"" said Rep. Waltz. ""The world cannot legitimize the CCP's acts of genocide in Xinjiang, destruction of the democratic rights of Hong Kong, and dangerous suppression of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan that cost lives by sending delegations to Beijing.""

Here's a list of some of the offenses Waltz listed:



The genocide and mass internment of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang providence of China.

The undermining of democratic rights and dismantling of ""one country, two systems"" framework in Hong Kong.

The CCP targeting and control of religious practices in China.

The failure to report the outbreak of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization and suppression of reports from medical doctors in Wuhan, China.

The resolution calls for the United States Olympic Committee to request the location of the Olympics, scheduled Feb. 4-20, 2022, to be moved to another site away from Beijing.

""[H]osting the 2022 Winter Olympics Games in the [People's Republic of China], where organized atrocities in the [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region] are ongoing; where the freedoms of Hong Kong's citizens are being trampled; where the fundamental right to worship is brutally persecuted; and in the wake of the ongoing global devastation from COVID-19; would be immoral, unethical and wrong,"" the resolution read.

Some lawmakers in Britain have already called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics over similar concerns.

On Sunday, China responded by warning that any country participating in a boycott would face economic sanctions.

""China will seriously sanction any country that follows such a call,"" said Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-controlled Global Times. ""Boycotting 2022 Beijing Winter Games, an unpopular idea, won't receive wide support.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/beijing-olympics-boycott-dictatorship,2021-02-16
Sen. Sasse rips Democrat's 'sinister ... paranoid obsession' that the FBI conducted a 'fake' investigation of Justice Kavanaugh,"Left-wing progressive Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made headlines this week with his letter to U.S Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding the Department of Justice look into the FBI's ""perhaps fake"" investigation of allegations of misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh that were brought up during his 2018 Supreme Court nomination hearings.

Whitehouse has made a bit of a name for himself with his rabid rants against and conspiracy theories about Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices.

For example, the far-left New England Democrat garnered a lot of attention for a long-winded diatribe about a conspiracy connecting ""dark money"" to federal courts that he believed he had uncovered and then ""exposed"" during the nomination hearings for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Now GOP Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) is standing up to Whitehouse and telling him to knock it off, warning that his most recent nonsense is a threat to the republic.

What happened?

Whitehouse sent a letter to Garland on Monday accusing the FBI of conducting ""a politically-constrained and perhaps fake FBI investigation into alleged misconduct by now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.""

The senator was upset that the law enforcement agency did not find corroboration of the allegations against Kavanaugh — corroboration that the justice's accusers failed to provide themselves.

Whitehouse claimed that the FBI ignored multiple witnesses and sent ""tips"" down a virtual ""garbage chute."" He went on to accuse FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""stonewalling"" congressional inquiries about the investigation.

Following publication of Whitehouse's allegations, Sen. Sasse decided it was time to punch back against the Democratic senator's ongoing ""sinister"" bloviation that, according to the Nebraska senator, is actually a threat to the nation.

“If senators want to join conspiracy theory book clubs, wear tinfoil hats, and talk about Roswell, that's their prerogative, but this is something more sinister,"" Sasse, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee with Whitehouse, told National Review.

Whitehouse's rhetoric goes beyond political differences over SCOTUS nominees, Sasse said. Now, the Rhode Island senator is actually attempting to use the Justice Department to take down a member of the nation's highest court.

""A United States Senator who once peddled lies about a Supreme Court nominee is now trying to weaponize the DOJ against a sitting Supreme Court Justice,"" Sasse added. ""This kind of paranoid obsession is Nixonian poison to public trust.""

Not the first Sasse-vs.-Whitehouse conspiracy kerfuffle

This isn't the first time Sasse has taken Whitehouse to task for his conspiracy twaddle.

In July, the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a government panel that creates binding conduct guidelines for federal judges, was considering changing its rules in order to ban judges from being members of the Federalist Society, at least in part at the urging of Sen. Whitehouse, who has repeatedly attempted to connect the organization with ""dark money"" plots and underhanded conservative movements.

The committee ultimately decided against the Federalist Society membership ban, to which Sasse responded with thanks and a dig at Whitehouse's penchant for perpetuating conspiracy theories.

""I'm glad the Judicial Conference decided not to participate in a vicious liberal smear campaign against the Federalist Society,"" Sasse said. ""Senator Whitehouse can hyperventilate about the Illuminati all he wants, but the Federalist Society is a group of law students and lawyers with diverse opinions who formed a debate society. Because they take the Constitution and the rule of law seriously, they've been the target of a ruthless blitz that will ultimately erode confidence in an independent and fair Judiciary. The Judicial Conference made the right call.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ben-sasse-sheldon-whitehouse-paranoid-obsession-brett-kavanaugh,2021-03-17
"Bernie Sanders claims the USSR wasn't socialist, gets called out for Sweden comparison by Fox News host","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a democratic socialist presidential candidate, tried to separate his brand of socialism from that of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics when questioned Monday during a Fox News town hall by woman from Russia, the Daily Caller reported.

What was the question?

A woman named Margaret, who said she was from Russia, asked Sanders to address the concerns of her and others who had suffered under socialism and explain why his so-called democratic socialism would be different.



""As someone from Russia, a country that was greatly impacted by the negative effects of socialism, what assurances can you offer myself and other people impacted by socialism that democratic socialism will not have the same results?""

Bernie's response

""What happened and existed in the Soviet Union was not socialism. It was authoritarian communism,"" Sanders responded, as the audience began applauding. ""And communism, whether in Cuba, whether in the Soviet Union, whether in other countries, was marked by totalitarianism, was marked by throwing millions of people into the gulag — Stalinism was about as bad as it got.



""But right near — you're from Russia; I don't know if you've ever visited Finland. Finland is a neighbor to Russia. They have a very democratic society with strong democratic socialist principles,"" Sanders continued. ""Everybody in Finland has health care as a right. Their educational system is perhaps the best in the world, and college there is free. They take environmental responsibility very, very seriously. They have one of the lowest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. And you know what? Their voting rate — people who participate in their elections — is a lot higher than it is in the United States. So when we talk about democratic socialism, Margaret, I'm talking about Finland, I'm talking about Denmark, I'm talking about Sweden, I'm talking about countries all over the world who have used their government to try to improve life for working families, not just the people on top.""

Not so fast, Bernie

Fox News host Martha MacCallum, who was hosting the town hall along with Bret Baier, didn't let Sanders off the hook on his reference to Sweden — she had a response ready pointing to the numerous ways Sweden has moved toward a more free market system over the last few decades.



Sanders' response? ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-claims-the-ussr-wasnt-socialist,2020-03-10
Sanders doubles down on support for communist dictator Fidel Castro in '60 Minutes' interview,"In a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday night, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders doubled down on comments he made in the 1980s where he praised late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. When asked about his current stance on Castro, the Democratic front-runner said he continues supporting aspects of his totalitarian regime.

""We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba,"" Sanders told host Anderson Cooper before pivoting to defending Castro. ""But it's unfair to say that everything is bad.""

He then began parroting talking points often cited by the country's communist government. ""When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing even though Fidel Castro did it?""

Sanders is parroting communist propaganda

While it is true that Castro implemented a reading program on the island after seizing power in a bloody revolution in 1959, Cuba's literacy rate was already high for a Latin American nation at the time and its educational gains have been comparable to those of its peers in the years since.

As attorney Hans Bader noted in an August 2016 article, nearly eight out of 10 Cubans already knew how to read by 1950. This figure was similar to that of Costa Rica, which also achieved 100 percent literacy over the following decades — except Costa Rica and other countries did so without the kind of Marxist dictatorship that Cubans have endured under the Castro regime for over 61 years.

According to UNESCO, Cuba had about the same literacy rate as Costa Rica and Chile in 1950 (close to 80%). And it has almost the same literacy rate as they do today (close to 100%). Meanwhile, Latin American countries that were largely illiterate in 1950 — like Peru, Brazil, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic — are largely literate today, closing much of the gap with Cuba. El Salvador had a less than 40% literacy rate in 1950, but has an 88% literacy rate today. Brazil and Peru had a less than 50% literacy rate in 1950, but today, Peru has a 94.5% literacy rate, and Brazil a 92.6% literacy rate. The Dominican Republic's rate rose from a little over 40% to 91.8%. While Cuba made substantial progress in reducing illiteracy in Castro's first years in power, its educational system has stagnated since, even as much of Latin America improved.

The island's literacy program was part of a Marxist indoctrination effort

Reached by TheBlaze on Sunday evening, Dr. Andy Gomez, a retired University of Miami professor who led the school's Cuban Studies department for decades, said the democratic socialist presidential candidate is misinforming voters about the true motives behind Castro's education efforts.

""Contrary to what Senator Bernie Sanders said, the literacy campaign used by the Castro regime was part of their strategic plan to indoctrinate the Cuban people by using education at all levels in support of a Marxist ideology,"" Gomez said.

Claims of Castro's health care, education, and social achievements have been a common talking point of the Castro regime for decades.

As National Review's Jay Nordlinger noted, in 1986 former Cuban political prisoner Armando Valladares was asked at a Harvard forum about Cuba's literacy rate and other supposed accomplishments of the island's communist revolution. He responded by noting that not only are many of the regime's claims false, even if they were true, they came at the expense of basic human freedoms and dignity.

Say all those things are true. They're not, but just say they are. Can't you have those things without torturing people? Can't you have them without wrongly imprisoning them? Can't you have them without killing them? Without denying them rights? Without forbidding them to speak freely, without forbidding them to worship, without forbidding them to vote and have a normal political life and pursue their own destinies, and so on? Why is material well-being — not that Cuba has it, or anything remotely like it — but why is material well-being incompatible with freedom? Or not even with freedom: with the absence of a stifling, horrid dictatorship? Why?",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-doubles-down-on-his-support-for-communist-fidel-castro-in-60-minutes-interview,2020-02-24
"Ronald Klain, Biden's chief of staff, said elections rigged","Former Vice President Joe Biden selected Ronald Klain as his White House chief of staff on Wednesday. Within hours of Klain being named to the new position, a 2014 tweet by Klain saying that elections are ""rigged"" resurfaced and raised eyebrows.

Klain's tweet was a reply to a Vox.com post on Twitter linking to an article titled, ""68% of Americans think elections are rigged."" Klain reacted to the article by declaring, ""That's because they are.""

The article, which was written by Vox founder Ezra Klein, argues, ""Elections are rigged in favor of incumbents. And they're basically right.""

The article claims election fraud isn't the problem.

""Incumbents get a voice in gerrymandering — meaning that the politicians, in an inversion of the normal rules of democracy, get to choose their voters,"" Klein wrote.

The article highlights that ""very few congressional elections are seriously competitive"" because ""reelection rates for incumbents tend to hover around 90 percent — and they occasionally get perilously close to 100 percent."" Adding that the ""powers of incumbency are so strong that overall congressional approval ratings barely affect congressional reelection rates.""

The Vox article cited a 2014 Rasmussen poll with the headline, ""68% Think Election Rules Rigged for Incumbents.""

As of Thursday morning, Klain's tweet was still up, and Twitter had not slapped a warning label on it.

Klain was the general counsel to Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore during the Florida recount in the 2000 election against Republican George W. Bush. He argued against counting overseas absentee ballots, which would have ""potentially thrown out the votes of hundreds of military members stationed overseas,"" as reported by CNN.

""The idea that people were going to vote after the election and have those votes count, that's a pretty irregular idea,"" Klain said in 2000.



Following a machine recount, Bush's lead stood at 327 votes. Klain called Florida a ""Third World banana republic"" for its handling of the 2000 recount.

Klain served as chief of staff to Gore when he was vice president between 1995 and 1999, as well as to former Vice President Biden from 2009 to 2011.

On Wednesday, Biden issued a statement on selecting Klain as his White House chief of staff:

""Ron has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014. His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-chief-staff-klain-elections-riggedged,2020-11-12
"President Biden gets blasted for new 'rule' on COVID-19 vaccinations and masks: 'Kindly, screw off'","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally eased indoor face mask requirements on Thursday. The new CDC guidance allows vaccinated Americans to not have to wear masks outdoor and in most indoor settings. Following the announcement, President Joe Biden issued his own new ""rule"" about face masks and coronavirus vaccinations, which caused a stir on social media, and many lambasted the order as ""authoritarian.""

The official Twitter account for President Biden posted a video calling for Americans to get ""vaxxed or masked,"" and had the caption: ""Folks, if you're fully vaccinated — you no longer need to wear a mask. If you're not vaccinated yet — go to http://vaccines.gov to find a shot, and mask up until you're fully vaccinated.""

The Twitter account for President Biden also posted a proclamation, ""The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. The choice is yours.""

There was an immediate backlash to Biden's ""rule."" Twitter reactions labeled the order as unconstitutional, and said the ultimatum wasn't really a ""choice.""

BlazeTV host Glenn Beck hurled back, ""Hey #POTUS - the rule is simple. Kindly, screw off. You will find the rules in a little read document called 'the constitution'. The sequel is even better. You can find it on line under 'The Bill of Rights'. You and your authoritarian pals will find it a quick read.""

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-K.Y.) countered the president on Twitter, ""Show us in the Constitution where you have this power Mr @POTUS. (You don't).""

Rep. Paul Gosar (R- Ariz.) stated, ""Men must be governed by God or they will be ruled by tyrants.""

Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) retorted, ""Requirement to do one or the other of two things demanded by another person, against your will, is not called a choice; it's called coercion, and we reject it in a free society.""

Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) reacted by saying, ""No. 1) The federal government can't force you to wear a mask until you're vaccinated, 2) it would also have no way of tracking vaccinations, and 3) this doesn't account for natural antibodies.""

'They don't understand': Biden responds to angry Americans who called him out while touring storm damage,"President Joe Biden completely dismissed angry Americans on Tuesday who earlier in the day had called out the president as he was touring the storm damage in New Jersey.

What happened first?

As Biden was touring damage caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, nearby people in a Manville, New Jersey, residential neighborhood yelled at the president.

""I'm an immigrant and I am proud of this country,"" one woman screamed. ""I'd give my life for this country. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves — this is a republic, not China. It's sad. It's sad that America has come to this. It's sad — despicable.""

Others nearby demanded that Biden resign, and even called him a ""f***ing tyrant."" One man said, ""All this for a f***in' photo-op? You ain't gonna do s**t!""

Also heard in the background was a man chiding Biden for his botched Afghanistan withdrawal. Although the audio is difficult to discern, the man said his friend died in Afghanistan in 2011.

""For what? So this guy could pull this s**t? You leave them in ruins and you leave Americans behind!"" the man screamed.

""You leave Americans behind!"" the man screamed again. ""We will leave you behind!""

Content Warning: Strong language:

As the New York Post noted, anti-Biden demonstrators lined the streets where his motorcade drove. People reportedly gave Biden the middle finger, and many held anti-Biden signs.

One sign reportedly read ""F*** Biden And F*** You for Voting For Him,"" while another said, ""Biden go back 2 the basement."" People also held pro-Trump flags and signs.

How did Biden respond?

While speaking in Queens after surveying the storm damage, Biden acknowledged that he was heckled, but outright dismissed the angry Americans.

Biden oddly claimed the hecklers did not live in the neighborhood — despite cameras capturing some of those who voiced the frustrations standing clearly inside a fenced yard — and said the hecklers were angry about ""free enterprise.""

""The people who stand on the other side of the fences, who don't live there, who are yelling that we're talking about interfering with free enterprise by doing something about climate change — they don't live there, they don't live— they don't understand,"" Biden said.

Biden has blamed climate change for Hurricane Ida, which killed dozens of Americans, mainly in New York and New Jersey. He used a speech on Tuesday to urge Americans to take ""bold action now to tackle the accelerating effects of climate."" Biden suggested his multitrillion dollar spending bills are the solution that Americans need.

The president is also asking Congress for $24 billion in disaster relief funds, NPR reported. The money would be used to help recover Americans impacted by tropical storms, like Hurricane Ida, and wildfires that continue to ravage the west, as they do every summer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-dismisses-angry-americans-who-called-him-out,2021-09-08
"President Biden eases sanctions, offers to restart nuclear deal talks with Iran","President Joe Biden's administration on Thursday says that it is ready to commence talks with Iran to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal.

What's a brief history here?

Former President Donald Trump famously withdrew from the Obama-era deal in 2018.

According to reports, the Biden administration has also began taking steps with the United Nations to restore the policy to what it was before Trump's move to strike it down.

Biden has said that he would attempt to save the deal so long as Tehran resumes compliance with the agreement terms.

Iran previously set a deadline of Feb. 21 and vowed that if oil and banking sanctions are not removed, the country would expel the United Nation's nuclear inspectors from the country.

What are the details?

According to the Daily Wire, the state department announced the developments ""following discussions between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his British, French, and German counterparts,"" and just one day before Biden speaks with Group of Seven (G7) leaders at the Munich Security Conference.



""At both,"" the outlet noted, ""Biden is expected to discuss his commitment to multilateral diplomacy and his desire to undo damage that Trump's positions may have caused over the previous four years.""

In a statement on the matter, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the country is willing to further talks regarding the deal.

""The United States would accept an invitation from the European Union High Representative to attend a meeting of the P5+1 and Iran to discuss a diplomatic way forward on Iran's nuclear program,"" Price said.

No such invitation has been extended at the time of this reporting.

According to the Associated Press, ""In addition to signaling a willingness to talk with Iran, the administration also reversed Trump's determination that all U.N. sanctions against Iran had been restored. And, it eased stringent restrictions on the domestic travel of Iranian diplomats posted to the United Nations.""

The Daily Wire added, ""National security expert Tim Morrison, who was on Trump's National Security Council and is currently a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told The Daily Wire in a statement that the Biden administration was giving up all leverage as it tried to restart the 'dangerously flawed' deal.""

""The Biden Administration is repeating the mistakes of the Obama Administration,"" Morrison said. ""It's making concessions to get nothing more than a meeting. The Iran deal was dangerously flawed in 2015. In 2021, with key provisions expired, it's simply national security malpractice to return to that deal. The Trump Administration bequeathed Biden tremendous leverage over Iran — it must not squander it.""

The outlet added:

Nuclear weapons expert Dr. Peter Vincent Pry told The Daily Wire back in 2017 that one of the major problems with the Iran nuclear deal was that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not have “access to their military facilities where the military program would be going on.""

“Most people in this town [Washington D.C.] believe [that Iran does not have nuclear weapons], because I think they are ignorant, the level of technological ignorance among Washington policy makers, who are mostly lawyers, is so astonishing that we can find ourselves in a treaty like this,"" Pry said. “When Obama signed that thing, he let them off the hook, to prove that they didn't have the bomb yet — and I think it was on purpose because he was so anxious to get that deal to set up his legacy and everything. He didn't want to be the president where Iran goes nuclear on his watch.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-eases-sanctions-nuclear-deal-iran,2021-02-19
Biden to announce end to US combat mission in Iraq,"President Joe Biden and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi will announce on Monday an agreement to end the U.S. military's combat mission in Iraq, a senior Biden administration official told reporters.

The two leaders are meeting at the White House in the afternoon and will release a ""broad communiqué"" that will establish a timetable for the U.S. military to withdraw from combat by the end of the year. U.S. forces will remain in Iraq in a training and advisory role, according to a transcript of the call released by White House.

""As this evolution continues, and as we formally end the combat mission and make clear that there are no American forces with a combat role in the country, Iraq has requested, and we very much agree, that they need continued training; support with logistics, intelligence, advisory capacity building — all of which will continue,"" the official said.

The announcement follows the Biden administration's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, ending the 20-year war that began after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The war in Iraq began in 2003, when President George W. Bush invaded Iraq after linking Saddam Hussein to the terrorist group al-Qaeda, which was responsible for 9/11.

Nearly two decades later, there are about 2,500 troops still deployed in Iraq and the U.S. military has trained 250,000 Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish fighters to combat the remaining forces of the Islamic State. These fighters are ""battle tested"" and ""have proven very capable in protecting their country,"" according to the official.

""At the same time, ISIS remains a threat,"" the official acknowledged, citing a roadside bomb attack in Baghdad that killed at least 30 people and wounded dozens more last week. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Biden administration appears to want to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Obama administration's premature 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, which left a weak Iraqi government unprepared for the threat of ISIS. By 2014, ISIS had captured several major cities including Mosul, and the Obama administration returned troops to Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.

""Some of these battles in Mosul were extremely costly on the Iraqi side. And so, nobody ever wants to see something like that again,"" the official said. ""And we're committed to making sure, as we always said from the beginning, nobody is going to declare 'mission accomplished.'""

Since ISIS was routed on the battlefield in 2017, Iraqi lawmakers have demanded that the U.S. withdraw its combat presence in their country. The U.S. and Iraq have met for three strategic talks to discuss the future of U.S. military intervention in Iraq, the first beginning under the Trump administration and the last being held in April when the Biden administration agreed to shift the mission of U.S. troops to training and advisory roles.

Though a timetable will now be set for when that transition is completed, the official declined to say how many U.S. troops would withdraw from Iraq, if any.



""The goal is the enduring defeat of ISIS. We recognize you have to keep pressure on these networks as they seek to reconstitute, but the role for U.S. forces and coalition forces can very much recede, you know, deep into the background where we are training, advising, sharing intelligence, helping with logistics,"" the official explained. ""And that's about where we are now.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-end-combat-mission-iraq,2021-07-26
"After White House bans travel from 8 African countries, tweets resurface of Biden saying travel bans don't work and accusing Trump of 'xenophobia'","Previous tweets from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are igniting accusations of hypocrisy after the administration announced a travel ban in response to a new COVID-19 variant.

A World Health Organization panel convened on Friday to assess the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 variant ""omicron,"" formerly known as B.1.1.529. The WHO classified the latest variant as a ""highly transmissible virus of concern,"" which is also what the health agency previously named the delta variant as.

""We don't know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations. And the concern is when you have so many mutations it can have an impact on how the virus behaves,"" said Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and WHO technical lead on COVID-19. ""This is one to watch, I would say we have concern. But I think you would want us to have concern.""

The Botswana government said there were four cases of the omicron variant reported on Nov. 22, and that all four patients were fully vaccinated for COVID-19.

Cases of the omicron variant have already been identified in Belgium, the U.K., Germany, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, and Israel.

The WHO cautioned against countries implementing travel bans.

""At this point, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said during a United Nations briefing in Geneva. ""The WHO recommends that countries continue to apply a risk-based and scientific approach when implementing travel measures.""

Dr. Michael Ryan — the head of emergencies at the WHO — warned against ""knee-jerk responses.""

""We've seen in the past, the minute there's any kind of mention of any kind of variation and everyone is closing borders and restricting travel,"" Ryan said. ""It's really important that we remain open, and stay focused.""

Despite the WHO recommendation, several countries implemented travel restrictions on African nations, including Australia, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and all 27 member states of the European Union.

The South African foreign ministry reacted to the travel bans by saying the country was being punished for being one of the first nations to identify the new COVID-19 variant. South Africa first reported cases of B.1.1.529 to the WHO on Nov. 24.

""This latest round of travel bans is akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker,"" the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement. ""Excellent science should be applauded and not punished.""

The White House issued a statement on the travel ban, ""The United States Government, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, has reexamined its policies on international travel and concluded that further measures are required to protect the public health from travelers entering the United States.""

Biden's travel ban goes into effect on Nov. 29, 2021.

The official Twitter account for President Biden issued a statement:

The @WHO has identified a new COVID variant which is spreading through Southern Africa. As a precautionary measure until we have more information, I am ordering air travel restrictions from South Africa and seven other countries. As we move forward, we will continue to be guided by what the science and my medical team advises. For now the best way to strengthen your protection if you're already vaccinated is to get a booster shot, immediately. For those not yet fully vaccinated: get vaccinated today. For the world community: this news is a reminder that this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations. The U.S. has already donated more vaccines to other countries than every other country combined. It is time for other countries to match our speed and generosity.





However, many commentators resurfaced old tweets by Biden that are deemed as hypocritical.

On Jan. 31, 2020, then-President Donald Trump declared a public health emergency in response to the global COVID-19 outbreak and temporarily suspended the entry of travelers from China. A day later, then-candidate Biden responded by saying Trump was xenophobic, ""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.""

On March 11, 2020, then-President Trump suspended travel from Europe in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus. The next day, Biden said travel bans would not stop the spread of COVID-19, ""A wall will not stop the coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it.""

In January 2020, when Trump added new immigration restrictions on six African and Asian countries — Nigeria, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, Eritrea, Sudan, and Tanzania — Democrats claimed the policy was ""driven by hate.""

Biden tweeted, ""Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban. This new 'African Ban,' is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It's a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed.""

Kamala Harris responded by saying, ""Trump's extended un-American travel ban undermines our nation's core values. It is clearly driven by hate, not security.""

At the time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement, claiming Trump's immigration policy ""undermined our Constitution"" and was ""bigoted.""

The Trump Administration's expansion of its outrageous, un-American travel ban threatens our security, our values and the rule of law. The sweeping rule, barring more than 350 million individuals from predominantly African nations from traveling to the United States, is discrimination disguised as policy.



America's strength has always been as a beacon of hope and opportunity for people around the world, whose dreams and aspirations have enriched our nation and made America more American. With this latest callous decision, the President has doubled down on his cruelty and further undermined our global leadership, our Constitution and our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants.



In the Congress and in the Courts, House Democrats will continue to oppose the Administration's dangerous anti-immigrant agenda. In the coming weeks, the House Judiciary Committee will mark-up and bring to the Floor the NO BAN Act to prohibit religious discrimination in our immigration system and limit the President's ability to impose such biased and bigoted restrictions. We will never allow hatred or bigotry to define our nation or destroy our values.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-kamala-travel-ban-trump,2021-11-27
Biden picks former Sen. Jeff Flake to serve as US ambassador to Turkey,"President Joe Biden is tapping former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake to serve as U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Turkey.

""Given the strategic importance of the United States' relationship with our long-time NATO Ally, the Republic of Turkey, I am honored and humbled by the trust President Biden has placed in me with this ambassadorial nomination. This is a pivotal post at an important time for both of our countries. Cheryl and I are grateful for the opportunity to serve, and eager to get to know the extraordinary people of Turkey,"" Flake said in a post on Medium.

""With this nomination, the Biden Administration reaffirms the best tradition of American foreign policy and diplomacy: the credo that partisan politics should stop at the water's edge. U.S. foreign policy can and should be bipartisan. That is my belief as well, and my commitment,"" the former lawmaker said.

Flake served one term as U.S. senator, representing Arizona from 2013 to 2019. He had previously served six terms as a lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013.

Flake, who endorsed Biden for the White House, was one of the few outspoken Republicans who did not support former President Donald Trump.

In order to serve in the ambassador role, Flake will need to secure Senate confirmation.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have already issued statements backing Flake for the post.



""Congratulations to my friend Jeff Flake for his nomination to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey. As a former member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is very well suited to serve our nation in this critical role,"" tweeted Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

""Jeff and Cheryl Flake are dear friends and honorable people. They will represent the United States well in this critical role in an important time. President Biden shows wisdom in choosing them,"" Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah tweeted.

""In the six years we served together on SFRC, Sen. Flake & I traveled to more than a dozen countries, we legislated together repeatedly, & worked through dozens of hearings together. I am confident Jeff will serve our nation well & I look forward to supporting his nomination,"" tweeted Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware.

President Biden revokes Trump's TikTok ban,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday revoked the Trump administration's bans on TikTok and WeChat. Replacing his predecessor's executive orders, Biden directed the commerce secretary to investigate apps with ties to foreign adversaries of the United States that might pose a national security risk or compromise the data privacy of American citizens.

Biden's executive order revokes and replaces several orders issued by former President Donald Trump last year, which blocked TikTok, WeChat, and Alipay from being accessed on U.S. app stores. The Trump administration also attempted to prevent those apps from operating within the United States, but ongoing court challenges prevented most of those orders from going into effect, the Verge reported.

""The Biden Administration is committed to promoting an open, interoperable, reliable and secure Internet; protecting human rights online and offline; and supporting a vibrant, global digital economy,"" the White House said in a statement.

""Certain countries, including the People's Republic of China (PRC), do not share these values and seek to leverage digital technologies and Americans' data in ways that present unacceptable national security risks while advancing authoritarian controls and interests.""

The new orders require the Department of Commerce to ""evaluate foreign adversary connected software applications"" under a new framework for identifying which foreign apps might pose security or data collection risks.

There is widespread concern that America's foreign adversaries are using social media apps to collect data on American citizens. For example, Chinese-owned TikTok quietly updated its privacy policy last week to enable the app to collect users' biometric data, including faceprints and voiceprints.

The Commerce Department is also directed to ""make recommendations to protect against harm from the sale, transfer of, or access to sensitive personal data"" of U.S. customers to foreign adversaries.

Biden's order does not address actions or investigations taken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which under Trump's direction set deadlines for apps like TikTok to divest from their foreign owners.

""The CFIUS action remains under active discussion by the US government,"" a senior administration official told the Verge.



President Trump's original executive order banning TikTok was blocked by a federal court injunction last December. The court had determined the ban was ""arbitrary and capricious"" because the Trump administration failed ""to adequately consider an obvious and reasonable alternative before banning TikTok."" Biden sidestepped pending litigation by repealing the order outright and issuing new directives.

The president will meet overseas with European and NATO leaders this week to discuss actions the international community can take to hold China more accountable.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-revokes-trump-tiktok-ban,2021-06-09
Biden says he doesn't consider 'any Trump supporter to be a threat to the country' after speech proclaiming GOP 'dominated' by 'MAGA Republicans',"President Joe Biden on Friday responded to criticism of his recent verbal attacks against ""MAGA Republicans"" and his controversial prime-time speech Thursday, denying that he considers Trump supporters to be a ""threat"" to the country.

At Independence Hall in Philadelphia Thursday evening, against a backdrop of harsh red lighting and Marine guards, Biden strongly condemned his predecessor Donald Trump and his ""MAGA Republicans"" allies, who, the president said, ""represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic."" The president's speech was denounced by Republicans who accused Biden of using threatening, divisive language to demonize the 70 million Americans who supported Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

The speech came days after Biden reportedly told attendees at a Democratic Party fundraiser that the ""extreme MAGA philosophy"" of the Republican Party is ""like semi-fascism.""



Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy confronted Biden about his remarks after a White House event announcing the winners of a regional economic development competition.

""Mr. President, do you consider all Trump supporters to be a threat to the country?"" Doocy asked.

""I don't consider any Trump supporter to be a threat to the country,"" Biden replied. ""I do think anyone who calls for the use of violence, fails to condemn violence when it's used, refuses to acknowledge an election has been won, insists upon changing the way in which we rule and count votes, that is a threat to democracy.""

He emphasized the word ""democracy.""

""Everything we stand for rests on the platform of democracy. When people voted for Donald Trump and support him now, they weren't voting for attacking the Capitol. They weren't voting for overruling an election. They were voting for a philosophy he put forward,"" the president added.

""I am not talking about anything other than, it is inappropriate … the failure to recognize and condemn violence when it is used for political purposes. Failure to condemn the manipulation [of] election outcomes,"" he continued. ""Failure to acknowledge when elections were won or lost.""

But in his speech Thursday night, Biden said Republicans have assaulted the principles of ""equality and democracy"" and represent a threat to the country.

""As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault. We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise,"" he said. ""There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.""

The president did acknowledge that ""not every Republican, not even a majority Republicans are MAGA Republicans.""

""Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,"" Biden said. ""I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.""

Even so, Republicans demanded that Biden apologize for the tone of his speech.

""Instead of trying to bring our country together to solve the MANY problems he has created, President Biden has chosen to divide, demean, and disparage his fellow Americans—simply because they disagree with his policies,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tweeted Thursday. ""Mr. President: you owe millions of Americans an apology.""

Biden says US will intervene if China invades Taiwan,"President Joe Biden has announced that the United States will militarily intervene if the People's Republic of China decides to invade Taiwan, according to reports.

What are the details?

During a Monday press conference in Tokyo, Biden said that the United States military will help Taiwan defend itself against China if necessary.

A reporter asked the president, ""You didn't want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?""

""Yes. That's the commitment we made,"" Biden responded while delivering in remarks alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

The president added that China should not take Taiwan ""by force.""

""[It] is just not appropriate,"" he said.

A White House spokesperson told Fox News that the Biden administration's One China policy ""has not changed.""

""As the president said, our policy has not changed,"" the spokesperson said. ""He reiterated our One China Policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself.""

Fox News noted that America's ""One China policy"" states that the U.S. recognizes the People's Republic of China as the ""sole legal government of China, but only acknowledges, without endorsing, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China.""

What else?

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that he was unhappy with and opposed to Biden's remarks.

""China has no room for compromise or concessions on issues involving China’s core interests such as sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Wang said.

In October, Biden issued similar remarks and said that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, to which a ministry spokesperson warned, ""No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination, and capability of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China has no room for compromise.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-taiwan-military-china,2022-05-23
Big Short investor Michael Burry warns recession looming,"Michael Burry – the hedge fund manager who garnered prominence for forecasting the 2008 financial crisis – warned that a recession is ""looming."" Burry also slammed President Joe Biden, the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. Treasury for failing to forecast crushing inflation.

""U.S. Fed, POTUS, Treasury do not know history and, frighteningly, could not see devastating inflation coming,"" Burry tweeted on Wednesday.

Burry – who is the founder of Scion Asset Management – also shared a video clip from an episode of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that aired in February 2021. In the Fox News video clip, Tucker Carlson highlights a tweet by Burry that said, ""The U.S. government is inviting inflation with its MMT-tinged policies.""

MMT is an abbreviation for Modern Monetary Theory – which is defined by Investopedia as: ""Put simply, such governments do not rely on taxes or borrowing for spending since they can print as much as they need and are the monopoly issuers of the currency. Since their budgets aren’t like a regular household’s, their policies should not be shaped by fears of a rising national debt.""

Burry made parallels to the current U.S. economy and Germany's Weimar Republic – which saw monthly inflation skyrocket by as much as 29,500% in 1923.

Tucker: Biden economic policy could 'destroy' households www.youtube.com

Burry — the hedge fund manager depicted by Christian Bale in ""The Big Short"" movie — has made several dire observations about the economy and the importance of knowing history.



""History is not useless,"" he tweeted in February 2021, adding that American inflation from the 1970s ""is more relevant today than one might think.""

Later that month, Burry warned, ""Prepare for inflation.""

He cautioned about inflation as far back as April 7, 2020.

""When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store,"" Burry told Bloomberg.

Earlier this week, the inspiration for ""The Big Short"" book explained, ""When you see mention of the strong dollar, the almighty dollar, please remember this is only in relation to other fiat currencies. The dollar is not at all strong, and it is not getting stronger. We all see it every single day in prices of everything.""

Last month, Burry posted an ominous message on Twitter, ""As I said about 2008, it is like watching a plane crash. It hurts, it is not fun, and I'm not smiling.""

Burry – who regularly deletes his tweets – wrote in May, ""U.S. Personal Savings fell to 2013 levels, the savings rate to 2008 levels — while revolving credit card debt grew at a record-setting pace back to the pre-COVID peak despite all those $trillions of cash dropped in their laps. Looming: a consumer recession and more earnings trouble.""

Earlier this week, Burry warned that Americans are exhausting their savings accounts at alarming rates.

""At the last 12mos' rate of depletion of savings, could hit that level between September and December this year. Borrowing time,"" he said.

In June 2021, Burry sounded the alarm about the downfall of cryptocurrencies and meme stocks.



""All hype/speculation is doing is drawing in retail before the mother of all crashes,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""When crypto falls from trillions, or meme stocks fall from tens of billions, Main Street losses will approach the size of countries.""

Bill Gates is largest farmland owner in the United States,"Bill Gates is now the largest private farmland owner in the United States, according to a new report. Gates, who is the fourth-richest person in the world, owns an estimated 242,000 acres of farmland, analysis by The Land Report discovered.

The massive land grab by Gates last year gave the tech magnate his first appearance on The Land Report, a magazine that ""provides news, information, and insight into America's land for existing and potential landowners.""

For the title of America's biggest farmland owner, Gates beat out the Minnesota-based Offutt farming family who owns 190,000 acres. Also with 190,000 acres of farmland is Stewart and Lynda Resnick. The Resnicks, who have a combined net worth of $7.1 billion, are the owners of California-based The Wonderful Company that controls POM Wonderful, bottled water company FIJI Water, Wonderful Pistachios, and Wonderful Halos.

Gates boasts a real estate portfolio that includes landholdings in 19 states. Bill and Melinda Gates own 69,071 acres in Louisiana, 47,927 acres in Arkansas, 20,588 acres in Nebraska, 17,940 acres in Illinois, 16,963 acres in Mississippi, 16,097 acres in Washington, and 14,828 acres in Florida, according to the report.



The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that there is a total of 897,400,000 acres in farmland in the United States in 2019.

The co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft, who has a net worth of $120 billion, reportedly purchased the enormous land resources directly and through ""dozens"" of third-party entities, principally via Cascade Investment LLC.

The Land Report 100 Research Team stated that Michael Larson, who ""operates primarily through an entity called Cascade Investment LLC.,"" has ""managed the Gateses' personal portfolio as well as the considerable holdings of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"" for the last 25 years.

Cascade Investment LLC., a holding and investment company headquartered in Kirkland, Washington, holds a large number of shares in prominent companies such as Berkshire Hathaway, Canadian National Railway, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Ecolab, and Waste Management.

In 2017, Cascade Investment purchased a ""significant stake"" in 24,800 acres of transitional land outside of Phoenix. Through Cascade, Gates invested $80 million in developing the Belmont suburb to have ""80,000 homes, 3,800 acres of industrial, office and retail space, 3,400 acres of open space and 470 acres for public schools,"" as reported by the Arizona Republic in 2017.

Also in 2017, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledged $300 million over three years to farmers in Africa and Asia to ""support agricultural research that will help the world's poorest farmers better adapt to increasingly challenging growing conditions brought about by climate change, including rising temperatures, extreme weather patterns (droughts and floods), diseases, poor soil fertility, and attacks from crop pests.""



Gates is far from the biggest landowner in the U.S. That title belongs to billionaire businessman and philanthropist John Malone, who topped The Land Report's 100 largest landowners list in 2019 with 2.2 million acres of land.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-gates-farmland-biggest-owner,2021-01-15
Sens. Cotton and Tuberville introduce bill to prevent Chinese communists from buying American land,"On August 2, Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) introduced a bill with the aim of preventing members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from purchasing any land in the United States.

The bill, Securing America’s Land from Foreign Interference Act, comes months after a similar bill (H.R.7892) was introduced into Congress on May 27, 2022, by Rep. Dan Newhouse, entitled Prohibition of Agricultural Land for the People’s Republic of China Act.

Cotton's and Tuberville's bill is, in part, a response to a report issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2020 indicating that ""foreign persons held an interest in nearly 37.6 million acres of U.S. agricultural land."" They note in their announcement that ""approximately 14 states have some level of foreign ownership restriction yet there are no federal restrictions on the amount of private U.S. agricultural land that can be owned.""

Chinese entities have acquired immense swaths of American soil and are poised to continue doing so. ""Millions of acres in U.S. farmland are expected to change hands in the next decade.""

Whereas in 2010, China had invested in 13,720 acres of U.S. land, ""by the end of 2020, the number had risen to 194,179 acres,"" leaving China with a total of 352,140 acres of American land.

""Chinese investments in American farmland put our food security at risk,"" said Cotton. Furthermore, these investments ""provide opportunities for Chinese espionage against our military bases and critical infrastructure.""

Besides farmland, Chinese entities also bought $6.1 billion in U.S. real estate in 2022, according to the National Association of Realtors, and constituted 6% of foreign buyers.

Tuberville emphasized the strategic importance of keeping out the CCP. ""We cannot continue giving our top adversary a foot in the door to purchase land in the United States and undermine our national security.""



The relationship between Beijing and Washington is particularly adversarial at the moment, underlining the potential security risk of the possession of American land by Chinese communists. The CCP has recently targeted the United States with a great deal more violent rhetoric than usual, largely because of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to the Republic of Taiwan.

Communist Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, “If Pelosi insists on visiting Taiwan, China will take resolute and strong measures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” going on to say that “those who play with fire will perish by it … we are prepared for any eventuality and the PLA will never sit idly by.”

In June, Beijing accused the U.S. of employing a ""cold war mentality,"" and in early July 2022, Zhao accused America of being “the biggest threat to world peace, stability, and development.""



The Heritage Foundation suggested that the next step to take would be ensuring the CCP cannot interfere in American politics.

A Republican announces his bid to challenge President Trump in the primary for 2020,"A former Massachusetts governor officially announced his presidential bid to challenge President Donald Trump for the nomination for the Republican party.

Bill Weld went on CNN with Jake Tapper to explain why he was mounting an unlikely attempt to unseat the president from his re-election in 2020.

""I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years, that would be a political tragedy and I would fear for the Republic,"" said the 74 year-old Weld, ""so I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run.""

Tapper challenged Weld by listing off polling numbers that show Trump is highly popular within the Republican party, including his latest financial campaign statement that showed he had already raised historic donations for his re-election.

""What we have now is a president that mocks the rule of law, I spent seven years in the Justice Department trying to keep the politics out of law enforcement - he's trying to put it in,"" Weld said.

""A president who says we don't need a free press, who says climate change is a complete hoax,"" he added, ""he's not paying attention, I doubt very much that he's made a study of any of those issues.""

Weld said that he is a very fiscally economic conservative and criticized Trump for not even pretending to be fiscally conservative.

Weld was the governor of Massachusetts for two terms and worked as the head of the criminal division at the U.S. States Attorney office under Ronald Reagan's administration. He had said in February that he was thinking about running against Trump.

Bipartisan bill calls for US investigation into lab leak COVID-19 origin theory,"A bipartisan bill recently introduced in the U.S. Senate calls on the federal government to conduct its own investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, including whether or not the virus originally leaked from a Chinese lab known as the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The lab leak theory — popular among many Americans and reportedly suspected by several U.S. officials and agencies— was dismissed as ""extremely unlikely"" by a team of World Health Organization investigators who flew to Wuhan earlier this year to probe the origins of the pandemic, which has now claimed the lives of nearly 3 million people worldwide.

However, since the launch of the WHO investigation, officials from the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns about its integrity and transparency. Now a bipartisan group of lawmakers are urging the government to review all the intelligence the U.S. has on the matter and produce its own report.

The 281-page bill, called the Strategic Competition Act, was introduced last week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Chairman, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez (N.J.), and ranking member, Republican Sen. Jim Risch (Idaho). Its overarching intention is to comprehensively confront the economic challenge and national security threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party, and part of that is assessing the CCP's potential cover-up of the origins of the coronavirus.

The proposed legislation, if passed, would require ""an assessment of the most likely source or origin of the SARS–CoV–2 virus, including a detailed review of all information the United States possesses that it has identified as potentially relevant to the source or origin of the SARS–CoV–2 virus, including zoonotic transmission and spillover, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or other sources of origin, transmission, or spillover,"" the bill states.



Elsewhere, the bill calls for ""an account of efforts by the [People's Republic of China] to cooperate with, impede, or obstruct any inquiry or investigation to determine the source and transmission of SARS–CoV–2 virus, including into a possible lab leak, or to create or spread misinformation or disinformation regarding the source and transmission of SARS–CoV–2 virus by the PRC or CCP.""

The legislation also calls for an account to be given about the U.S. government's funding of coronavirus research at the WIV, including controversial gain-of-function research — which involves genetically enhancing pathogens for the purpose of predicting which may become especially dangerous to the human population.

News broke last summer that the National Institutes of Health had been financially backing research into bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab prior to the pandemic. Then this month, it was revealed that some of the funding for that risky research had bypassed security protocols.

A pair of leaked State Department cables showed that U.S. officials visiting the WIV reported back concerns about inadequate safety measures and risky research being conducted there in 2018.

Black Lives Matter co-founder's venture funded by pro-communist China group: report,"A new project from a Black Lives Matter co-founder is funded by an organization that is pro-communist and supports China's communist government, according to a new investigation by the Heritage Foundation. Alicia Garza, who is the co-founder of the Black Lives Matter organization, started a new venture called the Black Futures Lab.

""The Black Futures Lab transforms Black communities into constituencies that change the way power operates — locally, statewide and nationally,"" the Black Futures Lab's website states. The group has a mission to ""educate elected officials on this new legislative agenda, and challenges policymakers to take up positions beneficial to Black communities.""

When you click on the donation page of the Black Futures Lab website, the page says: ""Black Futures Lab is a fiscally sponsored project of the Chinese Progressive Association.""

The Chinese Progressive Association was founded in 1972, and claims it ""educates, organizes and empowers the low income and working class immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco to build collective power with other oppressed communities to demand better living and working conditions and justice for all people.""

There is also another CPA chapter in Boston that was established in 1977.

The Heritage Foundation claims that from CPA's start, ""it has been a promoter of the People's Republic of China."" The Heritage Foundation report cites ""an authoritative 2009 Stanford University paper"" that alleges the Chinese Progressive Association ""worked with other pro-PRC groups within the U.S. and San Francisco Bay Area … Support for the PRC was based on the inspiration the members drew from what they saw as a successful grassroots model that presented a viable alternative to Western capitalism.""

The Chinese Progressive Association was commended for participating in anti-police brutality protests this summer by China Daily, China's state-owned English-language news site that is run by the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party.

CPA held a rally last September in Boston, where demonstrators raised the People's Republic of China flag in City Hall Plaza to commemorate the anniversary of the communist takeover.

CPA co-founder Lydia Lowe co-wrote an essay titled, ""The Role of Asian American and Pacific Islander Movements: Race, Nationality Oppression and Revolutionary Strategy"" for Leftroots, a self-described ""national organization of Leftists engaged in mass organizing in the United States committed to developing the individual and collective skills necessary to formulate, evaluate and carry out strategy to build twenty-first century socialism.""

""What is the connection between the history of people of color in the U.S. and their role in the struggle for 21st century socialism? Exploitation, oppression, and theft from communities of color, rooted in the history of colonialism and imperialism, was central to the development of the U.S. economy and society; today's inequality and super-exploitation is the result of a western legacy of racial capitalism,"" the essay says.

""The issue of race or nationality oppression plays an exceptional role in U.S. society and its resolution is critical to achieving a fundamentally different one,"" the essay adds. ""Unifying working class struggles with the movements of peoples of color is critical to achieving a fundamentally different society.""

The Black Futures Lab nor the Chinese Progressive Association responded to requests for comment about the partnership from Fox News.

Garza's fellow Black Lives Matter co-founder, Patrisse Cullors, has admitted that the organization's leaders are ""trained Marxists."" In a 2015 interview, Cullors admitted that BLM founders subscribe to Karl Marx's ideology.



""Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists,"" Cullors said. ""We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories.""



Earlier this week, former NFL star Herschel Walker denounced BLM and asked, ""Are you supporting the group that says they are trained Marxists? Because they're making a lot of money, and I like to know.""

""I'm challenging every owner in the NFL, every owner of major league sports, every owner of stadiums, every commissioner, every leader in Washington, every church,"" Walker said. ""I'm challenging every professional player: Is this who you're supporting? Because a trained Marxist tells you that they're anti-government, they're anti-American, they're anti-Christian, they're anti-everything.""

Blaze Media CEO calls out New York Times for 'ominous framing' of Glenn Beck quote ripped out of context,"Blaze Media CEO Tyler Cardon called out the New York Times on Wednesday for using ""ominous framing"" in an article about ""election falsehoods"" that took comments from BlazeTV host Glenn Beck out of context.

The Times article, ""Election Falsehoods Surged on Podcasts Before Capitol Riots, Researchers Find,"" reported on a study by researchers at the Brookings Institution who reviewed transcripts of nearly 1,500 episodes from 20 of the most popular conservative podcasts looking for election misinformation leading up to the 2020 presidential election.

In the opening paragraph, the article by reporter Stuart Thompson claimed that Beck made a prediction about the election in which he suggested President Donald Trump would appear to be winning early in the evening but would have his lead erode after questionable mail-in ballots were counted, giving Joe Biden an advantage.

“No one will believe the outcome because they’ve changed the way we’re electing a president this time,” Beck is quoted as saying.

In several tweets, Cardon called attention to how the Times article left out important context surrounding Beck's remarks.

""Read this opening paragraph from New York Times piece about 'election falsehoods' that published yesterday. Note the ominous framing. Apparently, on a random day in September, big bad broadcaster Glenn Beck outlined his prediction for Election Day in a single sentence,"" Cardon wrote.

""But the quote they pulled was from a segment in which GB was reacting to a report by the Transition Integrity Project, which got a ton of media coverage largely because it predicted the end of the Republic in all scenarios except a Biden landslide,"" he continued, providing a partial transcript of Beck's remarks from the Sept. 16, 2020 episode of his radio program.

Beck was discussing an Aug. 3, 2020 report by a bipartisan group of experts convened by the Transition Integrity Project to run tabletop simulations of the 2020 presidential election. The report predicted it was highly likely ""that November’s elections will be marked by a chaotic legal and political landscape."" The report urged policymakers to prepare for a contested election and presciently predicted how Trump would contest the results of the election by alleging there was voter fraud.

The researchers ran four hypothetical scenarios with opposing teams representing the Biden and Trump camps. Two of the scenarios ended with close elections, which both resulted in what Beck described as a ""nightmarish"" situation where the election is contested. In a third scenario where Trump clearly won the Electoral College vote but Biden won the popular vote, ""game play ended in a constitutional crisis,"" the researchers said.

Only the fourth scenario of a decisive victory for Biden in both the Electoral College and popular vote was resolved without a major crisis. Reacting to this information, Beck agreed with that assessment and said it would take a ""landslide"" victory by either candidate to convince a majority of Americans the election was legitimate.



""Where's the lie?"" Cardon asked Wednesday. ""You need to look no further than the TIP report itself to find support for GB's 'prediction' here. The only difference is that GB is more generous to the Dems by assuming they'd accept a Trump landslide. In the report, this resulted in 'constitutional crisis.'""

Supporting his case, Cardon shared a video montage of ""prominent politicians"" — including many Democrats — expressing their doubts about the integrity of the electoral process leading up to the 2020 election.

""The NYT (and other dusty, legacy media outlets) are desperate to connect every effective dissident voice in today's media landscape to some flavor of 'dangerous misinformation,' not because it's true, but because they're losing influence & want to silence their competition,"" Cardon said.

Reached for a response, New York Times Vice President of Communications Danielle Rhoades Ha said, ""Our editors have reviewed the passage and found the use of the quote to be accurate and fair. Mr. Beck's quote is clearly in reference to concerns about mail-in ballots.""

BlazeTV host Chad Prather kicks off Texas gubernatorial campaign,"BlazeTV host and internet personality Chad Prather kicked off his campaign in earnest on Friday with a media blitz including appearances at the historic Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site, as well as a tour of the Blue Bell Creameries, and a visit with the Washington County Chamber of Commerce.

As he announced the start of his campaign near the site of the birthplace of the Republic of Texas, Prather said, ""A place where it all began is a good place to get this campaign started."" Prather said that he decided to run for Governor because of ""The loss of business. The loss of life. The loss of income. The loss of property and I said enough is enough. We've got to get back to a point where we're the leaders. We're the ones that people from all around the world look to as the epitome of what America stands for.""









Prather announced his intentions to run for Governor of Texas in July of 2020 on his Twitter account, then confirmed his intentions on ""The Chad Prather Show"" a few short days later. He made his announcement in response to incumbent governor Greg Abbott (R)'s executive order making masks mandatory in the state.

During his announcement, Prather stated, ""It's time to make Texas Texas again, because that humble arrogance is starting to get humiliated. We don't have that walking tall attitude anymore... it's okay for us to walk tall. It's okay for us to talk big. It's okay for us to lead the nation.""









Discussing the response to his initial announcement on Twitter, Prather said, ""I have been thrilled at the response, not because people are patting me on the back, I could care less about that. What I'm excited about is, people are ready to take their state back. And that is from the bottom to the top. From the grassroots folks who are seeing their livelihoods taken away from this nonsense that's going on... So yes, we're in the ring, we're running, we're gonna take some punches, and that's okay. Call me Rocky.""

In response to falling case numbers in Texas, Abbott finally lifted the statewide mask mandate and most other COVID restrictions earlier in March, a move that caused his approval rating to drop among Democratic voters in the Lone Star State, but did not affect his approval rating with Republican voters. Although Abbott's decision to remove these restrictions was widely criticized by liberals and their allies in the media, the widely-predicted surge of COVID cases that was supposed to result from Abbott's actions has not yet materialized after two weeks.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blazetv-host-chad-prather-kicks-off-texas-gubernatorial-campaign,2021-03-27
Phoenix denies Black Lives Matter street mural after request for a pro-police mural reading 'No one is above the law',"The city of Phoenix was considering allowing a Black Lives Matter mural to be painted, until they received a request for a massive pro-police mural too, and instead denied them both.

BLM activist Gizette Knight, who helped design the mural, is upset that the mural was denied, and organized a media briefing on Monday to pressure the city to reconsider the decision.

Two protesters appeared to signal their disapproval of the BLM mural proposal.



""What is important to note is that throughout my correspondence with either the mayor's office or with her administration, no one expressed to me verbally, electrically, or in writing, that non-standard markings on city streets are not allowed or present safety concerns,"" Knight said at the briefing.

The mural design would include the visages of civil rights leaders Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., César Chávez and John Lewis. Knight collected 2,500 signatures in support for her mural.

The denial came after the city received a similar request for a mural from Mark Spencer of Judicial Watch. Spencer, who is also a former president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, requested a mural to read, ""No one is above the law,"" painted in front of the Phoenix Police Department headquarters in downtown Phoenix.

The city denied both requests and told Knight that they did so because of safety considerations.

Knight said her group is preparing to sue Phoenix, and implied that the denial was motivated by racism.

""Every time Black people go to do something down here, we face adversity,"" she said, according to the Arizona Republic.

She said that the City Council should take a vote on whether to allow her mural and points to an LGBT crosswalk as precedence for the vote.

"Democratic Sen. Blumenthal, CNN place blame on President Trump for New Zealand massacre","Hours after a horrific mass murder occurred in New Zealand on Friday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) wasted little time in placing blame on President Donald Trump — joining a CNN anchor in saying the president's rhetoric played a role in the killings.

What are the details?

During an interview on CNN's ""New Day,"" host Alisyn Camerota began by asking the senator for his take on the tragedy and ""a rise in right-wing extremist around the globe."" After extending his condolences to the victims and their families, Blumenthal pointed to Trump's rhetoric as a prompt for the murders.

""Words do have consequences, and we know that at the very pinnacle of power in our own country, people are talking about good people on both sides,"" Blumenthal said, referring to the president's comments following a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.

""You mean the president talking about it,"" Camerota pressed. ""I mean I know it's hard to call this out. I've heard this from a guest this morning, they're having a hard time calling this out for some reason.""

Blumenthal responded, ""I think it's more than the president. It's the people who enable him and who fail to stand up to him and speak out.""

""Words have consequences, like saying we have an 'invasion' on our border, and talking about people as though they were different in some fatal way,"" he continued. ""I think the public discourse from the president on down is a factor in some of these actions.""

Camerota suggested the link was a fact rather than speculation, saying, ""I mean, we don't have to guess, actually, at this. We don't have to connect the dots ourselves. This is what the suspects say. This guy put out, according to authorities, put out this manifesto where he connects the dots between the rhetoric that he likes to hear and his violent action.""

Politico reported that at least 49 people were killed at two mosques during the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, and dozens more injured. A man in his late 20s has been taken into custody and charged with murder, and three other people have been arrested in connection with the horrific crimes.

The main suspect in the killings published a 73-page manifesto ahead of the attacks, in which he said he was inspired by the Norway murderer who killed 77 people in 2011, according to the Daily Mail.

In the writings, he also referred to President Trump as ""a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose,"" and said ""the person that has influenced me above all was [black conservative pundit] Candace Owens.""

The suspect also referred to himself as an ""Eco-Fascist by nature,"" and wrote that ""the nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China.""

According to Newsweek, ""many observers pointed out that the manifesto contained what is known online as 's**t posting,' the practice of posting outrageous comments to elicit an emotional reaction in viewers and distract from the real meaning of the post."" The outlet added, ""The comments about Trump may have been just that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blumenthal-cnn-blame-trump-for-new-zealand-massacre,2019-03-15
Bodycam captures woman opening fire on cops. They fire back and take her down — and then into custody.,"Bodycam footage captured the moment a nonchalant female suspect whipped out a handgun and began firing at police during a July 8 incident in Arizona.

Police released bodycam footage of the incident on Wednesday, according to The Arizona Republic.

What are the details?

Phoenix police arrived to question 24-year-old Jovana Kelsey McCreary after she reportedly engaged in a dispute with her roommate.

McCreary's unnamed roommate told authorities that he had kicked her out of their shared apartment because she was acting ""crazy"" and had a gun in her possession.

Police arrived on the scene to find McCreary near her former apartment and began questioning her as to whether she is armed with a gun.

She denied having a weapon and instead said that her roommate was threatening her.

During questioning, McCreary seemed to keep her cool, spending her time casually answering officers' questions and using her cellphone. She even consented to officers searching her belongings, where they reportedly recovered unspecified drugs and ammunition.

Around this time, responding officers discovered that McCreary has an outstanding warrant for her arrest, and attempted to begin the process of taking her into custody.

What happened next?

Out of nowhere, however, she pulled a gun hidden in her waistband and fired shots at responding officers, narrowly missing them.

The officers immediately returned McCreary's fire, striking her twice.

Bodycam footage of the incident shows McCreary tumbling to the ground, from where she can be heard screaming.

First responders arrived on the scene and took her to a hospital for treatment. She is expected to survive, according to reports.

No officers were injured in the incident.

According to the Republic, internal and criminal investigations into the incident are underway.

The Maricopa County District Attorney's Office will review the case upon the investigation's completion.

MSNBC viewers melt down on social media after John Bolton says Biden has failed to handle the Ukraine crisis,"MSNBC viewers lashed out at the progressive cable news channel after veteran journalist Andrea Mitchell interviewed John Bolton about the Biden administration's failures in Ukraine.

The former national security advisor in the Trump administration criticized President Joe Biden for failing to proactively prevent Russia's invasion into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic.

""I think [Russian President] Putin was undoubtedly waiting for a second Trump term. but he's getting almost effectively what he would have expected then,"" said Bolton. ""This is gonna be a victory for Russia.""

""You think that what the Biden administration is doing, rallying the NATO allies,"" Mitchell replied before getting interrupted.

""It has failed,"" Bolton fired back. ""The president has said it has failed.

They went on to debate whether NATO was more unified under the real threat of Russian invasion or whether it remained divided, but the viewers were not impressed by Bolton's presence on the show or Mitchell's reactions to his critique.

""I don’t want to hear John Bolton’s opinion on what we should be doing with Russia or anything for that matter,"" tweetedfailed congressional candidate Richard Ojeda.

""Literally the last person on earth who should be giving foreign policy advice right now. Perpetually incorrect bloodthirsty warmonger,"" replied YouTuber Kyle Kulinski.

""I would literally interview satan about Russia/Ukraine before even asking John Bolton how he likes his coffee,"" read one very popular tweet.

""Why would @andreamitchell give air time to a filthy traitor like john bolton? I despise her, for good reason,"" read another popular tweet.

Putin announced in an angry rant on Monday that Russia would be sending what he termed as ""peacekeepers"" into separatist regions of the former Soviet republic. Ukrainian leaders have warned that the ruse was likely a precursor to Russian forces seizing control of the country. Putin also said that other former Soviet republics should have never been allowed to leave Russia.

"Bombshell: Top Dem leaders are planning to stop Sanders at the convention, says NY Times","Despite Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying she would be ""comfortable"" with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as the party's nominee in the upcoming presidential election, a bombshell New York Times report says that a growing group of DNC superdelegates and party leaders are planning to stop the democratic socialist at the nominating convention in Milwaukee this summer.

Based on dozens of interviews with party leaders and 93 superdelegates, the Times reported that a significant contingent of top Democrats are secretly planning to stop him at the Democratic National Convention this summer, even if it risks damaging Democrats' chances in November.

""This article is based on interviews with the 93 superdelegates, out of 771 total, as well as party strategists and aides to senior Democrats about the thinking of party leaders. A vast majority of those superdelegates — whose ranks include federal elected officials, former presidents and vice presidents and D.N.C. members — predicted that no candidate would clinch the nomination during the primaries, and that there would be a brokered convention fight in July to choose a nominee,"" the Times, which also spoke on-the-record with various top Democrats, reported.

There's 'a vibrant conversation' about whether anything can be done to stop Sanders

""We're way, way, way past the day where party leaders can determine an outcome here, but I think there's a vibrant conversation about whether there is anything that can be done,"" Connecticut Congressman and superdelegate Jim Himes said.

The Times noted that only nine of the 93 superdelegates they contacted said that Sanders should become the Democratic Party's nominee if he arrives at the convention with a mere plurality of delegates.

""I've had 60 years experience with Democratic delegates — I don't think they will do anything like that,"" superdelegate and former Vice President Walter Mondale said. ""They will each do what they want to do, and somehow they will work it out. God knows how.""

A Stop Sanders super PAC?

The Times noted that since Sanders emerged as the party's clear front-runner after winning the Nevada caucus, four large donors have contacted former Congressman Steve Israel of New York to ask if he knew of someone who can help them build a super PAC aimed at stopping Sanders. He declined.

""People are worried,"" said former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, who once led the DNC and is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden. ""How you can spend four or five months hoping you don't have to put a bumper sticker from that guy on your car?""

Top Dems want Obama to get involved

Democrats are so anxious about Sanders potentially being the party's nominee that some are urging former President Barack Obama to get involved to broker a truce either among the remaining ""moderate"" candidates or between progressives and the DNC establishment.

At least one DNC member has even floated the idea of former first lady Michelle Obama being nominated as vice president as a way of unifying the party.

""She's the only person I can think of who can unify the party and help us win,"" William Owen of Tennessee told the Times. ""This election is about saving the American experiment as a republic. It's also about saving the world. This is not an ordinary election.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bombshell-top-dem-leaders-are-planning-to-stop-sanders-at-the-convention,2020-02-27

— Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) February 26, 2019

Massie added that he does support the border wall and he supports the president, but he opposes this act that he says undermines the checks and balances in our federal system.

Although the resolution passed easily in the House and may narrowly pass the Senate, it will almost certainly fail after President Trump vetoes it.

Congress can overturn a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both houses, but the bill doesn't have nearly that level of support.

Leading conservative intellectual Sir Roger Scruton dies at 75,"The UK's Sir Roger Scruton, one of the world's most prominent conservative philosophers, writers, and intellectuals of the last century, has died of cancer at the age of 75. Scruton was a formal advisor to the UK's Conservative Party and published around 50 books on politics, morality, and aesthetics throughout his career.

His passing was announced on his official website on Sunday morning:

It is with great sadness that we announce the death of Sir Roger Scruton, FBA, FRSL. Beloved husband of Sophie, adored father to Sam and Lucy and treasured brother of Elizabeth and Andrea, he died peacefully on Sunday 12th January. He was born on 27th February 1944 and had been fighting cancer for the last 6 months. His family are hugely proud of him and of all his achievements.

A renowned author, among Scruton's most notable were ""The Meaning of Conservatism,"" (1980), ""The Aesthetics of Music"" (1997), and ""How to be a Conservative"" (2014). Scruton was also a political commentator, most notably in publications including The Times, The Spectator, and the New Statesman.

Scruton was also remembered for his anti-communism, including helping to establish underground academic networks in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. For his efforts, Scruton was awarded the Czech Republic's Medal of Merit by President Václav Havel in 1998. In 2016, he was knighted in Buckingham Palace for his ""services to philosophy, teaching and public education.""

California college trustee board drops Pledge of Allegiance over 'white nationalism',"The board of trustees president for a California community college ended the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance at meetings, claiming the ritual was ""steeped in expressions of nativism and white nationalism.""

Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees president Robert Miller explained his decision in an email to Celeste Barber, a former adjunct instructor. The emails were obtained by Campus Reform.

""I assume full responsibility for the decision not to recite the Pledge of Allegiance,"" Miller wrote. ""I agree with you that the Pledge is an example of good writing. It well demonstrates the principle that fewer, well-chosen words are often the most effective. I also applaud and honor the patriotism that motivates your request and share your reverence for the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.

""I decided to discontinue use of the Pledge of Allegiance for reasons related to its history and symbolism.""

What does he have against the Pledge?

Miller claimed in his email to Barber that the pledge carried with it some negative connotations that he wanted the school to get away from.

""Moreover, I have discovered that the Pledge of Allegiance has a history steeped in expressions of nativism and white nationalism. The Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1890 by Francis Bellamy, a former Baptist minister. ... In support of the Pledge, Mr. Bellamy expressed concern about the 'races which we cannot assimilate without a lowering of our racial standard.'""

""Expressions for support for the Pledge of Allegiance in 1890 sound eerily similar to the ugly racist, anti-immigrant expressions we hear today,"" Miller wrote.

Miller also disagreed with the use of the pledge on what he said were First Amendment grounds.

""I also object to the phrase 'one nation under God.' The First Amendment not only protects freedom of speech and religion, it also expressly prohibits laws that establish a religion. The U.S. Supreme Court has expressly extended those rights to those who express no belief in God. Thus, I disagree with the 1955 act of Congress to add this phrase to the Pledge of Allegiance.""

Barber, who said her childhood neighborhood was full of WWII and Korean War veterans, was appalled at Miller's disregard for the Pledge.

""If my father's generation of young men were willing to stake their lives on this republic, how could I not recite one single sentence professing allegiance to our country?"" Barber said to Campus Reform.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-college-trustee-board-drops-pledge-of-allegiance-over-white-nationalism,2019-01-29
Carly Fiorina insists it's 'vital' that President Trump be impeached — but says she still might vote for him,"Former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina says she believes it is ""vital"" that President Donald Trump be impeached — but says he still might get her vote in 2020.

What are the details?

In an interview for CNN's ""Boss Files with Poppy Harlow"" released Monday, Fiorina said of President Trump, ""I think it is vital that he be impeached,"" adding with a shrug, ""Whether removed, this close to an election, I don't know. But I believe the conduct is impeachable.""

According to Politico, Fiorina said she voted for Trump — her former political rival — in 2016, but has been ""bitterly disappointed"" with how he has conducted himself in office.

""Some of his conduct, like publicly berating a decorated war veteran who shows up in response to a lawfully issued subpoena of Congress, I think that conduct is not just unbecoming, I think it's destructive to our republic,"" Fiorina said.

When asked what the Republican Party stands for today, Fiorina answered, ""I don't know. Loyalty to Trump is what I think it stands for, sadly.""

Still, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO left open the possibility that she would vote for President Trump a second time, saying, ""Honestly, it depends on who the Democrats put up and I won't go any further than that. For me, character matters. Character is destiny for a party, for a nation, for a president. Conduct matters.""

Fiorina and Trump were bitter rivals during the 2016 Republican primary, and she eventually became fellow presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) vice presidential pick.

Following Donald Trump's win, Fiorina met with the president-elect at Trump Towers in Dec. 2016 amid speculation that she was being considered for a Cabinet position within his administration.

Carnival cruise ship brawl video,"A massive brawl erupted on a Carnival cruise ship this week. The huge brouhaha was so intense that it continued on several different floors of the Carnival Magic cruise ship.

Video shows dozens of cruise passengers engaging in a brawl during the last hours of a Caribbean cruise. Around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, an argument exploded on the dance floor.

Citing travel agent Theresa James, who was aboard the cruise, Fox News reported, ""An alleged threesome between passengers had upset their significant others when they learned of the rendezvous.""

Authorities estimated that as many as 60 people were involved in the all-out brawl. The ship's security attempted to stop the fighting, but the guards were overwhelmed by the hostile crowd. The fight started on the dance floor on the fifth floor, spread to the casino on the same floor, and eventually fizzled out on the first floor of the vessel. The melee lasted for about an hour.

An onlooker said some passengers were injured by being cut by glass.

The fisticuffs broke out in international waters.

The Carnival cruise ship called the U.S. Coast Guard for assistance. The Coast Guard escorted the cruise liner back to New York City, according to the New York Post. New York police were waiting at the dock when the Carnival Magic arrived in port.

WNBC reported, ""No injuries were reported and no weapons were involved, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Neither the Coast Guard nor the NYPD boarded the vessel, officials said. Passengers disembarked without further incident upon their NYC arrival Tuesday.""

Cruise Law News reported, ""The Coast Guard notified the New York Police Department which also clearly does not have jurisdiction to investigate crimes on Panamanian-flagged ships which are outside of New York waters.""

""Last night while Carnival Magic was returning to New York, a number of guests were involved in an altercation in a nightclub,"" Carnival said in a statement. ""Thankfully no serious injuries were reported and our onboard security team intervened. The ship arrived as scheduled this morning and shoreside law enforcement authorities were notified and met the ship to interview suspects and witnesses and conduct an investigation.""

The eight-day cruise left New York City on June 20 and stopped at ports in the Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos, and a private island in the Bahamas before returning to the Big Apple.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/carnival-cruise-ship-brawl-video,2022-07-01
CBP issues groveling apology after official Twitter account reposts 'offensive' criticism of Joe Biden,"Customs and Border Protection issued a groveling apology on Saturday after a social media account for a CBP office based in Texas appeared to endorse criticism of President Joe Biden.

What happened?

Over the weekend, the verified Twitter account CBP West Texas ""retweeted"" two messages from Stephen Miller, a top adviser in the Trump administration, criticizing Biden and the ""immense power of the state.""

Those tweetssaid:

""Violent criminals lay waste to our communities undisturbed while the immense power of the state is arrayed against those whose only crime is dissent. The law has been turned from a shield to protect the innocent into a sword to conquer them.""

""The media’s greatest power is its ability to frame what is a dire national crisis (eg 'cops are racist' summer ‘20) and what is not. Biden’s eradication of our border means we are no longer a Republic—he’s ended nearly 250 years of constitutional government. The media is silent.""

The ""retweets"" generated attention and thus a response from CBP, after immigration advocate Adam Isacson criticized CBP West Texas for reposting Miller's criticisms.

""This is one of the most egregious examples I’ve ever seen of a US federal law enforcement agency defying elected political leadership in official communications,"" Isacson said.

The account had also liked ""homophobic"" insults targeting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

How did CBP respond?

The agency deactivated the CBP West Texas account (an archive remains live) and issued a stern apology.

CBP commissioner Chris Magnus called the retweeted messages ""offensive"" and said the agency will investigate what happened.

""Totally unacceptable and disappointing that any CBP Twitter account was used to [retweet] offensive, unauthorized content. We’ve removed the content and will deactivate the account,"" Magnus said. ""The Office of Professional Responsibility will investigate. This must not happen again.""

In an official statement, CBP said:

U.S. Customs and Border Protection has become aware of unauthorized and inappropriate content that was posted to the @CBPWestTexas Twitter account. CBP will take action to deactivate the account and has referred the matter to the Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate.The tweets do not reflect the values of this administration and our work to rebuild a humane, orderly, and secure immigration system.

The swift action to take down criticisms that do not ""reflect the values"" of the Biden administration leaves one wondering: What is the agency doing about the roughly 2 million migrants who have entered the U.S. over the past 12 months?",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbp-apology-twitter-account-biden-criticism,2022-09-13
CBS News reporter says he 'felt safer' in North Korea than he does at the White House amid outbreak,"CBS News White House correspondent Ben Tracy declared on social media Monday that he ""felt safer"" reporting from the communist regime of North Korea than he does currently covering the White House after President Donald Trump and several administration staffers tested positive for COVID-19.

What are the details?

""I felt safer reporting in North Korea than I currently do reporting at The White House,"" Tracy tweeted. ""This is just crazy.""

The journalist was lambasted by conservatives for the comment. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) replied, ""That's because you were supporting the regime.""

Tracy later clarified amid backlash, ""For context folks, this is in reference to the COVID-19 outbreak at The White House.""

One person wrote, ""I'm pretty sure you'd rather run the risk getting COVID in the USA before getting it in the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]...from what I hear a bullet is the only treatment option there."" They attached an AFP article from last month citing U.S. intelligence that North Korea has ""issued shoot-to-kill orders to prevent the coronavirus entering the country from China.""

Republican attorney and frequent Fox News guest Harmeet Dhillon tweeted to Tracy, ""Yes the White House is just like North Korea, other than the beatings, starvation, lack of electricity, organ harvesting, punishment of your parents, your children, your extended family on the basis of your network's reporting. You are a clown.""

Saagar Enjeti, co-host of The Hill's ""Rising with Krystal and Saagar"" added, ""Otto Warmbier was unavailable for comment.""

As TheBlaze previously reported:

[American college student] Otto Warmbier was arrested in 2016 and sentenced to 15 years hard labor in North Korea after being accused of stealing a propaganda poster while visiting the country on a guided tour. He was released after 17 months, but when he arrived in the US, he was in a coma and never regained consciousness — dying six days after his return home.



His parents said that when Otto arrived, he was making ""inhuman noises"" like ""howling"" and ""jerking violently."" They also contend that he was blind, deaf, and that it looked like someone had ""taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth.""

Anything else?

Tracy is not the first White House correspondent to say that covering President Trump during the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most dangerous jobs on earth.

A few weeks ago, ABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl described covering an indoor rally for the president as such: ""This is not like embedding with the Marines in Fallujah. It is like you are taking your family with you to Fallujah.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-reporter-safer-in-north-korea,2020-10-06
Chairman of Joint Chiefs issues apology for appearing with President Trump in church photo-op,"Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says he's sorry for taking part in President Donald Trump's photo-op at St. John's Church on June 1.

Trump and members of his administration faced criticism after walking from the White House to St. John's Church to pose for a photo. Controversy erupted when, prior to the president's appearance, law enforcement used crowd-dispersing tactics to clear out protesters.

What are the details?

In a video for the National Defense University's commencement ceremony, Milley said, ""As senior leaders, everything you do will be closely watched. And I am not immune. As many of you saw, the result of the photograph of me at Lafayette Square last week. That sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society.

""I should not have been there. My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics,"" he continued.

Amid protests, Trump appeared in front of the church with Milley as well as Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

""As a commissioned, uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from,"" Milley admitted. ""And I sincerely hope we can all learn from it.""



Milley added, ""We who wear the cloth of our nation come from the people of our nation. And we must hold dear the principles of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.""

According to the New York Times, the senior military member also spoke out against the police-involved death of George Floyd.

""I am outraged by the senseless and brutal killing of George Floyd,"" he said. ""His death amplified the pain, the frustration, and the fear that so many of our fellow Americans live with day in [and] day out. The protests that have ensued not only speak to his killing, but also to the centuries of injustice toward African Americans. We should all be proud that the vast majority of protests have been peaceful.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chairman-joint-chiefs-apology-photo-op,2020-06-11
Charlie Hebdo head of HR forced to flee her home after French mag republishes Mohammed cartoons,"The head of human resources at Charlie Hebdo — the French satirical magazine targeted in a deadly radical Islamic terror attack in January 2015 — has been forced to flee her home because of death threats.

What are the details?

BBC News reported Tuesday that Marika Bret told a French newspaper that her security guards received the ""precise and detailed threats"" last week.

The threats came amid the long-awaited trial of 14 people accused of assisting the two gunmen, brothers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, in their attack on the magazine's offices, which left 12 dead and 11 injured.

The two gunmen were killed by French police in a shootout two days later, but the attack sparked a string of subsequent jihadist attacks across France.

As the trial began, Charlie Hebdo decided to republish the cartoons of Muslim prophet Mohammed that served as the motive for the original attack.

""Since the start of the trial and with the republication of the cartoons, we have received all kinds of horrors, including threats from al-Qaeda and calls to finish the work of the [gunmen from the 2015 attack],"" Bret said.

She reportedly blamed ""a level of hallucinatory hatred around Charlie Hebdo"" for the recent threats.

Speaking with Le Point Magazine, Bret recalled, ""I had 10 minutes to do my business and leave my home, 10 minutes to give up part of my existence ... I won't be coming home.""

What else?

Earlier this month, the magazine posted an explanation for republishing the cartoons that lampoon Islam and its principal human figure.

In the explanation, the magazine suggest that the drawings belong to history and argue it would be ""inadmissible for [them] to approach this trial without communicating [the drawings] to readers and citizens.""

To not republish the caricatures would amount to ""political or journalistic cowardice,"" the explanation read.

Here is the full statement (translated into English using Google translation feature):

The reasons for this coverage are as follows. These drawings are now part of history, and history cannot be rewritten, nor can it be erased. This happened: it is the publication of these drawings, considered blasphemy by a number of Muslims, which is the motive for the January 7 massacre by assassins who wanted to, as they shouted on leaving from the premises of Charlie Hebdo , "" avenge the Prophet "".



These drawings are therefore exhibits. It was inadmissible for us to approach this trial without communicating them to readers and citizens. Because since 2006, fourteen years have passed, and the young French people who have been born since will be the witnesses of a trial that they would not understand, these drawings having never been republished. It is therefore a duty of information which imposes to bring to the knowledge of the public these documents which have both historical and criminal value.



We have often been asked since January 2015 to produce other caricatures of Muhammad. We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited, the law allows us to do so, but because there had to be a good reason to do it, a reason which has meaning and which brings something to the debate. Reproducing these cartoons this week of the opening of the January 2015 terrorist attacks seemed essential to us. All the reasons that could be opposed to us relate only to political or journalistic cowardice. Do we want to live in a country that prides itself on being a great free and modern democracy, and which, at the same time, gives up on asserting its deepest convictions? For our part, it is out of the question. Except to live in another country, another regime, another world.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/charlie-hebdo-hr-head-flees-home,2020-09-22
Cheney indicates Jan. 6 committee will seek details of McCarthy's phone call with Trump,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol held its first hearing on Tuesday. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), a fierce Trump critic and one of two Republicans Pelosi personally asked to serve on the committee, said in her opening statement that the events of that day must be fully investigated, indicating several of her House Republican colleagues and former President Donald Trump won't escape the committee's scrutiny.

""We cannot leave the violence of Jan. 6 – and its causes – uninvestigated. The American people deserve the full and open testimony of every person with knowledge of the planning and preparation for Jan. 6,"" Cheney said in her opening remarks.

The Wyoming Republican's inclusion on the committee at Pelosi's request was a slight against House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the rest of the GOP conference, who had kicked her out of Republican leadership for her vocal criticism of Trump. Cheney was the highest-profile Republican to vote to impeach Trump, whom she blamed for instigating the violence at the Capitol, claiming he ""summoned"" the rioters there and then ""lit the flame of this attack.""

She has been highly critical of her Republican colleagues who have opposed the Jan. 6 committee and defeated a bipartisan bill that would have established an independent 9/11-style commission to investigate the events of that day. Republicans have claimed that law enforcement and previous bipartisan investigations in the House were sufficient and that any further examination of the Jan. 6 riot would be ""duplicative"" and ""potentially counterproductive"", as well as politically motivated on the part of Democrats.

Dismissing those concerns, Cheney said Monday that McCarthy and others were attempting to ""whitewash"" the mob violence at the Capitol and that it was ""a disgrace.""

Speaking Tuesday, she called on the committee to investigate ""every phone call, every conversation, every meeting leading up to, during, and after the attack"" — which would include a Jan. 6 phone call between McCarthy and Trump where the two men reportedly got into a shouting match over Trump's response to the riot. McCarthy would later claim that he contacted the president to inform him of what was happening at the Capitol and that after their talk Trump agreed to put out a statement urging the rioters to cease and desist. Trump eventually released a video statement that told the rioters to ""go home"" and that ""we love you"" while repeating his claims that the election was stolen.

However, McCarthy's account of the phone call is disputed by Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), who said in February that McCarthy told her that Trump had repeated a false claim about Antifa breaching the Capitol in disguise to frame Trump supporters.

Democrats have previously indicated they will seek to learn whether Trump purposefully delayed deploying the National Guard to stop the riot. Cheney's remarks indicate she will support that effort.

""If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our Constitutional Republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system,"" Cheney said.

Full transcript:

Thank you very much, Chairman Thompson. Thank you to all of my colleagues on this committee, and thank you to each of the witnesses appearing before us today. It is because of you — you held the line, you defended all of us, you defended the Capitol, and you defended the Constitution and our Republic, and every American owes you our undying gratitude. Every American, I hope, will be able to hear your testimony today and will watch the videos. The videos show the unbelievable violence and the inexcusable and intolerable cruelty that you all faced, and people need to know the truth.



I want to begin by reflecting briefly on the investigation that we are launching today. Every one of us here on the dais voted for and would have preferred that these matters be investigated by an independent non-partisan commission, composed of five prominent Americans selected by each party, and modeled on the 9/11 Commission. Although such a commission was opposed by my own leadership in the House, it overwhelmingly passed with the support of 35 Republican members, it was defeated by Republicans in the Senate. And that leaves us where we are today.



We cannot leave the violence of January 6th – and its causes – uninvestigated. The American people deserve the full and open testimony of every person with knowledge of the planning and preparation for January 6th. We must know what happened here at the Capitol. We must also know what happened every minute of that day in the White House – every phone call, every conversation, every meeting leading up to, during, and after the attack. Honorable men and women have an obligation to step forward. If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our Constitutional Republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system. We will face the threat of more violence in the months to come, and another January 6th every four years.



I have been a conservative Republican since 1984 when I first voted for Ronald Reagan. I have disagreed sharply on policy and politics with almost every Democratic member of this committee. But, in the end, we are one nation under God. The Framers of our Constitution recognized the danger of the vicious factionalism of partisan politics – and they knew that our daily arguments could become so fierce that we might lose track of our most important obligation – to defend the rule of law and the freedom of all Americans. That is why our Framers compelled each of us to swear a solemn oath to preserve and protect the Constitution. When a threat to our constitutional order arises, as it has here, we are obligated to rise above politics. This investigation must be non-partisan.



While we begin today by taking the public testimony of these four heroic men, we must also realize that the task of this committee will require persistence. We must issue and enforce subpoenas promptly. We must get to objective truth. We must overcome the many efforts we are already seeing to cover up and obscure the facts.



On January 6th and in the days thereafter, almost all members of my party recognized the events of that day for what they actually were. One Republican, for example, said: ""What is happening at the U.S. Capitol right now is unacceptable and un-American. Those participating in lawlessness and violence must be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."" No Member of Congress should now attempt to defend the indefensible, obstruct this investigation, or whitewash what happened that day. We must act with honor and duty, and in the interest of our nation.



America is great because we preserve our democratic institutions at all costs. Until January 6th, we were proof positive for the world that a nation conceived in liberty could long endure. But now, January 6th threatens our most sacred legacy. The question for every one of us who serves in Congress, for every elected official across this great nation, indeed, for every American is this: Will we adhere to the rule of law? Will we respect the rulings of our courts? Will we preserve the peaceful transition of power? Or will we be so blinded by partisanship that we throw away the miracle of America? Do we hate our political adversaries more than we love our country and revere our Constitution? I pray that that is not the case. I pray that we all remember, our children are watching, as we carry out this solemn and sacred duty entrusted to us. Our children will know who stood for truth, and they will inherit the nation we hand to them – a Republic, if we can keep it.



Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cheney-jan-6-committee-mccarthy-trump-phone-call,2021-07-27
China caught 'trying to disrupt our justice system': DOJ accuses 10 Chinese spies and communist agents of 'malign schemes',"The Department of Justice announced on Monday that it had charged 13 Chinese nationals, ten of whom are believed to be spies, for efforts to ""unlawfully exert influence in the United States."" Their alleged crimes include coercing American residents into traveling to China to face punishments, stealing secrets pertinent to the criminal investigation of Huawei, and recruiting more spies for China.

Attorney General Merrick Garland indicated that, in three separate cases, communist agents operating in the U.S. sought to execute the will of the genocidal Chinese communist regime — to ""interfere with the rights and freedoms of individuals in the United States and to undermine our judicial system that protects those rights.""

These newly unsealed indictments come at a time of growing tensions between China and the West and after recent revelations that the communist regime is running illegal police stations across North America and Europe.

A communist baker's dozen

The U.S. attorney's offices for the Eastern District of New York and the District of New Jersey are overseeing three cases involving the 13 alleged communist agents.

In the first case, seven Chinese nationals, two of whom were arrested in New York on Oct. 20, were indicted for attempting to force an American resident back to China. They are accused of surveilling, harassing, and coercing the victim.

In the second case, two communist Chinese spies were charged with attempting to obstruct a criminal prosecution in the Eastern District of New York. The spies have not yet been apprehended.

In the third case, three Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence officers were charged in connection with a ""long-running intelligence campaign"" with the aim of flipping U.S. residents and turning them into communist agents.

Operation Fox Hunt

The Chinese communist party has worked hard in recent years to track down and coerce Chinese dissidents living abroad into returning to China for punishment. While the CCP claims that those targeted for illegal extradition are fraudsters, there is substantial evidence that the regime is in fact hunting down Chinese people it perceives to be its foes, including members of religious groups (e.g., Chinese house Christians and underground Catholics), ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs, and political dissidents at odds with the communist party.

The initiative, which began in 2014, is called Operation Fox Hunt. Unfortunately for the communist agents operating in the United States, they neglected to realize they were among wolves.



The Eastern District Court of New York unsealed an eight-count indictment on Oct. 20 charging seven Chinese nationals for their involvement in a scheme to force at least one individual living in the U.S. back to China.

According to the DOJ, the lead defendant is 55-year-old Quanzhong An, a business man who worked in Roslyn, New York. Quanzhong also is the majority shareholder of a hotel in Flushing, New York.

Quanzhong's criminal operation was allegedly directed and monitored by various officials with the Chinese regime's Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection.

The DOJ suggested that Quanzhong attempted with several others to coerce an American resident identified only as John Doe-1 as well as members of Doe-1's family to return to China. As part of the scheme, the Chinese agents brought a member of the victim's family from China to the United States, threatening harm in the event of noncompliance.

Quanzhong's co-conspirators told Doe-1's family, ""Coming back and turning yourself in is the only way out"" and that ""avoidance and wishful thinking will only result in severe legal punishments.""

Quanzhong was arrested along with Guangyang An on Thursday. They were charged with conspiracy to act as foreign agents and acting as agents of a foreign government.

U.S Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York indicated that the U.S. ""will firmly counter such outrageous violations of national sovereignty and prosecute individuals who act as illegal agents of foreign states.""

Huawei and Ocean University China

The second case referenced in the DOJ's announcement concerns Chinese agents Dong He and Zheng Wang, both of whom were charged after they allegedly set about stealing files and other information from the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York. The information they allegedly tried to steal pertained to the ongoing federal criminal investigation into Huawei, a Chinese company that was indicted in 2019.

Dong and Zheng, working on behalf of the CCP, tried bribing a U.S. government employee with $41,000 in Bitcoin. While the suspects believed the individual was a Chinese agent, they soon discovered he was working for the FBI.

Neither of the two communist agents have been arrested t -date. If brought to justice and convicted, Dong faces 40 years imprisonment and Wang 20 years.

In the third case, Chinese intelligence officers Wang Lin, Bi Hongwei, Dong Ting, and Wang Qiang attempted to recruit communist agents on behalf of the CCP. Among those they targeted were professors at universities and a state homeland security official. They used the so-called Institute of International Studies (Ocean University of China) as cover for their clandestine activities.

A pattern of 'outrageous behavior'

Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco stated, ""The actions announced today take place against a backdrop of malign activity from the government of the People's Republic of China [PRC] that includes espionage, attempts to disrupt our justice system, harassment of individuals, and ongoing efforts to steal sensitive U.S. technology.""

FBI Director Christopher Wray emphasized the CCP's hand in the criminality, stating, ""These indictments of PRC intelligence officers and government officials – for trying to obstruct a U.S. trial of a Chinese company, masquerading as university professors to steal sensitive information, and trying to strong-arm a victim into returning to China – again expose the PRC’s outrageous behavior within our own borders.""

In addition to the 13 Chinese agents charged in recent days, others have been charged in recent months and years.



On September 26, a Chinese national, 31-year-old Ji Chaoqun, was found guilty of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government. The former U.S. Army reservist had informed on individuals targeted for recruitment to the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security.

On July 7, five men including one current and one former Department of Homeland Security agent, Craig Miller and Derrick Taylor, were indicted for crimes related to a communist Chinese transnational repression scheme to silence critics of the regime.

In October 2020, eight illegal Chinese agents were charged for surveilling, locating, and intimidating targets of the CCP. They intended to coerce their targets back to China, where ""they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials.""

In September 2020, NYPD officer and U.S. Army reservist Baimadajie Angwang (of Tibetan descent) was allegedly conscripted by Chinese officials to spy on the Tibetan community in New York City on behalf of the communist regime.

FBI Director Wray said that the FBI ""will continue to throw the full weight of our counterintelligence and law enforcement authorities into stopping the Chinese government’s crimes against our businesses, universities, and Chinese-American communities.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-caught-trying-to-disrupt-our-justice-system-doj-accuses-10-chinese-spies-and-communist-agents-of-malign-schemes,2022-10-25
China complains about videos of Pompeo discussing CCP,"The Chinese embassy in the U.S. issued a letter complaining about videos from the Hudson Institute's China Center in which former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke out against the Communist Chinese Party.

""The CCP wants me to stop speaking the truth. Ain’t gonna happen,"" Pompeo tweeted on Tuesday.

Pompeo's post included a photo of a letter in which the Chinese embassy in the U.S. complained about the videos and claimed that the Communist Party of China has benefitted the nation's people.

In the Hudson Institute videos, Pompeo called out the communist Chinese regime for being against the people of China.

""The Chinese Communist Party doesn't represent the Chinese people,"" Pompeo says in the first video, which also includes English and what appears to be Chinese text of his remarks on the screen. ""The CCP is a one-party, totalitarian, political organization committed to a foreign, anti-Chinese ideology. It started out as a group of brutal, radical extremists. And frankly, not much has changed.""

""There is no bigger enemy for the CCP than you, the Chinese people,"" Pompeo declared. He also said that ""what the CCP truly cares about is maintaining their stranglehold over the Chinese people.""

So far, the video has amassed more than 53,000 views on YouTube.

The Chinese Communist Party Does Not Represent the Chinese People www.youtube.com

The letter from the Chinese embassy claimed that Pompeo had ""made groundless accusation against the Communist Party of China.""



""The CPC is founded for the people and nurtured by the people. The leadership of the CPC is the choice of history and of the people, and is endorsed in China's Constitution. China's development would never have been possible without the leadership of the CPC. Under its leadership, the Chinese people have, through arduous struggle and hard work, established the People's Republic of China and freed themselves from bullying, oppression and subjugation,"" the note claimed.

Pompeo served CIA director during a portion of President Donald Trump's tenure before moving on to serve as secretary of state. Prior to those roles, he had served as a congressman from Kansas in the U.S. House of Representatives. He appears to be open to the possibility of mounting a White House bid.

""So the decision about what I'll do next, the place I'll find myself whether that's helping someone run for president or putting myself forward as a candidate, ah, will depend on my judgment about the most effective way to deliver what the American people deserve,"" Pompeo said last month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-complains-videos-pompeo-communist,2022-10-05
China warns it may detain Americans over scholar prosecutions,"The Chinese government has warned the United States that it may begin to detain Americans in response to the U.S. Justice Department's prosecution of Chinese military-affiliated scholars, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.

Chinese officials reportedly issued multiple warnings to U.S. government representatives through the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and other channels, as reported in the WSJ. The Chinese officials cautioned that they may arrest Americans currently residing in the country if U.S. officials don't drop charges against the country's scholars. The Wall Street Journal's sources for the report are from unnamed people familiar with the matter.

When asked about the report, the White House referred questions to the State Department, which responded to Reuters in an emailed statement that said, ""To the Chinese government — including at the highest levels — our concern about China's coercive use of exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries, and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process.""

The Chinese Embassy in Washington and China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comments on Saturday from the WSJ.

In July, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it had charged four Chinese nationals for visa fraud, the FBI arrested three of the suspects.

""These members of China's People Liberation Army applied for research visas while hiding their true affiliation with the PLA,"" said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. ""This is another part of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions. We will continue to conduct this investigation together with the FBI.""

""The United States welcomes students, academics, and researchers from across the globe. Today's announcement shows the extreme lengths to which the Chinese government has gone to infiltrate and exploit America's benevolence,"" said John Brown, Executive Assistant Director of the FBI's National Security Branch. ""In interviews with members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in over 25 cities across the U.S., the FBI uncovered a concerted effort to hide their true affiliation to take advantage of the United States and the American people.""

The DOJ also announced that it had conducted interviews of visa holders suspected of having undeclared affiliation with the Chinese military in more than 25 U.S. cities.

On Sept. 14, the State Department issued an advisory that warned against traveling to China ""due to COVID-19 and risk due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" The advisory cautioned that the Chinese government uses arbitrary detention of U.S. and foreign citizens ""to gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.""

""In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of an exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there is no reliable mechanism or legal process to find out how long the ban might continue or to contest it in a court of law,"" the advisory said.

Demers told the WSJ that the agency was ""aware that the Chinese government has, in other instances, detained American, Canadian and other individuals without legal basis to retaliate against lawful prosecutions and to exert pressure on their governments, with a callous disregard of the individuals involved.""

In May, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that allowed the U.S. to cancel or deny student visas for anyone with direct connections to China's military, the People's Liberation Army.

""The PRC authorities use some Chinese students, mostly post‑graduate students and post-doctorate researchers, to operate as non-traditional collectors of intellectual property,"" the order stated. ""Thus, students or researchers from the PRC studying or researching beyond the undergraduate level who are or have been associated with the PLA are at high risk of being exploited or co-opted by the PRC authorities and provide particular cause for concern.""

There were approximately 360,000 Chinese students enrolled in U.S. schools as of August. As of Sept. 9, more than 1,000 Chinese students and researchers had their visas revoked after the State Department deemed them to be ""high risk,"" some were alleged to have ties to the People's Republic of China military.

In July, FBI Director Christopher Wray outlined the threats posed by the Chinese government.

""We've now reached the point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours,"" Wray said. ""Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China. And at this very moment, China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research.""

Wray added a clarification, ""Every year, the United States welcomes more than 100,000 Chinese students and researchers into this country. For generations, people have journeyed from China to the United States to secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their families—and our society is better for their contributions. So, when I speak of the threat from China, I mean the government of China and the Chinese Communist Party.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-detain-americans-prosecution-scholars,2020-10-18
China expels American journalists in latest escalation of media war amid the coronavirus outbreak,"The Chinese government revoked the press credentials of American journalists for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal Tuesday, effectively expelling them from the country.

The journalists will be required to turn in their press cards to the Chinese government within 10 calendar days and will ""not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions,"" according to the announcement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs office.

The country also ordered the journalists from those media outlets — along with voice of America and Time magazine — to ""declare in written form"" information about their operation within the country.

What's the background?

The move is the latest escalation in a media war between the United States and China amid the global coronavirus pandemic.

In the announcement, the Chinese government stated that the expulsion was a necessary retaliation to the U.S. State Department's action last month, which designated five Chinese state media outlets as ""foreign missions."" The designation meant that the outlets would be treated as arms of the Chinese government.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued that the five outlets were ""clearly controlled by the [Chinese Communist Party]"" and that the U.S. was ""simply recognizing that fact by taking this action.""

At the same time, China expelled three Wall Street Journal journalists in response to an opinion piece the outlet published that was headlined: ""China Is The Real Sick Man Of Asia.""

Then in March, the State Department also capped the number of Chinese journalists that could work for the media outlets at 100, which resulted in 60 Chinese nationals having to leave the country.

'Disinformation and outlandish rumors'

The global coronavirus outbreak has heightened the intensity of the conflict of late, as many in the U.S. suspect that China lied for weeks regarding the origin and severity of the novel virus, which began in Wuhan, China, last year.

On Saturday, the State Department ""hauled in"" the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. to confront him over a Chinese official's unsubstantiated claims that the virus was introduced in Wuhan by the U.S. Army.

Then early this week, Secretary Pompeo again lashed out at the Chinese government for pushing the claims.

In a phone call with the Chinese Foreign Affairs office director, Pompeo ""conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

""The Secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,"" the statement added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-expels-american-journalists-coronavirus,2020-03-17
Taiwan in trouble: China flies warplanes and bombers through independent airspace,"This past Sunday, 39 Chinese warplanes — including one bomber — entered Taiwan’s air defense zone.

The Chinese warplanes were detected in Taiwan’s south-western Air Defense Identification Zone. The ADIZ is a self-declared airspace that Taiwan monitors for national security purposes, Deutsche Welle reported.

In response to the Chinese incursion of the ADIZ, the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense scrambled its fighter jets and deployed air defense missile systems to monitor the Chinese planes’ activity.

This incursion was the largest since last October when China flew 38 planes — including bombers outfitted to potentially carry nuclear weapons — through the ADIZ.

At the time, Tawainese Premier Su Tseng-chang said, “China has been bellicose and damaging regional peace while engaging in many bullying acts,” Deutsche Welle reported.

In 2020, China made 380 separate incursions into the ADIZ. In 2021, they flew through the ADIZ over 500 times.

Last July, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to “reunify” with Taiwan and “smash” any attempts from the Taiwanese to attain formally recognized independence, Reuters said. Under Jinping’s rule, China has amplified its intentions to bring Taiwan under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party and incorporate it into the People’s Republic of China – similarly to Hong Kong.

At the Chinese Communist Party’s 100th birthday celebration, President Jinping stated that “Solving the Taiwan question and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland are the unswerving historical tasks of the Chinese Communist Party and the common aspiration of all Chinese people.”

In response, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council — an entity tasked with making policy pertaining to Taiwan and China’s strained relationship — said, “[China’s] historical decision-making errors and persistent harmful actions have caused serious threats to regional security.”

The possibility of falling under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party is, obviously, very unpopular among the Taiwanese people.

The Mainland Affairs Council stated “Our government’s determination to firmly defend the nation’s sovereignty and Taiwan’s democracy and freedom and to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait remains unchanged.”

After previously vowing to protect Taiwan should China invade, President Joe Biden has since reneged on his promise. After speaking with Xi in November, Biden said the United States does not encourage Taiwanese independence.

According to CNN, Biden said, “They have to decide — Taiwan, not us. We are not encouraging independence.”

Notably, many American corporate entities are silent on China’s growing aggression toward Taiwan. American film studios, professional sports leagues, and even soda companies bend the knee so that they may do business within the Chinese mainland.

China has made it clear that it’s a matter of when it invades Taiwan, not a matter of if it invades. The fact that American companies are increasingly conducting business with a nation that violates human rights and national sovereignty ought to be a concern toeveryone.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-flies-warplanes-through-independent-airspace-taiwan,2022-01-24
China warns government departments to clean up social media accounts,"The State Council of the People's Republic of China has warned government departments to clean up its social media accounts in an effort to boost its image to attract younger people.

Officials issued stricter social media guidelines late Thursday, Reuters reported. The State Council said more regulation was needed for authorities' profiles, and it pledged to get rid of dormant accounts and ""shocking"" comments on official channels.

""This has a negative impact on the image and the public trust in the government,"" the cabinet said on its website.

Some government agencies have large followings. For instance, the Communist Party's Youth League has 7.7 million followers on Weibo.

What's the story?

The new rules come amid the government's push to reach younger generations who get most of their information on popular platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and a news aggregator called Toutiao.

The move also is in line with the Communist leadership's ongoing attempt to control the sharing of information with the public, especially financial news and posts from bloggers and livestreamers, Reuters noted.

Facebook, Twitter, and other global social media platforms are banned in China.

Government accounts ""cannot express any personal emotions or opinions, and normally should only repost information from government websites or from sources recognized by the government,"" the State Council said.

Paying for fake followers and fabricating social media data are also disallowed.

Earlier this year, the Yueyang municipal government's official Weibo account called an internet user an ""environment protection b***h"" when it shared a post that concerned a waste incineration plant. It later issued an apology, according to Reuters.

What else?

The State Council has also tightened its regulations on financial news and other information provided to the public.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-government-clean-up-social-media,2018-12-28
China warns of 'resolute counterattack' after Pompeo says 'Taiwan has not been a part of China',"In response to comments from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recognizing the reality that ""Taiwan has not been a part of China"" for decades, the Chinese government responded by promising a ""resolute attack"" against ""any behaviour that undermines China's core interests and interferes with China's domestic affairs.""

In a radio interview Thursday, Pompeo explained why the administration's position is that ""Taiwan has not been a part of China,"" saying, ""That was recognized with the work that the Reagan administration did to lay out the policies that the United States has adhered to now for three-and-a-half decades.""

Taiwan's foreign ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou thanked Pompeo for his support, noting, ""The Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign, independent country, and not part of the People's Republic of China. This is a fact and the current situation.""

The communist Chinese government, meanwhile, was not amused.

According to a report from Reuters, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Wenbin responded furiously, ""We solemnly tell Pompeo and his ilk, that any behaviour that undermines China's core interests and interferes with China's domestic affairs will be met with a resolute counterattack by China.""

He did not elaborate on what that ""resolute counterattack"" might entail.

The United States' relationship with Taiwan has been an ongoing source of angst to the Chinese government, which insists that Taiwan is a rebel province and repeatedly threatens retaliation against countries that recognize Taiwan's independence.

The United States has at least arguably a legal obligation to defend Taiwan in the event of an attack on the island by mainland China. Additionally, the Trump administration has taken a series of incremental steps to increasingly recognize Taiwan's independence, including encouraging arms sales to Taiwan and inviting representatives from Taiwan to participate in economic talks with the United States as an independent country.

These moves have also rankled the Chinese government, which has placed sanctions on United States companies that have sold to Taiwan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-resolute-counterattack-pompeo-taiwan,2020-11-13
DNI Ratcliffe says US intelligence proves China is the greatest threat to freedom around the globe since WWII,"Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe warned Americans that China is running a ""massive influence campaign"" to bend U.S. lawmakers to the will of the communist government, and called it the country's top national threat.

Ratcliffe made the accusations in a startling op-ed in the Washington Post published Thursday.

""If I could communicate one thing to the American people from this unique vantage point, it is that the People's Republic of China poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II,"" wrote Ratcliffe.

He explained that evidence gathered by the U.S. intelligence community indicated that the goal of China's government is to dominate the globe ""economically, militarily and technologically.""

Ratcliffe said that the country uses the camouflage of its prominent companies to rob intellectual property from American companies, replicate their innovations, and then replace them in the global marketplace.

He gave an example of how a Chinese-owned company in the U.S. could use its influence to subtly manipulate politicians to do the will of the communist government back home.

Consider this scenario: A Chinese-owned manufacturing facility in the U.S. employs several thousand Americans. One day, the plant's union leader is approached by a representative of the Chinese firm. The businessman explains that the local congresswoman is taking a hard-line position on legislation that runs counter to Beijing's interests—even though it has nothing to do with the industry the company is involved in—and says the union leader must urge her to shift positions or the plant and all its jobs will soon be gone.



The union leader contacts his congresswoman and indicates that his members won't support her re-election without a change in position. He tells himself he's protecting his members, but in that moment he's doing China's bidding, and the congresswoman is being influenced by China, whether she realizes it or not.

Ratcliffe also said that China had been crossing ethical boundaries by experimenting with human subjects in order to develop soldiers with enhanced abilities.

He concluded by warning that America needed to be prepared for the challenges from China.

""Americans have always risen to the moment, from defeating the scourge of fascism to bringing down the Iron Curtain. This generation will be judged by its response to China's effort to reshape the world in its own image and replace America as the dominant superpower,"" wrote Ratcliffe.

""The intelligence is clear,"" he concluded. ""Our response must be as well.""

China threatens US: There will be 'military conflict' if Biden supports Taiwanese independence,"In what could be read as either a warning or a threat, China's ambassador to the United States said Thursday there will be ""military conflict"" between the U.S. and China should the island nation of Taiwan attempt to become fully independent from Xi Jinping's communist regime.

In an interview with NPR, ambassador Qin Gang asserted that Taiwan is ""walking down the road toward independence"" and said, ""If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict.""

While Russian aggression on Ukraine's borders may precipitate war in Eastern Europe, China is taking increasingly aggressive action toward Taiwan under President Joe Biden's watch. Days ago, Chinese warplanes flew through Taiwan's southwestern Air Defense Identification Zone in what was the largest incursion on Taiwanese territory since last October, when China few 38 planes, including bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, through the ADIZ.



The People's Republic of China has long claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, which is the last foothold of the old pre-communist Chinese government and a democracy. Last year, dictator Xi pledged to ""reunify"" Taiwan with mainland China and ""smash"" any attempts by the island nation to achieve independence from the PRC.



The United States has traditionally supported Taiwan's right to be free of ""force or threat"" from the PRC. President Barack Obama's administration sold $1.83 billion worth of arms to the Taiwanese military in 2015, which was opposed by the PRC. As a candidate for president, Joe Biden said that the U.S. has a ""commitment"" to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. But since assuming office and talking with Xi, Biden has backed down and said the future of Taiwan is in the country's own hands.

""We are not encouraging independence,"" Biden said in November.

Though Biden has made noncommittal statements about Taiwan, Qin said the region's status remains ""the biggest tinderbox"" in U.S.-Chinese relations. He denied that China wants to pursue war to take control of Taiwan.

""People on both sides of Taiwan Straits are Chinese, so we are compatriots. So the last thing we should do is to fight with compatriots. And we will do our utmost in the greatest sincerity to achieve a peaceful reunification,"" Qin said. ""But ... that Taiwanese authority is working down the road towards independence, emboldened by the United States. So China will not commit to giving up the un-peaceful means for reunification because this is a deterrence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-threatens-us-there-will-be-military-conflict-if-biden-supports-taiwanese-independence,2022-01-28
China threatens war if US interferes with possible Taiwan invasion,"China's defense minister threatened all-out war while discussing Taiwan's independence during a meeting between top Chinese and American military officials. The threats were made on Friday during the first face-to-face meeting of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe.

""If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will definitely not hesitate to start a war no matter the cost,"" warned China’s defense spokesman Wu Qian – who was quoting General Wei.

The saber-rattling continued as the Chinese defense minister declared that Beijing would ""smash to smithereens"" any effort to maintain Taiwan's independence. The ministry vowed that Taiwan would be made part of China for the ""unification of the motherland.""

During the 30-minute summit at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Wei ""stressed that Taiwan is China's Taiwan... Using Taiwan to contain China will never prevail.""

Qian said the meeting was a ""good start"" to resuming normal military dialogue, and both countries agreed to continue communicating.

Austin pointed out there has been a ""steady increase in provocative and destabilizing military activity near Taiwan.""

Austin called on China ""to refrain from further destabilizing actions toward Taiwan.""

""We remain focused on maintaining peace, stability and the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,"" Austin proclaimed. ""But the PRC's moves threaten to undermine security, and stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.""

Austin hinted at a parallel with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating that the indefensible assault on a peaceful neighbor has galvanized the world and ... has reminded us all of the dangers of undercutting an international order rooted in rules and respect.”

Austin added, ""Rules-based international order matters just as much in the Indo-Pacific as it does in Europe.""

""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is what happens when oppressors trample the rules that protect us all,"" Austin said. ""It's what happens when big powers decide that their imperial appetites matter more than the rights of their peaceful neighbors. And it’s a preview of a possible world of chaos and turmoil that none of us would want to live in.""

Austin said the U.S. is committed to ""assisting Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.""

The Pentagon released a statement regarding the meeting.



""Secretary Austin discussed the need to responsibly manage competition and maintain open lines of communication,"" the statement said. ""The Secretary underscored the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue on improving crisis communications and reducing strategic risk.""



""Secretary Austin discussed global and regional security issues, including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,"" the Pentagon stated.

Austin told his counterpart that the United States ""remains committed to our longstanding one-China policy.""

The Center for Strategic and International Studies defines the one-China policy as: ""The United States recognizes the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China but only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China. Thus, the United States maintains formal relations with the PRC and has unofficial relations with Taiwan.""

Last month, President Joe Biden broke away from the strategic ambiguity of whether the U.S. would defend Taiwan against an invasion by China.

When asked if the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily if the CCP invaded, President Biden said, ""Yes... that's the commitment we made. The idea that it [Taiwan] can be taken by force... is just not appropriate. It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine.""

The Taipei Times reported this week that Beijing estimates that the Chinese military will be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.



""China has over the past few years stationed an increasing number of warships along its southeastern coast, as it is seeking to maintain its military advantage in the region and attempting to build a system of intelligence warfare by 2027,"" the report said. ""By 2027, China is expected to possess regional air defense capabilities, and long-range sea and airstrike systems, which would greatly extend its combat range, following the introduction of its aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong, a second-generation Type 003 vessel, as well as the mass production of Type 055 destroyers, Y-20 tanker aircraft, and J-20 fighters.""

Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949, and Taiwan has been self-governed ever since. China claims that Taiwan is a breakaway province.

CCP leader Xi Jinping has vowed to reclaim Taiwan.

""No one should underestimate the Chinese people's staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Xi said last year. ""The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-war-us-taiwan-invasion,2022-06-11
"Report: Chinese communists operating covert police operations in the US, Canada, and Europe","Chinese communist agents are reportedly conducting extralegal and clandestine policing operations across the globe to intimidate and hunt down persons wanted by Beijing. The United States, Canada, and Europe are among the countries home to the CCP ""police service stations"" involved in this work.

According to a new report, these police stations, while purportedly created to combat fraud, are a means to extend the genocidal communist regime's influence and powers of ""transnational repression."" This confirms the acceleration of a well-documented trend of the communist power infringing upon the ""rights and freedoms of overseas Chinese and minority communities in exile.""

Parallel policing mechanisms

Safeguard Defenders, a European pan-Asian human rights NGO, issued a September report entitled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" detailing how the communist Chinese regime has employed ""overseas police service stations"" on five continents.

On January 22, Liu Rongyan, director of the Overseas Chinese Police Office of the Public Security Bureau in Fuzhou City, announced that the ""first batch"" of 30 overseas police services in 25 cities across 21 countries had been opened. There are now reportedly 54 such CCP-backed centers.



There are allegedly one station in New York, three in Toronto, and dozens across Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

Whereas China contends that these stations serve expats in the capacity of micro-consulates, aiding with administrative tasks (e.g., filing police reports or renewing drivers' licenses), Safeguard Defenders indicated that the primary function of these forward operating bases is instead to compel persons to return to China whenever the regime has determined them to have broken Chinese law.

""These operations eschew official bilateral police and judicial cooperation and violate international law,"" said the report. Furthermore, they may ""violate the territorial integrity of third countries involved in setting up a parallel policing mechanism using illegal methods.""

The development of these centers occurred alongside the CCP's campaign to intimidate and extort Chinese nationals and expats to return to China to face criminal proceedings. Between April 2021 and July 2022, communist authorities claimed 230,000 nationals were ""persuaded to return.""

Safeguard Defenders identified two methods frequently used to prompt nationals to return.

First, CCP agents track down a target's family in China ""in order to pressure them through means of intimidation, harassment, detention or imprisonment into persuading their family members to return 'voluntarily'.""

Second, CCP agents or proxies are dispatched to threaten and harass the target into returning ""voluntarily.""

For proxies and willing co-conspirators, Freedom House reported last year that communist officials rely upon ""a broader framework of influence that encompasses cultural associations, diaspora groups, and in some cases, organized crime networks.""

The Safeguard Defenders report stressed that these methods and the stations that may provide support to their executors leave ""legal Chinese residents abroad fully exposed to extra-legal targeting by the Chinese police, with little to none of the protection theoretically ensured under both national and international law.""

Chinese authorities claim that the hundreds of thousands of people persuaded to return to China were suspected of fraud and telecom fraud; however, there have been recent indications that such intimidation campaigns have been utilized against political dissidents, religious minorities, and refugees fleeing communist oppression.

Growing infrastructure of repression

Pastor Pan Yongguan and 61 Christian congregants belonging to the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church fled China in 2019, seeking refugee from communist persecution. Yongguan's family, who remained in China were penalized as a result of his actions.

Pressure was similarly applied to other congregants' families (e.g., a newborn's legal status was denied by authorities), with the expectation that the expats would return to face charges of treason and ""collusion with foreign forces.""

Although Yongguan suggested CCP agents were stalking him in Thailand, he has not yet been captured. Other targets of the CCP who fled to countries with closer Chinese ties were, however, quickly apprehended.

For instance, many of the estimated 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs who were hunted down and detained in the Near East and North Africa have been extradited back to China.

A 2021 Freedom House report stated, ""China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" The CCP ""targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption.""

It may be expedient for the communists to accuse those in these groups instead of fraud, the alleged focus of their foreign police service stations.

Regardless of the accusation, the tactics utilized are the same, ranging from ""direct attacks like renditions, to co-opting other countries to detain and render exiles, to mobility controls, to threats from a distance like digital threats, spyware, and coercion by proxy.""

American operations

While New York City may be the only known American location of a CCP police service station administered by the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau, there is nevertheless a great deal of communist interference and intimidation nationwide.

In September 2020, NYPD officer and U.S. Army reservist Baimadajie Angwang (of Tibetan descent) was allegedly conscripted by Chinese officials to spy on the Tibetan community in New York City on behalf of the communist regime. He was charged with acting as an illegal agent of the CCP as well as committing wire fraud, making false statements, and obstructing an official proceeding.



In October 2020, eight illegal Chinese agents were charged for surveilling, locating, and intimidating targets of the CCP. They intended to coerce their targets back to China, where ""they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials.""

On July 7, five men including one current and one former Department of Homeland Security agent, Craig Miller and Derrick Taylor, were indicted for crimes related to a communist Chinese transnational repression scheme to silence critics of the regime.

On September 26, a Chinese national, 31-year-old Ji Chaoqun, was found guilty of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government. The former U.S. Army reservist had informed on individuals targeted for recruitment to the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security. These individuals included other Chinese nationals operating as engineers and scientists in the U.S.

Governments looking the other way

The Globe and Mail reported that one of the three CCP stations allegedly operating in Toronto was the office belonging to the Canada Toronto FuQing Business Association. This association was reportedly ""established 'under the guidance' of a number of Chinese and Fujianese government organizations, including a municipal committee of the United Front Work Department, the body that projects the Chinese Communist Party's influence overseas.""

It remains unclear whether these alleged communist police service stations operate ""with the imprimatur or even knowledge of the host government.""

Camille Boily-Lavoie, a spokesman for the RCMP, told the Globe that the federal police force was aware that ""foreign states may seek to intimidate or harm communities or individuals within Canada.""

According to the National Post, dissidents targeted by the CCP have long warned Canadian authorities of organized harassment by communist agents.

Canadian critics of the CCP's genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been targeted by CCP proxies in harassment campaigns.

Cherie Wong, for instance, faced rape and death threats from communist activists in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Wong indicated that critics of the CCP and its murderous policies can expect their family members back in China to get a threatening ""tea visit"" from Chinese officials.

Chinese dissident Shen Xue, who moved to Canada fleeing communist persecution, was allegedly threatened by CCP agents in Toronto. ""I thought that I escaped from the fear,"" she said. ""But I realized that they are here, their people, their network, their power, and everything is here.""

In light of a cabinet letter, the House of Commons is reportedly ""aware that foreign states, including the People's Republic of China or its proxies, may attempt to harass, threaten and intimidate Canadians, persons residing in Canada or their families, in Canada or abroad.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who publicly stated that he admired China's ""basic dictatorship,"" was warned last year by Canada's spy agency that the communist Chinese interference campaigns ""have become normalized.""

The Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China called the Trudeau government's response to communist interference and influence campaigns weak and ""piecemeal at best, and, more often, unsatisfactory and ineffective at identifying and addressing the sources of these violations.""

The group stated that ""many individuals fear that Chinese government or consular agents are monitoring their speech or their activities. ... Chinese state actors have almost certainly become emboldened by the inadequate responses of Canadian officials.""

Charles Burton, a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, called the presence of the CCP police stations in Toronto ""an outrage.""

""Chinese police setting up offices in Canada, then 'persuading' alleged criminals to return to the motherland to face 'justice' — while our own government and security services apparently choose to look the other way — represents a gross violation of Canada's national sovereignty, international law and the norms of diplomacy,"" he wrote.

Burton added, ""China is extending the grip of its Orwellian police state into this country.""

It's not just Canada that has permitted CCP agents to put up shop.

According to the Italian publication Il Foglio, there is a ""Fuzhou Overseas Police Station"" in the Tuscan city of Prato. Some Chinese expats reportedly use the station as an alternative to a legitimate Italian court, much like the Sharia law courts that operate extralegally in Britain.

The communist-linked police station is reportedly ""not of particular concern"" to the real Italian police because it ""only deals with administrative practices and not public security.""

According to the Safeguard Defenders report, there are communist Chinese-linked police stations in the following British, European, and Balkan countries: The Netherlands; Ireland; Portugal; Czech Republic; Hungary; Italy; France; Germany; Slovakia; Austria; Ukraine; Serbia; Sweden; Spain; Scotland; England; and Greece.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-communists-operating-covert-police-operations-in-the-us-canada-and-europe,2022-09-30
"Top Chinese counterintelligence official defected to US, provided intel on Wuhan lab and China's bioweapons programs: Reports","There are multiple reports that a top Chinese official, who is reportedly ""close to"" Chinese President Xi Jinping, has defected to the United States. The reports claim that the defector is cooperating with a U.S. intelligence agency, providing eye-opening intel about the Wuhan Institute of Virology and China's bioweapons programs.

There are reports that Dong Jingwei defected from China with his daughter Dong Yang in mid-February, flying from Hong Kong to the United States. Dong landed in California, where he contacted the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency to inform officials that he was defecting and could provide inside information about covert Chinese operations, according to a report from Red State, which says, ""Dong then 'hid in plain sight' for about two weeks before disappearing into DIA custody.""

Dong is a longtime official in China's Ministry of State Security, also known as the ""Guoanbu."" The U.S. Department of Justice describes the Ministry of State Security as an ""institution similar to the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency (ClA) combined under one intelligence directorate responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, and political security.""

Dong's ""publicly available background indicates that he was responsible for the Ministry's counterintelligence efforts in China, i.e., spy-catching, since being promoted to vice minister in April 2018,"" as reported by the Daily Beast and SpyTalk, which is a news site offering analysis on national security topics and U.S. intelligence operations.

""If the stories are true, Dong would be the highest-level defector in the history of the People's Republic of China,"" the report says.

Dong is ""close to"" Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to Intelligence Online, a Paris-based newsletter specializing in coverage of the global intelligence community. ""He previously headed the Guoanbu in the region of Hebei, which has produced many of Xi's securocrats,"" the publication reported in 2018.

The Daily Beast report states:

Dong's defection was raised by Chinese officials last March at the Sino-American summit in Alaska, according to Dr. Han Lianchao, a former Chinese foreign ministry official before defecting after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. In a Wednesday tweet, Han, citing an unnamed source, alleged that China's foreign minister Wang Yi and Communist Party foreign affairs boss Yang Jiechi demanded that the Americans return Dong, and U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken refused.

Dong allegedly supplied the U.S. with ""information about the Wuhan Institute of Virology that changed the stance of the Biden administration concerning the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Red State reports, ""Not only does Dong have detailed information about China's special weapons systems, the Chinese military's operation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and the Chinese government's assets and sources within the United States; Dong has extremely embarrassing and damaging information about our intelligence community and government officials in the 'terabytes of data' he's provided to the DIA.""



The Red State report also claims that Dong provided the DIA with information about: ""Early pathogenic studies of the virus we now know as SARS-CoV-2, models of predicted COVID-19 spread and damage to the US and the world, financial records detailing which exact organizations and governments funded the research on SARS-CoV-2 and other biological warfare research, names of US citizens who provide intel to China, names of Chinese spies working in the US or attending US universities, financial records showing US businessmen and public officials who've received money from the Chinese government, details of meetings US government officials had (perhaps unwittingly) with Chinese spies and members of Russia's SVR, and how the Chinese government gained access to a CIA communications system, leading to the death of dozens of Chinese people who were working with the CIA.""

The report alleges that Dong delivered copies of the contents of the hard drive of Hunter Biden's laptop, ""showing the information the Chinese government has about Hunter's pornography problem and about his (and Joe's) business dealings with Chinese entities.""

Emmy, AP, and RTNDA Award-winning American journalist Adam Housley said earlier this month that the United States ""increased pressure on China in recent days is due to a defector with intimate knowledge.""



On the same day as Housley's report, Red State published an article stating, ""A person believed to be among the highest-ranking defectors ever to the United States from the People's Republic of China has been working with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for months,"" according to sources inside the intelligence community.

""FBI Director Christopher Wray was 'ambushed' with the information, they say, and Langley was also unaware,"" the Red State report adds. ""Sources say DIA leadership kept the defector within their Clandestine Services network to prevent Langley and the State Department from accessing the person, whose existence was kept from other agencies because DIA leadership believes there are Chinese spies or sources inside the FBI, CIA, and several other federal agencies.""



A report from the Washington Times in September 2020 claims that another defector, who was a member of the People's Liberation Army, furnished the U.S. with information about China's covert biological weapons program. The defector escaped to Europe and was reportedly ""under the protection of a European government security service."" ""The PLA defector believes that Chinese intelligence has penetrated the U.S. government and is therefore wary of cooperating with the CIA and other Western spy agencies,"" the report alleges.

The Daily Beast article warns that rumors of defectors are common, ""Former Pentagon, State Department, and CIA expert Nicholas Eftimiades, author of Chinese Espionage: Operations and Tactics, called the report 'exactly what it is, a rumor. It happens all the time' in the information warfare between Beijing and anti-communist overseas Chinese.""

Mollie Saltskog, a senior intelligence analyst with the Soufan Group, notes, ""While significant and certainly useful for our intelligence efforts, one high-level defection will not drastically change our understanding or approach to China. In short, if true, this is potentially significant but not a game changer.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-counterintelligence-official-defector-wuhan,2021-06-18
Chip Roy's 'Know Debt' resolution would hang National Debt clocks in Congress,"Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) introduced a resolution Monday in the U.S. House of Representatives to keep lawmakers mindful of the rapidly ballooning federal debt.

Roy's ""Know Debt"" resolution would put debt clocks in the main hearing rooms of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget, ""in clear view of all the members.""

The resolution states, ""Members of Congress should keep the gross national debt in mind when debating legislation that would affect the Nation's fiscal situation."" It calls the national debt ""the greatest threat to the national security of the United States"" and notes that federal spending causes the nation to accrue ""at least $100 million in debt every hour.""

""Our republic has been racing towards fiscal self-destruction for decades now, and it is time that Congress confront its ruinous behavior. Last week, we crossed the threshold of $28 trillion in total debt and are currently on track to have spent $6 trillion in pandemic 'relief' in less than a year,"" Roy told TheBlaze. ""For perspective, $6 trillion is more than the United States spent in 4 years fighting World War II and close to the total national debt when I came first came to Congress as a staffer in 2003.""

He continued: ""If my colleagues and the leadership of this Congress want to continue mortgaging away our kids' and our country's future, having debt clocks in the House Budget and Appropriations Committee rooms is a simple way to confront them with the consequences of their recklessness every single day.""

Last week, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the national debt will eclipse 200% of gross domestic product in the next 30 years. In other words, by the year 2051, the debt owed by the United States government, which taxpayers are responsible for, will be more than twice the size of the entire value of the U.S. economy.

This current year, the federal budget deficit is estimated to be 10.3% of GDP, the second largest since 1945, during World War II. By the end of 2021, the debt is expected to be 102% of GDP, and that estimate does not take into account the $1.9 trillion coronavirus spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate over the weekend, nor proposals from congressional Democrats to pass an infrastructure bill.

Social Security, Medicare, and other mandatory spending continue to be the largest drivers of the overall debt. But the CBO expects annual budget deficits to increase as interest rates rise and the interest payments on the debt Congress must make to avoid default grow bigger each year.



As interest payments get bigger, they take up a larger portion of the federal budget, leaving less money for Congress to spend on popular programs or the military. The inevitable fact of continued spending is that Congress will be forced to raise taxes or borrow more money to pay the interest on the debt and avoid government default. Tax increases are unpopular, so it is more likely that Congress will attempt to borrow more money, which will in turn increase debt and make the interest payments even bigger.

""Debt that is high and rising as a percentage of GDP boosts federal and private borrowing costs, slows the growth of economic output, and increases interest payments abroad,"" the CBO warned. ""A growing debt burden could increase the risk of a fiscal crisis and higher inflation as well as undermine confidence in the U.S. dollar, making it more costly to finance public and private activity in international markets.""

Republican lawmakers have recently revived arguments against wasteful federal spending to criticize President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending bill, but most Republicans were silent as the federal debt exploded under President Donald Trump, despite the fact that Republicans held full control of the federal government for the first two years of his presidency.

The national debt is a bipartisan problem that for decades has lacked a bipartisan solution, with no relief in sight.

The current U.S. federal debt is $28 trillion and rising.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chip-roy-national-debt-clocks,2021-03-08
CNN's Chris Cuomo mocks Sen. Marco Rubio's Christian faith: 'Mr. Bible Boy' has a 'Bible quote for every moment',"CNN anchor Chris Cuomo openly mocked Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for his Christian faith, saying that ""Mr. Bible Boy"" has a ""Bible quote for every moment.""

Cuomo made the remarks after suggesting that conservatives — including Rubio, an outspoken Christian — are enabling President Donald Trump in his insistence that he won the 2020 presidential election.

As a result, Cuomo took Rubio to task and mocked his faith on Monday night.

What are the details?

The remarks came during the nightly handoff between Cuomo and CNN's Don Lemon, according to Fox News.



Leading up to the exchange in question, Lemon attempted an impersonation of President Donald Trump and mocked the president for his recently published phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

In the reported hour-long phone call, which was obtained and published by the Washington Post, Trump appeared to repeatedly urge the Georgia Secretary of State to ""find"" enough votes to help reverse the state's election results. President-elect Joe Biden was able to win the traditionally red state by less than 12,000 votes.

Lemon said that Raffensperger was a ""man of faith"" for not caving to the president's requests to continue looking into the results of the election.

""I just learned about it tonight as I was watching CNN, he is a man of faith and he is relying on his faith and that's why he could sit there and, just, very stoically say, 'I'm sorry, Mr. President, you're wrong,'"" Lemon said.

Lemon then mulled over how the president could still have any government allies after the leak — a sentiment with which Cuomo apparently agreed.

""Look, Trump, I believe, will be remembered as the worst,"" he began. ""We've never seen anybody abuse the office the way he has — not in our lifetime. But the people, those who remain, the Kevin McCarthys, the people in the House, the people in the Senate. ... The man he called Lyin' Ted, the man he called Little Marco, Mr. Bible Boy. You know, he's got a Bible quote for every moment, he just never speaks truth to power or acts on any of it in the interest of his own state or of this country.""

Lemon, Cuomo: Raffensperger Is a Man of Faith While 'Bible Boy' Marco Rubio Never Speaks the Truth: AIR.TV www.air.tv





What else?

Rubio has, indeed, shared a plethora of Bible quotes over the years and has caught the attention of leftists with his leaning on the Word.

In 2017, the Freedom from Religion Foundation took Rubio to task over his insistence on sharing the Gospel on Twitter.

In a statement on the Florida lawmaker's online behaviors, the group said, ""We have no issue with people reading and discussing the bible. The road to atheism is littered with bibles that have been read cover to cover. But it is not for the government in our secular republic to promote one religious book over others or to promote religion over nonreligion. Doing so violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.""

""By tying your government title to a social media page, you have intimately entwined your official position with the messages you send on that platform, creating the appearance of official endorsement,"" the group's statement added.

Anything else to know?

In November, Rubio appeared to stand by the president and his desire to take legal action against the election's voting results.

""At the core of our republic, its legitimacy comes from people's confidence in the elections,"" Rubio said at the time. ""Right now, you got half this country that has doubts about the veracity of this election.""

The Florida lawmaker also appeared to support the president's demand for a recount and said that both parties ""should be welcoming of having this process be open and transparent.""

""That's why the process that exists in the law, there's a process in the law that exists, after the election, before the results are certified,"" Rubio added. ""That process has to be allowed to move forward. Otherwise, we're going to have a result here that half the country will harbor significant doubts about.""

At the time of this reporting, Rubio has not indicated whether he will vote to reject the Electoral College's certification on Wednesday. On Friday, Rubio told reporters he would not address the issue until that day.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-cuomo-mocks-marco-rubio-faith,2021-01-05
Christian scholar tossed in Facebook jail for 'violence and incitement.' His crime? Objecting to Biden's transgender military policy.,"Facebook suspended a prominent Christian scholar for 24 hours earlier this week — for speaking out against transgender ideology and President Joe Biden lifting the ban on transgenders in the military — calling his words ""violence and incitement,"" PJ Media reported.

What are the details?

Robert A.J. Gagnon, who teaches New Testament Theology at Houston Baptist University, was banned Tuesday, the outlet said.

Gagnon also holds a Ph.D. in Pauline theology and sexuality from Princeton Theological Seminary and published ""The Bible and Homosexual Practice: Texts and Hermeneutics,"" PJ Media said.

The outlet said Gagnon posted a defense of his friend, Laurie Higgins, who got a seven-day ban for criticizing Biden's policy. Then Gagnon himself was thrown in Facebook's slammer for the following text, PJMedia said:

My friend Laurie Higgins has been suspended for 7 days, for making an accurate and witty satirical post, by left-wing FB overlords who seek to squash all dissent on the issue of transgenderism, no doubt emboldened by the Biden/Harris administration. There's nothing inaccurate about this post. Biden's lifting of Trump's transgender military ban will indeed put women military personnel in the awful position of having to shower with biological males. Trans-promoters aren't content with having men invade the domain of women's sports and shelters. ""Transgender"" ideology is indeed a pseudo-science, compelling people to reject basic biological facts. Promoters of ""transgenderism"" do indeed exhibit traits of a religious cult in their mind-numbing, science-denying conformity. The censoring and suspending of Laurie Higgins rather proves the point, doesn't it?

Gagnon said Facebook claimed his criticisms violated the social media giant's ""Community Standards on violence and incitement,"" the outlet reported.

What did Gagnon have to say?

""There was absolutely no incitement to violence on our part. We abhor violence done to any person,"" Gagnon told PJ Media on Tuesday. ""This is just a thinly veiled and pathetic excuse for censorship of any critical views toward trans-tyranny over our consciences, religion, and reason.""

He also noted that ""only one point of view is being allowed. [Former President Donald] Trump was not the great danger to the Republic. Left-wing canceling is,"" the outlet added.

Facebook, however, told Gagnon it has such ""standards"" in place ""to prevent and disrupt offline harm,"" PJ Media reported, adding that Facebook didn't respond to the outlet's request for comment.

Another professor steps in

Robert P. George, McCormick professor of jurisprudence and director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University, spoke out on Facebook against the platform's attack on Gagnon, the outlet said.



""Censorship on Facebook and some other social media has now gone way beyond the bounds of the reasonable, and is grossly violating representations about free speech made by CEOs and other officers of the major platforms,"" George wrote, according to PJ Media, calling Gagnon's suspension ""an egregious case.""

""We need robust free speech in what functions today as the public square. We need dialogue and debate. People need to be able to criticize and forcefully challenge idea — including ideas that are dominant in elite sectors of the culture and among people in the tech industry,"" George said, the outlet reported. ""What we do NOT need is the silencing of dissent. That is never a good idea. Once it starts and becomes normalized … things do not end well.""

George concluded, according to PJ Media: ""If anyone from FB is reading this comment, please, I beg you, reconsider the path down which you are going. It is not a good one. It is a healthy spirit of civil libertarianism we need; not dogmatism and the enforcement of groupthink.""

Anything else?

Gagnon had more to say Thursday:

On the bright side, he also noted Thursday that Higgins' ban had been lifted:

Bob Woodson says progressives hijacked civil rights movement,"Civil rights leader Bob Woodson railed against progressives who he accused of ""hijacking"" the 1960s movement that he was heavily involved in and helped coordinate national and local community revitalization programs.

""The Ingraham Angle"" guest host Raymond Arroyo kicked off the interview by playing a video clip of Vice President Kamala Harris speaking with actress and Democratic activist Kerry Washington.

Speaking about the Democrats' voting rights legislation that flopped, Harris said, ""How can we talk to other countries about human rights – autocracies – if we in our own country see an erosion of rights that have been invested in the American people?”

Woodson, 84, commented on how progressives — including the Biden administration — have used voting rights to attempt to appeal to black voters by marketing it as a civil rights issue.

""It's part of the whole process that progressives have hijacked the rich legacy of the civil rights movement and really using it as a bludgeon against the country,"" Woodson stated.

""And as long as they can keep black America in a constant state of agitation, anger and resentment, it means they can easily control them. In other words, they're willing to sacrifice black bodies for black votes, even as they hijack the civil rights movement,"" said the civil rights leader and founder of the Woodson Center, an organization self-described as having a mission to ""empower community-based leaders to promote solutions that reduce crime and violence, restore families, revitalize underserved communities, and assist in the creation of economic enterprise.""



""The biggest voter suppression is apathy,"" Woodson continued. ""In many of our cities like Washington, D.C., in mayoral elections and others, the turnout is under 6% in high crime areas because they live in a banana republic.""

""They're talking about voting rights as the most important issue to black America,"" he said. ""That's not true. It may be for some elites who profit from it, but every five minutes of every day a child is shot in America, and four times that number of those children are black.""



""I know one woman who lost all four of her sons to homicide before the age of 30; that's the crisis facing low-income black America, it is not voting rights,"" he added.

""Some of these same murders are occurring in cities that have been run by black politicians over the past 50 years,"" Woodson explained. ""If racism were the sole culprit, then why are blacks failing in institutions run by their own people? Why are they failing in political systems where all the control is in the hands of black politicians?""

""So the way you can avoid having to address this dilemma — what I call the 'enemy within the black community' — is what we must address,"" Woodson concluded. ""And concentrating on voting rights is a deflection away from that reality and prevents us from coming up with solutions that the Woodson Center has been promoting and will continue to promote. Restoration from within the community suffering from the problem.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/civil-rights-bob-woodson-biden-harris,2022-01-16
CNN anchor shreds Democrats for 'cynical and hypocritical' midterm strategy,"CNN anchor John Avlon shredded Democrats for ""meddling"" in Republican Party primary elections on Tuesday, saying the left-wing party was deploying a ""cynical and hypocritical"" strategy that could backfire in November.

In recent weeks, news reports have picked up on how Democratic-aligned groups are purchasing ads to support GOP candidates who have echoed former President Donald Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen in primary contests against more moderate or incumbent Republicans. Democrats appear to believe that if these so-called extreme candidates win primary elections, they will be easier for the left to beat in November's general elections.

In California, for example, Democrats have funded ads against Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), who voted to impeach Trump. In Colorado and Pennsylvania, Democrats have boosted the names of candidates perceived to be ""far-right"" because they have challenged the 2020 election results.



Avlon, a political analyst for CNN, covered these reports on his show ""Reality Check"" and ripped Democrats for hypocritically claiming that ""democracy"" is threatened by 2020 election skeptics while helping such candidates beat moderate Republicans.

“There’s a lot of righteous talk, especially from Democrats, about how we need to build the biggest possible coalition to defend democracy,” Avlon said. Noting that the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2020 were under attack from both the left and right, the CNN anchor slammed Democrats for trying to unseat these lawmakers in GOP primaries even as they have lifted them up as ""profiles in courage.""

He pointed to the latest example of Democrats meddling in Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, where incumbent Rep. Peter Meijer (R-Mich.), who voted to impeach Trump, is facing a primary challenge from John Gibbs, who is endorsed by Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is spending more than $400,000 to boost Gibbs' name ID in an attempt to oust Meijer.

“Handpicked by Trump to run for Congress, Gibbs called Trump ‘the greatest president’ and worked in Trump’s administration with Ben Carson,” the ad states. It also calls Gibbs ""too conservative for West Michigan,"" which is meant to make him more favorable among GOP primary voters.

Noting that Meijer's ""independent minded, common sense conservative principles perfectly fit the district once held by Gerald Ford,"" Avlon slammed the Democratic strategy as ""incredibly cynical and hypocritical.""



He said that Democratic attempts to ""kneecap"" certain ""honorable Republicans"" are a ""dangerous game"" that could backfire badly if the Trump-supported candidates go on to win in a wave election year that looks increasingly dire for Democrats.

""Some principles are bigger than partisan gain,"" Avlon said.

""Our democratic republic depends on people putting country over party. But our usually zero-sum partisan political system rewards the opposite, and in Washington, D.C., getting reelected is held in higher regard than trying to do the right thing,"" he concluded.

"CNN host confronts Jerry Nadler over impeachment, exposes his partisan hypocrisy","House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) was confronted Sunday over remarks he made about then-Bill Clinton's impending impeachment in 1998 that would prove his current political pursuit against President Donald Trump to be hypocritical.

In 1998, Nadler, being that he is a Democrat, opposed Clinton's impeachment. CNN host Dana Bash confronted Nadler on ""State of the Union"" with what he said at the time:

They must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of our major political parties, and largely opposed by the other.



Such an impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come.

After playing the clip, Bash asked how Nadler's current pursuit of impeachment is different, especially considering not a single Republican has indicated they will support impeachment.

""So, right now, you are moving forward with impeachment proceedings against a Republican president without support from even one congressional Republican,"" Bash asked. ""Is it fair to say that this impeachment, in your words from back then, will produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come?""

In response, Nadler completely ignored Bash's question, slamming the president instead.

""I think what puts bitterness and divisiveness into our politics is the conduct of the president, who calls — who questions the patriotism of people who don't agree with him, who calls political opponents human scum, who talks about the fake press, who derides the judiciary, who questions — who attacks all our democratic institutions,"" Nadler told Bash.

Bash shot back, ""So, you are willing to impeach the president with no Republican votes, correct?""

Nadler responded that Democrats will impeach the president ""on adequate and urgent grounds to defend our democratic republic."" He said it is up to Republican lawmakers ""whether they want to be patriots or partisans,"" implying that voting to impeach Trump is the patriotic decision.

Earlier in his interview, Nadler claimed the case that Democrats have against the president is so ""rock solid"" that any jury would return a guilty verdict ""in about three minutes flat.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-host-confronts-jerry-nadler-over-impeachment-exposes-his-partisan-hypocrisy,2019-12-08
"Leading conservative writer wrecks CNN: It's a 'progressive propaganda outlet,' not a news network","Conservatives often criticize CNN, but a leading intellectual on the right has just penned what might be the most brutal indictment of the network written to date.

In a 2,800 word essay, National Review editor Charles C. W. Cooke verbally demolished the cable channel, stating it suffers from an acute case of ""monomania"" and peddles ""glossy propaganda.""

Cooke reminisced how, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, CNN could assert its ""most trusted name in news"" slogan with some credibility as a respectable media organization that was ""careful and self-consciously non-partisan.""

""It could be sensationalist and intrusive at times, but it was sensationalist and intrusive in the way that the paparazzo is rather than in the way that protesters who bang drums in your face and insist that you give up gasoline are,"" he wrote.

Now, the author of ""The Conservatarian Manifesto"" argued, the network has been reduced to ""a peculiar and unlovely hybrid of progressive propaganda outlet, oleaginous media apologist, sexless cultural scold, and frenzied Donald Trump stalkerblog.""

Trump drove them crazy

What has happened to CNN? Cooke said its descent can be attributed to a mix of Trump Derangement Syndrome and an insatiable appetite for ratings.

In a compelling passage, the British-born American writer compares the front page of the network's website to that of the New York Times to illustrate how low CNN has fallen.

It is difficult to convey in words just what the candidacy and then presidency of Donald Trump have done to CNN, but one can gain a sense of the descent by comparing the network with a news organization that has largely maintained its sanity: the New York Times. On April 30 of this year, the front page of the Times featured stories on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the consequences of ISIS's rule of Raqqa; on the biggest measles outbreak of the 21st century; and on the Labor Department's decision to treat workers in the ""gig economy"" as contractors rather than as employees. The first column of CNN's homepage, by contrast, featured — in order: ""77 lies and falsehoods Mueller called out""; ""What's in the Mueller report? CNN breaks it down""; ""William Barr now has to try to defend the indefensible""; ""Barr gave his version of the report. Then we read it""; ""Democrats ramp up Trump financial probe, make new hire""; ""Prosecutors seek to block Stone from seeing unredacted portions of Mueller's report""; ""Analysis: Is Rosenstein the hero of the Russia probe? Or the villain?""; ""Biden: Congress would have 'no alternative' to impeachment if Trump blocked Mueller probe.""

Cooke also contrasted the Times' coverage of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's torture of military foes and Hong Kong protests with CNN's headlines on the same day.

More prominent than any of these stories on CNN.com were an ""analysis"" titled ""Trump's talking more than ever about men's looks""; an ""analysis"" of ""Donald Trump, plastic pusher""; an ""analysis"" under the headline ""This one word is a telltale sign Trump is being dishonest""; and a piece providing ""proof Obama was better for the stock market than Trump.""

Tough words for Jim Acosta, Don Lemon, and Brian Stelter

CNN personalities Jim Acosta, Don Lemon, and Brian Steler were not spared of criticism either.

Cooke wrote that Jim Acosta ""seems to believe that his job is to act as the loyal opposition to President Trump, serves as a good example of the tendency, prone as he is to showing up at press conferences and emoting until he inspires a reaction about which he can subsequently complain on Twitter.""

Worse than Acosta, according to the National Review editor, is Don Lemon. Cooke argued the host of ""CNN Tonight"" is a ""'news anchor' in the same sense as that in which Nick Saban is a referee."" He also detailed how Lemon interviewed Rev. Bill Owens on his show and when the African American pastor refused to agree with him that President Trump is a racist, the show's producers changed the chyron from ""African American faith leader"" to ""controversial pastor"" within minutes.

However, perhaps the harshest words were reserved for Brian Stelter, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" a program Cooke said primarily exists ""to whitewash the most egregious decisions it makes, to defend similar decisions made by its allies, and to explain why mirror-image behavior by Fox News represents a unique threat to the republic.""

Stelter calls himself a ""media critic,"" but Cooke suggested that a more fitting title for him would be ""media apologist.""

Combat veteran suspends congressional campaign after a heroin overdose: ‘I’m not going to hide from this’,"A Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives announced this week the suspension of his 2020 campaign following a heroin overdose and said that he will seek treatment for substance abuse.

""Today, I have suspended my campaign for the US House of Representatives and am seeking treatment for substance abuse disorder,"" now-former Arizona congressional candidate Chris Taylor said in a social media post on Monday. ""I will fully cooperate with local authorities on any matters arising from my recent relapse and overdose. Please respect the privacy of my wife and children as we deal with this situation.""

Taylor went on to express confusion at how he relapsed, saying that he had been sober for a long time previously.

""I'm not going to hide from this. I'm not ashamed of what happened,"" Taylor wrote. ""I wish to sincerely apologize to the amazing people who have supported me. I don't know what went wrong. I recently relapsed after having so many solid years in sobriety. I have to figure out where I went wrong.""

The Arizona Republic reported that Taylor overdosed on heroin last week. A family member found him unresponsive at his home. The Gila Herald reported that paramedics revived him at the scene using a dose of Narcan — a drug used to rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdoses.

The Republic also said that Taylor had struggled with opioid addiction since high school.



Taylor — a 33-year-old Army combat veteran and Safford, Arizona, city councilman — was one of a group of Republicans seeking the GOP nomination in the election for the Grand Canyon State's 1st Congressional District. The seat is currently held by Arizona Democrat Tom O'Halleran, who is serving his second House term.

In his Monday statement, Taylor also expressed optimism about the support he expects to receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs, his family, and his community in taking his next steps in the process of recovery.



""The only thing I can do is face this head on in complete humility and put one foot in front of the other so that I can get the help needed to be the father and husband that my family deserves,"" the statement concluded. ""I'm human and I have never pretended to be anything but. I know that through the Grace of my loving savior Jesus Christ I will be restored to full health and bounce back from this and be stronger than ever.""

In a campaign video posted in August, the candidate also recounted the difficulties of dealing with opioid addition as a result of abusing prescriptions when he came back from serving in Afghanistan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/combat-veteran-suspends-congressional-campaign-after-a-heroin-overdose,2020-02-25
"Concealed-carry hero takes out shooter who seriously wounded him, killed two at party: 'If I didn't have my gun, everyone in the house would have died'","A bullet tore through Raul Mendez's left eye amid a deadly rampage at a Fourth of July party in Arizona this summer, covering his face with blood and rendering him unconscious.

But Mendez told Fox News that with God's help, he soon opened his eyes amid screaming from other partygoers — and then he got up, pulled out his concealed handgun, and fatally shot the suspect before he could kill or wound any more people.

""If I didn't have my gun, everyone in the house would have died,"" Mendez said in a National Rifle Association video about the incident. ""The news vans would've been front and center. But because I did, you never even heard about it.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

What are the details?

On the evening of July 3, Mendez, his two daughters, and his wife — who was seven months pregnant — gathered with friends and other families at a home in the city of Surprise for a party featuring food and fireworks, Fox News said.

A neighbor of the man hosting the party had joined the festivities despite not being close friends with anyone present, Mendez told the cable network — and police later identified that neighbor as 46-year-old Jason Hunt, saying he opened fire unprovoked at the gathering, according to the Arizona Republic.



Mendez told Fox News that Hunt and other party attendees were eating in the kitchen when Hunt pulled out a gun and began firing, sending everyone fleeing.

""My back was turned,"" Mendez recounted to the cable network. ""I heard the first gunshot, and that's what made me kind of turn my head. ... But by the time I even was able to look and see what was going on, a bullet already had struck the side of my face.""

Mendez was shot in front of his wife, who rushed to his side and believed he was dead due to the amount of blood covering his face, Fox News noted.

She then grabbed their two daughters and put them into a room deeper in the house, barricading them and other children inside, the cable network said.

""She barricaded the door with the dresser. There were three other children in there, not including my two daughters. A total of five kids. She … throws them in the closet, throws clothes over them. Tells them, ‘Be quiet. Do not make a peep if you hear loud noises in this room,’"" Mendez told Fox News in regard to his wife's actions.

Mendez said two other women began fighting the suspect and were screaming for Mendez, as they knew he had a concealed weapon, the cable network explained.

""By the glory of God or the adrenaline and just everything — just the will to live and the will to protect my family — I was able to hear those pleas, those yells for help,"" Mendez recalled to Fox News. ""I heard my name. And I was able to get up.""

With that, Mendez pulled out his own gun and shot the suspect four times in the chest, the cable network said.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Two of Mendez’s friends — Conrradito Ochoa Navarro, 41, and Carl Dinora, 38 — were killed, while four others, including Mendez, were seriously wounded, Fox News noted.

Police said Mendez and others were acting in self-defense and in defense of innocent individuals, the cable network said, citing a KTAR-TV report.

No motive has been announced in the case, Fox News said, adding that the Sunrise police department didn't immediately respond to the cable network's requests for case updates.

What happened afterward?

Besides losing his left eye and his sense of smell, Mendez also suffered a fractured jaw and a torn eardrum, Fox News said, adding that he spent a week in the hospital and is scheduled for more surgeries.

But Mendez also is speaking out about the importance of the Second Amendment and how law-abiding, armed Americans can help stop shootings before they claim more lives, the cable network said.

""This world is unpredictable. And honestly, at the end of the day, the people that want to ban guns, they're only banning it from good people, not criminals,"" he told Fox News. ""Because again, there [are] no gun laws for criminals.""

What's more, Mendez has since purchased two additional handguns for his family members to train with, saying they are ""more ready to confront [evil] with equal force now than ever,"" Fox News noted.

Mendez — a lifetime NRA member — lauded the Second Amendment and denounced the media for not covering his story as part of the NRA video, the cable network said.

Conservatives sound off after Trump says FBI raided Mar-A-Lago,"Republican politicians and conservative commentators sounded off on Monday after former President Donald Trump released a statement saying that the FBI had raided Mar-A-Lago.

""The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime's political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves. Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared in a tweet.

""This is the act of a dictator of a Banana Republic. Republicans NEVER did this to Clinton, although perhaps we should have. With Joe & Hunter Biden paying zero consequence for his actions. This is shameful and MUST STOP. We don’t do this in America. Way over the line,"" Glenn Beck tweeted.

""In third world countries and banana republics they prosecute the former presidents/leaders and their staff. Right now, we look beneath them. We are in a race to the bottom,"" GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted.

""Using government power to persecute political opponents is something we have seen many times from 3rd world Marxist dictatorships,"" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida tweeted. ""But never before in America.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy declared that when Republicans regain the majority in the chamber, they will carry out ""immediate oversight"" of the Justice Department. ""Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar,"" McCarthy said in the statement.

Trump, who is widely expected to run for president again, issued a statement on Monday in which he said that, ""my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.""

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024 ... and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the incoming Midterm Elections. Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/conservatives-react-trump-fbi-raid,2022-08-09
Sen. Cotton blasts New York Times' Independence Day story saying the US flag is a 'divisive symbol',"The New York Times posted a news story over the Independence Day weekend about the divisiveness of the United States flag, sharing stories of how displaying the flag has become a symbol of divisive political affiliation.

On ""Fox & Friends"" Monday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) went after the paper for running a story with rhetoric that indoctrinates Americans to believe we should be ashamed of the symbols of ""our heritage and our founding principles.""



What did the Times say?

The Times story posted Saturday, ""A Fourth of July Symbol of Unity That May No Longer Unite,"" told the stories people who perceived the flag is closely affiliated with Trump supporters and how that impacted their businesses, as well as their friendships and family relationships.

The flag, the Times said, has had several meanings over the last nearly 250 years.

""Raised at Iwo Jima, it was a symbol of victory,"" the paper noted. ""Lit on fire, it became a searing image of the protests against the Vietnam War. Ribboned around the twin towers on commemorative Sept. 11 lapel pins, it is a reminder of the threats against a delicate democracy.""

Though politicians have long wrapped themselves in the flag, there appears to be a change looming, the Times reported:

Today, flying the flag from the back of a pickup truck or over a lawn is increasingly seen as a clue, albeit an imperfect one, to a person's political affiliation in a deeply divided nation.



Supporters of former President Donald J. Trump have embraced the flag so fervently — at his rallies, across conservative media and even during the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol — that many liberals ... worry that the left has all but ceded the national emblem to the right.



What was once a unifying symbol — there is a star on it for each state, after all — is now alienating to some, its stripes now fault lines between people who kneel while “The Star-Spangled Banner"" plays and those for whom not pledging allegiance is an affront.

The division, according to the Times, has made Independence Day celebrations ""another cleft in a country that seems no longer quite so indivisible, under a flag threatening to fray.""

What did Cotton say?

Monday morning, Sen. Cotton went after left-wing activism that we have allowed to ""march through our cultural institutions"" and ""indoctrinate our kids,"" which is exactly what the Times story reflected.

""Over the weekend, you saw the New York Times running a long story about how the flag, for goodness sake, is now a divisive symbol for many Americans,"" Cotton said. ""Look, we should be proud of our heritage and our founding principles.""

""Two hundred and forty-five years ago this weekend, our Founding Fathers declared our independence not just because of local grievances over taxes or the quartering of soldiers, but because they wanted to found a new republic dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, as Abraham Lincoln said at the Gettysburg Address,"" he continued.

""Now, we haven't always achieved that practice, but our history has been one of continuingly struggling to realize those ideals,"" the senator said. ""That's exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King said in his 'I Have a Dream' speech in which he explicitly and repeatedly invoked the declaration and said that our work is the full realization of America's founding principles. We should teach our children, whether it's in the schools or in our movies and television or our comic books, to be proud of and celebrate America's traditions.""

Republicans push resolution that calls critical race theory a 'threat' to the US,"A group of House Republicans is backing a resolution that calls critical race theory a ""Marxist ideology"" and a ""threat"" the the country.

""CRT proponents cannot be allowed to conceal the Marxian foundations of their racist ideology. This resolution allows Congress to do what has always been essential to defeating Marxism — calling it what it is and exposing those who consort with it,” GOP Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina noted, according to the Daily Caller.

Bishop introduced the resolution, which is cosponsored by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Randy Weber of Texas, Greg Steube of Florida, Bob Good of Virginia, Jim Banks of Indiana, and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

According to a copy of the resolution posted by the outlet, the text of the measure would declare that the House ""recognizes critical race theory and its derivatives as a form of Marxist ideology"" and ""recognizes that critical race theory exists in direct opposition to the founding ideals, way of life, and form of government of the United States.""



The resolution also states the the House ""declares that, as a Marxist ideology, critical race theory poses a significant threat to the United States Republic, its citizens, and the free people of the world rising to the degree of a clear and present danger to the Republic, its citizens, and the States, its allies, and the good and happiness of mankind.""



The measure will likely fail to make any headway in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.

Bishop has previously pushed legislation to prohibit the federal government from supplying funds to any entity that teaches concepts such as the idea that America is a ""fundamentally racist"" nation or that a person is ""inherently racist or oppressive"" because of their race. He has also pushed legislation to bar the military from promoting such concepts.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/critical-race-theory-marxist-resolution,2022-07-30
Damning US intelligence says researchers at Wuhan lab hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms in fall 2019,"Three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough with COVID-like symptoms in November 2019 that they required hospitalization, according to a damning American intelligence report.

The intelligence, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, adds weight to the Wuhan lab leak theory, which suggests the COVID-19 pandemic originated inside China's only Biosafety level-4 laboratory.

What are the details?

The intelligence is particularly significant because it suggests COVID-19 was spreading in China much earlier than China has admitted. China's communist government traced patient-zero to a man who became sick on Dec. 8. But if researchers at the Wuhan lab were hospitalized one month prior, the virus was likely spreading even earlier than previously believed.

One official familiar with the intelligence described it as ""of exquisite quality.""

""The information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn't tell you was exactly why they got sick,"" the official told the Journal.

Another official told the Journal that while the intelligence was potentially significant, it needed further corroboration to be definitive.

The intelligence corroborates a fact sheet released by the State Department in the final days of the Trump administration, which cited classified intelligence and suggested COVID-19 may have escaped from the Wuhan lab via infected researchers.



That report said, ""U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and seasonal illnesses.""

How did China respond?

China's Foreign Ministry bucked the intelligence, and continued to suggest COVID-19 originated in the United States.

""The U.S. continues to hype the lab leak theory,"" the foreign ministry told the Journal. ""Is it actually concerned about tracing the source or trying to divert attention?""

China's communist government has infamously refused transparency with investigations surrounding the pandemic's origins.

""The Wuhan Institute hasn't shared raw data, safety logs and lab records on its extensive work with coronaviruses in bats, which many consider the most likely source of the virus,"" the Journal noted.

China has pointed to wet markets in Wuhan as the source of the pandemic.

What did the US government say?

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council reiterated concerns about the pandemic's origins, but declined to comment further.

""We continue to have serious questions about the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, including its origins within the People's Republic of China,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We're not going to make pronouncements that prejudge an ongoing WHO study into the source of SARS-CoV-2. As a matter of policy we never comment on intelligence issues.""

Anything else?

The Wuhan lab leak theory has been widely denounced as a conspiracy theory despite a lack of evidence disproving the possibility.

In fact, aside from equally plausible origination theories, only the World Health Organization has said it was ""extremely unlikely"" COVID-19 came from the laboratory. But their conclusion came after a rushed investigation in which access to critical data was tightly controlled by Chinese authorities.

Indeed, 18 high-profile scientists published a letter this month calling for more investigations into the lab leak theory, saying, ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable.""

The group even responded to the WHO's conclusion, which they rebuked because, as they explained, the WHO did not give the Wuhan lab leak theory ""balanced consideration,"" writing, ""Only 4 of the 313 pages of the report and its annexes addressed the possibility of a laboratory accident.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical adviser, also said this month that he is no longer convinced COVID-19 originated naturally.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/damning-us-intelligence-wuhan-lab-covid-symptoms,2021-05-24
Defiant Trump campaign insists they can still take Arizona and Nevada to win re-election,"After election odds swung heavily in Democratic nominee Joe Biden's favor overnight as Wisconsin and Michigan shifted blue, the Trump campaign insisted Wednesday morning they are still on pace to win re-election by notching surprise wins in Arizona and Nevada.

What are the details?

President Trump is in a ""very, very, very good position"" to win re-election, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters early Wednesday on a campaign call, according to the New York Post.

""We are confident in our pathway. We are confident in our math. We said all along we are viewing some of these races as math equations,"" he added. ""If we count all legal ballots, the president wins.""

Politico White House reporter Gabby Orr relayed some of the campaign's touted statistics that show Trump narrowly pulling ahead in Arizona and Nevada and maintaining Pennsylvania.

What else?

The campaign's insistence was somewhat of a surprise since Arizona was called for Biden by Fox News on Tuesday night and then later Wednesday morning by the Associated Press. As for Nevada, Trump currently trails Biden narrowly, and it is presumed that the remaining absentee votes left to be counted will favor the former vice president.

Nevertheless, the campaign said their math is forecasting late-breaking wins in both states. Such a feat would be a major boost to Trump's re-election odds.



""[In Arizona], we know that a final batch of mail-in ballots is being counted. We know that these ballots are counted sequentially, meaning that late-arriving votes or ballots cast closest to Election Day are the ones being counted now. We know and expect that about a half-million votes are left to be counted,"" Stepien said. ""And based on the math that we have been seeing as these late-arriving ballots are counted, anywhere from two-thirds to 70 percent of these votes are coming to the president, that math adds up to a margin of around 30,000 in the president's favor.""

The Arizona Republic agreed with the Trump campaign's claims Wednesday, estimating that about 600,000 ballots were left to be counted in the state. Just as well, FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver noted in Arizona, ""mail ballots that arrived late in the process are considerably more [Republican] by party registration than the ones that arrived earlier.""

According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign plans to dispatch a team to Arizona to monitor the state's vote count after unverified reports have surfaced claiming ballots filled in with Sharpie pens in pro-Trump counties may have not been counted.

Anything else?

Stepien predicted that in Nevada, like Arizona, ""late-breaking mail helps us"" and ""we believe that once all legal ballots are counted in Nevada, the president wins Nevada, we believe by a margin of 5,500 votes.""

Mail ballots received on Election Day or after are the bulk of what remains to be counted in Nevada. It remain to be seen if that vote will break for Trump or Biden.

Either way, we won't know until Thursday.

If Trump were to somehow win Arizona and Nevada and hang on in Pennsylvania and Georgia, he would be in line to win the election. If Georgia goes for Biden in that scenario, there would be — you guessed it — an electoral tie.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/defiant-trump-campaign-arizona-nevada,2020-11-04
Defund-the-police advocate running for Senate calls Rand Paul's campaign ad 'dangerous',"Despite losing in the Democrat Senate primary in 2020, defund-the-police advocate and former Kentucky state Rep. Charles Booker won his party's nomination in May and is presently running against Republican Sen. Rand Paul in the November election. On Tuesday, Booker accused Paul of employing ""dangerous and dishonest rhetoric"" in a new campaign ad posted to social media earlier this week. The ad denounced by Booker highlights ties between the Democrat's campaign and persons who have allegedly committed or celebrated political violence.

The Republican Party of Kentucky rallied behind Paul and his message, stating on Monday, ""Charles Booker and his far-left allies espouse dangerous views and tactics. ... It is beyond time for him and his supporters to apologize for joking about the serious attack that left Senator Paul with six broken ribs.""



Sen. Paul's ad and Democrat violence

The Paul campaign ad stated that ""the Charles Booker campaign has repeatedly embraced people who celebrate and glorify the violent attacks against Senator Paul.""

The ad alleged that Kevin Mays, a Brooker campaign volunteer, tweeted a ""graphic doctored image"" of Paul with a broken neck and published the senator's home address.

The ad also claimed that Amy Jean, who has been featured in at least one Brooker campaign ad, expressed her belief that the man who sent Paul to the emergency room was a ""hero"" whom she often thought about.

In 2017, Amy Jean's ""hero,"" Rene Boucher, assaulted Paul, breaking the senator's ribs and leaving Paul with a ""significant injury"" that he now suffers ""lifelong symptoms from."" Boucher pled guilty to assault charges.

In the same year, Paul was among those who survived a shooting in which Republicans practicing for a charity baseball game were targeted. The leftist gunman, James Hodgkinson, was a supporter of Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). He wounded Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and three others.

In 2020, an enraged mob of BLM activists attacked Paul and his wife, Kelley Ashby Paul, as they attempted to return to their hotel after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention. The mob that swarmed the Pauls chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" and ""Say her name, Breonna Taylor.""



Paul, endorsed by the Kentucky Fraternal Order of Police this week, later noted that he was the author of the federal legislation to prohibit police officers from using no-knock warrants like the one that led to the shooting of Taylor. ""The irony is lost on these idiots that they're trying to kill the person who's actually trying to get rid of no-knock raids.""

Republican Sen. Rand Paul swarmed by protesters after Trump speech youtu.be

After the ordeal, Paul told ""Fox and Friends,"" ""We can't let our cities be taken over by these marauders and thugs.""

The Paul campaign's ad pointed out that Charles Booker campaigned with accused assassin Quintez Brown, the BLM activist who was charged earlier this year with the attempted assassination of Louisville, Kentucky, mayoral candidate Craig Greenberg. According to police, Brown fired multiple shots at Greenberg as the mayoral candidate exited his campaign headquarters. One bullet grazed Greenberg's shirt.

The Paul campaign ad concluded by saying, ""It's clear: Charles Booker doesn't believe in civil discourse, only violence.""

Booker's response

Booker responded to the ad, suggesting it ""grossly lies about me and, in a very sinister way, attacks several Kentucky citizens by name.""

He added, ""Neither I, nor my campaign, have ever endorsed violence against any political candidate. It is despicable for Rand Paul to even insinuate that.""

In an advertisement entitled ""Pain of our Past"" posted to YouTube on June 1, Charles Booker put a noose around his neck and insinuated that a vote for Paul was tantamount to a tightening of the noose.

Booker alluded to the historic use of lynching as a ""tool of terror"" and as a means of killing ""hopes of freedom"" and stated that Paul stands to ""forever hold us back."" The Hill reported that in the ad, after Booker criticized Paul, he said, ""The choice couldn't be clearer,"" at which time the ""sounds of a tightening rope can be heard.""

Pain of our Past youtu.be

In criticizing the Paul campaign's Monday ad, Booker claimed that ""Rand Paul has used racially charged dog whistles throughout his campaign to paint a violent picture of me.""

Notwithstanding Booker's recent and past accusations that Paul is racist, the AP reported that during his Senate tenure, Paul has frequently visited mostly black neighborhoods, supporting criminal justice reforms, anti-violence efforts, and education initiatives.

Booker, critical of the rhetoric employed by Paul's campaign, previously stated, ""Rand Paul has built a career out of weaponizing hate and hiding his hand."" He suggested further that Paul was a ""privileged, spoiled brat.""

Defunding the police

When Booker announced his intention to run again last year, Paul said he didn't think that ""defunding the police and forcing taxpayers to pay for reparations will be very popular in Kentucky.""

J. McCauley Brown, chair of the Kentucky Republican Party, concurred, suggesting, ""Charles Booker's extremist agenda has zero chance with Kentucky voters. He supports the radical socialist policies of D.C. Democrats like defunding the police, the Green New Deal and forcing taxpayers to pay for reparations.""

Universal basic income and so-called racial justice are two pushes that occupy much of Booker's focus. The latter is what prompted him to take part in numerous identitarian Marxist protests. A spokesman for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Booker during his failed 2020 campaign, lauded Booker for showing up at BLM protests and for ""being engaged in the movement for Black lives.""

Booker told the Root that he supported defunding the police and that the legal system was ""woven with racism."" According to Booker, police saw black Americans as deadly weapons, not as human beings. He proposed reallocating police funding to other services in the hope bolstering ""public safety.""

Earlier this year, Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy indicated Paul led Booker in the polls by 15 points.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/defund-the-police-advocate-running-for-senate-calls-sen-rand-pauls-campaign-ad-dangerous,2022-10-05
Democratic LA city councilman absolutely roasted after botching Pledge of Allegiance at meeting,"Democratic Los Angeles City Councilman Kevin de León was supposed to lead the council in the Pledge of Allegiance on Tuesday but was unable to complete it, KCBS-TV reported.

The 54-year-old managed to get through the first part: ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.""

But then problems began:

On his first try after completing the first phrase through ""the United States of America,"" there was a long, uncomfortable pause until he added a newfangled word that sounded like ""under visible.""

Then he restarted the pledge, and there was still a long pause in the same spot. You could tell de León was flustered as he let out a quiet, ""Oh boy.""

He then plowed ahead — leaving out ""and to the republic"" — and then reciting the rest of it, after which he exhaled a frustrated huff.

How did folks react?

Reactions were a mixed bag on Twitter, with many folks blasting the councilman and others pushing back by saying the pledge isn't that important:

""Sad and pathetic,"" one commenter said. ""It should be funny, but in all honesty it's tragic and disgusting how these people that work for the government of the United States of America don't even know the simple Pledge of Allegiance. It should serve as indicator of how ill prepared he is for his duty.""

""Meh,"" someone noted. ""I forgot most of that hollow propaganda after reciting it every school day for 13 years, and I don't feel bad about it.""

""How disgraceful!"" another commenter exclaimed. ""That you could actually be an adult male living in the United States of America, and not even know the simple words to the Pledge of Allegiance. What rock has this slimeball been under? I can just imagine what the other council members are like!""

""The pledge is weird and fascist,"" another user said.

De León later posted a tweet acknowledging his faux pas:

""Embarrassing, am I right?"" he noted. ""If you or someone you know got a good laugh out of my own 'unique' version of the pledge of allegiance, consider donating a few $ to https://nouswithoutyou.la. They're doing amazing work in CD 14 to provide food security for undocumented immigrants.""

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin calls for censure of President Trump,"Moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) on Monday called for the upper chamber to censure President Donald Trump over the allegations House Democrats made against the president in the impeachment trial, saying he believes a partisan impeachment would further divide the country and arguing that the condemnation of President Trump's alleged actions (without removal from office) would have bipartisan support.

Manchin has not disclosed how he plans to vote on the articles of impeachment, slated for Wednesday.

What are the details?

""The purpose of impeachment is not to punish the president, but to protect the public,"" Manchin argued from the Senate floor. ""The ultimate question is not whether the president's conduct warrants his removal from office, but whether our nation is better served by his removal by the Senate now — with impeachment — or by the decision the voters will make in November.""



""Never before in the history of our Republic has there been a purely partisan impeachment vote of a president,"" the West Virginia Democrat continued. ""Removing this president at this time would not only further divide our deeply divided nation, but also further poison our toxic political atmosphere.""

Sen. Manchin explained, ""I see no path to the 67 votes required to impeach President Trump, and haven't since this trial started. However, I do believe a bipartisan majority of this body would vote to censure President Trump for his actions.""

He reasoned, ""Censure would allow this body to unite across party lines, and as an equal branch of government, to formally denounce the president's actions and hold him accountable.""

""His behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate, and censure would allow a bipartisan statement condemning his unacceptable behavior in the strongest terms,"" Manchin added. ""History will judge the Senate for how we have handled this solemn constitutional duty, and without bipartisan action



The resolution proposed by Sen. Manchin states that President Trump used his office ""to attempt to compel a foreign nation to interfere with domestic political affairs for his own personal benefit,"" and ""wrongfully enlisted his personal lawyers to investigate a domestic political rival by meddling in formal diplomatic relations in a manner that is inconsistent with our established National Security Strategy.""

It further states that the president ""hindered the thorough investigation of related documents and prohibited Congress and the American people from hearing testimony by first-hand witnesses with direct knowledge of his conduct.""



Anything else?

There appears to be little appetite from Senate Republicans or Democrats for Manchin's motion to censure President Trump.

The Hill reported that ""Manchin's proposal has received little traction among Senate Republicans who control the schedule, but it could gain the support of a handful of Republicans who have expressed concerns over Trump's actions,"" namely Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), and Mitt Romney (Utah).

According to The Washington Post, ""several Democrats also said they were unsold on censure, calling it a punishment well short of what Trump deserves.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-sen-joe-manchin-calls-for-censure-of-president-trump,2020-02-04
VIDEO: Democratic pundit says Republican governor and legislature 'should be shot',"In an interview on a local PBS station, Democratic pundit Chris Herstam said the state's Republican governor and legislature ""should be shot"" if they refuse to modify Arizona's election processes.

""If they don't change the state statute to allow for an all-mail election system for the primary and general election this year, they should be shot, because that's the only common sense thing to do,"" Herstam, a former state lawmaker and university regent, said on the ""Arizona Horizon"" show.

The remarks prompted a swift backlash from state lawmakers and even U.S. congressional leaders.

Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who himself was shot by a Bernie Sanders supporter at a 2017 congressional softball game, described Herstam's comments as ""dangerous and disgraceful.""

""Hard to believe someone would call for violence against officials they disagree with during this crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""But that's what this columnist did—saying the AZ Gov & Legislators 'should be shot' if he doesn't get his way.""

""There must be accountability,"" Scalise added.

According to the Arizona Republic, state Rep. Daniel Hernandez, a Tucson area Democrat who survived the attempted assassination of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, blasted the pundits comments as inciting violence.

'I made hyperbolic and inappropriate statements'

Herstam apologized following a flurry of denunciations from political observers around the country and his home state.

""In an effort to make a point about the important of all-mail voting this week in light of COVID-19, I made hyperbolic and inappropriate statements that have no place in political discourse. I apologize for making them,"" he wrote on Friday morning.

Herstam made the comments while calling for the state's various elections departments to move to a vote-by-mail system in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Voters are scheduled to vote on Tuesday in the state's Democratic primary, but some activists are calling local counties to adopt all-mail ballots as alternatives as a back-up plan for an upcoming election in August and November's general election.

Republican lawmakers have pushed back on the proposal, arguing it would disenfranchise communities who live in areas where mail service is unreliable or unavailable.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic_pundit_arizona_shot_herstam,2020-03-21
"Democrats actually blocked a vote to support Iranian protesters and condemn Iran for killing 1,500 of its own people","Democrats in the House of Representatives blocked a vote Tuesday afternoon aimed at condemning the Iranian government and supporting Iranian citizens protesting against the oppressive regime.

What are the details?

A vote on the resolution was officially blocked when Democratic lawmakers present in the chamber voted unanimously to advance the previous question.

The resolution, which had been introduced by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) earlier in the week, was designed to send a message to the government of Iran following its killing of at least 1,500 Iranian citizens during protests in the country in November and its missile strike on a Ukrainian passenger jet last week, which killed all 176 people on board.

In addition, the resolution condemned Iran for ""repeatedly lying to its people and to the world about its responsibility"" in downing the passenger jet, and called on the government of Iran to ""refrain from the use of violence"" and respect the ""freedom and human rights"" of protesters in the country.

McCarthy called the move to block a vote a ""disappointment"" on Twitter, and argued that ""this is not the time for partisan politics.""

Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Miss.) joined McCarthy in denouncing the move on Twitter, arguing, ""supporting a resolution so basic shouldn't be this difficult. The House is better than this.""

McCarthy had previously said in announcing the resolution that ""the world is watching, and the people of Iran need to know that they are not alone in this pivotal moment.""

Anything else?

The blocked resolution comes only days after the Democrat-led House passed a resolution to limit President Trump's authority to use further military force against Iran. Congressional Democrats were upset after Trump approved a rocket strike to kill Iranian terrorist military leader Qassem Soleimani without notifying Congress.

In the wake of Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted out support for Iranians protesting the oppressive regime, saying, ""We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.""

It was reported that Iranian citizens again flooded the streets to protest their government after its leaders admitted to downing Ukrainian Arlines Flight 752.

Videos posted to social media showed the protesters chanting ""death to the Islamic Republic"" and ""Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is also a murderer"" as they called for Ayatollah Khamenei to step down as the supreme leader of Iran.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-block-vote-supporting-iranian-protesters,2020-01-15
Democrats freak out over leaked video showing GOP lawmakers praising Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema,"Progressive pundits appear furious and are making renewed calls to abolish the Senate filibuster after video was leaked of Republican lawmakers telling conservative activists to praise moderate Democratic senators.

Democratic activist Lauren Windsor on Friday posted a video of Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) telling a group of conservatives that the Senate filibuster is preventing President Joe Biden from accomplishing the most radical parts of his progressive agenda. In the video, he credits Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) with preserving the filibuster.

""The reality is they're pushing as far as they can,"" Biggs said of the Democrats. ""Fortunately for us, the filibuster is still in effect in the Senate. Without that we would be dead meat.""

""Thank goodness for Sinema and Joe Manchin,"" he added, praising the two Democrats in the Senate who have consistently opposed calls from progressive activists to abolish the filibuster.

Another Republican who speaks in the video, Rep. Bryon Donalds (R-Fla.), urged the conservative audience to call Manchin and Sinema's offices in Washington, D.C., to thank them for standing firm.

""All of you in this room, people at home on Zoom, let me tell you right now, if you want to do one thing to keep the republic afloat, call Joe Manchin's office, call Kyrsten Sinema's office,"" Donalds said.

The 60-vote majority required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate has acted as a significant obstacle to Biden's agenda. The most popular legislation among the progressive left on issues such as election reform, the climate, and so-called ""human"" infrastructure like free college tuition, government-funded child care, and a national paid leave program, has all been defeated by filibuster threats from the Republican minority.

Democratic activists and pundits have over the course of several months expressed their fury with Manchin and Sinema, and many such critics seized on the leaked video to shame the moderate senators.

""Republicans were caught on video thanking Manchin & Sinema for blocking Dem legislation. Let's make this viral and make it clear we're sick and tired of Manchin & Sinema's obstruction,"" Scott Dworkin, the founder of an anti-Trump super PAC that supports progressive candidates and causes, said.

MSNBC host Joy Reid echoed Dworkin's sentiments, asking if Manchin and Sinema are ""content to play this role in the fall of our democracy.""

""I sure hope @SenatorSinema and @Sen_JoeManchin watch this video and reconsider their positions on the filibuster for civil rights bills,"" added Grant Stern, the executive editor of Occupy Democrats.

""Wow, when the GOP are using you for stooges and laughing behind your backs @SenatorSinema and @Sen_JoeManchin , it might be time to join your own party,"" Tennessee State Rep. Gloria Johnson said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-freak-out-video-gop-praise-manchin-sinema,2021-07-09
Democratic leader admits they expect to 'lose some' members in 'divisive' impeachment vote,"House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said on a TV appearance on Friday that he expects to lose Democratic members when the House votes on whether to impeach President Donald Trump.

CNN anchor John Berman asked Clyburn how many House Democrats he expects to lose while noting that he knows of at least two Democratic representatives who will not be voting to impeach the president.

""Well, we do expect to lose some, and that's why I said it's a conscience vote and it's with their constituents. We have a very diverse caucus,"" the veteran lawmaker responded.



Not whipping 'divisive' impeachment votes

Clyburn added that his office does not plan to whip up impeachment votes and acknowledged the issue is dividing House members and Americans.

""I think that when it comes to something so divisive as impeachment, we have to leave members up to their own consciences, their own constituents, and what they think is in the best interest of their love for country,"" he said.

He added, ""So, I think it would be a bit unseemly for us to go out whipping up a vote on something like this. This is too serious, this is too much about preserving this great Republic.""

Bragged about having the votes to impeach Trump in June

As Townhall noted, Clyburn's tone was significantly different this week when compared to his previous comments during an interview with CNN host Jake Tapper in June where he boasted—before the Ukraine scandal broke—that Democrats had the votes to impeach Trump and could do so when needed.

""All it takes is 218 votes to effectively impeach the president,"" Clyburn told Tapper at the time. ""What Nancy Pelosi is trying to do and the rest of us in the House of Representatives is to develop a process by which we can efficiently move on this issue so that when we get to a vote it would be something that she calls 'iron clad,' I call 'effective.' And that's why we're trying to take our time and do this right.""

Clyburn's acknowledgment this week that Democratic leaders will likely lose members of their caucus in an impeachment vote comes as several surveys have shown that swing state voters are unimpressed by the case that Democrats made against Trump. TheBlaze reported on Tuesday that the Washington Post's polling experts analyzed a dozen polls conducted in eight battleground states and found that 51 percent of voters are opposed to impeachment and 44 percent support the effort.

""Battleground state polls show a more negative reaction to the impeachment inquiry, signaling more risk to Democrats and potential benefit for Trump,"" the researchers noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats_expect_to_lose_votes_impeachment_clyburn,2019-12-07
Breaking: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein hands in his resignation,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has handed in his resignation to President Donald Trump, according to the Washington Post.

The resignation letter says that he will leave the office effective May 11.

Rosenstein praised the president in his letter of resignation, first for his sense of humor, and second for the goals he set forth in his inaugural address.

""We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls,"" said Rosenstein.

""We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle,"" he continued.

Rosenstein became the focus of much ire after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and collusion with the Trump campaign. The oversight fell to Rosenstein, and many were angered that he did not dismiss the investigation.

Later a report said that he had offered to record the president surreptitiously in support of an effort to oust him from office, which he denied vehemently.

The accusation led the president to imply during a rally in September that he was going to fire Rosenstein and others in the Department of Justice.

""We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first,"" Rosenstein concluded in the resignation letter.

"'The prayers of millions have been answered': Following SCOTUS abortion ruling, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says the state 'will work to expand pro-life protections'","Following the release of a Supreme Court ruling that struck downRoe v. Wade, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a message declaring that the Sunshine State will seek to increase ""pro-life protections.""

""The prayers of millions have been answered. For nearly fifty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has prohibited virtually any meaningful pro-life protection, but this was not grounded in the text, history or structure of the Constitution. By properly interpreting the Constitution, the Dobbs majority has restored the people's role in our republic and a sense of hope that every life counts,"" the Republican governor noted in the statement.

""Florida will continue to defend its recently-enacted pro-life reforms against state court challenges, will work to expand pro-life protections, and will stand for life by promoting adoption, foster care and child welfare,"" the governor's post said.

A state law slated to take effect on July 1 would prohibit physicians from performing abortions if the gestational age of the unborn child is more than 15 weeks, though the measure does include several exceptions to the ban. The law has been challenged in court, according to Politico.

Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, a Republican, is calling for an emergency special session to pass pro-life legislation.



In a letter to DeSantis, state Senate President Wilton Simpson, and state House Speaker Chris Sprowls, Sabatini called for ""an emergency special legislative session to pass the Heartbeat Bill, and other legislation to protect the lives of unborn children in Florida.""

DeSantis entered office in 2019 and is currently running for re-election.

While the Supreme Court ruling represents a monumental victory for the pro-life movement, Democrats have been claiming that the decision marks a ""dark day"" for the country, and are even suggesting that the ruling will lead to people's deaths.



""Today is a dark day in American history,"" Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York said in a statement. ""Our country today failed the millions of Americans who will suffer from this inhumane, dangerous, and deadly ruling — especially the poor and people of color who will suffer and die the most,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/desantis-florida-pro-life-protections,2022-06-25
Dick Cheney calls Trump a 'coward' in scathing campaign ad for Liz Cheney,"Former Vice President Dick Cheney assailed former President Donald Trump as a ""coward"" in an ad for the re-election campaign of Republican Rep. Liz Cheney in Wyoming.

“In our nation’s 246-year history there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our Republic than Donald Trump,"" said Cheney in the video ad.

""He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,"" Cheney added. ""He is a coward. A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know he knows it and deep down I think most Republicans know it.""

Cheney went on to say he and his wife were proud of his daughter for honoring her oath to the Constitution.

""Liz is fearless. She never backs down from a fight. There is nothing more important she will ever do than lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and she will succeed,"" he concluded.

Ultimately, the effort might be a futile one since polls show Cheney is lagging far behind her primary challenger, natural resources attorney Harriet Hageman. A poll in July found that Cheney was receiving support from only 30% of Wyoming voters while Hageman garnered 53% support.

Hageman has received the endorsement of Trump who has excoriated Cheney for voting to impeach him and for sitting on the House Select Committee investigating the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

""Liz Cheney is polling sooo low in Wyoming, and has sooo little support, even from the Wyoming Republican Party, that she is looking for a way out of her Congressional race. Based on all polling, there is no way she can win,"" Trump claimed in April.

Liz Cheney has also said in July that she has not decided whether to run for the presidency in 2024.

""Dick Cheney"" was the top national trend on Twitter as many excoriated him for the ad, while some critics of Trump praised Cheney for his comments.

Here's the scathing ad from the Cheneys:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dick-cheney-trump-coward-ad,2022-08-05
Two DNC caucuses — 1 Muslim and 1 LGBT — omit 'under God' from Pledge of Allegiance this week,"At least two caucuses at the 2020 Democratic National Convention opted to omit ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance during this week's convention meetings, according to reports.

What are the details?

David Brody at CBN News posted the videos to Twitter, which have been widely shared.

Brody shared video footage of the meeting, captioning it, ""NEW! Democrats leave out 'Under God' from the Pledge of Allegiance at the #DemocraticNationalConvention Muslim Caucus meeting this week. Watch delegate AJ Durrani skip it. Featured speakers at this event were @BernieSanders @RashidaTlaib & @TomPerez.""

During the meeting, the assembly said, ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands. One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

At the LGBTQ caucus, the speaker said, ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands. One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

Brody also shared the now viral video, captioning it, ""At the #DemocraticNationalConvention, LGBT Caucus purposely leaves out the words 'under God' from the Pledge of Allegiance. Watch. This now makes twice that two key constituencies of the Democratic Party have done this. See my earlier tweet about DNC Muslim Caucus.""

'One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all'

As highlighted by the Washington Times, the term ""under God"" was not officially part of the Pledge of Allegiance until 1954.

The decision to include the verbiage was made official in a bill signed by former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

At the time, Eisenhower wrote, ""From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty ... In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource, in peace or in war.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dnc-caucuses-omit-under-god-from-pledge,2020-08-20
"DNC chair melts down over Tom Cotton's opposition to Ketanji Brown Jackson: 'Little, maggot-infested man'","Democratic National Committee Chairman Jamie Harrison had a meltdown on MSNBC Wednesday morning, calling Republican Sen. Tom Cotton a ""little, maggot-infested man"" because of the senator's comments in a speech opposing Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.

In remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday, Cotton pointed to Jackson's record of lenient sentences in child porn cases as well as her time as a defense attorney. The Arkansas lawmaker suggested that Jackson ""might have"" defended Nazis during the Nuremberg trials.

“The last Judge Jackson left the Supreme Court to go to Nuremberg and prosecute the case against the Nazis,” Cotton said, referring to former Justice Robert H. Jackson, who was appointed chief counsel in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals.

""This Judge Jackson might have gone there to defend them,” he added.

Cotton also claimed that as an associate justice on the Supreme Court, Jackson would ""coddle criminals and terrorists, and she will twist or ignore the law to reach the result she wants.""

Cotton's comments were widely condemned by Democrats and the Anti-Defamation League, which said his remarks were ""reprehensible.""

The Wednesday panel on ""Morning Joe"" discussed Cotton's speech, with host Joe Scarborough slamming the senator for implying that as a former defense attorney, Jackson has a soft spot for criminals.

“She was doing what the Constitution of the United States guarantees every American, that lawyers will do, and that lawyers have done since the beginning of this republic,” Scarborough said. “He knows better. That’s what makes it so absolutely, positively shameful.”

Harrison, a guest on the panel, said that ""in a Senate where there is Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Tom Cotton is the lowest of the low."" He brought up how in 2014, Cotton blocked President Barack Obama's nominee to be ambassador to the Bahamas, Cassandra Butts, allegedly because Cotton knew Obama and Butts were friends.

The DNC chairman repeated a claim that Cotton had told Butts he was blocking her nomination because he wanted to ""inflict special pain on the president."" Cotton's office disputes that he said any such thing. After waiting more than 800 days, Butts died of leukemia before the Senate considered her nomination.

Harrison said that story ""shows you who this little maggot-infested man is,"" then launched into a tirade against Cotton and the Republican Party.



""He does not deserve to have that pen. He doesn’t deserve to be in the United States Senate representing the good people of Arkansas,"" he said.

""He put his hand on the Bible, took an oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and he uses it as a play toy. That is the Republican Party we see today. It is a party built on fraud, fear, and fascism. They don’t deserve to be in power. Not because Democrats should, but because they don’t deserve to be in power of this great nation.""

DNC has no plans to scrap upcoming Sanders/Biden debate over coronavirus concerns,"While large public gatherings around the country and the world have been canceled or postponed due to the ongoing outbreak of the new coronavirus — formally known as COVID-19 — the Democratic National Committee says that it doesn't plan to cancel its upcoming 2020 presidential primary debate, at least for now.

According to a statement from DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa on Monday, Sunday's debate in Phoenix should go ahead as planned, the Arizona Republic reported.

""We are in touch with local officials and will follow their guidance,"" Hinojosa said. ""There are no plans to cancel the debate.""

The event will happen as concerns continue to grow about the spread of the coronavirus, which began in China late last year. Sunday's debate will bring together not only two top presidential candidates, but also their staff, the press, and members of the public.

In a statement reported by the Hill, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said that her team understands ""the responsibility that comes with hosting an event under these circumstances"" and is taking precautions ahead of the debate while reassessing the situation on a daily basis.

""We understand that the fear felt by residents is real, which is why we want to ensure transparency and efficiency in the dissemination of information on this topic,"" Gallego said. ""At this time, we are working with the understanding that the debate is moving forward as planned and taking proper safety precautions in the lead up to Sunday. Based on this information we will reassess daily what possible changes need to be made.""

The Grand Canyon State's first case of coronavirus was confirmed in late January. On Monday, the state reported its sixth confirmed case of the disease, as state Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ informed the public that the state had also seen community spread of the virus for the first time.

Before it was plagued with concerns about the potential for coronavirus transmission, Sunday's debate faced criticism over new DNC criteria that favored top primary candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden by singularly excluding Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who would have qualified under previous rules.

""To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications,"" Gabbard tweeted of the DNC's announcement calling on her opponents to speak out against it. ""Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate. I ask that you stand w/ me against the DNC's transparent effort to exclude me from the debates.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dnc-has-no-plans-to-scrap-upcoming-sandersbiden-debate-over-coronavirus-concerns,2020-03-10
"'Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government, because they are ruthless': Pelosi warns US athletes against condemning China during the Olympics","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is advising American athletes not to speak out against China while attending the 2022 Beijing Olympics, noting that they could draw the ire of the nation's ""ruthless"" government.

""I would say to our athletes, you're there to compete. Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government, because they are ruthless. I know there is a temptation on the part of some to speak out while they are there. I respect that,"" Pelosi said, while noting that she is concerned about what China's government might do to those athletes' reputations and families.

Pelosi made the comments while delivering remarks Thursday at a Congressional-Executive Commission on China hearing.

But the congresswoman did note the importance of calling China out for its abysmal record of human rights abuses.

""The People's Republic of China is perpetrating a campaign of gross human rights violations, including genocide,"" Pelosi said. ""While we fully support and will root for our athletes, we cannot and will not be silent on human rights in China.""

"Dominican Republic officials claim all recent US tourist deaths were due to natural causes, say contrary reports are manufactured 'hysteria'","Officials representing the Dominican Republic claim all the American tourists who have died in the country over the past year passed away from natural causes, and say reports to the contrary are nothing more than manufactured ""hysteria.""

What are the details?

A spokesman for the country's Ministry of Health told Fox News Wednesday that both preliminary and final autopsy reports of nine U.S. citizens who recently died at resorts on the island indicate there were no mysterious circumstances surrounding the deaths, despite reports that several victims consumed drinks from their hotel minibars before being found dead.

""It's all a hysteria against the Dominican Republic, to hurt our tourism,"" spokesman Carlos Suero told the outlet. ""This is a very competitive industry and we get millions of tourists, we are a popular destination. People are taking aim at us.""

Suero said the government's inspectors tested resorts for any possible links to the slew of reported tourist deaths, but could not find anything out of compliance.

""The testing results are all negative, everything,"" the spokesman insisted, ""The food, the alcohol, the air — is normal, there is no alteration of the alcohol. With all the tourists we get every year, we make sure we comply with international standards for everything.""

Suero added, ""People die all over the world. Unfortunately, very unfortunately for us, these tourists have died here. We had about 14 deaths last year here of U.S. tourists, and no one said a word. Now everyone is making a big deal of these.""

Fox reported that most of the victims died in their rooms after suddenly falling ill, and the official cause of the death for a majority of the deceased was a heart attack. Four of the victims were found to have died with fluid in their lungs.

What is the background?

The Daily Mail reported on eight cases of American tourists who have mysteriously died at five separate Dominican resorts over the past year, and noted that a Louisiana woman died Tuesday — just one week after returning from her honeymoon on the island.

Reports continue to pour in from victims who claim they fell violently ill while vacationing on the island nation, with several blaming drinks from their minibars. Relatives of tourists who have previously died in the Dominican Republic are also coming forward in light of the reports, questioning whether to believe the legitimacy of their loved one's official cause of death.

The FBI is currently assisting Dominican Republic authorities in an investigation into whether the deceased tourists drank tainted alcohol, CNN reported.

Arizona governor makes Nike pay — literally — after canceling patriotic shoes over Kaepernick objections,"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) announced Tuesday that he would order state officials to withdraw financial incentives for a future manufacturing plant that Nike was slated to build in The Grand Canyon State.

"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigns following Capitol siege, says Trump to blame for violence and destruction: 'Impressionable children are watching'","Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has resigned from President Donald Trump's administration following the deadly Wednesday siege on the U.S. Capitol.

DeVos' resignation makes her the second Trump Cabinet member to resign following the raid — Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao submitted her resignation earlier Thursday.

What are the details?

In a Thursday resignation letter, DeVos said that rioters' behaviors were ""unconscionable"" and that Trump played a signifiant role in spurring on the confrontation.

The letter, obtained by CNN, argued, ""There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.""

""Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us,"" DeVos' letter added. ""I believe we each have a moral obligation to exercise good judgment and model the behavior we hope they would emulate. They must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday.""

The New York Times reported that DeVos' statement added, ""We should be highlighting and celebrating your administration's many accomplishments on behalf of the American people. Instead, we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people's business.""

She concluded the statement, ""Holding this position has been the honor of a lifetime, and I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to serve America and her students.""

'We must set a better example'

DeVos' resignation letter echoes a statement she released on Wednesday following the raid.

""The eyes of America's children and students — the rising generation who will inherit the republic we lave them — are watching what is unfolding in Washington today,"" the former education secretary said Wednesday. ""We must set a better example for them, and we must teach them the solemn obligations and duties that come with the title 'American.'""

What else?



DeVos' resignation was met with scorn from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as well as the Teachers Union.

Warren tweeted the news, writing, ""Betsy DeVos has never done her job to help America's students. It doesn't surprise me one bit that she'd rather quit than do her job to help invoke the 25th Amendment. Good riddance, Betsy. You were the worst Secretary of Education ever.""

Randi Weingarten, chair of the American Federation of Teachers, echoed Warren's sentiments and, captioning a statement from the org on Twitter, wrote, ""#GoodRiddance.""

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, added, ""Her complicity, cowardice, and complete incompetence will be her legacy. #DoYourJob.""



In a longer statement, Pringle added, ""Resigning 13 days before the end of this administration does nothing to erase the harm Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has done to this country's students, their families, and educators. She has failed our students yet again when they needed her most. Her complicity, cowardice, and complete incompetence will be her legacy.""

""The 3 million members of the National Education Association are looking ahead to working with the Biden-Harris administration and Education Secretary-designate Miguel Cardona to make sure that we undo the damage done by the Trump administration,"" the statement added. ""We will build a new public education system to ensure it is one where all students — no matter who they are or where they live — have access and opportunity to a racially just and high-quality education.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/education-secretary-betsy-devos-resigns-capitol-siege,2021-01-08
Supreme Court denies pro-Trump bid to nullify election results in Pennsylvania,"The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a bid by Republican allies of President Donald Trump to undo the election results in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.

Republican state lawmakers had requested their petition to be seen by the U.S. Supreme Court but that was denied without proving any reasoning or offering any dissent to the order.

The allies of the president had charged that the Republican-controlled legislature had improperly passed an act to allow universal mail-in balloting, which they said was in violation of the state's constitution.

That was denied by the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court, which said that the challenge was filed too late.

The plaintiffs' demand before the U.S. Supreme Court was that either more than 2.5 million mail-in ballots be nullified in the election, or that the results of the entire election be nullified.

Lawyers for the state were outraged against the demands from the plaintiffs.

""Petitioners ask this court to undertake one of the most dramatic, disruptive invocations of judicial power in the history of the Republic,"" said the state of Pennsylvania. ""No court has ever issued an order nullifying a governor's certification of presidential election results.""

The Supreme Court rejected that demand without a hearing, allowing the election results in Pennsylvania to stand.

The petition, led by Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly (R) and GOP congressional candidate Sean Parnell, was considered one of the last-ditch efforts to thwart the officially recognized results of the election and its defeat seriously injures the president's efforts.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf already has certified Joe Biden's victory and the state's 20 electors are to meet on Dec. 14 to cast their votes for Biden.

Electoral College objection divides Senate GOP: Here's where everyone stands,"As Congress prepares to certify the results of the Electoral College on Wednesday, a group of Republican senators have declared their intention to object to accepting President-elect Joe Biden as the winner.

Their objection, while unlikely to prevent Congress from accepting Biden as the victor and the next president of the United States, will trigger hours of debate in Congress about the merits of allegations of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election and will culminate in a vote that will divide the Republican Conference.

So far, 38 of 51 Republican senators who will have a vote on Wednesday have gone on the record about where they stand. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) will not participate in the Electoral College certification Wednesday because his term ended Sunday. If he wins re-election, the results of his election will not be certified before Congress votes. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, (R-Ga.) on the other hand is running in a special election to complete the term of retired Sen. Jonny Isakson (R-Ga.), so she will have a vote even though her election is on the same day as Perdue's.

Those in favor of objecting

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was the first to declare his intention to object to the Electoral College vote, calling out the state of Pennsylvania for, in his words, failing to ""follow their own state election laws"" and accusing ""mega corporations"" including Facebook and Twitter of interfering in the election.

Later, a group of 11 Republican senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced they would object as well. They issued a joint statement on Saturday citing widespread allegations of voter fraud as reason to appoint an Electoral Commission to investigate the 2020 election and conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the returns.

""A fair and credible audit-conducted expeditiously and completed well before January 20-would dramatically improve Americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next President. We owe that to the People,"" the senators said.

""These are matters worthy of the Congress, and entrusted to us to defend. We do not take this action lightly. We are acting not to thwart the democratic process, but rather to protect it. And every one of us should act together to ensure that the election was lawfully conducted under the Constitution and to do everything we can to restore faith in our Democracy.""

The senators who joined this statement include Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.).

Also, Loeffler, who is running for re-election in a run-off against Democratic candidate, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, that will be decided Tuesday, released a statement Monday lending her support to the objection effort.

""The American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed,"" Loeffler said. ""That's why, on January 6th, I will vote to give President Trump and the American people the fair hearing they deserve and support the objection to the Electoral College certification process.""

That makes 13 Republican senators so far who will object to the Electoral College results from battleground states disputed by President Donald Trump's campaign.

Those opposed to objecting

They are met with opposition from at least 25 of their colleagues, several of which have raised constitutional concerns about whether lawmakers have the ability to disregard election results certified by the states at all.



Four Republican senators including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) joined Democrats in a statement calling for Congress to certify Biden as the winner of the election.

""The voters have spoken, and Congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results,"" the senators said collectively.

Romney issued an additional statement on Jan. 3 condemning Cruz and the co-signers of his statement for their ""egregious ploy to reject electors,"" accusing them of dangerously threatening the republic.

""President Trump's lawyers made their case before scores of courts; in every instance, they failed. The Justice Department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election. The Presidential Voter Fraud Commission disbanded without finding such evidence,"" Romney said.

My fellow Senator Ted Cruz and the co-signers of his statement argue that rejection of electors or an election audit directed by Congress would restore trust in the election. Nonsense. This argument ignores the widely perceived reality that Congress is an overwhelmingly partisan body; the American people wisely place greater trust in the federal courts where judges serve for life. Members of Congress who would substitute their own partisan judgement for that of the courts do not enhance public trust, they imperil it.



Were Congress to actually reject state electors, partisans would inevitably demand the same any time their candidate had lost. Congress, not voters in the respective states, would choose our presidents.



Adding to this ill-conceived endeavor by some in Congress is the President's call for his supporters to come to the Capitol on the day when this matter is to be debated and decided. This has the predictable potential to lead to disruption, and worse.



I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?

The following are statements from other GOP senators who will oppose the effort to object to the Electoral College vote, as collected by the Washington Post:

Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.): ""Not one of the lawsuits filed found evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities that would have changed the outcome of the election. Similarly, not a single state's outcome changed as a result of requested recounts. Objecting to certified electoral votes submitted by the states will have no impact on the result of the election either. We cannot erode the ideals that generations of Americans have fought to protect simply because we do not like the outcome of the election.""

Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.): ""I am a conservative Republican. Therefore, I must strictly adhere to the United States Constitution. The Constitution clearly limits the role of Congress with respect to presidential elections to the counting of electoral votes that have been certified by the states. The states, consistent with the principles of federalism and a limited national government, possess the sole authority to determine and submit their electors. To vote to reject these state-certified electoral votes would be to act outside the bounds of the Constitution, which I will not do.""

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.): ""As I read the Constitution, there is no constitutionally viable means for the Congress to overturn an election wherein the states have certified and sent their Electors. Some of my colleagues believe they have found a path, and while our opinions differ, I do not doubt their good intentions to take steps towards stamping out voter fraud. Importantly, I disagree with their method both in principle and in practice. For their theory to work, Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats would have to elect Donald Trump president rather than Joe Biden. That it is not going to happen, not today or any other day.""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska): ""I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and that is what I will do January 6 — just as I strive to do every day as I serve the people of Alaska. I will vote to affirm the 2020 presidential election. The courts and state legislatures have all honored their duty to hear legal allegations and have found nothing to warrant overturning the results. I urge my colleagues from both parties to recognize this and to join me in maintaining confidence in the Electoral College and our elections so that we ensure we have the continues trust of the American people.""

Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.): ""At the end of the day, it's time to move on. We need the electoral college to do its work. It's an integral part of our constitution.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.): Cotton said that he shares ""the concerns of many Arkansans about irregularities in the presidential election"" and will therefore support ""a commission to study the last election and propose reforms to protect the integrity of our elections."" However, he opposes an effort by Congress to overturn the results of the election.

""... the Founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states—not Congress. They entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the Electoral College—not Congress. And they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts—not Congress. Under the Constitution and federal law, Congress's power is limited to counting electoral votes submitted by the states.



""If Congress purported to overturn the results of the Electoral College, it would not only exceed that power, but also establish unwise precedents. ...

""Thus, I will not oppose the counting of certified electoral votes on January 6.""

Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): ""Many of us hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result, but our system of government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20. The electoral college has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many years.""

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine): ""It's not an effort that I'm going to support. And right now, I'm going to go get sworn in to my fifth term, making history as the first Republican woman senator ever to be elected to a fifth term, and making Maine history by being the first Maine senator since popular election to be elected to a fifth term. So I'm gonna enjoy that for a bit first.""

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): ""We've now gone through the constitutional process and the electors have voted, so there's a president-elect.""

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.): ""I think the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that Joe Biden defeated my candidate, Donald Trump, and I have to live with it.""

Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): Responding to a question on whether he would join Hawley's effort to object, Burr said, ""no.""

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.): ""While I share the concerns of those who plan to object, the Founding Fathers did not design a system where the federal legislative branch could reject a state's certified choice for President in favor of their own ... I do not have the authority to overturn the will of other states on behalf of North Dakota, nor do other members have the ability to overturn the will of my state. ...

""In light of these concerns, I will not object to the Electoral College votes when they are counted, and — unless overwhelmingly persuasive evidence is presented before the Senate when we debate the objections – I will not vote to reject the results.""

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.): ""The people of North Dakota do not want Congress to determine their vote, and we should not set the precedent by doing it for other states. Therefore, I do not plan to object.""

Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.): ""I look forward to working with President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to keep our nation safe, update our infrastructure, and provide opportunities to families,"" she said in a letter to a constituent.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.): ""We have a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there's a quick way to tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage. But they're wrong – and this issue is bigger than anyone's personal ambitions. Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government.""

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): ""The orderly transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy, and although I supported President Trump, the Electoral College vote today makes clear that Joe Biden is now President-Elect.""

Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.): ""My job on Wednesday is clear, and there are only two things I am permitted to do under the Constitution: ensure the electors are properly certified and count the electoral votes, even when I disagree with the outcome. To challenge a state's certification, given how specific the Constitution is, would be a violation of my oath of office -- that is not something I am willing to do and is not something Oklahomans would want me to do.""

Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.): ""I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.""

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.): ""Vice President Biden is the president-elect based on the electoral count.""

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.): On how the vote on the objection will turn out: ""It's going down like a shot dog.""

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas): ""There's good constitutional and other legal grounds to say: You had your day in court, 60 different lawsuits in state courts, you had a chance to appeal those to the Supreme Court, and as I read the law once a state certifies its electoral vote it's conclusive.""

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah): ""... with respect to presidential elections, there is no authority for Congress to make value judgments in the abstract regarding any state's election laws or the manner in which they have been implemented.""

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.): ""Several of my congressional colleagues have made clear their plans to object to counting certified electoral votes from certain states. I will oppose their effort because the will of voters in each state—not political considerations or the individual preferences of senators and representatives—must determine the winner of the presidential election.""

And the rest



There are 13 Republican senators who have not definitively stated their position ahead of Wednesday

Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have each released statements indicating they will listen to the debate and cast their votes after considering what those objecting have to say. According to the Washington Post, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) acknowledged that Biden is the ""presumptive president-elect"" but did not comment on the effort to object to the Electoral College results.

The remaining 10 Republicans, Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Crapo (R-Id.), Jim Risch (R-Id.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), and Sen.

Liz Cheney endorsed Democrat Elissa Slotkin. New poll shows her double-digit lead has evaporated completely.,"The lead that Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) held over her Republican challenger, Tom Barrett, has now completely evaporated, according to a new poll.

Ironically, the survey showing Slotkin and Barrett in a dead heat was taken one day after Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) campaigned for Slotkin.

What does the poll show?

The Mitchell-MIRS poll of likely general election voters shows that Barrett actually leads Slotkin by less than one percentage point, 48.4% to 47.5%.

Independent voters are helping propel Barrett ahead of his Democratic opponent. The survey found that each candidate is receiving 89% of support from voters in their respective parties, but Barrett holds a 3-point advantage — 48% to 45% — over Slotkin among independent voters.

The result suggests Barrett is on the receiving end of a significant final push, because the same poll, conducted just three weeks ago, showed that Slotkin held an 11-point advantage over Barrett.

Steve Mitchell, president of Mitchell Research, said the latest result indicates what is happening nationwide.

[A]s we are seeing nationwide and within Michigan, there seems to be a late last minute surge to Republican candidates. That surge has moved Barrett into a statistical tie and has also moved Tudor Dixon into a tie with Governor Gretchen Whitmer. The momentum in the race would seem to indicate that if Republicans turn out in high numbers next Tuesday, Barrett may win a very close race.

The Cook Political Report agrees that Michigan's 7th Congressional District is a toss-up.

What about Cheney?

The survey was conducted on Nov. 2, one day after Cheney traveled to the Great Lakes State to endorse Slotkin.

The Democratic lawmaker thus became the first Democrat that Cheney has ever endorsed.

""If we want to ensure the safety of our republic, we have to walk away from politics as usual,"" Cheney said at a campaign event. ""We are going to look beyond partisan politics. If the people in our party are not doing the job they need to do, than we're going to vote for the people in the other party, because we are Americans above all else.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elissa-slotkin-trails-gop-challenger-after-cheney-endorsement,2022-11-04
Empty streets & air raids in northern Japan after North Korea fires a ballistic missile overhead,"On October 3, just days after Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to the Korean Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone, North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan — the first time it has done so in five years.

The missile, believed to be the Hwasong-12, proved capable of reaching Guam. It was airborne for 20 minutes, reached an altitude of 620 miles (over twice as high as the International Space Station) and ultimately traveled 2,800 miles before smashing into the Pacific Ocean.

Upon detecting the launch, Japanese officials halted trains in the northern Hokkaido and Aomori regions and urged citizens to take shelter.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's office indicated that a missile was ""believed to have been launched from North Korea"" and that citizens should ""evacuate to the inside of a building or go to the basement.""

The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo reportedly cautioned Americans in the area that there was a possibility the missile was headed toward Japan.

Later, Japanese officials acknowledged that ""the aforementioned missile is believed to have passed through the Pacific Ocean.""

Condemnation

The U.S., Japanese, and South Korean governments quickly condemned the attacks.

Kishida stated that the ""firing, which followed a recent series of launches by North Korea, is a reckless act and I strongly condemn it.""

The Japanese prime minister was referencing several earlier launches of short-range ballistic missiles by the communist regime into the East Sea, including two fired just hours after the U.S. vice president's departure from South Korea last week.

South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol indicated that the regime's ""reckless nuclear provocations"" would be met by a stern response.

Adrienne Watson, the spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, stated that ""the United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) dangerous and reckless decision to launch a long-range missile over Japan.""

Watson added that the act was ""destabilizing"" to the region and in contravention of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The Security Council previously called on the communist regime to ""cease its illicit activity"" and voted 15-0 to sanction the rogue nation.

In response to the imposition of parallel U.S. sanctions against North Korea in 2017, Pyongyang responded: ""The U.S. mainland will sink into an unimaginable sea of fire on the day when it dares to touch our country by stupidly causing mischief and brandishing its nuclear and sanctions clubs.""

The regime also threatened to hit U.S. military bases in Guam with the same type of missile believed to have been fired this week.

Responding to these threats to the U.S. homeland in a speech to the U.N., on September 19, 2017, former President Donald Trump stated: ""The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.""

North Korea withdrew from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, after the U.S. alleged the regime was pursuing an illegal uranium enrichment program. It refuses to return to nuclear diplomacy with the U.S.

This latest missile launch is reportedly another step toward the regime's test of a nuclear weapon, expected to occur after China's communist party congress starting on October 16.

Adrienne Watson emphasized that the U.S. ""will continue its efforts to limit [North Korea's] ability to advance its prohibited ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction programs, including with allies and U.N. partners.""

Military response

The U.S. and South Korea quickly responded to the communist regime's first missile launch with what the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff characterized as a ""combined attack squadron flight and precision bombing drill.""

Four U.S. F-16 fighter jets and four South Korean F-15s fired on an uninhabited island in the Yellow Sea. The drill evidenced the allies' ability to accurately obliterate communist targets with ""overwhelming force"" and ""to respond resolutely to any provocation from North Korea.""



Last week, the two countries also conducted joint military exercises, in which the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan participated. The North Korean regime allegedly regarded these exercises as invasion rehearsals.

On October 1, the 7th Fleet conducted exercises with Canada and Japan, reiterating its ""commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""

In response to the latest missile launch, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command stated: ""The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,"" noting further that while ""the event does not pose a threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we will continue to monitor the situation.""

USINDOPACOM added that the ""U.S. commitments to the defense of Japan and the [Republic of Korea] remain ironclad.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/empty-streets-air-raids-in-northern-japan-after-north-korea-fires-a-ballistic-missile-overhead,2022-10-04
Warning signs that Europe could have an energy crisis this winter,"Energy prices are soaring in Europe because of inflation and the repercussions of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. There are numerous warning signs that Europe could face a crippling energy crisis this winter.

Inflation has spiked

Inflation is surging in Europe. In July, the annual inflation rate was up 9.8% among the 28 European Union member nations – up from 2.5% a year earlier.

Russia holds power over Europe's natural gas supply

Gazprom – the Russian government-owned energy behemoth – has shut down a critical natural gas pipeline to Europe. Last week, Gazprom switched off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to perform urgent maintenance work.

There are concerns that Russia may hold Europe hostage with the pipeline over the winter.

Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied more than a third of Germany’s gas supplies.

Europe is already burdened with record-high energy prices

In August, Spain experienced its most expensive month for electricity since records have been kept.

France 24 reported, ""The year-ahead contract for German electricity reached 995 euros ($995) per megawatt hours while the French equivalent surged past 1,100 euros – a more than tenfold increase in both countries from last year. In Britain, energy regulator Ofgem said it would increase the electricity and gas price cap almost twofold from October 1 to an average £3,549 ($4,197) per year.""

Daniele Franco – Italy's Minister of Economy and Finance – warned that the country's net energy import costs will more than double this year to nearly 100 billion euros ($99.5 billion). Franco said the nation was helpless in the matter, ""To keep offsetting, at least in part, rising energy prices through public finances is very costly and we could never do enough.""

Germany faces a coal shortage

The lack of oil and gas has forced European nations to increase their dependency on coal.

In Germany, the water levels in the Rhine River have hit crisis levels amid summer heatwaves. The Rhine River – one of Europe's key waterways – has already been closed due to low water levels.

""Due to very reduced domestic shipping, accumulated coal stocks could quickly fall,"" Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action said in a document obtained by Reuters.

Other major waterways have also prevented large vessels from bringing coal to European countries. That coal is now stuck in ports. Approximately 8 million tons of coal were stranded in ports at the end of July, Politico reported. If the supply chain woes continue, it will have dire effects on Germany, Poland, and Switzerland in the winter.

Scandinavian governments are bailing out energy companies

Finland and Sweden announced that they plan to offer billions of dollars to energy companies to prevent them from ending up in ""technical bankruptcy.""

""The rapid rise in electricity prices has resulted in paper losses on electricity futures contracts of energy firms, forcing them to find funds to post additional collateral with the exchanges,"" according to Reuters.

Finland will offer $9.95 billion, and Sweden will give $23.2 billion to energy companies.

Businesses face bankruptcy over energy costs

MakeUK – the lobbyist group for British factories – said nearly half of all manufacturers in the country have seen electricity bills skyrocket more than 100% in the past year.



Bloomberg reported, ""Soaring energy bills are threatening to put six in 10 British manufacturers out of business, according to a survey that lays bare the extent of the crisis facing the next prime minister.""

Sky-high energy prices are severely curtailing production

""Nordic Greens, one of the largest tomato growers in both Denmark and Sweden, has announced that they will not grow any tomatoes during winter in their Sweden-based cultivation because of the skyrocketing electricity prices, ""according to HortiDaily – a global greenhouse news website.

An estimated 500 tonnes of tomatoes will be lost because of the shutdown.

Multiple European aluminum smelters have drastically cut production or temporarily shut down because of spiking energy prices.

""Industry insiders say the escalating energy crisis is now threatening to create an extinction event across large swathes of the region’s aluminum production,"" Bloomberg reported.

Restrictions on electricity, heat, and water

Since July, some of Germany's biggest cities implemented restrictions on warm water, heat, and lighting.

U.S. Army bracing for energy shortages at a military base in Germany

Last month, the U.S. Army notified troops that there would likely be energy restrictions at the U.S. Army Garrison in Ansbach, Germany.



""USAG Ansbach installations rely solely on local German utility partners for power, heating, and water needs,"" the Army memo stated. ""In spite of all the solar panels and windmills in Germany, a large percentage of the energy used for heating within the EU is imported…much of it from Russia.""



DPW Energy manager Brad Jennings said, ""There is the potential that we will have to endure large cuts in available power and heating.""

The U.S. Army advised servicemembers to put on extra clothing, minimize long, hot showers by lowering the temperature, and use cold water instead of hot.

Civil unrest is on the rise across the globe

Verisk Maplecroft – a risk consultancy firm – released its latest Civil Unrest Index last week. The most recent report found that out of 198 countries, 101 experienced an increase in risk of civil unrest, versus only 42 which decreased.

""The data, covering seven years, shows that the last quarter saw more countries witness an increase in risks from civil unrest than at any time since the Index was released,"" the report stated.

The analysts noted that ""rising food and energy prices will make it more difficult for governments to manage popular discontent.""

""A cold autumn and winter in Europe would worsen an already serious energy and cost of living crisis,"" the report said.

On Friday, Italians burned their energy bills in front of the town hall in Naples.

On Saturday, an estimated 70,000 protesters staged a demonstration in Prague ""against soaring energy bills and demand an end to sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine,"" according to the Guardian.

"Denmark to re-open schools next week, as European nations 'walk the tightrope' of easing coronavirus lockdowns","Multiple European countries will begin to relax some of their coronavirus lockdown restrictions, including Denmark reopening schools and day care centers next week, after experiencing several days of declining COVID-19 cases.

Denmark's schools and child care centers are set to reopen on April 15. Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced the Nordic country's plan to gradually soften restrictions earlier this week in a press conference.

""This will probably be a bit like walking the tightrope,"" Frederiksen said. ""If we stand still along the way we could fall and if we go too fast it can go wrong. Therefore, we must take one cautious step at a time.""

Denmark Health Minister Pernille Rosenkratz-Theil noted that schools that are not prepared will not be open to the public on Wednesday. ""They will not be allowed to reopen until they can be sure that the rules are being complied with,"" Rosenkratz-Theil said. ""It doesn't matter if it's one date or another one.""

The ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in Denmark will continue until at least May 10, and the ban on large gatherings would remain in effect until August.

Frederiksen warned that the gradual lessening of restrictions would only happen if new coronavirus cases remain stable. She also reminded Danes that they still need to practice social distancing and hygiene.

Denmark was the second European nation, after Italy, to announce a lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. Denmark closed all restaurants, cafes, gyms, schools, and day care centers on March 11, despite having zero confirmed COVID-19 deaths at the time. Denmark also closed its borders to most foreigners starting on March 13.

Denmark has 260 coronavirus deaths and nearly 6,000 confirmed cases. New cases have declined for four straight days in the Scandinavian nation that has a population of 5.6 million.

Other European countries are also slowly easing restrictions. Austria will allow small shops of less than 4,305 square feet to return to business on April 14, followed by larger stores on May 1.

Based on how well the country is doing with new COVID-19 cases, Austria is targeting a mid-May timeline to allow restaurants, hotels, and schools to reopen. There will remain strict rules requiring people to wear masks, practice social distancing, disinfection requirements, and health checks on workers. Austrians must wear face masks at supermarkets, as well as while using public transportation. There will also be a limit as to how many people will be allowed in a store at one time. The earliest that public events could return is July.

Austria implemented a national lockdown on March 16, and the country's young leader credits the quick shutdown for the gradual reopening that will soon take place.

""We reacted faster and more restrictively in Austria than in other countries and were therefore able to prevent the worst from happening so far,"" the 33-year-old Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said at a press conference. ""The quick and restrictive reaction now also gives us the opportunity to get out of this crisis faster.""

Austria, which has a population of 9 million, has had nearly 1,400 confirmed cases and 337 deaths during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Czech Republic was the first European country to declare a state of emergency, a 30-day decree announced on March 13 that closed borders to Germany and Austria, and banned entry of foreigners from high-risk COVID-19 countries. Starting on April 14, the Czech government will ease restrictions on people leaving the country.

Those who want to travel abroad from the Czech Republic will need to present ""reasonable grounds"" to make their case for leaving the country. Those who do leave must also observe a two-week quarantine when they return.

The Czech government will also allow more kinds of stores to be open. Czech Trade Minister Karel Havlicek said retail locations selling construction materials, hobby supplies and bicycles will be permitted to do business again. Previously, only grocery stores, pharmacies, and garden stores were allowed to operate.

""We are clearly saying now that we are able to relatively well manage the pandemic here, it is not the pandemic managing us,"" said Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech at a news conference on Monday.

The Czech Republic has experienced over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 129 deaths.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-countries-easing-coronavirus-lockdowns-,2020-04-11
FEC commissioner dresses down Eric Swalwell for 'abhorrent' request of campaign funds,"A commissioner with the Federal Election Commission condemned Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) on Thursday after asking whether he could use campaign funds for childcare while he takes an international trip.

What is the background?

In May, Rebecca Olson, an attorney for Swalwell's campaign, asked the FEC for clarification whether Swalwell could use campaign funds for overnight childcare while he travels abroad.

""Can Swalwell for Congress pay for childcare expenses for his children if he travels at the request of foreign government or other entities because of his status as a member of Congress? If yes, would that include overnight care as well?"" Olson asked.

The childcare is necessary, Olson explained, because Swalwell and his wife, who also works full-time, have three young children. Their busy schedule means they have to employ a ""night nanny"" when both parents are unavailable to care for their children.

Previously, the FEC ruled that campaigns may use campaign funds for childcare if the need is directly related to campaigning.

What did the FEC commissioner say?

Commissioner Trey Trainor (R) dressed down Swalwell over the request during an FEC meeting, calling the request ""abhorrent.""

""I am a father of six children, and my wife also works. And I am very aware of the lengths that parents have to go to in order to provide childcare,"" Trainor began. ""I do see this as nothing more than a member of Congress looking for a way to have donors pay for nanny services while they run off on weeklong trips overseas.

""To be real honest with you: I'm actually going to pass judgment on it,"" he continued. ""I think it's abhorrent that Congressman Swalwell would have such a young child and want to leave them in the care of someone else, for a weeklong trip overseas and using donor contributions to pay for that. I think it's inappropriate we even had to address this question.""

Ultimately, the commission failed to come to an agreement.

Three commissioners supported barring Swalwell from using campaign funds as requested, two supported allowing Swalwell to use campaign funds as requested, while the sixth commissioner abstained.

Anything else?

After the meeting, FEC commissioner Ellen Weintraub condemned Trainor for his comments.

""I have never seen a requestor treated so disrespectfully by a member of this Commission. This is the United States of America, not the Republic of Gilead. The @FEC enforces the law,"" Weintraub said on Twitter. ""We do not 'pass judgment' on the personal lives of those who come before us asking for guidance.""

Trainor shot back, ""I’ve never seen campaign donors treated so disrespectfully! The Republic will persevere even if Swallwell doesn’t get all the junkets he’d like.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fec-trey-trainor-eric-swalwell-request,2022-07-15
Feminist author: 'I believe Tara Reade. I'm voting for Joe Biden anyway.',"Count Linda Hirshman as one of those on the left who at least isn't hiding her political motivations.

The feminist author and longtime voice against sexual harassment penned a New York Times op-ed Wednesday that spelled things out plainly in the headline: ""I Believe Tara Reade. I'm voting for Joe Biden anyway.""

What are the details?

Hirshman — who said she also believed Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings — argued that trashing Reade's accusation and her four (and counting) corroborating witnesses ""is nonsense.""

""So stop playing gotcha with the female supporters of Mr. Biden or the #MeToo movement, making them lie to the camera — or perhaps to themselves — about doubting her to justify their votes,"" she wrote before her zinger: ""I'll take one for the team. I believe Ms. Reade, and I'll vote for Mr. Biden this fall.""

Hirshman has a long history of advocacy for women's issues dating back the 1960s, noting that ""supposedly 'liberal' men abused the sexual revolution in every imaginable way. I am unimpressed by their lip service to feminism, their Harvard degrees or their donations to feminist causes.""

She also said she was ""one of a few establishment feminists"" who stuck up for Monica Lewinsky when feminist icon Gloria Steinem protected President Bill Clinton by tossing Lewinsky to the sharks.

Now Hirshman is living by the following mantra: ""Suck it up and make the utilitarian bargain.""

More from her op-ed:

All major Democratic Party figures have indicated they're not budging on the presumptive nominee, and the transaction costs of replacing him would be suicidal. Barring some miracle, it's going to be Mr. Biden.



So what is the greatest good or the greatest harm? Mr. Biden, and the Democrats he may carry with him into government, are likely to do more good for women and the nation than his competition, the worst president in the history of the Republic. Compared with the good Mr. Biden can do, the cost of dismissing Tara Reade — and, worse, weakening the voices of future survivors — is worth it. And don't call me an amoral realist. Utilitarianism is not a moral abdication; it is a moral stance.

""Won't the good for all the Americans who will benefit from replacing Donald Trump with Joe Biden, including the masses of women who will get some crumbs, count for more than the harm done to the victims of abuse?"" Hirshman asked.

She added that ""utilitarian morality requires that I turn my face away from the people I propose to sell out: Monica Lewinsky, Tara Reade. This is agonizingly hard for me to do. Pretending not to believe the complainants — which is what is taking place with Ms. Reade — or that they're loose nobodies, which is what much of the media did to Ms. Lewinsky, is just an escape from the hard work of moral analysis.""

Hirshman added a message to rest of the left trying discredit Biden's accuser.

""Better to just own up to what you are doing: Sacrificing Ms. Reade for the good of the many,"" she said.

Anything else?

She also savaged President Trump and even Vice President Mike Pence, calling both misogynists in their own ways and concluded Biden — ""that relic of the good-old-boy Senate years, seems positively benign by comparison.""

Still Hirshman said, ""But even that probably would not be enough to make me abandon the claims of justice and vote for him in face of credible accusations of sexual assault. Fortunately for my sanity, there's more.""

With that she invoked a philosophical argument about making a ""distasteful moral choice"" in the midst of a figurative shipwreck — and said Trump's presidency is one.

""It may not be just, but I'm swimming away from Mr. Trump's sinking ship as hard as I can."" Hirshman wrote. ""If I have to, I'll vote for Mr. Biden. I hope I'm not going to drown anyway.""

On that note, here's video of Hirshman in 2019 discussing her book, ""Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment."" In the first few minutes of the clip, the author recounts the brutal story of a 20-year-old woman who was nearly raped her workplace restroom — and that her shift manager ""treated her story like it was nothing."" Hmm.

Reactions to FIFA punishing Russia soccer team over Ukraine invasion,"The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) took a stand against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. However, soccer fans say the punishment was not harsh enough.

On Sunday, FIFA announced that the Russian national soccer team could no longer compete under the name of ""Russia."" Instead, it could only use the name ""Football Union of Russia"" or the acronym ""RFU.""

In addition, Russia may not display the country's flag or play the Russian national anthem during matches. FIFA also declared that Russia is no longer permitted to play home games. Instead, the Russian soccer team may only play on neutral sites and without any fans in attendance.

""Violence is never a solution and FIFA expresses its deepest solidarity to all people affected by what is happening in Ukraine,"" the international soccer organization said in a statement titled ""Bureau of the FIFA Council takes initial measures with regard to war in Ukraine"" released on Sunday. ""FIFA calls again for the urgent restoration of peace and for constructive dialogue to commence immediately.""

""FIFA will continue its ongoing dialogue with the IOC, UEFA, and other sport organizations to determine any additional measures or sanctions, including a potential exclusion from competitions, that shall be applied in the near future should the situation not be improving rapidly,"" FIFA stated.

However, soccer fans and experts were expecting more severe penalties, such as FIFA expelling Russia from World Cup qualifying.

Soccer journalist Grant Wahl: ""Terrible from FIFA.""

Soccer writer Henry Winter: ""FIFA has blood on its hands. Infantino should stand up to Putin not appease him. Utterly spineless from FIFA to let Russia continue competing in World Cup qualifying just with a different name. While brave Ukrainians die.""

Many soccer enthusiasts pointed out the issue with allowing to continue to compete.

The national soccer teams from Poland, Sweden, and the Czech Republic declared they will boycott games against Russia in retaliation to the Ukraine invasion. However, there will be a major issue if teams forfeit their matches against Russia, including World Cup qualifiers.

President of the Polish Football Association (PZPN) Cezary Kulesza: ""Today’s FIFA decision is totally unacceptable. We are not interested in participating in this game of appearances. Our stance remains intact: Polish National Team will NOT PLAY with Russia, no matter what the name of the team is.""

Former pro soccer player Gary Lineker: ""With Poland, Sweden & Czech Republic refusing to play Russia, @FIFAcom has to support them. It’s hard to envisage a World Cup taking place if Russia are given a free pass to the finals. How many teams will refuse to play them or pull out? FIFA where are you?""



Soccer commentator Iain Dale: ""If FIFA kick Poland out of the World Cup for refusing to play Russia, and allow Russia through on a bye, all other nations should make clear they won't play in Qatar.""

Sportswriter Karolos Grohmann: ""FIFA really doesn't get it that there are national teams out there that will not play against Russia anywhere under any name and what ever FIFA says.""

ESPN noted that the teams forfeiting matches against Russia could be punished, ""A strict reading of FIFA's World Cup regulations would even make the Polish, Swedish, and Czech federations liable to disciplinary action and having to pay fines and compensation if they wouldn't play Russia.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fifa-russia-ukraine-punishment-reactions,2022-02-28
Former MLB star David Ortiz allegedly shot by cops hired by a drug lord in Dominican Republic,"Former Boston Red Sox star David ""Big Papi"" Ortiz was shot Sunday night in the Dominican Republic, and remains in intensive care after a bullet went into his back and out his stomach, according to CNN.

Police have detained multiple suspects, including one who was beat up by some bystanders as he tried to escape the scene. The Daily Mail reports that the suspect was ""beaten relentlessly"" until police arrived, and suffered extensive injuries.

What happened?



Ortiz was at the Dial Discotheque in Santo Domingo, his hometown, Sunday night. Two men approached the club on motorcycles, and at least one opened fire and shot Ortiz in the back. Jhoel Lopez, a television host who was at the club with Ortiz, was also shot.

As the suspects attempted to flee, they crashed the motorcycle. That's when bystanders got a hold of Eddy Vladimir Feliz Garcia and roughed him up before turning him over to police. The other suspect fled on foot, but has also been captured by police. Ortiz told police he does not know Feliz Garcia.

How is Ortiz?

The Boston legend is recovering from surgery. He has been dealing with bleeding in his liver, and has had his gall bladder removed. He is currently in stable condition, and is awaiting approval from doctors to be transported to the United States.

The Red Sox plan to facilitate Ortiz's travel back to Boston.

Why did this happen?

The New York Post reported Monday that Dominican Republic authorities believe Ortiz was shot by two police officers who had been hired by a drug lord who believes Ortiz was having an affair with his wife.

Leo Lopez, a representative of Ortiz, denied the affair narrative but did say he believed the gunmen had been hired to kill Ortiz.

""There is no doubt that it was an act of hired killers,"" Lopez said. ""If we had known that there was a dangerous situation, he would not have been there at that moment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-mlb-star-david-ortiz-shot-at-a-club-and-bystanders-made-sure-a-suspect-paid-for-the-act,2019-06-10
Former NBA dud accused of attempting to rob gas station,"A former NBA first-round draft pick, who never amounted to much in the league and who reportedly has a history of fighting with other athletes, has now been accused of attempting to rob an Indiana gas station.

Just after midnight on November 8, police in Goshen, Indiana, about 20 minutes south of the Michigan border, received a report of an unruly man at an area Phillips 66. A clerk there claimed that a man — later identified as 34-year-old Donté Greene — entered the store and demanded: ""[G]ive me all the money!""

When the clerk took his cell phone out of his pocket to call police, Greene supposedly told him to put the phone away and not to contact law enforcement. Surveillance footage from the store also indicated that Greene meandered about the store for a while, removed items from his own pockets, and even took off the shirt he was wearing.

Greene also allegedly ""lunged"" at the clerk, who continued to back away behind the counter, police said.

Workers at a Taco Bell adjacent to the Phillips station eventually called 911 regarding the incident. Turns out that police had already been canvassing the area for a drunk driver. They quickly arrested Greene and charged him with attemptedrobbery, intimidation, and interfering in the reporting of a crime. He faces up to six years in prison, if convicted.

Notably, Greene was not charged with any alcohol-related offenses, despite reports of a drunk driver in the area. He also did not have a weapon on him when he was arrested, and he did not take anything from the store, reports say.

Greene is probably best remembered for the high expectations many basketball fans had for him after a successful season at Syracuse University, during which he led the team in points. He then declared for the 2008 NBA Draft and was selected by the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round. However, the Grizzlies immediately traded him to the Houston Rockets, who then traded him to the Sacramento Kings in August of that year. Greene then spent four lackluster years with the Kings and their NBA Development League affiliate, the Reno Bighorns.

Greene then bounced around various NBA Development League and NBA Summer League teams before eventually heading overseas to continue his career. He had stops in Puerto Rico, China, the Dominican Republic, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan.

In 2011, Greene supposedly got into a fight with former Kings teammate, DeMarcus Cousins. He was also arrested for fighting with former St. Louis Rams linebacker Jo-Lonn Dunbar outside a Miami nightclub in 2014.

Arrest records indicate Greene currently resides in Waldorf, Maryland, about 75 miles south of Towson, Maryland, where Greene grew up. Why he was in Indiana at the time of the incident is unclear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-nba-dud-accused-of-attempting-to-rob-gas-station,2022-11-17
Report: Former Obama officials are currently advising Iran on how to counter President Trump,"Former officials from the Obama administration are reportedly advising Iran amid escalating tensions with U.S., running an independent foreign policy initiative to counter President Donald Trump.

What are the details?

According to left-leaning outlet the Daily Beast, architects of the Iran nuclear deal, secured by former President Barack Obama, have been in talks with Iranian officials over the past two months — including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif — both over the phone and in person, urging the regime to ""stay calm"" and ""not take Trump's bait.""

None of the ""several"" former Obama aides interviewed by the Daily Beast were named, but they were apparently willing to explain what type of counsel they were providing Iranian higher-ups and insisted their ongoing interactions with the Islamic Republic are ""normal.""

Journalists Betsy Woodruff and Erin Banco noted that ""conversations of this nature sometimes generate"" accusations of violating the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from engaging in discussions relevant to a U.S. dispute with another country on behalf of the government.

The authors also pointed out ""the likelihood that former Obama officials could face such a charge is basically zero percent,"" given the fact that no one has ever been convicted under the 1799 law.

The ex-officials would not answer whether or not they had funneled information from the Iranian government to congressional Democrats, but admitted to educating Democratic members of Congress on their experience working with Iranian leaders.

A Republican aide told the Daily Beast those actions are problematic.

""It's not just about what they were saying to the Iranians,"" the anonymous staffer said. ""It's about what they were saying to their political allies back here in the U.S. Their strategy was to divide and isolate the Trump administration just as the Trump administration was trying to re-establish deterrence with Iran.

""In the current highly partisan political environment, the only safe course is to signal national unity — and they contributed to eroding that at home and abroad,"" the staffer added.



Anything else?

The United States' relationship with Tehran has been shaky for decades, but became more tense after President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the regime. Meanwhile, Iran has been threatening to reverse course on its promises to remaining signatories under the deal by resuming production of highly enriched uranium.

Fellow Iranian rivals Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have blamed Tehran for recent attacks on oil tankers and a Saudi pipeline, further complicating matters. But both sides remain entrenched, with the U.S. demanding Iran stop funding Islamic terrorist groups and imposing its strict theocracy on its people while Iran has dug in its heels out of protest of the economic sanctions.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech Wednesday, ""We will not negotiate [with the United States], as negotiations are useless and may even incur harm.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-obama-officials-advising-iran,2019-05-31
"Former Rep. Allen West resigns as chair of Texas GOP, fueling speculation of another run","Former Florida congressman and retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West is stepping down as chair of the Texas Republican Party, sparking rumors that he is looking at another run for office.

What are the details?

The Texas GOP issued a statement Friday morning announcing that West ""submitted his irrevocable resignation to the officials' meeting"" and ""will remain at the helm of the Texas GOP until a new Chairman can be selected on July 11th at an undetermined location as of now.""

The party wrote that West ""expressed his humble gratitude and stated that 'it has been my distinct honor to serve as Chairman of the Republican Party of Texas. I pray Godspeed for this governing body.'""

""Lt. Col. Allen West will take this opportunity to prayerfully reflect on a new chapter in his already distinguished career,"" the news release went on to say.

The Washington Times reported that West's ""resignation comes less than a year after he entered the job."" The outlet went on to note that ""the former congressman has not ruled out challenging Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who was endorsed by former President [Donald] Trump on Wednesday.""

The Texas Tribune reported that West also raised the prospect of a run for Congress. He is a resident of the 32nd Congressional District, ""and there's a guy in Texas 32 I really don't care for being my congressional representative,"" West said, the outlet reported. That incumbent is Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas.



West did not say when he would announce a decision on his next step, the Tribune reported. He told a reporter that his ""timeline is in my head and not in yours yet.""

Anything else?

The Texas Republican Party also stated that West's ""tenure has been marked by a remarkable commitment to our grassroots organizers as well as tireless effort to make gains on our Legislative Priorities such as Constitutional Carry, the Heart Beat Bill, and Election Integrity.""

West made headlines last December when he suggested some states secede from the United States in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court turning down Texas' lawsuit seeking to overturn Electoral College votes in four other states.

""This decision will have far reaching ramifications for the future or our constitutional republic,"" West wrote at the time.

Social conservatives slam Fox News for airing pride month segment on transgender teen,"Social conservatives slammed Fox News on Friday after the cable network aired a lengthy segment praising a transgender California teenager as an ""inspiration"" for LGBTQ+ pride month.

""Pride month continues as we highlight the story of Ryland Whittington, who's journey of transitioning at age 5 has been seen by seven million people in a family YouTube video,"" said anchor Dana Perino as she introduced the controversial segment on ""America's Newsroom"" Friday.



Fox News correspondent Bryan Llenas then reported on Ryland Whittington, a 14-year-old gender dysphoric girl who identifies and presents as a boy.

“If you saw me walking down the street you wouldn’t think anything different,” Ryland says at the beginning of the segment.

“14-year-old Ryland Whittington is a typical southern California teenager. And the Whittingtons, along with mom Hillary, dad Jeff, and sister Brynley are a typical family. The only difference though, in Ryland’s eyes, is what this family can mean to the tens of thousands of kids under 18 who identify as transgender,” Llenas reported.

“We put our story out there so people could see that, like, there's another family out there that is going through what we’re going through or there is another family who is proud of who they are,"" Ryland said.

Watch:



The Whittingtons claim they knew their child was transgender even before Ryland could speak.

“I could see it. It wasn’t him trying to be a brat. It was like painful. It was truly painful for him to have to wear feminine clothing and for us constantly telling him that you're a girl,” said Ryland's mother, Hillary.

When Ryland vocalized her gender confusion at age 5, her parents ""fully embraced"" her new identity as a boy, Llenas reported.

“We were confused like most people are. We thought gender and sexuality were the same thing. It took us a while to figure out those two things are different and that children actually do recognize their gender identity very young. Some of them, not all,” Hillary said.

She claims that her ""conservative faith"" led her to believe that God made Ryland transgender.

“For me, it is just a deep spiritual belief that you believe in God and he created us the way he wanted us and he created Ryland just the way he is,” Hillary said.

The Whittington family said they want Ryland's story to raise awareness for how transgender youths are at a higher risk of self-harm when their self-proclaimed gender identities are not accepted. Llenas reported statistics from the Trevor Project, a suicide hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, that show more than 50% of transgender youths consider suicide.

“That was the turning point. I didn’t want to see Ryland go through that,” said Ryland’s father Jeff.

“I would rather have a living son than a dead daughter,"" added his wife Hillary.



""I guarantee that if we had pushed back and done what a lot of parents do, I don’t think we would have either one of the kids that you see before you here today,” she said.

The family has written a book, ""Raising Ryland,"" that chronicles their experience. They also posted a YouTube video telling Ryland's story in 2014 that has since been viewed more than 8 million times.

“I’m just here to make the ride smoother for others. You might be struggling right now but we believe in you. This family, we might not know you, we might not know where you live but, you know, we understand you and we believe in you,” Ryland concluded.

“What extraordinary courage, displayed by Ryland, his sister Brynley, father Jeff, and mom Hillary. I want to thank the family for speaking to us,” Llenas said at the end of the segment. ""It is not easy, particularly at a time when transgender issues have been politicized. People are afraid of what they don’t understand, Dana. This family hopes their story will lead to more understanding, more acceptance, and ultimately more love.""

Social conservatives reacted poorly to the Fox News segment, which was aired as part of the network's diversity programming for Pride Month.

""I’m stunned that Fox News ran a segment celebrating a girl whose parents 'transitioned' her into a boy when she was 5 because she apparently told them she was a boy 'before [she] could talk,'"" tweeted BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey of ""Relatable.""

""For those saying, 'why are you stunned?' Look - of course we all knew most at Fox are socially liberal. But THIS? Is a whole other level. It’s as extreme and depraved as it gets,"" she said in a follow-up tweet.

""Fox has become Jenner’s press agent, so this is sadly its next logical descent into the mouth of madness,"" BlazeTV host Steve Deace of ""The Steve Deace Show"" said, quoting Stuckey's tweet and referring to Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender former Olympic athlete who has since been hired as a contributor by Fox News.

Conservative radio host Erick Erickson commented that the segment on Ryland was likely to hurt Fox News' reputation as the go-to cable news channel for conservatives.

""Fox News promoting trans propaganda is something to behold. That’s gonna hurt the network more than calling Arizona for Biden,"" Erickson tweeted.

Others slammed Fox News for promoting the pro-trans position.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-pride-month-transgender,2022-06-10
France bans gender-neutral words in schools harmful language,"France has banned the use of gender-neutral language in schools, bucking the recent woke culture trend spreading throughout academia around the world.

Gender equality advocates were pushing for full stops in the middle of written words, which they called ""midpoints,"" that would allow both male and female forms of the word to be represented at the same time. The Daily Mail reported, ""In French grammar, nouns take on the gender of the subject to which they refer, with male preferred over female in mixed settings.""

However, the Academie Francaise or the French Academy, which is the 400-year-old education authority responsible for preserving the French language, shot down the woke proposal. The Academie Francaise declared the overture to be ""harmful to the practice and understanding of [French].""

Nathalie Elimas, France's state secretary for priority education, said the proposed gender-neutral changes were ""a danger for our country"" and ""the death knell for the use of French in the world."" Elimas added that the use of midpoints ""dislocates words, breaks them into two.""

Elimas said the changes would push people to learn English, which doesn't gender nouns, instead of French, ""With the spread of inclusive writing, the English language—already quasi-hegemonic across the world—would certainly and perhaps forever defeat the French language.""

France's education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that the midpoints would present challenges for learning disabilities, including dyslexia.

""In addition, this writing, which results in the fragmentation of words and agreements, constitutes an obstacle to reading and understanding the written word,"" Blanquer stated. ""The impossibility of verbally transcribing texts using this type of writing hampers reading aloud as well as pronunciation, and consequently learning, especially for the youngest.""

Despite the decision from the Academie Francaise, a French teacher's union, the SUD Education Union, attacked the ruling and even instructed schools to ignore it.

""SUD Education demands from the Minister that he stop trying to impose his backwardness on the educational community,"" the statement read. ""SUD calls on staff to take no account of these instructions from another time, and to exercise as they wish, depending on professional situations, the full use of their pedagogical freedom.""



Top French politicians, journalists, and intellectuals have recently become concerned about woke ""out-of-control leftism and cancel culture'' from the United States and how it could affect French culture.

""Emboldened by these comments, prominent intellectuals have banded together against what they regard as contamination by the out-of-control woke leftism of American campuses and its attendant cancel culture,"" the New York Times reported in February. ""With its echoes of the American culture wars, the battle began inside French universities but is being played out increasingly in the media. Politicians have been weighing in more and more, especially following a turbulent year during which a series of events called into question tenets of French society.""

French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a speech in October, where he sounded the alarm about ""certain social science theories entirely imported from the United States.""

""Many of these topics in which France used to excel academically have been undermined and we have abandoned them,"" Macron said in his speech. ""And in so doing, we have left the intellectual debate to others, to those outside of the Republic by ideologizing it, sometimes yielding to other academic traditions…And when I see certain social science theories entirely imported from the United States, with their problems, which I respect and which exist, but which are just added to ours, I say to myself that it is reasonable to make this choice. And so we must, very clearly, re-invest, on a massive scale, in the field of social sciences, history, understanding of civilizations by creating posts, by stepping up dialogue, academic and scientific debate in order not to allow the knowledge, the understanding of Islam as a religion, of the civilization it underpins and its contribution to our country and our continent to become ideological and exclusively political debates.""

In October, Blanquer warned that there is a need to fight the ideologies coming from American universities.

""No one has the right to cowardice anymore,"" Blanquer said, according to the Daily Wire. ""There is a fight to be waged against an intellectual matrix coming from American universities and intersectional theses, which want to essentialize communities and identities, at the antipodes of our republican model which, for its part, postulates equality between human beings, independently of their characteristics of origin, sex, religion. It is the breeding ground for a fragmentation of our society and a vision of the world which converges with the interests of the Islamists.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/france-bans-gender-neutral-words-schools,2021-05-16

French President Macron accuses American media of 'legitimizing' Islamist violence,"French President Emmanuel Macron accused American media of ""bias"" and of ""legitimizing"" Islamic violence in a phone call with a New York Times columnist, the paper reported Sunday.

Macron called Times media columnist Ben Smith to complain about how American media has covered the French government's response to terrorism. During the call, Macron argued that English-language coverage of recent Islamic terror attacks in France and the French government's crackdown on Islamic extremism in response has been unfairly characterized as racist or Islamophobic by the media.

""When France was attacked five years ago, every nation in the world supported us,"" President Macron said, referring to the Nov. 13, 2015, coordinated terrorist attacks at the Bataclan theater, outside a soccer stadium, and at Parisian cafes.

""So when I see, in that context, several newspapers which I believe are from countries that share our values — journalists who write in a country that is the heir to the Enlightenment and the French Revolution — when I see them legitimizing this violence, and saying that the heart of the problem is that France is racist and Islamophobic, then I say the founding principles have been lost,"" he continued.

The Times reports that more than 250 people have died in terror attacks in France since 2015. Last month, a French teacher was beheaded by a Chechen refugee in apparent retaliation for showing his class a cartoon of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Following that attack, three more people were brutally assaulted and one of them was beheaded inside a church in Nice.

In response to the threat of Islamic terror, Marcon's administration ordered a crackdown on extremism, initiating raids of suspected terrorists' homes, dissolving associations accused of spreading Islamic propaganda, and targeting terrorist funding. Macron has also denounced what he calls ""Islamist separatism."" In a major speech delivered in October, Macron said Muslims living in France under their own religious laws and within their own religious communities present a danger to the country by forming a ""counter-society."" He announced several policies that are intended to make Islam in France inclusive of French citizenship, including strictly monitoring sports organizations and other associations to stop the spread of Islamist teaching; ending the practices of imams being sent to France from abroad; increasing oversight of funding for mosques; and restricting homeschooling. The goal, as Macron states, is to craft a modern ""Islam of the Enlightenment.""

Muslims around the world have called for boycotts against French goods and responded with outrage to the French government's policies. An opinion article published by the Financial Times on Nov. 3 declared, ""Macron's war on Islamic separatism only divides France further,"" arguing Macron's policies were alienating peaceful Muslims.



Macron's critics in the media have accused him of implementing policies that discriminate against the Islamic faith, but Macron says American media doesn't understand the French policy of ""laïcité,"" or ""secularism."" The French government maintains an active separation of church an state, and the purpose of these policies is to ensure that the practice of Islam in France respects French law and French citizenship.

""We don't believe in political Islam that is not compatible with stability and peace in the world,"" Macron said in October. He defined ""Islamist separatism"" as ""a conscious, theorised, politico-religious project, which is materialised by repeated discrepancies with the values of the republic, which often results in the creation of a counter-society and whose manifestations are the dropping out of school of children, the development of sports, cultural and communal practices which are the pretext for the teaching of principles which do not conform to the laws of the republic""

Macron believes America's experience with racism has biased the media's judgement and caused a misunderstanding of what the French government is trying to accomplish.



""There is a sort of misunderstanding about what the European model is, and the French model in particular,"" Macron told the Times. ""American society used to be segregationist before it moved to a multiculturalist model, which is essentially about coexistence of different ethnicities and religions next to one another.""

""Our model is universalist, not multiculturalist,"" he continued. ""In our society, I don't care whether someone is black, yellow or white, whether they are Catholic or Muslim, a person is first and foremost a citizen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/french-president-macron-accuses-american-media-of-legitimizing-islamist-violence,2020-11-16
George Soros-backed organization is now engaged in anti-gun lobbying,"According to a report from the Washington Free Beacon, billionaire liberal activist George Soros — through his Open Society Policy Center — is now actively lobbying on legislation that would have the effect of targeting gun manufacturers.

What are the details?



In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which protects firearms manufacturers from lawsuits brought by victims of the criminal acts of some gun users. The legislation was passed in response to a growing effort on the part of anti-gun activists to litigate the gun industry out of business by encouraging shooting victims to sue gun manufacturers for the activities of criminals.

The law does not shield gun manufacturers from all liability. Gun manufacturers can still be sued for defective manufacturing or design issues. However, it does ""prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or ammunition products, and their trade associations, for the harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products by others when the product functioned as designed and intended.""

According to the Free Beacon, Soros' Open Society Policy Center spent $2.6 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2019 on a variety of issues, including ""a bill to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act."" The disclosure did not reveal what portion of the $2.6 million total was allocated to this specific issue.

The bill passed both houses of Congress with broad bipartisan support in 2005, passing the House by a vote of 283-144 and the Senate by a vote of 65-31. However, Hillary Clinton promised to support repeal of the law during the 2016 campaign, and even Sen. Bernie Sanders, who voted for the law in 2005, said that he would support a partial repeal of the bill.

According to the Trace, every single major Democratic candidate for president in 2020 now supports repealing the bill, including Biden, who voted against the original bill, and Sanders.

George Stephanopoulos ignores Gov. Kristi Noem as she rattles off examples of voting irregularities — but Noem puts the smack down later on,"George Stephanopoulos — host of ABC News' ""This Week"" and prominent member of former President Bill Clinton's administration — seemed to ignore or mischaracterize South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem's examples of voting irregularities in last week's presidential election.

What are the details?

During Sunday's interview, Stephanopoulos asked Noem if she would work with former Vice President Joe Biden — whom numerous media outlets on Saturday declared the winner of the 2020 election over President Donald Trump — with regard to the coronavirus.

Noem's interview came after far-left New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's, in which he urged Republicans to accept Biden's victory and predicted more governors will acknowledge the pandemic's severity once Trump leaves office, Townhall reported.

""Well, it is a regional increase that we're seeing. We are testing more,"" Noem replied. ""And, frankly ... I'm not going to take advice from Gov. Cuomo. He has the second-worst death rate per 100,000 people in this nation. He's at 173 deaths per 100,000 per capita; South Dakota's at 54.""



She then noted such questions are ""premature"" since the election technically isn't over, and legal challenges from the Trump camp appear to be on the way.

""We have not finished counting votes,"" Noem said. ""There're states that have not been called, and back in 2000, [Democratic presidential nominee] Al Gore was given his day in court. We should give President Trump his day in court, let the process unfold because, George, we live in a republic. We are a government that gets its power from the consent of the governed. That is the people. They give their consent on Election Day. Election Day needs to be fair, honest, and transparent, and we need to be sure that we had an honest election before we decide who gets to be in the White House the next four years.""

Stephanopolous rushed in to interrupt while Noem was finishing her sentence, asking if she had any evidence that it wasn't an honest election and adding that he's spoken with Republican officials who gave ""zero evidence"" of widespread fraud.

Besides the fact that voting irregularities in a handful of swing states are at issue as opposed to ""widespread fraud,"" Noem told Stephanopolous his assertions were ""absolutely not true"" and that ""people have signed legal documents, affidavits, stating that they saw illegal activities, and that is why we need to have this conversation in court. The New York Times itself said that there were clerical errors. ... In Michigan we had computer glitches that changed Republican votes to Democrat votes. ... Dead people voted in Pennsylvania.""

""So George, I don't know how widespread it is. I don't know if it will change the outcome of the election,"" she added. ""But why is everybody so scared just to have a fair election and find out? We gave Al Gore 37 days to run the process before we decided who was going to be president. Why would we not afford the 70.6 million Americans that voted for Trump the same consideration? If Joe Biden really wants to unify this country, he would wait and make sure we had a fair election.""

By the end of the interview, despite all the points Noem made, Stephanopoulos wedged in a whopper, saying ""It starts with providing evidence; you still have not provided that, but I'm afraid we're out of time today. Gov. Noem, thanks for your time.""

""Let the process work, and we will,"" she said.

The smack comes down

Noem wasn't about to let things go after the interview. She replied to the ""This Week"" video tweet of her chat with Stephanopoulos — and added a well-deserved zinger when the intrepid poster referred to her state as ""North Dakota"":

""More mischaracterization from ABC,"" she wrote. ""Watch the interview, I gave several specific instances of serious election integrity concerns. Oh, and it's SOUTH Dakota"":",https://www.theblaze.com/news/george-stephanopoulos-ignores-kristi-noem,2020-11-09
George W. Bush compares 9/11 terrorists to 'violent extremists at home' in commemorative speech,"Former President George W. Bush on Saturday seemingly compared ""violent extremists at home"" to the Al Qaeda terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

The comparison was widely reported as a thinly veiled allusion to those Americans who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

What did Bush say?

While commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, which happened during his first presidential term, Bush warned of ""growing evidence"" that terrorism threats do not only come from abroad.

""We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within,"" Bush said. ""There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home.""

""But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit. And it is our continuing duty to confront them,"" he continued.

The Washington Post reported that Bush, [w]ithout naming it, Bush seemed to condemn the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol."" CNN agreed, publishing a story with the headline, ""Bush alludes to US Capitol rioters when condemning violent extremists behind 9/11 attacks.""

Bush delivered his speech at the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Forty people — 33 passengers and seven crew members — were aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when it was hijacked by terrorists. Those passengers and crew members bravely thwarted the terrorists' plan to fly that plane into the U.S. Capitol building or White House. After storming the flight deck, United 93 crashed in rural Pennsylvania.

What did Bush say about the Capitol Riot?

Bush vocally condemned the events of Jan. 6, releasing a statement that called the riots ""sickening and heartbreaking.""

""This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic,"" Bush said.

""I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,"" Bush continued. ""The violent assault on the Capitol — and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress — was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes. Insurrection could do grave damage to our Nation and reputation.""

""In the United States of America, it is the fundamental responsibility of every patriotic citizen to support the rule of law,"" Bush added. ""To those who are disappointed in the results of the election: Our country is more important than the politics of the moment. Let the officials elected by the people fulfill their duties and represent our voices in peace and safety.""

Glenn Beck retracts apology for calling former President Barack Obama 'racist': 'I was exactly right!',"Conservative media mogul Glenn Beck has retracted his apology for referring to former President Barack Obama as a ""racist,"" telling Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he was ""exactly right"" the whole time.

What's a brief history here?

In 2009, Beck blasted the former president as having a ""deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.""

""This guy,"" the conservative firebrand said at the time, ""is, I believe, a racist.""

In 2016, Beck expressed regret over the remarks in an interview with the New York Times, and said, ""I know I wouldn't believe me if I heard myself apologizing, so I'm telling you now: Don't take my word for it. Watch my actions. I don't care what you think about me. All I care about is saying, 'Please, don't make the mistake I made.'""

What's he saying now?

On Wednesday night, Beck told Carlson that he was absolutely right back in 2009 when he made the remarks about Obama and said he never should have doubted himself.

He made the admission in response to the former president's recent remarks in which he told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he believes right-wing media is ""stoking the fear and resentment"" of white people.

""I take my apology back,"" Beck told Carlson. ""I was exactly right, and I even stated it right. You are a racist if you believe in critical race theory. If you think that what Dr. Martin Luther King said, that he envisions a country that is seeing people for the content of their character and not their color, if you think that's wrong, then yes — you are a racist.""

In an interview that aired Monday, Obama said, ""There are certain right-wing media venues, for example, that monetize and capitalize on stoking the fear and resentment of a white population that is witnessing a changing America and seeing demographic changes. And do everything they can to give people a sense that their way of life is threatened and that people are trying to take advantage of them.""

He also joked that Republicans are more concerned with critical race theory than what he said are more pressing issues like climate change and the economy.

""What are we going to do about climate change, what are we going to do about — lo and behold, the biggest single most important issue to them apparently right now is critical race theory,"" Obama added. ""Who knew that was the threat to our republic?""

Obama is back to divide America as much as he can www.youtube.com

What else?

Earlier on Wednesday, Beck blasted Obama as ""Marxist.""

During his radio show, Beck said that Obama helped — and continues to help usher in — a radical, Marxist ideology.

""Mr. Obama, you lied,"" he said. ""You used the IRS to hunt down your enemy. You spied on the media. And your health care package, which was supposed to save every American $3,000 per year, has helped some, perhaps, while raising the cost of everyone's health care in double and triple percentages. But the worst thing that you did, is you planted, you watered, and you protected the Marxist seeds, by crying race.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/glenn-beck-retracts-apology-obama-racist,2021-06-10
GOP congressional candidate lifts himself up from his wheelchair to stand 'for our Republic' in RNC speech,"North Carolina Republican congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn delivered a speech with a powerful ending to the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, raising himself up from his wheelchair to stand ""for our Republic.""

What are the details?

""This is a time of great adversity for our country, and I know something about adversity,"" Cawthorn began, explaining that a car accident when he was 18 years old left him paralyzed from the waist down.

The 25-year-old went on to detail his first experience going out in public in a wheelchair to a professional baseball game, recalling that he ""felt invisible"" from his new perspective after previously standing at 6-foot-3.

He revealed that at the age of 20, he ""thought about giving up,"" but he persevered knowing that he could still make an impact.

""My accident has given me new eyes to see and new ears to hear,"" Cawthorn said. ""So, I say to people who feel forgotten, ignored and invisible: I see you. I hear you.""

The Hill noted that:

Cawthorn, if elected in North Carolina's largely Republican 11th district, will be the youngest-ever member of Congress, something he noted in his remarks, saying 'if you don't think young people can change the world than you just don't know American history.'

He pointed to the accomplishments of figures like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and James Madison in their twenties, adding 'In times of peril young people have stepped up and saved this country abroad and at home. We held the line, scaled the cliffs, crossed oceans, liberated camps and cracked codes.'

'You can kneel before God, but stand for our flag'

As he started to wrap up his speech, Cawthorn told viewers, ""You can kneel before God, but stand for our flag.""

Two other men walked up to Cawthorn from either side of him at that point, as the candidate continued, ""The American idea my ancestors fought for during The Revolutionary War is just as exciting and revolutionary today as it was 250 years ago. I say to Americans who love our country — young and old — be a radical for freedom. Be a radical for liberty.""

Cawthorn grabbed the bars of a walker stabilized by the men assisting him as he said, ""Be a radical for our republic. For which I stand.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-congressional-candidate-stands-wheelchair,2020-08-27
GOP lawmakers introduce resolution to literally hold China accountable for COVID-19 pandemic,"As China attempts to shift blame for the coronavirus pandemic to the United States, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is working to ensure that China's communist government is held responsible for unleashing COVID-19.



Hawley introduced a resolution on Tuesday demanding that China literally pay for its actions.

The resolution calls for an ""international investigation into the handling by the Government of the People's Republic of China of COVID–19"" and details in damning fashion the actions that China took to cover up COVID-19 that triggered the current pandemic.

Hawley's resolution ultimately demands that China compensate the world ""for the harm caused by its decision to hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 during the initial weeks of the outbreak.""

The Missouri Republican said in a statement:

Since day one, the Chinese Communist Party intentionally lied to the world about the origin of this pandemic. The CCP was aware of the reality of the virus as early as December but ordered laboratories to destroy samples and forced doctors to keep silent. It is time for an international investigation into the role their cover-up played in the spread of this devastating pandemic. The CCP must be held to account for what the world is now suffering.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) introduced a companion resolution in the House.

""There is no doubt that China's unconscionable decision to orchestrate an elaborate coverup of the wide-ranging and deadly implications of coronavirus led to the death of thousands of people, including hundreds of Americans and climbing,"" Stefanik said. ""This Resolution calls for China to provide compensation for the harm, loss, and destruction their arrogance brought upon the rest of the world. Simply put — China must, and will, be held accountable.""

The COVID-19 outbreak has forced America to once again re-think its interdependence with communist China.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) has introduced legislation to end America's pharmaceutical dependence on China, which produces the majority of pharmaceutical ingredients that the U.S. uses.

What is not yet clear is how or if the COVID-19 pandemic will impact America's relationship with the World Health Organization, which has proved itself to bemore of a puppet for China's communist government than international ally.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-lawmakers-introduce-resolution-to-literally-hold-china-accountable-for-covid-19-pandemic,2020-03-25
GOP report finds Wuhan lab was carrying out suspicious activity months before the start of the pandemic,"New information published over the weekend by congressional Republicans raises further suspicions about the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic began as a result of the dangerous pathogen accidentally leaking from a Chinese lab.

In a report released Sunday, Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), alleged that major renovations totaling well over $1 billion were requested to air safety and waste treatment systems at the Wuhan Institute of Virology just months before the pandemic began.

Interestingly, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, the pathogen-focused lab within the complex where the renovations were to occur, had only been operational for less than two years.

""Such a significant renovation so soon after the facility began operation appears unusual,"" wrote Republicans in the report, adding that ""procurement announcements published on the [People's Republic of China's] government procurement website provide evidence of ongoing work at what appears to be both WIV locations.""

""The procurement of an environmental air disinfection system, and renovations to the hazardous waste treatment system and central air conditioning system all raise questions about how well these systems were functioning in the months prior to the outbreak of COVID-19,"" the lawmakers added.

While the official reason for the procurement posting remains unclear, Republicans on the committee argue it adds to the growing ""preponderance of evidence suggest[ing] SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally released from a Wuhan Institute of Virology laboratory.""

The theory suggesting the novel coronavirus leaked from a Chinese lab has picked up steam in recent months as circumstantial evidence continues to pile up. Under significant pressure, President Joe Biden changed tune in May and asked the intelligence community to ""redouble"" efforts to investigate the pandemic's origin, acknowledging for the first time that the lab leak theory holds water.

But calls for a serious investigation hit roadblocks recently after the Chinese Communist Party denied independent researchers from the World Health Organization access to the compound. Now, without cooperation from the Chinese government, many remain skeptical that a concrete determination will ever be attained.

Nevertheless, using a combination of open-sourced data, other publicly available information, and interviews with scientists and intelligence officials, Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee have built an argument suggesting the virus escaped the WIV ""sometime prior to September 12, 2019"" — and that the Chinese government knew about it.

They allege that on that day, a notice for lab inspections was issued and the WIV's viral sequence and sample database were taken offline. Then later in the evening, the WIV published a tender requesting bids for ""security services"" as the WNBL, including ""gatekeepers, guards, video surveillance, security patrols, and people to handle the 'registration and reception of foreign personnel.'""

Grocery store faces calls for a boycott after its immigrant owner offers a 20% discount to Trump supporters,"People are calling for a boycott of a grocery store in Oakdale, New York, after its owner — Jose Colon, who hails from the Dominican Republic — had the apparent audacity to offer Trump supporters a deep discount on their purchases.

The backlash and demand for a boycott even continued after he conceded and even said he was open to offering the same discount for supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden.

What are the details of the offer?

On Wednesday, the Fresh Food Supermarket advertised the discount on its Facebook page.

A portion of the now-viral ad read, ""Trump supporters get 20% off[.] Mention at the cash register you are a Trump supporter to get discount[.] (Excludes beer)[.]""

The ad, at the time of this reporting, has sparked a frenzy of remarks.

What's happening now?

According to Fox News, social media users took issue with the discount and reportedly threatened to boycott the store and call the local health department.

Colon told the outlet, ""We're supposed to live in a free country. This is weird. It's crazy.""

He explained that he would honor the same discount for Biden supporters.

""We live in a free country where we support democracy, where we can go both ways, we can support left, right — whatever you want,"" he explained. ""I decided to vote and support the best interest, I believe, for this country.""

Colon added that he was not pleased with the response to the offer.

""I'm an immigrant as well,"" he told Fox. ""I came here to this country legally, and I've been working hard since day one.""

Colon noted that he's made his point and is content to live with the backlash.

""If this is gonna cause me losing my store, I'll run it until Election Day,"" he insisted. ""I'll run it until the last day.""

According to WABC-TV, Colon added, ""I don't try to make any kind of division with politics.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/grocery-store-boycott-trump-discount,2020-10-23
There’s a giant statue celebrating Saudi Arabia near ground zero in NYC — here’s why,"A sculpture celebrating Saudi Arabia was erected near the site of the World Trade Center has raised some eyebrows. Fifteen of the 19 terrorists who participated in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks were Saudi nationals. But this particular sculpture has nothing to do with Sept. 11.

Here's what we know

This particular sculpture is one of a set of 20, each representing one of the nations that participate in the G-20 summit.

According to a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey:

The exhibit, known as ""Candy Nations"", will feature the unique candy sculptures in various locations around the site, including One World Observatory/West Plaza, Liberty Park, Oculus Plaza, the West Concourse, and the Tower 2 Plaza. Each of the sculptures features flags from countries in the G20 summit, and the art work was commissioned by companies and organizations including the Chanel Foundation, the International Olympic Committee and Coca-Cola.

The art exhibit has already been displayed in 25 countries.

The G-20, officially known as the ""Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy,"" is an annual gathering of the leaders of 20 economic powerhouses: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Republic of South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the European Union (EU). Together, these nations make up 86 percent of the total global economy. The last summit took place between Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The sculptures, crafted by renowned French artist Laurence Jenkell, have become a traveling art exhibit since the summit ended, and the World Trade Center site is their current stop.

Jenkell has done other, similar art exhibits, including one resembling a piece of blue candy with the flag of the European Union on it. She has a whole series of sculptures of candy featuring various designs.

Haitian President Jovenel Moïse assassinated in his home late Tuesday night; wife shot during 'inhuman and barbaric' attack,"Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, 53, was assassinated in his home late Tuesday night, according to variousreports, and his wife suffered bullet wounds during the attack.

She remains hospitalized at the time of this reporting.

His murder takes place against a backdrop of horrific, ongoing violence in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, perpetuated by at least 95 armed gangs carrying out acts of arson, assault, murder, and shootings.

What are the details?

A statement from interim Prime Minster Claude Joseph revealed that an unidentified group stormed Moïse's home and killed him.

Joseph condemned the attack, saying it was an ""odious, inhuman, and barbaric act.""

According to reports, some of the attackers were described as Spanish-speaking.

""A group of individuals who have not been identified, some of whom were speaking Spanish, attacked the private residence of the President of the Republic and fatally injured the Head of State,"" Joseph said in a statement. ""All measures have been taken to ensure the continuity of the State and to protect the Nation. Democracy and the Republic will win out.""

In February, large protests took place in the country questioning the legitimacy of Moïse's presidency. The nation missed its 2018 election, as Moïse said the country was too unstable to hold free and fair elections, and he continued serving as president.

That same month, Moïse said that his security detail foiled an assassination attempt against him.

""I thank my head of security at the palace,"" he said at the time. ""The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life. ... That plan was aborted.""

"Hillary Clinton compares Trump to Hitler, MAGA fans to Nazis","Hillary Clinton recently likened former President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. She also compared MAGA supporters at Friday's Trump rally to Nazis.

Earlier this month, Trump held a rally in Youngstown, Ohio. Near the conclusion of the rally, some Trump supporters made a one-finger gesture that was likely an endorsement of the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Trump held his latest rally in Wilmington, North Carolina. During Friday's event, a handful of attendees made the pointing finger gesture. However, security at the Trump event are seen on video asking people to stop making the hand motion.

PBS ""NewsHour"" correspondent Lisa Desjardins was at Friday night's rally, and said, ""Confirmed with people at Trump rally who held 1 finger up that they meant it as a symbol of QAnon’s 'Where We Go One We Go All' and further… Security staff here fanned out and told people to take down their fingers. That is a reason why – maybe main reason - we saw fewer"" finger gestures than in the previous rally.

""The man in this photo held up 1 finger and told me he meant it as a WWG1WGA sign – and then the security guard in the next photo told him to take it down. He was furious 'that's my Constitutional right!' The man in the crowd told me after I saw that interaction happen,"" Desjardins wrote on Twitter.

Desjardins said the security staff ""clearly had been directed to watch for this kind of gesture and to shut it down.""

Hillary Clinton said the MAGA supporters making the finger gesture were like Adolf Hitler supporters doing the Sieg Heil salute of the Nazis.

On Friday, Clinton spoke at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.

Clinton said, ""I remember as a young student, you know, trying to figure out, how people get basically brought in by Hitler. How did that happen? I'd watch newsreels and I'd see this guy standing up there ranting and raving, and people shouting and raising their arms. I thought, 'What's happened to these people? Why do they believe that?'""

She continued, ""You saw the rally in Ohio the other night, Trump is there ranting and raving for more than an hour, and you have these rows of young men with their arms raised. I thought, 'What is going on?'""

Clinton theorized, ""So there is a real pressure – and I think it is fair to say we're in a struggle between democracy and autocracy.""

Taylor Budowich – a spokesman for Trump – blasted Clinton for ""using some of the most disgusting smears imaginable.""

""It seems like perpetual-failed-candidate Hillary Clinton’s basket of deplorables has run stale, not unlike herself,"" Budowich told Fox News. ""It's pathetic, it’s divisive, and it is further cementing her legacy of cringe.""

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Hillary Clinton denigrated half of Trump's supporters as a ""basket of deplorables.""

""You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Clinton said in September 2016. ""The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.""

Hong Kong speech therapists jailed for printing ‘seditious’ children’s books,"Five Hong Kong speech therapists were convicted of sedition this week after they printed a series of children’s books that a court said was anti-government.

Reuters reports that the therapists “were accused of publishing three picture books, featuring cartoons of sheep and wolves, which government prosecutors alleged had spread separatism and stirred up hatred and opposition to the government.”

In one book, according to Reuters, wolves want to occupy a village and eat the sheep, who in turn start to fight back.

The books referenced actual events, including Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests in 2019 and the pro-democracy protesters who fled Hong Kong by speedboat in 2020 and were captured by Chinese authorities.

""What the defendants have done to the children aged 4 and above was in fact a brain-washing exercise with a view to guiding the very young children to accept their views and values,"" wrote the judge who convicted the therapists. The judge added, ""Children will be led into the belief that the [People's Republic of China] Government is coming to Hong Kong with the wicked intention of taking away their home and ruining their happy life with no right to do so at all.”

According to the BBC, the therapists were charged under a rarely-used British colonial-era sedition law rather than the 2020 national security law that has been used to crack down on other political crimes in Hong Kong.

The therapists were sentenced to 19 months in prison. One of the group's lawyers suggested that the five could be out of prison in 31 days once deductions were made. They had already spent over a year in prison prior to this week’s ruling.

In a statement released after the conviction, human rights group Amnesty International called for the immediate release of the therapists, saying the use of ""archaic"" sedition laws was a ""brazen act of repression"" and should be abolished.

""Writing books for children is not a crime, and attempting to educate children about recent events in Hong Kong’s history does not constitute an attempt to incite rebellion,"" the statement read.

""I don't regret my choice, and I hope I can always stand on the side of the sheep,"" said Melody Yeung, one of the therapists.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hong-kong-speech-therapists-jailed-for-printing-seditious-childrens-books,2022-09-10
House Intel Committee GOP says 'significant circumstantial evidence' shows COVID-19 outbreak came from Wuhan lab; CDC director admits it's a possibility,"Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee say there is ""significant circumstantial evidence"" that the coronavirus originated from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology. The GOP report released Wednesday hints that the Chinese military could have been secretly working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The report also suggests that the U.S. government ""may have funded or collaborated"" in the research that led to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Fox News.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who serves as the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and other Republicans on the committee released the 21-page report titled, ""In Focus: COVID-19 and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.""

""To prevent or quickly mitigate future pandemics, it's crucial for health experts and the U.S. Government to understand how the COVID-19 virus originated,"" the report states. ""International efforts to discover the true source of the virus, however, have been stymied by a lack of cooperation from the People's Republic of China (PRC).

""Nevertheless, significant circumstantial evidence raises serious concerns that the COVID-19 outbreak may have been a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" the report says.

The Republicans outline the evidence against China in the report:

China's history of research lab leaks resulting in infections.

Warnings from U.S. diplomats in China as early as 2017 that the Wuhan lab was conducting dangerous research on coronaviruses without following necessary safety protocols, risking the accidental outbreak of a pandemic.

Gain of Function research being conducted at the Wuhan lab that made coronaviruses more infectious in humans.

Several researchers at Wuhan lab were sickened with COVID-19-like symptoms in fall 2019.

The involvement in the Wuhan lab of the Chinese military, which has a documented biological weapons program.

Multiple indications of attempts by Beijing to cover up the true circumstances of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Republicans argue that the Communist Party of China has provided ""little circumstantial evidence"" to the country's claim that coronavirus ""was a natural occurrence, having jumped from some other species to humans."" The lawmakers note that China has yet to ""identify the original species that allegedly spread the virus to humans, which is critical to their zoonotic transfer theory.""

They add that the ""outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 pandemic could have been the result of an accidental leak from the WIV, particularly given the absence of credible information that supports a zoonotic transmission.""

The report highlights that U.S. government agencies and academic institutions ""may have funded or collaborated in Gain of Function research at the Wuhan lab.""

Previously, Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) have both questioned why the U.S. could be involved with gain-of-function research with the Chinese Communist Party. Paul has grilled Biden medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci about National Institutes of Health funding going to the Wuhan lab, and Johnson has demanded answers as to why the U.S. was cooperating with China in research. Both senators are concerned about gain-of-function research, where scientists deliberately make viruses more dangerous to humans in an effort to prepare for potential outbreaks, but presents a risk of an outbreak.

The report states, ""At least some of this research was published even after the U.S. Government had paused these kinds of studies in the United States due to ethical concerns over their biowarfare applicability and their potential to accidentally unleash a pandemic.""

""Beijing has hindered the conduct of a full, credible investigation,"" the Republican lawmakers say.

GOP House Intel members want the intelligence community to release all information it has about the origins of the coronavirus, and want a response by May 31.



Also on Wednesday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky did not rule out that the coronavirus originated from a laboratory.

During Senate testimony, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked Walensky, ""What, in your opinion, was the origin of the virus?""

""I don't believe I've seen enough data, individual data, for me to be able to comment on that,"" Walensky replied.

Kennedy then pressed the CDC director, ""What are the possibilities?""

""Certainly, the possibilities that most coronaviruses that we know of are of origin from — that have infected the population, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, generally come from an animal origin,"" Walensky responded.

""Are there any other possibilities?"" Kennedy followed up.

""Certainly, a lab-based origin is one possibility,"" Walensky admitted.

Robert Redfield, the former CDC director, has gone on the record to say that he believes that the COVID-19 pandemic started when the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab.

""I'm of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathology in Wuhan was from a laboratory — escaped,"" Redfield said in March. ""Other people don't believe that. That's fine. Science will eventually figure it out.



""It's not unusual for respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in a laboratory to infect the laboratory worker,"" he said. ""That's not implying any intentionality.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-intelligence-committee-coronavirus-origin-china,2021-05-20
"House Republicans release 'Commitment to America,' finalizing midterm messaging","House Republicans are readying for midterm elections in November. Media buys in the intervening months will only be as effective as the messages they permit politicians to transmit to voters. For this reason, and in hopes of achieving cohesion in the party's communications, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will officially unveil a four-piece ""Commitment to America"" on September 19 in Pittsburgh.

This package of commitments will indicate to voters not only what the GOP intends to combat in the way of Democrat policies, pernicious trends, and perceived corruption, but what it intends to deliver instead to the electorate. The latter is regarded by some as more important — communicating a positive message along with solutions rather than negative messaging.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) told Axios: ""If you're just running on anti-Biden, well, that's not going to get you over the finish line.""

When responding to President Joe Biden's claim that the Republican philosophy is ""semi-fascist,"" McCarthy hinted at the party's forward-looking thematics: ""Our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. Our nation can flourish again, and under a new historic Republic majority, it will.""

Axios reported that McCarthy's latest iteration of the House Republicans' ""Commitment to America"" is the product of the work of seven issue-specific task forces assigned to identify and develop policy solutions to the problems confronting the American people.

The issues tackled by the task forces were: jobs and the economy; big tech censorship and data; the future of American freedoms; energy, climate, and conservation; American security; a healthy future; and China accountability.

A communications kit disseminated by McCarthy last month hinted at the contents of the September 19 release as well as the task forces' determinations. The kit divided Republicans' commitment to America into four documents, detailed below.

""An economy that is strong""

The first document attributed an estimated 550% increase in inflation to Democrat spending and noted the impact of a 12% spike in food prices. It also emphasized American energy dependence, the high price of gasoline, and U.S. reliance on a hostile supply of critical goods (i.e. particularly on communist China).

The proposed remedies:

eliminate wasteful government spending;

reduce the cost of living and boost business with ""pro-growth tax policies"";

reconnect workers with jobs while also disincentivizing remote work;

end Biden's ""anti-energy policies"" and increase the production of American-made energy;

onshore supply lines and manufacturing; and

strengthen and modernize the U.S. stockpile of supplies and medicines.

""A nation that is safe""

The second document pointed to the fallout of the Biden administration's border policies, including the crime and drug deaths resulting from unchecked illegal immigration. It also noted the connections between ""Defund the Police"" initiatives and skyrocketing murders and between failed border policies and the unprecedented number of opioid overdoses.

The southern border and Democrat deference to criminals were not the only focuses, however; foreign policy concerns were also raised. The document stressed the geopolitical threat of communist China amid waning confidence in the U.S. military, particularly after Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The proposed remedies:

require proof of legal status when applying for a job;

restrict welfare benefits that incentivize illegal immigration;

end catch-and-release at the southern border;

finish building the border wall while also fully funding Border Patrol;

make violent crime against police officers a federal offense;

fully fund hiring bonuses to recruit more cops;

deny funding to ""woke district attorneys"" and prosecutors who refuse to prosecute crimes;

invest in the lethality of the U.S. military;

hold the Biden administration responsible for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal;

stand with Israel against Iran and terrorism; and

counter communist Chinese aggression.

""A future that is free""

The third document homed in on three fronts: education, health care, and free speech. On the first front, it underlined a dearth (28%) of confidence in public schools, the Department of Justice's efforts to target parents, and the pandemic's deleterious impact on children's academics. For health care, the document noted Americans' decreasing life expectancy and the possible negative impact of an increasingly socialized approach to medicine. Finally, the document touched both on the addictive and censorious nature of social media.

The proposed remedies:

take action to protect parental rights and expand school choice;

ensure that transsexuals do not ruin girls' school sports;

invest in lifesaving cures;

modernize personal health care and expand access to telemedicine;

scrap Section 230 protections for big tech companies;

provide greater data security protections for citizens; and

counter the cartelization of and collusion between big tech organizations.

""A government that is accountable""

The final document in the communication kit suggests the Democrats have: been opaque in their dealings; worked to silence their critics; applied the law unevenly; and run roughshod over the liberties of conservatives.

The proposed remedies:

promote government transparency and accountability;

uphold free speech and religious liberty;

defend the unborn and protect pro-lifers targeted by bad actors;

safeguard the Second Amendment; and

ensure safe and free elections.

House Republicans previously issued a ""Commitment to America"" in 2020. The 2020 commitment was more geared toward helping then-President Trump continue to execute his mandate and to helping America gain its footing after the pandemic, hence the language of ""restore,"" ""rebuild,"" and ""renew.""

Since Afghanistan had not yet been withdrawn from in a botched manner and nearly 2 million illegals had not yet stolen into the country, geostrategy and the border were not top priorities as they are now. Policing was, however a concern, considering that year the ""Defund the Police"" rhetoric had kicked off, along with the BLM riots.

In March, former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich likened McCarthy's recent efforts and his forthcoming ""Commitment to America"" to past Republican efforts, particularly former President Ronald Regan's successful work in 1980 and the GOP's game-changing 1994 Contract.

Gingrich suggested that the House Republicans, by following up on these commitments, will ""replace Pelosi's despotic perversion of the House of Representatives and turn it once again into the 'people's House.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-republicans-midterm-agenda-crystallized,2022-09-07
House Republicans circulate petition to remove pro-impeachment Rep. Liz Cheney from GOP leadership,"A faction of conservative House Republicans are taking action to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from GOP leadership after she became the highest-profile Republican member of Congress to declare her support for impeaching President Donald Trump.

Punchbowl News reporter Jake Sherman obtained a copy of a petition that calls for a special conference to meet to discuss Cheney's leadership role as No. 3 House GOP leader and demand her resignation as chairman of the GOP Conference.

""We, the undersigned, do hereby petition for a special meeting of the Republican Conference pursuant to Rule 6(d) to discuss a resolution on your leadership,"" the petition states.

On Tuesday, Cheney issued a statement blaming President Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters in what she referred to as an ""insurrection"" against the United States government.

""On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic,"" Cheney said.

""Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough,"" she continued. ""The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.""

""I will vote to impeach the President,"" Cheney concluded.



A handful of House Republicans have joined Cheney and announced their support for impeaching Trump. Republican leadership in the House is reportedly taking a mostly hands-off approach to the issue, with members being told to vote their consciences.

The petition calling for Cheney's ouster says her statement has been used by Democrats as ""justification"" for a ""truncated impeachment process that denies the president due process."" Additionally, the petition asserts that Cheney's position ""does not reflect that of the majority of the Republican Conference and has brought the Conference into disrepute and produced discord.""

It is unclear at this time how many House Republicans will sign the petition, but some members have already called for Cheney's resignation.

I don't think she should be the chair of the Republican Conference anymore,"" Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told Fox News in an interview Tuesday. Biggs is the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.

""The reality is, she's not representing the conference, she's not representing the Republican ideals. And I think that that's a problem...I'm not alone in that sentiment,"" he said.

He suggested that under different leadership, House Republicans might present a more united front against impeaching Trump.

""In this instance, she is the conference chair. I think they should be actually whipping against an impeachment vote but they're not gonna do that, and she's out there advocating others to join her in impeachment. That is wrong. And I think she should resign.""



Montana GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale also called for Cheney to resign in a statement made Tuesday.

""When Representative Cheney came out for impeachment today, she failed to consult with the Conference, failed to abide by the spirit of the rules of the Republican Conference, and ignored the preferences of Republican voters,"" he said. ""She is weakening our conference at a key moment for personal political gain and is unfit to lead. She must step down as Conference Chair.""

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also called for Cheney to be removed, Fox News reported.

There are some Republicans standing by Cheney, though they disagree with her on impeachment. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told Bloomberg News Wednesday that he ""respects"" her decision and that her statement calling for Trump's impeachment was ""honorable"" and ""brave,"" though he does not support impeaching the president.

""I have every confidence in Liz Cheney's ability to do any job,"" he said. ""And you can't punish somebody when they say it is a vote of conscience and they act on their own conscience.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-republicans-petition-remove-cheney-from-leadership,2021-01-13
Tropical storms Marco and Laura may make historic landfall in Louisiana as hurricanes,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that the 2020 hurricane season would be busy with the potential for ""extreme activity."" But there was no way they could forecast the possibility of double hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time because there have never been two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time in documented history. There are currently two storms marching towards the Gulf Coast of the United States.

""Official records go back to 1851. Based on the WPC (Weather Prediction Center) analysis, there is no record of two hurricanes at the exact same time in the Gulf of Mexico,"" an NOAA staffer told WABC-TV.

Tropical Storms Laura and Marco are barreling towards the Gulf coasts of Louisiana and Texas. Tropical Storm Marco has a head start and is already in the Gulf of Mexico, and is expected to make landfall on Monday. Tropical Storm Laura is predicted to arrive in the U.S. by Wednesday, exactly three years after Category 4 Hurricane Harvey smashed into Texas and caused catastrophic flooding Louisiana.



As of 5 p.m. EST, Tropical Storm Laura has sustained winds of 50 mph while dumping heavy rains on Puerto Rico and is headed to the Dominican Republic, according to the NOAA. Tropical storm warnings were issued to Puerto Rico, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Haiti, the Bahamas, and the Florida Keys. A hurricane watch has been posted on the Louisiana coast.



As of 4 p.m. EST, Tropical Storm Marco is east of the Yucatan Peninsula with sustained winds of 65 mph and is expected to develop into a Category 1 hurricane by Monday.

The storms are currently forecast to make landfall as hurricanes, but upper-level shear ahead of the storms is expected to weaken them both before hitting Louisiana or Texas.

The latest forecast from the NOAA predicts that both storms will make landfall as Category 1 hurricanes near New Orleans. It's 2020, why would you expect anything less than double hurricanes.

















Despite the systems following similar paths and being in close proximity, experts say that they can not combine to become a ""supercane.""



""That's because each system has sinking air on its outskirts, which presses down on the other system,"" CBS News reported. ""So, when two systems are that close, the larger one tends to weaken the smaller one. And in some cases they can even dance around one another in a phenomena called the 'Fujiwhara effect.'""

Tropical Storm Laura was the 12th named storm of the hurricane season, and Marco was the 13th. This hurricane season ties 2005 for the record of the highest number of tropical storms before September. The 2005 hurricane season was especially destructive with Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hurricane-marco-tropical-storm-laura-louisiana,2020-08-22
ICE deported the husband of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan—then brought him back a week later,"An illegal immigrant who had been married to a soldier killed in Afghanistan was deported back to Mexico last week, forcing him to leave his daughter behind in Arizona.

Monday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement brought the man back to the U.S. to be released, according to the Arizona Republic.

How did this happen?

Jose Gonzalez Carranza, 30, first came to the U.S. illegally in 2004 as a teenager. In 2007 he married Barbara Vieyra.

In 2010, Army Pfc. Vieyra was killed in Afghanistan when her unit was attacked by insurgents with an IED and grenade launchers. They have a daughter, Evelyn, who is now 12.

Carranza was granted a ""parole in place"" after his wife's death, which allowed him to remain in the U.S. without fear that he would be deported.

However, in 2018, ICE refiled his case, and he was ordered to be deported by a judge in December 2018 after not showing up for a hearing. Gonzalez said he never received notice of the hearing. His attorney said ICE sent notification to the wrong address.

Carranza said he found out about the deportation order last Monday when he was arrested by ICE agents on the way to his welding job. He was deported to Nogales, Mexico, a few days later and had been living in a shelter there while his daughter stayed in Arizona with her grandparents.

How did he get back to the U.S.?

Carranza's attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez, sent out a press release after his client was deported, hoping to draw attention to what he believed was an injustice.

""There are plenty of people you can go after but not a guy whose wife died in Afghanistan,"" Hernandez told the Arizona Republic.

Hernandez said that not long after he spoke to the Republic about the case, an ICE official called him and said the agency was bringing Carranza back to the U.S.

Customs and Border Patrol brought Carranza back into the U.S. and to their Tucson, Arizona, offices, where he would be picked up by ICE agents, brought back to his home in Phoenix, and released.

As of Monday night, ICE had not commented on the specifics of the situation or why the agency opted to bring Carranza back. A spokesperson for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) told the Republic that Sinema's office reached out to assist Carranza.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ice-deported-the-husband-of-a-u-s-soldier-killed-in-afghanistan-then-brought-him-back-a-week-later,2019-04-16
Rep. Ilhan Omar says she is drawing up articles of impeachment against President Trump over Capitol rioting,"Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted that she was drawing up articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump over the rioting Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol against the certification of the Electoral College results.

Omar tweeted the announcement as the Secret Service and the Capitol Police were attempting to evacuate the Capitol building in order to regain control.

""I am drawing up Articles of Impeachment. Donald J. Trump should be impeached by the House of Representatives & removed from office by the United States Senate,"" Omar tweeted.

""We can't allow him to remain in office, it's a matter of preserving our Republic and we need to fulfill our oath,"" she added.



Other Democrats called for the president's removal over the rioting, including Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.

""This is on Donald Trump, period. He called folks to D.C. and gave them marching orders. He needs to be impeached and removed immediately,"" Tlaib said.

Tens of thousands of supporters of the president participated in a rally at the Ellipse near the White House to protest the scheduled certification of the results of the presidential election. Rallygoers then marched to the U.S. Capitol, which turned into a riot when some protesters forced their way into the Capitol building and broke into lawmakers' offices.

President Trump later called for rioters to act peacefully and then posted a video statement asking for them to go home, while reiterating his claims that the election was stolen from him.

Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December 2019 over claims of abuse of power, but he was not removed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. If impeached a second time, he would be the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice.

The president has just 14 days left in office before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20.

"France bolsters US resistance against British offensive, officially enters war","Editor's note: In order to allow our staff to enjoy the 4th of July holiday with their families, TheBlaze will be running a series of articles today commemorating the Revolutionary War, which won America her freedom. God bless America, and all of you.

PARIS, FRANCE (FEBRUARY 6, 1778) — Following U.S. diplomats Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane and Arthur Lee's meeting with King Louis XVI in December 1776, King Louis XVI announced today that France would officially join the United States' war effort against Great Britain.

The French formally acknowledged the United States and their decision to ally with them against the British, and signed what they called The Treaty of Amity and Commerce, which recognized the States as an independent nation. The treaty also encouraged further trade between France and the States.

The Treaty of Amity and Commerce was directly followed by the The Treaty of Alliance, which formed a military alliance against Great Britain with the stipulations that the States would not accept peace with Great Britain that did not include their independence, and that the French would be allowed to conquer the British West Indies.

Before France's entry into the war, the European nation — for over a year — has been rumored to be providing U.S. soldiers with armaments and supplies.

After many months of deliberation, King Louis XVI — initially a skeptic of the colonies' fledgling republic — made the decision to ally with U.S forces. Sources close to the king say that his blatant hostility toward the British won out over his skepticism of the military viability of the Continental Army.

The French was also reportedly concerned that the French Navy was insufficient and thusly unprepared to enter a war against the British. As a result, sources say that King Louis XVI was reluctant to put the French economy in further debt.

However, the Battles of Saratoga, fought in 1777, were a turning point in convincing King Louis XVI to join the war effort against Great Britain.

After British Gen. John Burgoyne launched an attack against Gen. Horatio Gates and his American forces in the first battle of Saratoga in September 1777, King Louis was convinced of the States' ability to stand on its own two feet after British forces were defeated and surrendered in October 1777.

Leading up to the King's official announcement that the French would back the States' efforts, French foreign minister Charles Gravier had decided that French forces should enter the war after the city of Philadelphia fell to British control in September 1777.

Gravier's decision was as a result of fear that the States would not win the war against the British without French intervention.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/independence-day-france-enters-war,2020-07-04
Iran debuts a new 'Khaibar-buster' missile that can reportedly strike Israel and U.S. bases in the Middle East,"Iran has just unveiled a new missile that can strike targets in Israel and American military bases in the Middle East.

On Wednesday, the Iranian government debuted its new solid-fuel missile on state television. The missile has a range of 1,450 kilometers — roughly 900 miles — and is called the Khaibar-buster.

Khaibar was an ancient Jewish palace that was overrun by Muslim armies under the leadership of Muhammad in the early days of Islamic expansion.

The Khaibar-buster is manufactured completely domestically in Iran and, per the Times of Israel, may be able to circumvent sophisticated missile defense systems.

Iran debuted its new missile as the United States continues to re-negotiate the 2015 nuclear agreement. Iran has long claimed that it does not wish to develop nuclear weapons and insists that its missile development programs are simply a deterrent.

Iran isn’t able to launch the Khaibar-buster at intercontinental targets, but the new missile is able to reach American military bases in the Middle East.

Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff for the Iranian armed forces, described the Khaibar-buster as a “long-range missile” and said that “the enemies of the Revolution and the Islamic Republic do not understand anything but the language of power and force.”

Iranian leadership is dedicated to wiping the Jewish state of Israel off the map. Ayatollah Khamenei has even referred to the “Zionist regime” as a “long-lasting virus.”

Iran’s aggressiveness towards and perpetual harassment of Israel have led to the Jewish state hastening the development of new missile defense systems. Israel is 620 miles away from Iran, well within the Khaibar-buster’s range. This missile is capable of reaching targets deep inside Israel.

This past January, Iran successfully tested a solid-fuel rocket engine that is allegedly designed to launch satellites into orbit. According to an Iranian spokesperson, via Reuters, this rocket launched research devices into space at an “altitude of 470 km (290 miles) and at a speed of 7,350 meters per second.”

Satellite rocket engines are usually powered with liquid fuel, and pure solid-fuel rockets are typically associated with ballistic missile systems, so the international community remains highly skeptical of Iran’s intentions.

It’s unclear whether the rocket reached orbit, but the Iranian government confirmed, “The intended research objectives of this launch were achieved.”

According to the U.S. State Department, this launch violated a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution. A State Department spokesperson said, “The United States remains concerned with Iran’s development of space launch vehicles which pose a significant proliferation concern.”

Last week, the State Department confirmed that Iran was merely weeks away from being able to fuel and power a nuclear weapon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-debuts-a-new-khaibar-buster-missile-that-can-strike-israel-and-u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east,2022-02-09
"Iran denies abolishing morality police, reportedly destroys female athlete's family home because she competed without headscarf","Just a day after reports came out across the world that Iran was scrapping its ""morality police,"" responsible for enforcing certain tenets of Sharia law, such as the country's hijab policy, Iranian state media is denying the force is being disbanded.

Now, after Iranian Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri claimed, ""Morality police have nothing to do with the judiciary,"" Iran's state broadcaster claims those comments were misinterpreted and that the morality police continue to operate.

Despite the attorney general being quoted as saying the morality police had been ""abolished from the same place it was launched,"" state television Al-Alam says that the only thing that can be confirmed from the comments is that the judiciary system operates as a separate entity from the morality police.

The broadcaster appeared to mockingly claim that ""foreign media"" had simply misinterpreted Iran as ""retreating"" from the issue of the ""hijab"" and ""modesty."" As CNN reports, the newscast went on to say that ""no official of the Islamic Republic of Iran has said that the Guidance Patrol has been shut” and that the idea that the force was shut down ""due to the recent riots” is false.

Iran has seen large-scale protests lately, following international outcry over Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in state custody in September. As a result, over 14,000 protesters have been arrested, with authorities even threatening the lives of soccer players' families over athlete protests at the World Cup.

This comes in wake of the Iranian state destroying the villa belonging to the family of a female rock climber who competed in a tournament abroad without wearing a headscarf. As reported by the Daily Mail, Elnaz Rekabi and her brother were both reportedly arrested upon the rock climber's return to Iran after she competed in South Korea in the women's boulder finals of the Asian Championships of the International Federation of Sport Climbing in Seoul.

However, also according the Daily Mail, local media outlet Tasnim News reports that the house was actually demolished by Iranian authorities before the competition for having the incorrect construction permit, not an act of retaliation. Rekabi had previously claimed her competing without a hijab was unintentional, posting an apology video online.

Rekabi wore a black baseball hat and a hoodie that covered her hair as she answered questions from reporters at the airport, despite competing in just a headband in South Korea.

"Iran disputes US Navy's accusations of 'provocative' encounter, warns 'any error in calculation will receive a decisive response'","U.S. Navy ships encountered Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy speedboats in the Persian Gulf last Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Defense called the maneuvers by the Iranian ships ""dangerous and provocative."" Iran has denied any wrongdoing and called Washington's accusations a ""Hollywood tale."" The IRGC also warned that any error in calculation ""will receive a decisive response.""

Six Navy and Coast Guard ships encountered 11 Iranian IRGC Navy speedboats last week in international waters. At one point, an armed Iranian vessel came within 10 yards of a Coast Guard cutter. The U.S. Navy stated that the Iranian boats ""repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds.""

U.S. military members captured video and photos of the face-off.

The U.S. Navy said that the IRGC Navy's repeated maneuvers ""increased the risk of miscalculation and collision.""

Despite photos and videos showing the IRGC speedboats getting within close proximity to U.S. ships, Iran claims that the U.S. is sharing ""fake stories"" and it would retaliate to any errors with a ""decisive response.""

""We advise the Americans to follow international regulations and maritime protocols in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and to refrain from any adventurism and false and fake stories,"" the IRGC said in a statement.



""They should be assured that the Revolutionary Guards navy and the powerful armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran sees the dangerous actions of foreigners in the region as a threat to national security and its red line and any error in calculation on their part will receive a decisive response,"" the Iranian military branch warned.

Iran said its naval ships were conducting a drill when they encountered ""the unprofessional and provocative actions of the United States and their indifference to warnings.""

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had increased patrols in the Gulf.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked about the incident during a Fox News interview last week and whether he had consulted the Pentagon about the situation.

Iran on latest sanctions: White House 'afflicted by mental retardation',"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reacted to the latest sanctions imposed on his country by President Donald Trump this week, by accusing the White House of being ""afflicted by mental retardation.""

What are the details?

President Trump issued an executive order on Monday, placing additional sanctions on top of existing economic restrictions against the Islamic Republic. The president imposed the new sanctions targeting officials — in lieu of an airstrike — in retaliation for Iran shooting down a $100 million unmanned American drone on Thursday.



U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said President Trump ""has held the door open to real negotiations"" and ""all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door,"" Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif can expect to be sanctioned ""later this week.""

According to the Associated Press, Rouhani called the sanctions ""outrageous and idiotic"" in a televised address on Tuesday, saying, ""You sanction the foreign minister simultaneously with a request for talks.""

Rouhani added, ""The White House is afflicted by mental retardation and does not know what to do.""

Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi also weighed in, issuing a statement saying, ""The fruitless sanctions on Iran's leadership and the chief of Iranian diplomacy mean the permanent closure of the road of diplomacy with the frustrated U.S. administration.""

Anything else?

The Trump administration is pushing for Iran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and President Trump said over the weekend that he ""look[s] forward to the day when sanctions can be finally lifted and Iran can become a peaceful, prosperous and productive nation.""

""That can go very quickly. It can be tomorrow. It can also be in years from now. So I look forward to discussing whatever I have to discuss with anybody that wants to speak,"" the president also said, according to Politico. ""In the meantime, who knows what's going to happen, I can only tell you that we can not ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon. And it won't happen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-on-latest-sanctions-white-house-afflicted-by-mental-retardation,2019-06-25
Iran tweets threats of violent revenge against Trump — but Twitter took its sweet time removing the message and people are noticing,"Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Thursday tweeted what appeared to be an ominous warning against former President Donald Trump.

The tweet remained up for several hours and garnered much criticism before Twitter — which banned Trump for reportedly inciting violence ahead of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol — suspended Khamenei's account.

On Friday, Reuters confirmed that Twitter suspended the account.

What are the details?

Roughly translated, the tweet said, ""Revenge is inevitable. Revenge must be taken on those who ordered the murder of General Soleimani as well as those who carried it.""

The tweet accompanied a photo of a Trump likeness playing golf, with what appeared to be a graphic of a bomber aircraft's shadow appearing from afar, above his head.

According to Newsweek, the image was previously tweeted by Iranian media outlet Tasnim News Agency.

'Social media playing field remains starkly tilted in favor of the dictatorship'

Washington Post contributor Masih Alinejad called for Twitter to ban Khamenei's account, and on Thursday, wrote, ""Many Iranian human rights activists have often wondered why Twitter and other social media organizations take so little action against the Islamic republic's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other government officials.""

""Meanwhile, Khamenei has banned 83 million Iranians from Twitter, although he and his allies make full use of social platforms to spread their lies — without even a hint of warning labels,"" Alinejad continued. ""The social media playing field remains starkly tilted in favor of the dictatorship.""

Alinejad referred to an October Senate hearing in which Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that Khamenei's history of anti-Semitic tweets and calls to obliterate Israel ""didn't violate the company's rules because they were only 'saber-rattling.'""

""This is shortsighted — and plain wrong,"" Alinejad continued.

""It is time to start restricting social media access for those authoritarian leaders and high-ranking officials who advocate violence against dissidents,"" she concluded. ""It's time for Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg and the other tech titans to stop giving Khamenei the means to preach hatred. We must hold all dictators to account.""

'Is this a joke?'

The BBC on Friday reported that Twitter only suspended the account after outcry over the apparent double standard.

The British news organization cited one social media user's complaints, which stated, ""How come this atrocious psychopath can openly call for the assassination of a former U.S. president, and not be kicked out of Twitter?""

Another person added, ""Trump's banned but this is perfectly OK. Is this a joke?""

On Friday, the Times of Israel reported that a spokesperson for Twitter said that the tweet violated the company's ""abusive behavior policy"" and violated its ""manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts.""

""However, Khamenei's office runs several accounts and the others were still working, including his main account, which he regularly uses to call for the destruction of the Jewish state,"" the outlet added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-trump-threat-twitter-delay,2021-01-22
"Iran set to produce uranium metal, a key material used in nuclear weapons, UN watchdog says","Iran has begun work on an assembly line to produce a key material used in nuclear warheads, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a confidential report released to member states on Wednesday.

According to the report, allegedly viewed by the Wall Street Journal, the Islamic republic informed the United Nations watchdog agency that in coming months it was planning to manufacture equipment it will use to produce uranium metal at a site in Isfahan.

The Wall Street Journal story noted that the development was a significant one since uranium metal can be used to construct the core of a nuclear weapon. Here's more from the story:

Iran hasn't made uranium metal so far, senior Western officials said. The IAEA said Tehran had given it no timeline for when it would do so. Still, the development brings Iran closer to crossing the line between nuclear operations with a potential civilian use, such as enriching nuclear fuel for power-generating reactors, and nuclear-weapons work, something Tehran has long denied ever carrying out.



Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharib Abadi, said Wednesday on Twitter that Iran would produce uranium metal, saying it would allow the development of a new fuel for the Tehran civilian research reactor. Iran has said it would take four to five months to install the equipment to produce a uranium powder from which uranium metal is made.

The move will likely add to rising tensions between the United States and Iran in the early days of President-elect Joe Biden's term, as production of uranium metal is strictly prohibited by the Iran nuclear agreement forged in 2015 when Biden was vice president.

President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement in 2018, but Iran is still part of the international agreement that also includes the U.K., France, Germany, China, and Russia. On the campaign trail last year, Biden signaled that he was open to re-entering the nuclear deal.

Iran appears to be testing the boundaries of late perceiving that the incoming Biden administration will be much more lenient.

In December, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani bragged he has ""no doubt"" the administration under Biden will ""bow"" to Iran by rejoining the nuclear deal and lifting sanctions reimposed on them by Trump.

Only a few days later, satellite photos obtained by the Associated Press appeared to show new construction underway at Iran's underground nuclear site at Fordo, another breach of the agreement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-uranium-metal-nuclear-weapon,2021-01-13
"Trump's support for Iranian protestors breaks a Twitter record, something the MSM 'will not report'","President Donald Trump expressed his solidarity with Iranian protestors calling for the resignation of Ayatollah Khamenei on Saturday.

As he often does, the president took to Twitter to circumvent the media and speak directly to the people. Only this time, he did so in Farsi, the official language in Iran—and broke a Twitter record in the process. As of the writing of this article, one of his tweets had earned over 300,000 ""likes,"" making it the most ""liked"" Farsi tweet in history, according to the Washington Examiner.

The other Farsi tweet is at over 223,000 ""likes.""

Expert: Tweets are something the media 'will not report'

The president's tweets in support of the Iranian people was noticed by Saeed Ghasseminejad, a senior adviser and financial economist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who remarked the protests were, ""A strong show of support by Iranians for Trump's Iran policy, something the MSM does not and will not report.""

The nation's commander in chief also tweeted translations in English of his messages to the Iranian people:

To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.

In his second Persian tweet, Trump directed his message to the Iranian regime:

The government of Iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the Iranian people. There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching.



On Sunday morning, America's 45th president warned Iran not to harm its protestors:

Why are Iranians protesting?



As TheBlaze's Chris Enloe reported, protesters took to the streets of Tehran on Saturday and demanded that Ayatollah Khamenei step down as supreme leader of Iran. The protests come after the Iranian government admitted its armed forces ""unintentionally"" shot down a Ukrainian commercial plane, killing all 176 people on board.

In videos posted on social media, protestors can be seen shouting ""death to the Islamic Republic,"" ""death to liars,"" and ""Soleimani was a murder, his leader is also a murderer."" Reuters also reported the protestors were chanting ""death to the dictator,"" a direct reference to Khamenei.

Other leaders of the Trump administration have also spoken out in support of the Iranian protestors.

Commenting on Twitter, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday afternoon, ""The voice of the Iranian people is clear. They are fed up with the regime's lies, corruption, ineptitude, and brutality of the IRGC under [Khamenei's] kleptocracy.""

""We stand with the Iranian people who deserve a better future,"" Pompeo added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran_tweets_break_records,2020-01-12
Iranian supreme leader dismisses US officials as 'first-class idiots',"Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed U.S. officials on Wednesday as ""first-class idiots.""

What are the details?

Khamenei made the comments while speaking in Qom, the religious capital of Iran. He's in Qom to commemorate the anniversary of the start of the riots that would eventually overthrow the Shah of Iran.

He referenced a U.S. official who had purportedly said that he would celebrate Christmas in Iran. Who this official is was not clear, but The Associated Press suggested that it could have been national security adviser John Bolton or Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, based on similar comments that had both made in the past.

""Some U.S. officials pretend that they are mad,"" Khamenei said. ""Of course, I don't agree with that, but they are first-class idiots.""

The Jerusalem Post reported that Khamenei also ridiculed U.S. sanctions, saying that all they had accomplished was to ""turn Iran into the region's unparalleled power today.""

In November, the Trump administration announced that it was reimposing every sanction on Iran that had been lifted under the Obama administration.

""These sanctions hit at the core areas of Iran's economy,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the time. ""They are necessary to spur changes we seek on the part of the regime.""

Pompeo said that sanctions would only be lifted if the Iranian government changed its behavior and met certain conditions.

What else?

Khamenei is no fan of the Trump administration. In 2017, he criticized President Donald Trump for calling Iran a ""terrorist"" nation.

""The body of this man, Trump, will turn to ashes and become the food of the worms and ants, while the Islamic Republic continues to stand,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iranian-supreme-leader-dismisses-us-officials-as-first-class-idiots,2019-01-10
Powerful video shows Iranians demonstrating more respect for the US flag than Colin Kaepernick has,"As protestors took to the streets of Tehran this weekend calling for the resignation of Ayatollah Khamenei, a video shows thousands of them demonstrating more respect toward the flags of the U.S. and Israeli than, frankly, many Americans, like Colin Kaepernick and others, show to Old Glory.

The 12-second video was shared early Sunday morning on Twitter by an account known as ""@mamlekate.""

""Today, the crowd in an Iranian university refused to trample US and Israel flag #LoveBeyondFlags. These IR ideologies, like forced hijab, are falling one by one,"" it reads in a caption.

The video shows thousands of protestors marching in Iran, approaching an American and Israeli flags that appear to be painted on the floor, and most of them carefully walking around them to avoid stepping on the national symbols.

As of the writing of this story, the video has nearly 1 million views, over 2,800 ""likes,"" and has been retweeted over 1,000 times.

Reuters also noted the protestors were chanting ""death to the dictator,"" in a direct reference to Khamenei.

What has Kaepernick said about the Iran situation?

Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who is known for leading the kneeling protest during national anthems in NFL games, has not made any public comments regarding the protests in Iran. However, Kaepernick was quick to attack the U.S. after President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that killed terrorist Qassem Soleimani.

""There is nothing new about American terrorist attacks against Black and Brown people for the expansion of American imperialism,"" Kaepernick wrote on Jan. 4.

In a separate tweet, the former San Francisco 49ers player added, ""America has always sanctioned and besieged Black and Brown bodies both at home and abroad. America militarism is the weapon wielded by American imperialism, to enforce its policing and plundering of the non white world.""

Kaepernick is no stranger to controversy or making comments that many perceive as anti-American. Last July, Nike famously stopped selling a special Fourth of July edition of its shoes featuring the Betsy Ross flag after Kaepernick reportedly told the company that the flag, with 13 stars, was a racist symbol for slavery.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iranian_protestors_respect_american_flag,2020-01-13
Iran's only female Olympic medalist announces her defection from Iran in scathing message,"Kimia Alizadeh, Iran's sole female Olympic medalist, has announced her defection from Iran.

Amid increasing unrest in the Islamic Republic following Tehran's admission that it shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet last week, Alizadeh, who is just 21 years old, posted to her Instagram on Saturday that she has officially defected from Iran.

""Should I start with hello, goodbye, or condolences?"" Alizadeh wrote in her native Persian, Agence France-Presse reported.

""They took me wherever they wanted. I wore whatever they said. Every sentence they ordered me to say, I repeated. Whenever they saw fit, they exploited me,"" she went on to write, CNN reported.

""I wasn't important to them. None of us mattered to them, we were tools,"" she continued. ""The virtue of a woman is not to stretch her legs!""

She also accused the Iranian government of ""hypocrisy,"" ""lying,"" and ""injustice,"" according to AFP.



Alizadeh became the first Iranian woman to win an Olympic medal when she secured the bronze medal in female taekwondo during the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Her defection came just one day after the Iranian government admitted responsibility for shooting down Ukrainian International Flight PS752, killing all 176 people on board, including a large contingency of Iranians and Canadians.

"After taking heat from conservatives, IRS changes course to grant Christian group tax-exempt status","Following legal pressure and significant backlash on social media, the Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday reversed course to grant a Christian nonprofit organization tax-exempt status.

The IRS had previously rejected the status to the group, known as Christians Engaged, arguing its mission of educating and empowering Christians to engage in America's civics process was partisan by default since Christians usually align with Republican candidates.

In a rejection letter issued in May, the IRS informed Christians Engaged that it was disqualified from holding the status because the ""Bible's teachings are typically affiliated with the Republican Party and candidates.""

News of the group's rejection immediately sparked outrage among conservatives and was picked up by many right-leaning media outlets.

But the nonprofit didn't take the news lying down. It responded with a legal challenge to the rejection, enlisting help from religious liberty law firm First Liberty Institute, which filed an appeal last month.

On Wednesday, First Liberty Institute announced in a press release that the IRS had changed its mind following a review of the matter.

The law firm noted, ""The reversal [came] after a national backlash against the IRS's initial rejection of Christians Engaged's nonprofit status.""

""This is truly great news for our client, as well as religious organizations and churches across America,"" said Lea Patterson, counsel for First Liberty Institute, in a statement. ""We are grateful the IRS changed course to bring its decision into line with the Constitution and its own regulations.""

Christians Engaged President Bunni Pounds added, ""I am incredibly thankful to the IRS for doing the right thing, and we look forward to continuing our mission of educating more followers of Jesus to pray for our nation and to be civically engaged. When we stand up, our republic works for all Americans.""

On its website, Christians Engaged states that it ""exists to awaken, motivate, educate, and empower ordinary believers in Jesus Christ to: pray for our nation and elected officials regularly, vote in every election to impact our culture, [and] engage our hearts in some form of political education or activism for the furtherance of our nation.""

But the IRS originally disagreed, accusing the group of engaging in ""prohibited political campaign intervention.""

""Specifically, you educate Christians on what the Bible says in areas where they can be instrumental including the areas of sanctity of life, the definition of marriage, biblical justice, freedom of speech, defense, and borders and immigration, U.S. and Israel relations,"" IRS exempt organizations director Stephen Martin charged in the initial rejection letter.

Under federal law, a religious organization can obtain tax-exempt status so long as it operates exclusively for charitable or educational purposes and does ""not attempt to influence legislation"" or ""participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/irs-grants-christian-group-tax-exempt-status,2021-07-07
CNN's Jake Tapper celebrates Joe Biden's reported victory: 'Long national nightmare is over',"CNN anchor Jake Tapper channeled his inner Gerald Ford upon the media's declaration that former Vice President Joe Biden is the president-elect — declaring America's ""long national nightmare is over.""

""What a moment in history. We have all been waiting on the edges of our seats since Tuesday. It is the end, the end of a tumultuous presidency— a time of some accomplishments, no question, a time when many Americans throughout the country and in shuttered steel-towns and in rural America, they felt for the first time they felt heard, which is important,"" Tapper began.

""But it has also been a time of extreme divisions, many of the divisions caused and exacerbated by President Trump himself,"" Tapper explained.

""It's been a time of several significant and utterly avoidable failures, and most tragically, of course, the unwillingness to respect facts and science and do everything that could be done to save lives during a pandemic,"" Tapper continued. ""It has been a time where truth and fact were treated with disdain. It was a time of cruelty, where official inhumanity, such as child separation, became the official, shameful policy of the United States.""

""But now, the Trump presidency is coming to an end. To an end. With so many squandered opportunities and ruined potential, but also an era of just plain meanness,"" Tapper went on to say.

""It must be said to paraphrase President Ford: For tens of millions of our fellow Americans, their long national nightmare is over,"" Tapper said.

What was the reference to Ford?

Upon taking the presidential oath of office in August 1974, Ford — who was not elected president, but assumed the high office after Richard Nixon resigned — sought to encourage Americans that the Watergate Scandal that had besmirched Nixon's White House was finally over.

""My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,"" Ford said.

""Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy,"" Ford continued. ""As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jake-tapper-long-national-nightmare-over-trump,2020-11-07
MSNBC political analyst says Biden gave wartime speech,"President Joe Biden delivered a divisive prime-time speech on Thursday that targeted supporters of former President Donald Trump. An MSNBC political analyst described the combative speech as a ""wartime address."" Twitter reactions denounced the categorization as ""foolish"" and ""dangerous.""

Speaking in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Biden delivered a speech billed as the ""Battle for the Soul of the Nation."" Biden claimed that Trump and MAGA Republicans ""represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.""

""And here, in my view, is what is true: MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution,"" Biden said. ""They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people.""

Biden accused Make America Great Again leaders of fanning the flames of political violence.

""MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards — backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love,"" Biden declared during his speech.



Biden quoted J. Michael Luttig – a former Court of Appeals judge for the Fourth Circuit – who called Trump a “clear and present danger” to American democracy during a Jan. 6 committee hearing in June.

Biden warned Americans that they are now at an ""inflection point"" and said it is within our power to ""stop the assault on American democracy.""

He said MAGA Republicans ""embrace anger,"" ""thrive on chaos,"" and ""live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies.""



President Biden declared, ""We’re all called, by duty and conscience, to confront extremists who will put their own pursuit of power above all else.""

Washington Post columnist and MSNBC political analyst Eugene Robinson categorized Biden's fiery speech as a ""wartime address.""

""The speech last night to me sounded like a president delivering a wartime address,"" Robinson said during a Friday morning appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

“And indeed, Joe Biden sees this as a battle for the soul of our country,"" he told host Joe Scarborough. ""It's a battle for the preservation of our democracy.""

""To me, the significant thing was, yes, he called out Donald Trump — but he also called out the MAGA Republicans, the MAGA Republican officials and followers, who, you know, for whatever motive, under whatever delusion, are going down this authoritarian path, this undemocratic path and trying to take the nation with them,"" Robinson continued.

""And he framed this as an emergency, as something that we as a nation need to bond together and to stop, and to reverse, and to return to our democratic principles and our democratic practices,"" Robinson added. ""And to me, it was an urgent wartime address.""



Reactions on Twitter from political commentators found the liberal pundit's ""wartime"" description alarming.

Writer Pradheep J. Shanker: ""Do you guys hear yourselves?""

Conservative activist Daniel Garza: ""Wartime? Stop. This is foolish, dangerous rhetoric by President Biden & Co. You don't ask Americans to forsake own family, neighbors or friends over politics. And to do so in order to favor a side they vehemently disagree with. It won't go the way you think it will.""

Media critic Dan Gainor: ""They desperately want 'war.'""

Conservative commentator Sean Davis: ""Who is the Biden regime at war with and how will the regime win this war? Be specific.""

Conservative activist William Ruger: ""Did I miss a speech on Syria or Iraq or anything else allegedly covered by an Authorization for Use of Military Force?""

Conservative commentator Kurt Schlichter: ""You idiot. If it ever is wartime, you’ll know it.""

Conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan: ""'Wartime address'… So, at least the Democrats admit they are at war with the rest of the nation. It is a shame Republicans won’t admit it.""

Earlier this week, President Biden mocked ""brave right-wing"" Americans by telling them they will need more than guns to fight back against the government.

""For those brave right-wing Americans who say it's all about keeping America, keeping America independent and safe, if you want to fight against the country, you need an F-15. You need something a little more than a gun,"" Biden stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-speech-wartime-msnbc,2022-09-02
Joe Scarborough blasts those who taunted President Trump at World Series with 'lock him up!' chant. Social media takes him to the woodshed — but he doesn't back down.,"The internet had a field day after MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said Americans shouldn't chant ""lock him up"" at President Donald Trump.

On Sunday night, many fans at the World Series game in Washington, D.C., responded to the president's presence at the game by loudly booing and chanting ""lock him up!"" The phrase was popularized at Trump 2016 campaign rallies in reference to former Secretary of State and failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

What are the details?

On Monday's episode of ""Morning Joe,"" Scarborough admonished game attendees who reacted negatively to the president's presence at Sunday night's game.

""I speak to the 'lock him up' chats,"" Scarborough said. ""It's un-American. It started with Donald Trump. In fact, he's made it the centerpiece of his campaign rallies.""

""Sickening,"" he added. ""We are Americans. And we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant 'lock him up' to this president or to any president. Let's hope as we move forward maybe this is one less fascist tactic he and his supporters use during chants. You're going to actually imprison your political opponent.""

What else?

Hashtag #SorryJoe began trending on Twitter following Scarborough's remarks.

At the time of this writing, there have been more than 10,000 tweets using the viral hashtag, which has mainly been used to blast the MSNBC co-host for his defense against the ""Lock him up"" chant.

TV writer David Simon, one of the more prolific social media users, issued a pointed response to Scarborough's remarks.

He wrote, ""The misrule, cruelty and infantilism of this administration is such that some sense of enduring ethos is actually redeemed when we the people openly express our contempt. Dissent is the most American thing there is — and to get clean we need as much as there is on display.""

Twitter user Greg Morelli, one of the top tweets in the #SorryJoe thread, said that Scarborough doesn't ""get to put democracy in a time out.""

""Sorry Joe, you don't get to put democracy in a time out. Sorry Joe, it feels like you want the rest of us to forget that you played an instrumental role in getting Trump elected & now you want to play revolutionary with the coiffed hair. Sorry Joe, we remember,"" he wrote.

Twitter user ""Hillary Won"" added, ""Sorry Joe, but what we do not tolerate in the US are wannabe dictators. This was the most American thing ever, booing a corrupt President who stole the office with the help of a foreign adversary. And at the quintessential American past time. I thought it was wonderful!""

CNN analyst Asha Rangappa chimed in, pointing out that Trump is wrong for chanting ""lock her up"" with regard to Clinton, and that he is simply reaping what he sows.

""Um, no. A President who *leads* a 'lock her up' chant against his political enemies smacks of authoritarianism,"" she wrote. ""Americans who chant 'lock him up' to a President who acts like a tyrant and believes he is above the law is calling for accountability.""

Anything else?

Scarborough took issue with the internet dragging him and doubled down on his original comments via Twitter.

In a lengthy thread, the he wrote, ""So let's see if I've got this straight: When crowds chant 'Lock her up' toward Hillary, it is illiberal and anti-American. (I agree). But when crowds chant the same toward Trump, it is suddenly a fulsome exercise of sacred First Amendment rights. What hypocritical clowns.""

He continued, insisting that people who believe this line of thinking are as ""ignorant"" and as ""illiberal"" as the president himself.

""If you think that democracy is strengthened by calling for the arrest of political opponents, you're as ignorant and illiberal as Trump himself,"" Scarborough blasted. ""Delete your account and read some civics. Stop embarrassing yourself.""

He concluded by pointing out that no one should call for the arrest of political opponents.

""Republicans, look at the response to a very traditional view that in America, we do not call for the arrest of political opponents. And then understand that you reap what you sow,"" he wrote. ""A republic if you can keep it. Seacrest Out.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-scarborough-blasts-anti-trump-lock-him-up-taunt-at-world-series,2019-10-28
John Cena gets demolished online after profusely apologizing to China for calling Taiwan a 'country',"John Cena, the WWE star-turned actor, was bashed online Tuesday after he posted a video to Chinese social media network Sina Weibo apologizing to the Chinese people for referring to Taiwan as a ""country.""

Oh, and Cena delivered his mea culpa in Mandarin, the official language of China.

What happened?

While promoting the release of ""F9"" — the latest installment in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise — Cena told Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS that Taiwan would ""be the first country to see Fast & Furious 9.""

The problem with Cena's statement, according to communist China, is that he acknowledged Taiwan as a sovereign country separate of China. The communist government claims Taiwan as its territory, but Taiwan claims to be a sovereign, self-governing republic. Conflict over Taiwan's status stems from the 20th century Chinese civil war, which has never technically ended.

Taiwan's independence, unfortunately, is mostly unacknowledged on the world stage — most countries have not established official diplomatic relations with Taiwan — and China aggressively polices speech regarding Taiwan. The communist government considers the recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty as crossing the proverbial ""line in the sand.""

What did Cena say?

Uploading a video to China's Twitter-like social media platform Sina Wiebo, Cena profusely apologized — although it was not good enough for many Chinese people.

""Hello, China. This is John Cena. I did many, many interviews for Fast & Furious 9. In one of the interviews I made a mistake,"" Cena said, according to Newsweek.

""I love and respect China and Chinese people. I'm very, very sorry for my mistake. Sorry, sorry. I'm very sorry,"" he added. ""You must understand I love and respect China and Chinese people. Sorry. Goodbye.""

The video was reportedly flooded with thousands of comments from Chinese users who thought Cena's apology was not sufficient.

""Please say in Chinese, 'Taiwan is part of China,' otherwise we won't accept [your apology],"" the top comment on the video said, Newsweek reported.

""Then at least say Taiwan is China's. You're avoiding the issue and talking nonsense. You can't benefit from [the Chinese market] and trash it at the same time,"" another critic said.

Pennsylvania Dem Lt. governor gets schooled after he claims 'lies' about election are 'not protected speech',"Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, was condemned online Friday after claiming that rhetoric doubting the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, such as claims that it was ""rigged"" or ""stolen,"" is not constitutionally protected speech.

What did Fetterman say?

In a video posted online Friday, Fetterman said, ""This idea that saying that Pennsylvania was 'rigged' or that we were 'trying to steal the election,' that's a lie.""

""And you do not have the right, that is not protected speech,"" Fetterman claimed.

Fetterman, who is reportedly considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 2022, said that Twitter should have immediately removed any tweet from President Donald Trump that questioned the integrity of the election, comparing Trump's claims to ""yelling fire in a crowded theater when there is none.""

""There is a difference. That is not protected speech,"" Fetterman doubled down. ""He can talk all day about what his favorite football team is or that he's the greatest president in the history of the world, but no one — Republican, Democrat, or whatever — has the right to say those kind of incendiary lies.""

What was the response?

Fetterman's assertion drew significant attention, with critics pointing out that lies are, in fact, generally protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

""Lying is bad. It's also not the same as truly holding views that most agree are ignorant ['the earth is flat']. And most importantly, lying is still generally protected speech. This is why a plurality struck down the Stolen Valor Act as unconstitutional (United States v. Alvarez),"" Amy Swearer, a legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explained.

""Fraud? Not protected. Libel? Not protected. Lying under oath? Not protected. But false statements, writ large? Still protected,"" Swearer added.

Journalist Sharyl Attkisson mocked, ""WARNING LABEL: 'This claim is determined to be ridiculously false.' Signed, US Constitution (Will Twitter take it down? I'm not advocating it do so, just pointing out if they were 'fact checking' and treating supposedly false claims fairly; they would.)""

Omri Ceren, national security adviser for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), sarcastically pointed out, ""What if the lies about 'trying to steal the election' are published and echoed by the republic's most prominent media outlets, and are repeatedly debunked but nevertheless consistently revived by those outlets quoting anonymous officials, over half a decade?

NYC deli worker Jose Alba released from Rikers Island after being charged with murdering ex-con who attacked him in store,"Jose Alba — the New York City deli worker charged with murdering an ex-con who physically attacked him last week in what many are calling a clear case of self-defense — was released Thursday from notorious Rikers Island prison on reduced bail.

What are the details?

After first setting Alba's bail at $250,000, prosecutors said they negotiated a new bail package with Alba’s lawyer and asked Judge Jonathan Svetkey to reduce it to $50,000, the New York Post reported.

The paper said prosecutors claimed Alba was a flight risk because of a planned trip to the Dominican Republic next week.

While out on bail, Alba must wear an ankle bracelet, must surrender his passport, and can't leave New York City, the Post reported, adding that Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Sigall said the bail terms “will ensure the fact that the defendant will not go to the DR as he planned to.”



Alba — a native of the Dominican Republic — came to America about 30 years ago and became a citizen 14 years ago, the Post added.

“He has every intention to return to court and defend this case,” Alba’s attorney, Danielle Jackson of Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, said in Manhattan Criminal Court, according to the paper.

Prosecutors will present the case to a grand jury on July 20, the Post said.

What's the background?

A woman tried to use a benefits card to buy potato chips for her 10-year-old daughter around 11 p.m. Friday at the Bluemoon Convenient Store in Harlem on Broadway near West 139th Street, the New York Daily News reported.

The transaction was declined, the Daily News said, citing the criminal complaint.

Amid an argument, prosecutors said Alba reached over the counter, grabbed the girl’s hand, and yanked the chips away, the Daily News reported.

Alba's boss — deli owner Maad Ahmad — told the Daily News the mom became enraged: “The lady threw everything from the counter and the [benefits card reader] machine, too. She said, ‘I’m going to get my man, and he’s going to get you.’”

The mother then came back inside the deli with Austin Simon, who got behind the store's counter to confront Alba, the Daily News said.

Security video shows Simon shoving Alba into product shelves, after which Alba — sporting a baseball cap, glasses, and a white mustache and beard — appears to slide down the shelves into a seated position.

The Daily News said Simon actually shoved Alba hard into a chair that hit the merchandise shelves.

“Jose said ... ‘I don’t want any problems,’” deli owner Ahmad recounted to the Daily News.

Simon then grabs Alba by the neck, pulls him up, and begins to walk him out of the area behind the counter.

With that, Alba grabs a knife that the paper said was stashed behind the counter and starts fighting back.

“He wanted me to come apologize to the girl,” Alba told a New York City police detective, according to the Daily News. “I took the knife we use to open boxes, and I stabbed him.”

Image source: TeaTenders video screenshot

The Daily News — citing the criminal complaint — added that Simon’s girlfriend grabbed a knife from her purse and stabbed Alba in the arm.

EMS crews took Simon to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, WNBC-TV reported.

Alba was arraigned Saturday on a second-degree murder charge, the Daily News said. He also was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, police told WNBC.

'Jose Alba should be getting a Congressional Medal of Honor'



The Post reported that Guardian Angels founder and former mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa said Thursday outside the courtroom that ""Jose Alba should be getting a Congressional Medal of Honor. Instead, he’s locked up on Rikers and this is all [Manhattan District Attorney] Alvin Bragg. He turns loose real criminals, and he incarcerates victims who fight back. What kind of a message is this?”

Mark Bederow, a former Manhattan prosecutor, added to the Post: “I don’t think a grand jury would indict [Alba] for murder in the second degree, and I don’t think a jury would convict him beyond a reasonable doubt given what the justification statute states,” which refers to self-defense arguments.

'Murdered in cold blood'

The Post said Simon’s family exited Thursday's hearing in tears, with his sister saying Simon “was murdered in cold blood.”

“If the shoe was on the other foot, my brother wouldn’t have gotten bail or bond or nothing,” she added, according to the paper.

Tina Lee, who said she has three children with Simon, called him “a good man” and a “good father” who took “good care” of all his children, the Post noted.

A separate Post story reported that Simon was on parole at the time of last week's deadly incident for assaulting a cop. State corrections records show Simon served prison time on a second-degree assault conviction for attacking the officer before he was paroled last year, the Post added.

In addition, the paper — citing sources and records — said Simon was busted at least eight times on charges ranging from assault, robbery, and assault during a domestic dispute.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jose-alba-released-50k-bail,2022-07-08
"VIDEO: Sen. Josh Hawley eviscerates media, Democrats for attacks on Amy Coney Barrett's faith","Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) on Monday sternly rebuked the press and his Senate Democratic colleagues for asking questions critical of Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett's faith in his opening remarks for the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing.

""We've gotten to read a lot about you in the press, and in particular about your religious beliefs,"" Hawley said to Barrett. ""One attack after another in the liberal media, one hit piece after another, many of them echoed by members of this committee.""

In recent weeks, several articles were published putting the spotlight on Barrett's Catholic faith and her ties to ""People of Praise,"" a small charismatic Christian fellowship group based in Indiana. The articles have raised questions about the group, suggesting that its Catholic doctrinal beliefs on abortion, contraception, IVF, and gender roles would have undue influence on Barrett's jurisprudence should she be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Republicans have criticized the questions as a ""religious smear.""



The point of the questions about Barrett's faith, Hawley surmised, is to question whether Barrett has ""the independence to be a judge, a justice on the United States Supreme Court.""

He called out Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who sits on the judiciary committee, for previously questioning judicial nominees about their relationships to Catholic groups:



And it's not just in the newspapers; it's members of this committee, including the Democratic nominee for vice president of the United States, who has questioned past nominees who have come before this committee about their membership in Catholic fraternal organizations like the Knights of Columbus. And for those watching at home, that's right, you heard me correctly, Sen. Harris and others on this committee have repeatedly questioned judicial nominees' fitness for office because of their membership in the Knights of Columbus.

Hawley also referred to ranking member and California Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein's infamous ""the dogma lives loudly within you"" comment from Barrett's confirmation hearing for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, calling such language ""the very terminology of anti-Catholic bigotry.""



""Let's be clear about what this is: This is an attempt to broach a new frontier. To set up a new standard,"" Hawley said. ""Actually, it's an attempt to bring back an old standard that the Constitution of the United States explicitly forbids. I'm talking about a religious test for office.""



Hawley then cited Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, which states that ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the United States.""

Now that was big news in 1787 when it was written, and it's worth remembering why. It's because no country, no republic in the history of the world had ever guaranteed to its citizens the right to freedom of conscience and religious liberty. Every other country that had ever existed tied together the religious beliefs that would be approved by the powerful and the right to serve in office, or to vote, or just to be a citizen. In every other country across history, you had to agree with what those in power agreed with in order to hold office or be a citizen in good standing. ...



So when our founders put Article VI into the Constitution of the United States, they were making a very deliberate choice. They were breaking with all of that past history and they were saying in America it would be different. In the United States of America we would not allow the ruling class to have veto power over your faith, over what Americans believed, over who we gathered with to worship, and why and where and how.



Now, in this country, the people of the United States would be free to follow their own religious convictions. Free to worship, free to exercise their religion. And people of faith would be welcome in the public sphere ... they'd be welcome without having to get the approval of those in power, like those on this committee. They would be welcome to come and to bring their religious beliefs to bear on their lives, on their office, in all that they do. So long of course as they are peaceful citizens who'd follow the law.



Religious people of all backgrounds would be welcome in public life, and no person in power would be able to control what the American people, any American citizen, thought or believed or who they worshiped. This freedom of conscience and religious liberty undergirds all of our other rights, because it tells the government that it cannot tell us what to think or who we can assemble with or how we can worship or what we can say.

Hawley pointed out that Article VI comes even before the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment in the Constitution, stressing its importance. He warned that the attacks on Barrett's faith undermine the principles and liberties the Constitution was written to protect.

""This bedrock principle of American liberty is now under attack,"" he said. ""That is what is at stake when we read these stories attacking Judge Barrett for her faith. That is what is at stake when my Democratic colleagues repeatedly question Judge Barrett and many other nominees about their religious beliefs, about their religious membership, about their religious practices, about their family beliefs and practices. That is an attempt to bring back the days of the religious test. That is an attempt to bring back the veto power of the powerful over the religious beliefs and sincerely held convictions of the American people. And that is what is at stake in this confirmation hearing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/josh-hawley-media-democrats-barrett-faith,2020-10-12
Joy Reid: Texas is basically a ‘small Soviet Republic’ now. ‘What woman or POC could possibly feel safe there?’,"MSNBC anchor Joy Reid lampooned Texas this week over its promotion of conservative legislation — including a constitutional carry provision, election security reform, and a ban on abortions — comparing the state to a satellite republic of the USSR.

""Texas is basically a small Soviet Republic at this point, with neighbors spying on neighbors, hoping to collect a cash bounty, in addition to being an apartheid state for nonwhite voters,"" the progressive anchor claimed in a tweet, likening private American citizens to the former Soviet KGB.

""What woman or [person of color] could possibly feel safe there?"" she asked. ""To say nothing of the gun proliferation.""

On Wednesday, a number of laws took effect in Texas, including one allowing residents to carry a handgun in public without a permit and another barring abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which typically occurs at six weeks' gestation. The latter provision is to be enforced not by the state but by private citizens now empowered to file a civil lawsuit against doctors who perform an abortion or anyone who ""aids and abets"" the procedure.

Republicans have also over the last several weeks pushed for a new election security reform bill, which, in part, would increase protections for poll watchers.

In the tweet thread, Reid exasperatedly questioned what the ""private citizen bullies"" would be permitted to enforce next?

""They've enacted laws letting (potentially armed) thugs ""watch"" (Black and Latino) voters, prompted Texans to spy on women and file lawsuits for a $ bounty against anyone helping them end a pregnancy,"" Reid lamented.



""Will Texans be prompted to spy on teachers to ensure they are not teaching the true history of slavery and are only upholding the prim dignity of the white founding fathers? How about urging citizens to inform on and sue parents who send their children to school masked?"" she asked.

The anchor then warned that similarly dangerous measures will soon be passed in Florida.

""[Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis] isn't just gonna sit back and let [Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott] out-Viktor Orban him,"" she said, alluding to the Hungarian prime minister who, ironically, is famous for openly demanding that Soviet troops leave the country during a 1989 speech.

""After that, it's the floodgates in Red America. We are two countries. The United States, and Gilead,"" she concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-reid-texas-soviet-republic-abortion,2021-09-03
Gruesome 'human chop shop' ordered to pay $58 million to Arizona families,"A jury ordered an Arizona body donation company to pay victims $58 million after they were accused of being a ""human chop shop"" operating a body part trafficking scheme.

The Maricopa County Superior Court jury made the ruling on Tuesday against Stephen Gore, the owner of Biological Resource Center, and in favor of ten of twenty-one plaintiffs who sued his company.

Plaintiffs alleged that they were deceived and told the bodies of their loved ones were going to be used for research. Instead, they were sold for other uses, including ballistics testing.

The Arizona Republic documented the story of Gwen Aloia, one of the plaintiffs who won $5.5 million in the case. She had signed over the body of her husband Louis in 2013 to the Biological Resource Center while he was in hospice care.

FBI agents later discovered the head of her husband in a freezer during their investigation.

Gore's lawyer argued that the families were not deceived, but the jury was persuaded by claims that his company conflated the terms ""body donation,"" which is unregulated, and ""organ donation,"" which is highly regulated.

A bizarre detail from the investigation describes how FBI agents found a cooler full of penises that had been dismembered from the donated bodies. The investigation did not discover what the body parts were being saved for, but the plaintiffs' lawyer told the jury they were clearly being collected for ""something.""

Gore said in a 2015 letter to a judge that he felt overwhelmed but that the industry was unregulated.

""I could have been more open about the process of donation on the brochure we put in public view,"" Gore admitted.

""When deciding which donors could be eligible to donate,"" he added, ""I should have hired a medical director rather than relying on medical knowledge from books or the internet.""

Justin Trudeau — after grisly murders in French church amid Muslim anger at Muhammad cartoons — says free speech 'is not without limits',"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted to the grisly murders in a French church amid worldwide Muslim anger over cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad by saying that free speech ""is not without limits,"" the Guardian reported.

What are the details?

Muslims have been furious at the French government for refusing to take action against its citizens for public displays of Muhammad, which have been in solidarity with free expression after a French schoolteacher was beheaded by a Chechen refugee on Oct. 16, apparently over the teacher showing Muhammad cartoons to his class.

Effigies of French President Emmanuel Macron were burned over his defense of the right to publish such caricatures, the Guardian reported, adding that Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said ""we are in a war against an enemy that is both inside and outside.""

Thursday's deadly terrorist attack took place inside the Notre-Dame Basilica in Nice, the paper said, adding that the three people who died were a 60-year-old woman who was almost decapitated, 55-year-old Vincent Loques — the church sexton — and a 44-year-old Brazilian-born mother of three.

Officers described the scene as a ""vision of horror,"" the Guardian reported, adding that Nice's police chief, Richard Gianotti, said officers shot a man ""who was holding a knife"" and ""had just killed three people"" and was ""was shouting 'Allahu Akbar.'"" The suspected attacker, 21-year-old Brahim Aouissaoui from Tunisia, was in serious condition in a local hospital, the paper noted.

""Any symbol of the republic or Christianity is a potential target,"" Gianotti also said, according to the Guardian. ""We have to be vigilant, we have to be attentive.""

Big contrast



Trudeau, however, worded his reaction to the killings with more — er — nuance.

""We will always defend freedom of expression,"" Trudeau said Friday, the paper reported, adding that the the far-left politician tempered that sentiment by saying that ""freedom of expression is not without limits. We owe it to ourselves to act with respect for others and to seek not to arbitrarily or unnecessarily injure those with whom we are sharing a society and a planet.""

According to the Post Millennial, Trudeau also seemed to compare the showing of Muhammad images to yelling ""fire"" in a crowded theater — and emphasized that ""in a pluralistic, diverse and respectful society like ours, we must be aware of the impact of our words, of our actions on others, particularly these communities and populations who still experience enormous discrimination.""

VP Harris commits gaffe by referring to North Korea,"Vice President Kamala Harris committed a major gaffe while delivering remarks at the Korean peninsula's Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), mistakenly saying that the U.S. and the ""Republic of North Korea"" have an alliance which ""is strong and enduring.""

While the nation of South Korea is a U.S. ally, the country of North Korea is not. The vice president's comment was an obvious mistake, and she went on to correctly refer to the Republic of Korea, which is the nation of South Korea.

""The commitment of the United States to the defense of the Republic of Korea, I will report, is ironclad,"" Harris said. She noted that both countries share the aim of achieving ""complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.""

""The United States and the world seek a stable and peaceful Korean peninsula where the DPRK is no longer a threat,"" Harris said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is the nation of North Korea.

"Kamala Harris blunders about NATO again, this time in a deleted tweet","Vice President Kamala Harris was caught in a precarious blunder again when she implied in a tweet that Ukraine was a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin has cited the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO as part of his justification for invading the former Soviet republic as a matter of national defense.

""When I was in Poland, I met with U.S. and Polish service members, thanking them for standing with our NATO allies for freedom, peace, and security,"" read the tweet from the @KamalaHarris account. ""The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the NATO alliance.""

Harris' false claim that Ukraine had already joined NATO was an embarrassing and potentially harmful blunder.

That tweet was deleted and replaced with one clarifying that the U.S. stood behind Ukraine and also behind NATO.

Harris had made the exact same mistake in a speech on Saturday at the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Washington D.C.

""Russia’s invasion threatens not just Ukraine’s democracy, it threatens democracy and security across Europe,"" Harris said during her speech. ""So I will say what I know we all say, and I will say over and over again: The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the NATO alliance.""

The White House altered the transcript of the event to add the word ""and"" in parenthesis to fix the gaffe.

After deleted the tweet, Harris' office blamed the DNC for the mistake.

""The 'and' was omitted by accident, so we took it down and reposted with the correct remarks,"" the DNC said in an email to Fox News.

The vice president's office has been plagued by staffers leaving amidst rumors of dysfunction and contentious bickering with the president's staff. Harris has been accused by some of being unprepared for media briefings and other official meetings.

"Lake dunks on Cheney, thanks her for attack ad","Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake dunked on Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming by thanking the GOP lawmaker for her PAC's ad urging Arizona voters to support Democrats during the upcoming election.

Politico reported that the Great Task indicated that it will shell out $500,000 to run the ad on broadcast, online, and streaming platforms.

But while the ad is meant to steer people away from backing Lake, the candidate claimed that it is actually boosting her campaign.

""Thank you for your generous in-kind contribution to my campaign,"" Lake declared in a message directed toward Cheney. ""Your recent television ad urging Arizonans not to vote for me is doing just the opposite. Our campaign donations are skyrocketing and our website nearly crashed from traffic as people rushed to learn more about my plan to put Arizona First and join our historic political movement.""

Kyrsten Sinema refuses to back down after Arizona Dem Party takes unanimous action against her,"Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D) was unanimously censured by the Arizona Democratic Party on Saturday, but the centrist Democrat refused to bow to increasing pressure.

In a statement after the censure, spokeswoman Hannah Hurley said that Sinema's allegiance lays with her constituents in the Grand Canyon State — not a political party.

""During three terms in the U.S. House, and now in the Senate, Kyrsten has always promised Arizonans she would be an independent voice for the state — not for either political party,"" Hurley said. ""She’s delivered for Arizonans and has always been honest about where she stands.""

What happened?

The executive board of the Arizona Democratic Party met Saturday morning and voted to censure Sinema for opposing the abolition of the Senate filibuster. Sources told NBC News the censure resolution passed unanimously.

""The state party has no confidence in Sinema,"" Arizona Democratic Party vice chairman Michael Slugocki said.

The party took action after passing a resolution last fall outlining the steps it would take if Sinema continued to support the filibuster and if that support doomed passage of voting reform legislation. Sinema has said she supports Democrats' voter rights bills, but has maintained her opposition to passing voter reform by eliminating the filibuster.

Still, the Arizona Republic reported that the action taken on Saturday means virtually nothing.

""The censure has no practical effect but does deliver a strong message of condemnation and reflects the will of the party's most active and loyal members,"" the news outlet explained.

Democrats ultimately failed to eliminate the Senate filibuster this week after Sinema and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) refused to support the effort to overturn it. The opposition to the effort, therefore, was bipartisan and comprised a majority of U.S. senators, 52-48.

Both Manchin and Sinema have repeatedly explained why they oppose eliminating the filibuster. Doing so, the lawmakers claim, would eliminate an essential function of the Senate, which is to prevent partisan rule by whichever party controls a majority. Currently, Democrats hold the majority, although the Senate is split 50-50, because Vice President Kamala Harris may cast a tie-breaking vote in the case of a 50-50 split vote.

Sinema explained after her vote that she opposed eliminating the filibuster because its elimination would ""deepen our divisions and risk repeated radical reversals in federal policy, cementing uncertainty and further eroding confidence in our government.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyrsten-sinema-censured-filibuster-vote,2022-01-22

A spokesperson for Sinema told the Arizona Republic that the newly minted senator, who previously served as a U.S. representative, is ""always sworn in on Constitution.""

""Kyrsten always gets sworn in on a Constitution simply because of her love for the Constitution,"" the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that the book was from the Library of Congress and contained texts of the United States and Arizona state constitutions.

A recent release from the Pew Research Center reported Sinema is the one member of Congress who is ""religiously unaffiliated.""

At just over 88 percent, the overwhelming majority of those serving in the U.S. Congress identify as Christians.

What else?

Hemant Mehta at the Friendly Athiest lauded Sinema's decision to be sworn in on the U.S. Constitution.

""To be sure, Sinema isn't an open atheist, and there were a lot of books other than the Bible this year for newly elected members of Congress,"" Mehta wrote.

""But it's still nice to see a government official show people that her allegiance is to our country and our laws, not a holy book or the Ten Commandments,"" Mehta added. ""Sinema did the same thing in 2013 when she was first sworn into Congress.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyrsten-sinema-sworn-in-on-constitution-not-bible,2019-01-04
LA County sheriff refuses to use COVID-19 test provider over alleged ties to China,"Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva on Monday informed the L.A. County Board of Supervisors that his office will no longer use the county's coronavirus test provider, alleging that the company may share data from COVID-19 testing patients with the Chinese government.

In a letter reported by Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin, Villanueva says he was contacted by the FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Coordinator, who shared ""very concerning information"" regarding Fulgent Genetics Corporation, the Temple City-based company contracted by L.A. County to provide coronavirus tests.

Villanueva told the board of supervisors that he attended a Nov. 26, 2021, briefing at the FBI Los Angeles Field Office, along with the county's top attorney and chief executive, with all supervisors and the head of the Department of Public Health invited.

""The FBI stated the purpose of the meeting was to inform County leaders of the serious risks associated with allowing Fulgent to conduct COVID-19 testing of County employees,"" Villanueva said.

The sheriff said he was ""shocked to learn"" that Fulgent has alleged ties to several Chinese technology and genomics companies that are ""linked to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) State Council and are under the control of the PRC.""

He further alleged that Fulgent uses genetic information obtained from COVID-19 testing patients in studies, and raised concerns that data potentially stored by Fulgent outside the U.S. could be accessed by the Chinese government.

“I am deeply concerned as to the vetting process which either failed to discover this or discovered it but chose to ignore it. A simple Internet search would have covered all the above facts,” Villanueva wrote.

He stated that the FBI ""felt strongly enough regarding Fulgent being used to test County personnel that they held an emergency briefing to disclose their concerns.""

""The Department will remove itself from working with Fulgent,"" Villanueva said.

L.A. County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl told the Los Angeles Times that she was invited to the FBI briefing but could not attend because she was out of town for Thanksgiving.

“From what I heard about the briefing, there was no evidence at all, zero, that Fulgent had breached anything or had any relationship with the Chinese government that was harmful to the information that might be present in the samples that they’re testing,” she said.

On Aug. 4, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors mandated that all County employees provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19 by Oct. 1 or face termination. Melugin reported that the county awarded a no-bid contract to Fulgent to provide testing and registration services, and that all county employees, more than 100,000 people, were required to register their vaccination status with Fulgent.

Melugin said that some employees reached out to him and were ""furious"" with a disclaimer from Fulgent Genetics explaining that the company may ""store, process and transmit personal information in locations around the world,"" including in places with ""less protective"" data protection laws.

""If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located, you should not use our Services,"" the Fulgent disclaimer reads, according to a screenshot shared by Melugin.

In a statement released Monday, the county said the contract with Fulgent prohibits the company from disclosing data collected without the county's ""express written permission"" and requires the company to ""store and process County data/information only within the continental United States.""

The county pointed out that federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security also contract with Fulgent, which is certified by the Food and Drug Administration, accredited by the College of American Pathologists, and licensed by the California Department of Public Health.

“As part of our ongoing commitment to safeguarding our employees’ testing data, the County continually assesses any credible concerns that may emerge, in consultation with our partners in the federal government, to ensure that the terms of our testing contract are stringently followed,"" the county said. ""If a credible threat is confirmed, or if the federal government takes any steps to rescind its certification, we will take immediate action to ensure no employee data is misused.”

The FBI declined to comment on the briefing to both Melugin and the Los Angeles Times.

Villanueva said the Sheriff's Department will use its own registration system and work with coronavirus testing companies that are unaffiliated with Fulgent to comply with the county's mandates. He asked that the board of supervisors ""take steps to immediately assess and mitigate any further risk before any personnel are disciplined under the mandate for refusing to subject their information to the Fulgent system.""

County Supervisor Janice Hahn said Monday that the sheriff's office should prioritize enforcing the county's employee vaccination mandate.

“I wish the sheriff would get his deputies vaccinated instead of worrying about how the unvaccinated get tested,” she said in a statement.

Villanueva, a Democrat, has been a longtime critic of the county's vaccine mandate. He said in October he would not enforce the mandate, warning that it could lead to a ""mass exodus"" of county employees.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/la-county-sheriff-refuses-to-use-covid-19-test-provider-over-alleged-ties-to-china,2021-11-30
Lab-leak denying EcoHealth Alliance president recuses self from COVID-19 investigation amid conflict-of-interest claims,"EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak has recused himself from a U.N.-partnered commission that is investigating the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus after vigorously working to discredit the lab-leak hypothesis and failing to disclose his organization's ties to the Chinese lab at its center.

Daszak is a highly influential scientist who since the onset of the pandemic has fiercely attacked anyone who suggested the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was manufactured and somehow leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Between 2014 and 2019, his organization funneled $3.4 million in National Institutes of Health grants to the Wuhan lab to study bat coronaviruses. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Daszak was the only American representative of a 10-member World Health Organization team sent to investigate the origins of the virus. He is also a member of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission, an interdisciplinary initiative established by the Lancet medical journal to make recommendations on how to prevent and contain future pandemics.

The Lancet COVID-19 Commission announced Tuesday that Daszak recused himself from the investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic after it came to light that his nonprofit group had funded research at the Wuhan lab that some claim could be related to the virus' origins.

""The Lancet COVID-19 Commission will carefully scrutinize the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in advance of its final report, with the overriding aim of recommending policies to prevent and contain future emerging infectious disease outbreaks. The Commission's technical work will be conducted by independent experts who were not themselves directly involved in US-China research activities that are under scrutiny. Dr. Peter Daszak has recused himself from the Commission's work on the origins of the virus,"" the statement said.

""The Commission urges all scientists who were involved in the US-China research to explain fully and transparently the nature of their work. In the meantime, the Commission will tap global experts in biosafety and other fields to help assess the relevant hypotheses on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and to recommend ways to prevent and contain future outbreaks, whether from naturally occurring zoonotic events or research-related activities.""

There is controversy surrounding Daszak because of his failure to be fully transparent about the nature of his work. Aside from failing to disclose his organization's ties to the Wuhan lab and his interests in the research performed there, Daszak worked both in public and behind the scenes to organize a campaign to discredit the lab-leak theory.

Publicly, Daszak has made misleading statements about the nature of the work conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and accused those who've suggested it's possible the virus leaked from the lab there of promoting conspiracy theories.

Privately, he led a campaign to give the appearance of authoritative scientific weight to his preferred natural origin hypothesis and ostracize opposing views. Last year, Daszak organized and drafted a statement signed by 27 prominent public health scientists that denounced ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."" The letter contained a declaration by the authors of no competing interests, despite Daszak's personal interest in ensuring that the research he supported in Wuhan continued uninterrupted by accusations that it caused the COVID-19 pandemic.



The statement was published by the Lancet in February 2020 and became the dominant media narrative about the origins of the virus throughout 2020. Big tech social media companies took action to de-platform all dissenting opinions, labeling claims that contradicted the ""science"" as ""misinformation."" As Vanity Fair noted in its explosive report on the various investigations into the origins of the virus, the Lancet statement ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

On Monday, the Lancet published an addendum acknowledging Daszak's potential conflicts of interest regarding the February 2020 statement.

""In this letter, the authors declared no competing interests. Some readers have questioned the validity of this disclosure, particularly as it relates to one of the authors, Peter Daszak,"" the Lancet wrote. ""In line with guidance from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, medical journals ask authors to report financial and non-financial relationships that may be relevant to interpreting the content of their manuscript.

""There may be differences in opinion as to what constitutes a competing interest. Transparent reporting allows readers to make judgments about these interests. Readers, in turn, have their own interests that could influence their evaluation of the work in question,"" the journal stated, adding that it invited each of the 27 authors of the February 2020 letter to ""re-evaluate their competing interests.""

The Lancet then provided an updated disclosure statement from Daszak (edited for readability):

[Peter Daszak]'s remuneration is paid solely in the form of a salary from EcoHealth Alliance, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation. EcoHealth Alliance's mission is to develop science-based solutions to prevent pandemics and promote conservation. Funding for this work comes from a range of US Government funding agencies and non-governmental sources. All past and current funders are listed publicly, and full financial accounts are filed annually and published.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China was previously funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Neither PD nor EcoHealth Alliance have received funding from the People's Republic of China.



PD joined the WHO–China joint global study on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 towards the end of 2020 and is currently a member. As per WHO rules, this work is undertaken as an independent expert in a private capacity, not as an EcoHealth Alliance staff member. The work conducted by this study was published in March, 2021.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China includes collaboration with a range of universities and governmental health and environmental science organisations, all of which are listed in prior publications, three of which received funding from US federal agencies as part of EcoHealth Alliance grants or cooperative agreements, as publicly reported by NIH. EcoHealth Alliance's work in China is currently unfunded. All federally funded subcontractees are assessed and approved by the respective US federal agencies in advance and all funding sources are acknowledged in scientific publications as appropriate.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China involves assessing the risk of viral spillover across the wildlife–livestock–human interface, and includes behavioural and serological surveys of people, and ecological and virological analyses of animals. This work includes the identification of viral sequences in bat samples, and has resulted in the isolation of three bat SARS-related coronaviruses that are now used as reagents to test therapeutics and vaccines. It also includes the production of a small number of recombinant bat coronaviruses to analyse cell entry and other characteristics of bat coronaviruses for which only the genetic sequences are available.



NIH reviewed the planned recombinant virus work and deemed it does not meet the criteria that would warrant further specific review by its Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight (P3CO) committee.



All of EcoHealth Alliance's work is reviewed and approved by appropriate research ethics committees, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institutional Review Boards for biomedical research involving human subjects, P3CO oversight administrators, and biosafety committees, as listed on all relevant publications.

Dr. Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economics professor and the the chairman of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission, wrote a related op-ed Tuesday explaining the state of the debate on the origins of the virus. While the op-ed does not mention Daszak by name, it does discuss the issues the commission will consider in its investigation of the origins of the virus, from which Daszak recused himself, and states: ""The Commission's overriding aim is to recommend policies to prevent and contain future disease outbreaks, and its technical work will be conducted by independent experts who were not themselves involved directly in the US-China research under scrutiny. The scientists who were involved should explain fully the nature of their work.""



Sachs emphasized that both the lab-leak hypothesis and the natural origin hypothesis ""are viable at this stage of the investigation.""

""Those who have claimed that a natural origin is the only viable hypothesis overlook the extensive research activity that was underway in the field and in laboratories on SARS-like viruses, including in Wuhan, China, where the first outbreak was identified, and in the United States,"" Sachs wrote. ""Those who claim that a research-related infection is the only viable hypothesis overlook the frequency of natural zoonotic transmissions of viruses, such as the SARS outbreak. There are many ways that a natural event could have occurred with SARS-CoV-2 somewhere in China and then been brought to Wuhan by an infected individual or an animal brought to market.""

He clarified that research seeking to prove the virus has natural origins remains inconclusive. It's still possible that the virus was transmitted to humans from some animal, though scientists have not yet identified an animal host. It's also possible that the virus originated from coronavirus research without being artificially created, which would be the case if a researcher contracted it in the field, brought it back to the lab, developed mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, and it spread from there.

The third possibility is that the virus was engineered in the Wuhan lab through gain-of-function research, which involves modifying viruses to be more transmissible among humans.

""The public and policy community have become increasingly aware of the intensive research on SARS-like viruses that was underway in the US, China, and elsewhere, both in collecting viral samples from the field and in studying their infectivity and pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) in the laboratory,"" Sachs wrote. ""We have learned that much of this work can be classified as 'gain of function' (GoF) research ... Experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) involving the modification of bat-origin coronaviruses to express proteins that are likely to enhance entry into human cells are viewed by many scientists as falling squarely into the category of GOFROC.""

Sachs acknowledged that the NIH funded U.S. and Chinese scientists to work collaboratively on collecting SARS-like viruses, taking them back to the Wuhan lab for study, though he did not mention EcoHealth Alliance by name.

""If there was indeed a laboratory-related release of SARS-CoV-2, it may well have occurred in a project funded by the US government, using methods developed and championed by US scientists, and as part of a US-led and US-financed program to collect and analyze potentially dangerous viruses, including in China,"" Sachs wrote.

He called on the NIH and on the Chinese government to release more information on the research that was funded and conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also called for ""an international and independent investigation"" to learn the truth and for both the U.S. and Chinese governments to cooperate ""fully and transparently"" with such an inquiry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lab-leak-ecohealth-alliance-president-recuses-self-covid-investigation,2021-06-22
"Lawmaker requests special counsel investigation into Hunter Biden, 'potentially incriminating contents' of laptop","Could Hunter Biden be the subject of the next special counsel investigation? That's what Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) wants.

Buck sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr on Monday requesting that the Department of Justice initiate a special counsel investigation into the son of the media-declared president-elect, centering on Hunter Biden's ""conduct"" and the ""potentially incriminating contents"" on the laptop in the FBI's possession that purportedly belongs to Biden.

A special counsel investigation is critical for maintaining confidence in national security, Buck said.



""This investigation is critical to defending the integrity of our republic and ensuring a potential Biden Administration will not be the subject of undue foreign interference,"" Buck wrote. ""Americans have the right to know whether Mr. Biden's reported ties to foreign governments will make him the subject of blackmail attempts or other nefarious efforts to undermine U.S. national security or otherwise improperly influence American foreign policy.""

Buck went on to compare the necessity of a special counsel investigation now to when Robert Mueller was tasked with leading a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

""As you know, the Attorney General is granted the statutory authority to appoint a Special Counsel under 28 U.S.C. § 515 and 28 CFR § 600 to investigate and prosecute any matter that would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances,"" Buck wrote.

""Similar to when the DOJ appointed Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, it is critical that this investigation continue free from political interference, no matter who is in the White House. We must guarantee the integrity of our government and the security of our republic,"" the Colorado Republican added.

Barr has already appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the Russia investigation, as a special counsel, essentially preventing the incoming Biden administration from interfering in Durham's work.

What's the background?

The New York Post published a bombshell story in mid-October reporting that the paper had obtained the hard drive to a laptop that allegedly had belonged to Hunter Biden. The laptop, which had been dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019 and never picked up, turned out to be in the possession of the FBI for unknown reasons.

The story was significant for many reasons. Most importantly, emails on the hard drive, purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden, showed that Joe Biden had been more involved in Hunter Biden's overseas work than the former vice president previously admitted.

Biden, however, has denied any wrongdoing.

Still, Democrats claimed the laptop story was ""Russian disinformation"" meant to sway the election in President Donald Trump's favor just weeks before the election. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe later refuted such allegations.

""Let me be clear, the intelligence community doesn't believe that, because there's no intelligence that supports that, and we have shared no intelligence with Chairman [Adam] Schiff or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden's laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign — it's simply not true,"" Ratcliffe said in October.

Details about the laptop and why the FBI seized it remain murky. Fox News reported that investigators took the laptop in connection to a money-laundering investigation. Details about that investigation were not made public, nor has the FBI confirmed that such an investigation took place.

The most recent development in the story happened last month, when the computer repair shop owner closed his business and allegedly disappeared after receiving death threats.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawmaker-requests-special-counsel-hunter-biden,2020-12-08
'It's liberty': Lawyer for Mississippi abortion provider argues Supreme Court must follow precedent and strike down abortion ban,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case challenging Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only licensed abortion provider in the state of Mississippi, filed a federal lawsuit against the Mississippi law, arguing that it is unconstitutional based on previous rulings from the high court. Lower courts have ruled the law as unconstitutional.

Mississippi Solicitor General Scott G. Stewart, arguing in defense of the law, asked the court to overturn precedents in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey that established a constitutional right to abortion. He said that these precedents ""haunt our country,"" and lack basis in the text of the Constitution.

After the justices finished asking Stewart questions (covered here), Julie Rikelman, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive rights, who is representing Jackson Women's Health, gave her opening statement, arguing Mississippi's abortion ban is ""flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedence."" The justices also heard arguments from U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who is representing the Biden administration against the Mississippi law.

""Mississippi asks the court to dismantle this precedent and allow states to force women to remain pregnant and give birth against their will,"" Rikelman said.

She gave three reasons for the court to strike down the abortion ban, first arguing that court precedent is clear that an ""especially high bar"" must be met before a previous decision should be overturned. Second, Rikelman argued that the landmark decisions in Roe and Casey were correctly decided, and are necessary to prevent the state from seizing control of a woman's body by forcing her to carry an unwanted child to term. She said denying a woman the right to abortion would be a ""fundamental deprivation of her liberty,"" which she argued was protected under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.

Third, Rickelman said eliminating or reducing the right to an abortion will ""propel women backwards."" She argued that Mississippi's law disproportionally impacts poor women who may not be able to afford contraception and younger women who may not immediately recognize signs of pregnancy.

Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, began questions by asking Rickelman a hypothetical based on a 1997 case in which the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a woman who had been charged with child abuse for using cocaine during her pregnancy. The court ruled that a viable fetus was considered a person under the state's criminal code.

Thomas asked Rikelman if she thought the state would still have had an interest in pursuing the case against the woman if her unborn baby was not viable at the time she used cocaine. The question is relevant because court precedent established in Casey says that the states cannot ban abortions before fetal viability or in a case where the restriction would place an ""undue burden"" on a woman's right to a pre-viability abortion. The Mississippi law bans abortions before fetal viability, at 15 weeks.

Thomas wanted to know if the woman who used cocaine has the same right to ""bodily autonomy"" as the woman who seeks an abortion.

Rikelman did not answer the question directly, saying that ""states can certainly regulate pregnancy both before and after viability to preserve fetal life and to preserve the woman's health."" She added that ""there are other constitutional issues at stake,” and this case is about a ""ban on abortion"" which she says violates court precedent.

Up next was Chief justice John Roberts, who began a line of questioning about fetal viability and the 15-week provision of Mississippi's law that seemed to suggest he was looking for a way in which the court might uphold the abortion ban without overturning Roe or Casey.

""Viability, it seems to me, doesn't have anything to do with choice. If it really is an issue about choice, why is 15 weeks not enough time?"" he asked Rikelman.

In answer, Rikelman said that ""without viability there will be no stopping point. States will rush to ban abortion at every point in pregnancy."" She noted that Mississippi has also passed a six-week abortion ban, for example.

But Roberts interrupted — ""I'd like to focus on the 15-week ban because that's not a dramatic departure from viability. It is the standard that a vast majority of other countries have.""

""When you get to the viability standard, we share that standard with the People's Republic of China and North Korea,"" he added. ""And I don't think you have to be in favor of looking to international law to set our constitutional standards to be concerned if those [countries] share that particular time period.""

Other conservative justices seemed less interested in the point about fetal viability and focused in on the precedents in Roe and Casey themselves.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked about adoptions and whether ""safe haven laws"" in all states, which allow women to relinquish parental rights over unwanted children shortly after birth, matter. “It seems to me, seen in that light, both Roe and Casey emphasized the burdens of parenting,” she said. Noting that Rikelman made arguments about how ""forced motherhood would hinder women’s access to the workplace and to equal opportunities,"" Barret asked, ""Why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?""

Justice Samuel Alito asked a question about whether drawing a fetal viability line for when abortion is permissible and when it is not makes sense at all.

""If a woman wants to be free of the burdens of pregnancy, that interest does not disappear the moment the viability line is crossed,"" he said.

""The fetus has an interest in having a life, and that doesn't change, does it, from the point before viability and after viability?""

Rikelman argued that viability is ""objectively verifiable"" and is a logical line to draw because it doesn't require the court to resolve philosophical questions about when life begins.

After a discussion involving Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer on whether Roe and Casey should be considered ""super stare decisis,"" Thomas asked Rikelman a direct question about what constitutional right protects abortion.

""Is it privacy? Autonomy? What would it be?"" he asked.

""It's liberty,"" she replied. ""It's the textual protection in the 14th Amendment that the state can't deny someone liberty without due process of law.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh drilled down on the role of the court and precedent. He observed that the ""other side"" argues that Rikelman's position forces courts ""to pick sides on the most contentious social debate in American life,"" rather than adopt a position of neutrality and let state legislatures hash these debates out.

Rikelman said this issue came up in the court's opinion in Casey and that ruling held that these philosophical disagreements can't be resolved in a way that deprives women of choice. She said the Constitution guarantees liberty and that the court has interpreted liberty to include decisions related to ""childbearing, marriage, and family.""

Kavanaugh's last question to Rikelman was about stare decisis and monumental court decisions that overturned previous court precedent. Brown v. Board of Education, Lawrence v. Texas, and Obergefell were among the cases overturning precedent that he listed as ""some of the most consequential and important"" decisions in the history of the court.

“If we think that the prior precedents are seriously wrong,” Kavanaugh asked, “why then doesn’t the history of this court’s practice ... tell us that the right answer is actually a return to the position of neutrality?”

Rikelman responded that the view that court precedent was wrong has ""never been enough"" to justify overturning stare decisis. ""The court has required something else, a special justification, and the state doesn't come forward with any special justification,"" she argued.

The justices revisited many of these points when Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar made her arguments defending the right to abortion. Prelogar said in her opening remarks that the ""real-world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift,"" noting that about half of the states in the union have abortion restrictions on the books that would trigger if Roe is overturned.

Justice Stephen Breyer gave an impassioned plea to his colleagues to read a certain passage from Casey describing when it is appropriate for the court to overturn precedent. Alito asked if it is ever right for the court to overturn a prior decision simply because it was ""egregiously wrong"" — and Prelogar answered ""no,"" arguing the court has never held that as enough of a reason to overturn stare decisis.

Kavanaugh expressed skepticism that abortion precedent currently accommodates the interests of both pregnant women and unborn children, even suggesting it is impossible to do so.

""You can’t accommodate both interests. You have to pick. That’s the fundamental problem. And one interest has to prevail over the other at any given point in time. And that’s why this is so challenging,"" he said.

He asked if the right solution was the one offered by Mississippi, for the court to be neutral on abortion and let the elected representatives of the people debate the value of human life versus individual liberty.

""There will be different answers in Mississippi and New York, different answers in Alabama and California, because there are two different interests at stake and the people in those states might value those interests somewhat differently,"" he said. ""Why is that not the right answer?”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawyer-for-mississippi-abortion-provider-argues-supreme-court-must-follow-precedent-and-strike-down-abortion-ban,2021-12-01
LBGTQ rainbow flag flying at US embassy to the Vatican for Pride Month — and backlash is swift,"An LBGTQ rainbow flag is flying at the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See for the month of June, which is Pride Month.

""The United States respects the dignity and equality of LGBTQI+ people,"" the embassy said on its Instagram page regarding the display of the rainbow flag. ""LGBTQI+ rights are human rights.""

What are the details?

An embassy statement to EWTN News Nightly says in part, ""The United States will lead by the power of our example and pursue policy to end violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics.""

EWTN reported that in previous years the rainbow flag was not flown for Pride Month at the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See but was flown at the U.S. Embassy to Italy. The outlet said the Vatican had no comment.

The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is not in Vatican City but in the same compound as the U.S. Embassy to the Italian Republic, according to LifeSite.

'Shame on our State Department'

As you might imagine, backlash against the display of the rainbow flag was swift.

Nebraska Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts was not pleased with the move, noting on Twitter that ""as a Catholic, I'm curious to know if the Biden-Harris Embassy in the Holy See will promote respect for Catholic teaching on family and freedom of conscience — or whether we can simply expect more political stunts like this.""

Evangelical Christian leader Franklin Graham also offered strong words in opposition to the gesture: ""Shame on our State Department for allowing the American Embassy at the Vatican to fly the LGBTQ pride flag. What an insult to the Catholic Church! This flag is promoting an agenda, not a country, & to give it equal billing with the American flag is wrong.""

Others expressed similar sentiments on the embassy's Instagram page:

""Your job is diplomacy NOT touting immorality,"" one commenter wrote.

""This is contrary to Catholic teaching and a slap in the face to actual practicing Catholics,"" another user declared. ""Funny how you don't post this flag in Saudi Arabia and other countries…""

""Actually it's the month of the Sacred Heart,"" another commenter said. ""Not the month of using a flag for false niceties.""

Anything else?

As TheBlaze recently reported, Republican U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York introduced a bill to prevent political flags other than the American flag from being flown outside U.S. embassies around the world in response to the Biden administration authorizing U.S. embassies to fly LGBTQ and Black Lives Matter flags.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lbgtq-rainbow-flag-us-embassy-vatican,2021-06-04
Leaked audio from a top-secret meeting confirms the Chinese military is preparing to invade Taiwan,"According to leaked audio from a top-secret meeting of Chinese military officials, China may soon launch an invasion of Taiwan.

The Times of India reported that an audio clip revealing dialogue between officials from China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), surfaced on YouTube marking the first time since the formation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 that a recording of a top-secret meeting of China’s military command has leaked.

The Times reported that the video containing the meeting’s conversation, along with English translations of what is being discussed, “appears authentic.”

Exclusive: Top-classified PLA meeting audio held on 14/5/2022 has been obtained youtu.be

Reportedly, “allies” within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the PLA recorded the audio. There is now an ongoing manhunt to uncover the source of the leak.

According to the audio, during the operation against Taiwan the Chinese military will have to safeguard the Pearl River Delta area in the Guangdong province. The Guangdong province is a densely populated part of China and home to much of China’s domestic industry.

The Guangdong province is often credited as being the heartbeat of Chinese industry. It includes the world class trading hub and hi-tech capital, Shenzhen, where digital behemoths Huawei and Tencent Industries are headquartered. It also includes Hong Kong, Macau, and the furniture capital Dongguan.

It’s reasonable to conclude that the protection of the Pearl River Delta is crucial to the CCP preserving stability of the Guangdong region and China in general. Should these areas be compromised by China’s enemies, large swaths of the Chinese economy will become extremely vulnerable.

Some of the leaked audio from the top-secret meeting confirmed that the invasion would be a massive operation.

A speaker at the meeting said, “First, the mobilization tasks issued to our province by the eastern and southern war zones totaling 20 categories and 293 items, mainly 1,358 detachments of various types with a total of 140,000 personnel, 953 ships of various types, and 1653 units/sets of various unmanned equipment.”

"Left-wing officials angry that 'anti-LGBTQ' Franklin Graham, Samaritan's Purse are helping NYC coronavirus victims. Officials get smacked right down.","Upon hearing the news that Samaritan's Purse — the relief organization run by Christian evangelist Franklin Graham — is coming to the aid of coronavirus victims in New York City by setting up a temporary hospital in Central Park, a couple of officials were none too pleased.

A temporary hospital is built in Central Park during the coronavirus pandemic on Monday in New York City. The facility is a partnership between Mount Sinai Hospital and Christian humanitarian aid organization Samaritan's Purse, and equipped with 68 beds to treat COVID-19 patients.

Who are the officials, and what did they say?



First up was New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who tweeted a statement berating the development: ""Franklin Graham has a long history of spewing anti-LGBTQ hate speech, and I find it extremely troubling that he and his organization are involved in our relief efforts in any way. New York City is known around the world for its embrace of diversity, and Franklin Graham has spent his career standing against these values. I will be monitoring this situation closely and making sure that our city's values are being represented at all times.""

Then there was New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman, who tweeted that ""it's a shame that the federal government has left New York with no other choice but to accept charity from bigots."" In a statement on his official Senate page, Hoylman called Graham a ""notorious anti-LGBTQ pastor"" and said he put Graham ""on notice"" that Samaritan's Purse must ""treat all COVID-19 patients equally at the new medical tents.""

Here's Hoylman's full statement:

COVID-19 doesn't discriminate, and neither should Franklin Graham. It's unacceptable that a New Yorker infected with COVID-19 could be subjected to discriminatory treatment from an organization whose leader calls us ""immoral"" and ""detestable.""



Today I'm calling on Franklin Graham to publicly assure LGBTQ New Yorkers that they will receive the same treatment as anyone else at the Central Park field hospital. The City of New York and the Mount Sinai hospital network must monitor conditions closely at Graham's facility and ensure every single LGBTQ patient is treated fairly. We cannot abandon our moral compass in the middle of a pandemic.



Sadly, beggars can't be choosers: New York needs every ventilator we can get. But homophobic pastor Franklin Graham and his field hospital operation in Central Park must guarantee all LGBTQ patients with COVID-19 are treated with dignity and respect.



We'll be watching.

What was the reaction?



While Johnson and Hoylman tickled a few itching ears with their decidedly virtue-signaling statements, quite a few others found their words rather, er, prejudiced:

""The vast majority of voters see this as a group of well intended people bringing hope and light into a dark place right now. Put the partisan politics aside for a season and be thankful for the people willing to serve NYC. This is not the time to score political points sir.""

""Now we can all really see where the actual hate comes from.""

""As a gay New Yorker, I'd like to sit down with them over a cup of coffee and thank them for putting themselves in harm's way. That's how change of heart happens. They are risking their lives. We should be grateful.""

""It's a shame that idiots like you would rather people die than have someone you don't agree with help them.""

""Christians build a free hospital to help New Yorkers survive this crisis and you complain? Despicable.""

""Whose the bigot? Christians believe what they believe. Get over it. They love people they disagree with. Even you!""

""Let it go. They are compassionate and want to help. Now who's the bigot?""

""Virtue-signaling boob.""

""And spare us your woke outrage. Holding a sincerely held religious belief about marriage (I personally think his scripture read is wrong) is not the same as hate speech. Your religious intolerance in the name of wokeness is a bigger threat to our republic.""

""It's pretty clear who's there to help New Yorkers and who's there to mouth off on twitter and do absolutely nothing.""

How did Graham respond?

""We do not make distinctions about an individual's religion, race, sexual orientation, or economic status. We certainly do not discriminate, and we have a decades-long track record that confirms just that,"" Graham told NBC News in a statement. ""This is a time for all of us to unite and work together, regardless of our political views. Let's support one another during this crisis, and we pray that God will bless the efforts of all those battling this vicious virus.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-officials-angry-that-anti-lgbtq-franklin-graham-samaritans-purse-are-helping-nyc-coronavirus-victims-officials-get-smacked-right-down,2020-04-01
Left-wing writer gets skewered for saying 'white men' have been acting like 'victims' ever since the Vietnam War,"Progressive magazine New Republic last week published a book review titled ""The White Men Who Wanted to Be Victims.""

The reviewer, Chris Lehmann, heaps praise upon Joseph Darda's tome, ""How White Men Won the Culture Wars: A History of Veteran America,"" calling it ""eye-opening"" and an ""original and persuasive revisionist study.""

Lehmann also gleefully declares that when it comes to ""cancel culture, wokeness, and the like,"" the ""loudest and most visible partisans in these battles are aggrieved white men, insisting that they're scapegoats in unhinged identity-driven witch hunts and eagerly putting themselves forward as martyrs in ugly confrontations over free speech.""

The central argument is that beginning with the Vietnam War ""aggrieved"" white men have been playing ""a discriminated-against minority"" — and among the pop-culture examples is Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo character, particularly in 1985's ""Rambo: First Blood Part 2"" in which the ""aggrieved"" Vietnam veteran issues bloody payback against all of his overseas opponents.

Here's how Lehmann puts it:

Stallone's title character is dispatched back to Vietnam on a POW rescue mission and delivers his signature catchphrase in reply to the officer briefing him: ""Sir, do we get to win this time?"" The movie script also goes out of its way to give the character of Rambo a new ethnic identity that hadn't been referenced in the franchise's debut film or in the novel that formed the basis of the Rambo series: He's made half-Native American. As Darda notes, Rambo's manufactured Indigenous backstory gave a character played by a white actor a way to co-opt a narrative of discrimination: ""The white ethnic revival had made white minorities the most American thing of all.… In the 1980s, that meant a white actor starring as a half-Indian soldier—a minoritization that, as simulated rather than embodied, allowed all white men to see themselves reflected in it.""

Reaction is brutal

In the aftermath, New Republic posted a tweet Wednesday noting Lehmann's ""The White Men Who Wanted to Be Victims"" review — and the backlash and ratio-ing has been severe so far. As of Thursday afternoon, the tweet has attracted 964 comments compared to only 42 likes.

Here's what some of the commenters had to say to Lehmann — and in fairness likely to Darda and the New Republic:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-writer-skewered-white-victims,2021-05-27
"After series of UK milkshake tossing incidents, leftists say such physical attacks are effective — and 'absolutely hilarious'","Following a series of incidents involving protesters pelting U.K. political figures with milkshakes — the latest being pro-Brexit leader Nigel Farage on Monday — leftists are saying that such physical attacks against ideological opponents are nothing if not effective and even ""absolutely hilarious.""

Tommy Robinson, former English Defense League leader, has been hit in public with milkshakes a number of times recently, and ""alt-right"" YouTube figure Carl Benjamin got multiple servings of the same as well.

Writing for New Republic, Matt Ford contended that ""milkshaking is so potent against Farage and his brethren"" because it ""humiliates them.""

Nigel Farage doused in milkshake on the campaign trail youtu.be

More from Ford's piece:

Throwing a milkshake at someone is rude at worst. It may also qualify as assault in some jurisdictions, especially in the United States. British political and media figures condemned the incidents. Prime Minister Theresa May's office said that politicians ""should be able to go about their work and campaign without harassment, intimidation and abuse."" Tim Farron, the leader of the pro-Europe Liberal Democrats, said, ""I'm not laughing along with the attack on Farage. Violence and intimidation are wrong no matter who they're aimed at. On top of that, it just makes the man a martyr, it's playing into his hands.""



Yet Ford noted that ""nothing animates the far right or shapes its worldview quite so much as the desire to humiliate others — and the fear of being humiliated themselves. It's why 'alt-right' trolls, projecting their own sexual insecurities, enjoy calling their opponents 'cucks.' It's why they rally around blustery authoritarian figures like Donald Trump who cast themselves as beyond embarrassment, shame, or ridicule. They brandish humiliation like a weapon while craving release from it.""

Ford also pointed out that persistent Antifa violence has led to opponents' ""fear of public clashes"" with the masked, far-left civilian army, all of which has had an ""intimidating and profound"" effect.

'Absolutely hilarious'

Amid complaints that the Farage milkshake incident was inherently violent or could lead to more pronounced violence, Aditya Chakrabortty noted in an op-ed for The Guardian that ""chucking a milkshake is not political violence at all; it is political theater, of a kind shared down the ages and across countries.""

In the same vein, the headline of an Independent article on the Farage milkshake incident characterized the act as ""absolutely hilarious.""

""For several weeks now, Nigel Farage has been visiting every part of the country, delivering a stump speech on Brexit that is a lie from start to finish, and no politician has done anything to stop him,"" Tom Peck, a political sketch writer, noted in his piece. ""The sum total of the resistance he has thus far met is £5.25's worth of salted caramel milkshake. Not great, but it's better than nothing.""

But not everybody agrees

In a notable retort to the ""absolutely hilarious"" headline of Peck's piece, we have the following clip showing Piers Morgan asking Peck himself if he'd find it funny if anti-Brexit politician Anna Soubry had a milkshake thrown at her.

Peck is deft enough with his pen, but he's clearly pushed out of his depth — for a few funny moments, at least — after being cornered by Morgan's pointed question:

Another Independent op-ed took the opposite position from Peck's piece, as Kate Townshend wrote that while she can't ""feel much pity for a man whose rhetoric makes me want to claw my own ears off,"" she wouldn't have tossed a milkshake at Farage, either.

""I can't help but imagine the moment some unknown liquid from some unknown assailant hits you is pretty terrifying,"" Townshend noted, adding that she'd be a ""hypocrite to condone it for Farage"" when she wouldn't want it happening to political figures she likes.

More from Townshend's piece:

On the one hand, nobody should have to walk around in fear of having things thrown at them, but on the other, a temporarily milky face is also just not a satisfying redress.



I'd far rather see the Brexit Party nosedive in terms of its expected votes on Thursday. I'd far rather see Farage unemployed and ignored by every media outlet currently so keen to provide him with a platform. I want him irrelevant, not just slightly damp and embarrassed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftists-support-physical-attacks-on-ideological-opponents,2019-05-22
Liberal journalist delivers scathing rebuke of the left's new politics of 'social control',"Zaid Jilani — a journalist who formerly reported for liberal organizations such asThinkProgress, United Republic, Alternet, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee — recently took aim at members of his own ideological tribe over their newfound penchant for censorship, suppression, and cancellation.

What did he say?

In an op-ed for Newsweek published Monday, Jilani, who now hosts the podcast ""Extremely Offline,"" masterfully exposed the left's drift from its ""old politics of social liberation"" to its new ""politics of social control,"" a movement he claims escalated during the Trump presidency.

As proof of this new politics, Jilani cited the immediate actions taken by newly elected Democratic Rep. Cori Bush (Mo.). Her election, he thought, had ""created an opportunity for progressive change,"" yet her very first bill introduced in Congress ""called for an investigation into and possible expulsion of over 100 House Republicans who objected to the certification of electoral college votes on Jan. 6th, the same day as the Capitol riot.""

Should such an expulsion take place, he noted, not only would it disenfranchise tens of millions of voters, but it would ""demonstrate a glaring double standard,"" since Democratic lawmakers in the not-so-distant past voted to do the same thing. That's not even to mention the woefully problematic precedent that would be set.

""After all, if we were to hold everyone who holds a certain belief responsible for a small number of their ideological allies who resort to violence, then Bush herself would have to be expelled; she is after all an outspoken supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, whose protests have at times devolved into violent riots,"" he wrote. A stunning admission from a progressive writer.



What else?

If people should need further proof of the left's politics, they need to look no further than ""bias response teams"" on college campuses or big tech's evolution into ""a 21st century speech police,"" Jilani argued as if writing for some conservative outlet.

""This new politics of social control means using public and private institutions, almost all of which are now controlled by left-leaning people, to coerce individuals into their preferred modes of being and even thinking,"" he wrote.

He later added: ""The left's system of social control is focused squarely in one direction: at individuals, organizations, and ideologies perceived to be representing the excesses of the right,"" noting that the left believes ""the only way to deal with this conflagration is with repression, ranging from classmates snitching on each other to a new domestic anti-terrorism law.""

Jilani also argued that mainstream media has played a major role in the left's transformation by exaggerating racism and sexism in the country and thus fomenting division and stoking fear. This fear, he argues, is the impetus for the left's crusade of ""surveilling, censoring, punishing, and expelling.""

""When we're in a climate of fear, the impulse to just do something is overwhelming,"" he notes.

Anything else?

By way of conclusion, Jilani offered some salient advice for his friends in the progressive movement:

The left should move away from a posture that sees social control as its primary function and remember its roots in social liberation. Bullying and repressing people backfires. The best way to fight hate is by building trust, even with those who dislike us.



The left has traditionally existed to liberate human beings, not take pleasure in controlling and punishing people it views as aberrant or evil. Social control should be a last resort, not a pastime. Only by realizing this can the left resume its mission of expanding human freedom by promoting the dignity of every person.

For the conservative reader, Jilani's arguments are hardly anything new. Though still, conservatives should celebrate the fact that a progressive writer would wield them.

It appears there is yet some self-awareness in left-leaning circles. Perhaps it will win the day.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-journalist-exposes-left-social-control,2021-02-09
Liberal mag posts open letter signed by left-wing notables saying it's time to cancel Cancel Culture,"For years now, conservatives and freedom-lovers have lamented, mocked, and warned against the growing trend of cancel culture. The act — a tool of the woke class — includes digging up controversial things a person has said or done in years past and then getting them fired from their jobs or socially punished for the ""crime.""

More often than not, it's the political left that engages in cancel culture — though members of the right will employ it from time to time to make a point or settle scores.

So it was quite a thing when left-wing monthly Harper's Magazine posted an open letter Tuesday signed by 150 liberal writers, journalists, and academics — from ""Harry Potter"" creator J.K. Rowling to rabid feminist Gloria Steinem — calling for an end to cancel culture.

The letter, naturally, begins with liberal platitudes (""Powerful protests for racial and social justice are leading to overdue demands for police reform, along with wider calls for greater equality and inclusion across our society, not least in higher education, journalism, philanthropy, and the arts."") and anti-Trump language (""The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat to democracy."").

But surrounding that liberal boilerplate language in the first paragraph is the beginning of what grows into a woke nightmare of left-on-left violence.

The opening text points out a ""new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity,"" against which the signatories are raising their voices.

They warn that ""resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion,"" adding that if the left wants to achieve its goal of ""democratic inclusion,"" then it must ""speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.""

They continue:

The free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted. While we have come to expect this on the radical right, censoriousness is also spreading more widely in our culture: an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty.

Sounding downright Founders-like, the letter signers laud the protection of speech, even speech they might not like, and decry the ""calls for swift and severe retribution in response to perceived transgressions of speech and thought."" And they criticize ""institutional leaders"" who engage in ""panicked damage control"" and punish those attacked by the woke brigade. For example:



Editors are fired for running controversial pieces; books are withdrawn for alleged inauthenticity; journalists are barred from writing on certain topics; professors are investigated for quoting works of literature in class; a researcher is fired for circulating a peer-reviewed academic study; and the heads of organizations are ousted for what are sometimes just clumsy mistakes. Whatever the arguments around each particular incident, the result has been to steadily narrow the boundaries of what can be said without the threat of reprisal. We are already paying the price in greater risk aversion among writers, artists, and journalists who fear for their livelihoods if they depart from the consensus, or even lack sufficient zeal in agreement.

They close by warning that restricting speech will ultimately harm liberal causes and remind readers that the best antidote for ""bad"" speech is more speech:

This stifling atmosphere will ultimately harm the most vital causes of our time. The restriction of debate, whether by a repressive government or an intolerant society, invariably hurts those who lack power and makes everyone less capable of democratic participation. The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away. We refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other.

Other notable liberals adding their names next to Rowling and Steinem were philosopher Noam Chomsky, writer Malcolm Gladwell, academic Jonathan Haidt, Vox editor Matthew Yglesias, CNN's Fareed Zakaria, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, author Salman Rushdie, journalist Anne Applebaum, New Republic's Damon Linker, and reporter Olivia Nuzzi.

Outraged liberals call on Biden to fire AG Merrick Garland over lack of prosecutions in Jan. 6 investigation,"Frustration over the lack of prosecution in the Jan. 6 investigation has bubbled over into online outrage from liberals demanding that Attorney General Merrick Garland be replaced.

The furor was fomented by a screed issued by former congresswoman Clare McCaskill on MSNBC where she outlined Democrats' accusations against former President Donald Trump and his alleged involvement in the rioting at the U.S. Capitol.

""Any responsible leader would want to end the violence, not provoke it!"" yelled McCaskill about Trump on Jan. 6.

""That's what he did that day, and that's what this committee is going to lay out, and that’s where Merrick Garland is either going to rise to the occasion or go down in infamy as one of the worst attorney generals in this country’s history!"" she added.

Many on the left took the opportunity to demand Garland be replaced in order to jumpstart any prosecution against Trump and his former aides.

""PLEASE PLEASE REPLACE #MerrickGarland with @SallyQYates. #MerrickGarland please put #SallyYates in charge of a Special Council on the people who have publicly admitted to trying to overthrow the government,"" tweeted actress Debra Messing.

""Does anyone else agree that Merrick Garland should be replaced?"" said filmmaker Chip Franklin.

""I’d like to think Merrick Garland’s plan includes resigning so Sally Yates can take over as Attorney General immediately please,"" read another tweet.

""There is no legal or strategic or smart reason for him to do absolutely nothing and 'wait',"" tweeted Cheri Jacobus. ""THERE IS NO REASON FOR MERRICK GARLAND TO NOT HAVE ACTED.""

""Merrick Garland is seemingly sitting on his hands, doing nothing while watching democracy to die,"" replied Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi.

""We need proof of life from Merrick Garland. He MUST prosecute Donald Trump and ALL involved in BOTH his coup and the Jan 6 terrorist attack. Our Republic hangs in the balance!"" tweeted Muslim comedian Dean Obeidallah.

The Jan. 6 committee plans to issue an interim report with many of its findings in the summer of 2022 after also holding public hearings. The committee has already interviewed 300 witnesses and obtained 35,000 pages of records pertaining to the attack on the Capitol.

"Lindsey Graham accused Rand Paul of 'empowering the enemy', and he just shot back a fiery response","Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) accused fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) of a ""low gutter type of response"" for accusing him of aiding U.S. enemies in his support of the Democrats' resolution to limit executive war powers.

Paul responded to Graham's criticism on CNN on Wednesday after host Wolf Blitzer played footage of the criticism from Graham.

""I think they're overreacting quite frankly,"" said Graham.

""Go debate all you want to, I'm going to debate you, trust me, I'm gonna let people know that in this moment in time to play this game with the War Powers Act, which I think is unconstitutional, is, whether you mean to or not, you're empowering the enemy,"" he continued.

""I know you don't mean to,"" Graham concluded, ""but we live in the real world here. So debate all you went, this is a constitutional democracy, but get ready for a lively debate.""

Paul and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) were incensed about a meeting with the White House where they claimed that the justification for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani last week was lacking.

""You know I think it's sad when people have this fake sort of drape of patriotism, and anybody that disagrees with them is not a patriot,"" responded Paul.

""Look, I love my country, I have many family members who have served in the military and continue to serve in the military. I like my country as much as the next guy, but for him to insult and to say that somehow we're not as patriotic as he is,"" he added.

""He hasn't even read the history of the Constitution. The Constitution specifically says that the war-making power resides in Congress. He believes in this unitary theory of the executive that presidents can do whatever they want, the only way you can stop them is by defunding a war,"" Paul continued.

""That's not what our founding fathers said. It's not what the Constitution says. And he insults the Constitution, our Founding Fathers, and what we do stand for in this Republic by making light of it and accusing people of lacking patriotism,"" he added.

""I think that's a low, gutter-type of response,"" Paul concluded.

Paul admitted that Soleimani was evil, but said the issue was what the global political ramifications would be to such a drastic military action.

"Liz Cheney draws primary challenge from gun activist, hardcore conservative Wyoming state senator","U.S. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has drawn her first 2022 primary challenger after voting last week to impeach President Donald Trump.

Wyoming Republican state Sen. Anthony Bouchard filed a statement of candidacy on Wednesday for Wyoming's lone congressional seat, initiating a primary challenge against Cheney for the next midterm elections.

""Wyoming was President Trump's best state both times he ran. That's because Wyoming voters are strong conservatives who want our leaders to stand up for America, defend our freedoms, fight for our way of life and always put working people first as President Trump did,"" Bouchard said in a statement.

""Liz Cheney's long-time opposition to President Trump and her most recent vote for Impeachment shows just how out-of-touch she is with Wyoming. Wyoming taxpayers need a voice in Congress who will stand up to Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats, and not give them cover. That's why I'm running for Congress.""



Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, infuriated Republicans in her home state by supporting the Democratic-led effort to oust Trump from office two weeks before his term was set to expire in response to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. The backlash was so severe that the Wyoming Republican Party felt obligated to publish a ""message"" to Cheney sharing some of the scathing remarks they had received from Republican voters upset with her position.

On Tuesday, Republicans in Carbon County, Wyoming, voted unanimously to censure Cheney and submitted their resolution to the state GOP for consideration.

""Representative Cheney has violated the trust of her voters, failed to faithfully represent a very large majority of motivated Wyoming voters, and neglected her duty to represent the party and the will of the people who elected her to represent them,"" the resolution states.

Additionally, some of Cheney's colleagues in the House last week circulated a petition to remove her from GOP leadership, an action opposed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).

In a conference call with Wyoming reporters last week after the impeachment proceedings, Cheney defended her vote and condemned President Trump.

""I will continue to talk to and hear from my constituents all over Wyoming. But when it came down to it, the president of the United States inciting a mob ... is, in my mind, absolutely high crimes and misdemeanors,"" she said.

""I really don't consider the politics at all. There are just times when those of us who are elected officials are called on to act in a way that does not take politics into consideration,"" she added. ""I think it would be wrong to think about this decision and this vote in the context of politics.""

According to KPVI-TV, Bouchard, the founder of the gun rights activist group Wyoming Gun Owners, has a reputation in the Wyoming legislature as one of the most conservative lawmakers, an uncompromising legislator who has at times been at odds with state Republican leadership.

In the 2020 election, Bouchard was challenged in the state Republican primaries by a lobbyist supported by incumbent and former state senate Republicans, going on to defeat his challenger and win re-election to the Senate.

After Cheney announced her intention to impeach Trump on Jan. 12, Bouchard slammed her on social media.

""Liz Cheney's insistence on ATTACKING President Trump at this late hour is a despicable representation of the people of Wyoming, which President Trump won very easily and which supports the Trump agenda 100%,"" he posted on Facebook.

His campaign website indicates he's running for Congress to ""to stand up and defend our rights and our republic against angry Socialists and their allies in Big Tech, academia and the Fake News Media.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liz-cheney-draws-primary-challenge,2021-01-20
"'I will vote to impeach the president,' says GOP Rep. Liz Cheney","Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming became the second House Republican to announce support of the impeachment of President Donald Trump after a congressman representing New York's 24th congressional district became the first.

Rep. John Katko of New York was the first House Republican to announce support Tuesday afternoon.

""On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic,"" Cheney said in her statement

""Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,"" she continued.

""Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not,"" Cheney said.

""There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" she added.

""I will vote to impeach the President,"" Cheney concluded.

Katko, a former federal prosecutor, gave similar reasons for his support of impeachment.

""To allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy,"" Katko said in a statement. ""For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this president.""

Prior to the announcements, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reportedly told people close to him that he believed Trump had committed impeachable offenses over his encouragement of the rioting at the U.S. Capitol.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois also announced on Tuesday that he would support a second impeachment.

Democrats have drawn up an article of impeachment that accuses the president of inciting an insurrection.

Trump was first impeached by the Democrat-controlled House in December 2019 on two articles of impeachment related to a controversial call the president made to the president of Ukraine. The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted against convicting and removing the president.

Liz Cheney absolutely gushes over Nancy Pelosi as 'tremendous leader' with 'historic consequence',"Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) praised House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a ""tremendous leader"" on Tuesday.

What did Cheney say?

Speaking with PBS, Cheney, a lifelong conservative Republican, described Pelosi as a leader of ""historic consequence.""

""I want to say a word about Speaker Pelosi. I did not really know her before I began work on the Jan. 6 committee,"" Cheney began. ""I'm not sure if I had ever spoken to her, actually.

""But since I have been on the committee — and I say this: Everyone knows she is a liberal from San Francisco, I am a conservative from Wyoming, there are many issues, maybe most issues, on which we disagree,"" she continued.

""But I think she is a tremendous leader. I have watched her up close. She is a leader of historic consequence,"" Cheney declared. ""She has put this committee together and demonstrated her commitment to the truth.""

The remark was prompted by PBS host Judy Woodruff, who asked Cheney to respond to the attack on Paul Pelosi. Woodruff described the incident as ""the latest example of political violence fueled by far-right conspiracies.""

Law enforcement, however, has not released evidence showing that Paul Pelosi's attacker was motivated by ""far-right conspiracies.""

Also on Tuesday, Cheney endorsed Democrat Tim Ryan over Republican J.D. Vance for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat.

""I would not vote for J.D. Vance,"" Cheney said in her interview with PBS.

When asked if that means she would, instead, vote for Ryan, Cheney responded, ""I would.""

The admission came one day after Cheney announced her first-ever endorsement of a Democrat when she campaigned for Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.).

""If we want to ensure the safety of our republic, we have to walk away from politics as usual,"" Cheney said. ""We are going to look beyond partisan politics. If the people in our party are not doing the job they need to do, than we're going to vote for the people in the other party, because we are Americans above all else.""

Liz Cheney calls Trump 'a domestic threat' and criticizes Republicans supporting 'this dangerous and irrational man',"Rep. Elizabeth Cheney lambasted former President Donald Trump and his supporters in the Republican party during a speech Tuesday.

Cheney called Trump a ""domestic threat"" and accused him of working against the Constitution and the rule of law. She was speaking in New Hampshire at St. Anselm College.

""At this moment when it matters most, we are also confronting a domestic threat that we've never faced before: a former president who's attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic, aided by political leaders who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man,"" said Cheney.

Cheney was among ten Republicans who voted to impeach Trump during the second impeachment on charges that he incited an insurrection on Jan. 6 when some of his supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol. She criticized him for continuing to reject the official results of the presidential election.

""Political leaders who sit silent in the face of these false and dangerous claims are aiding a former president who is at war with the rule of law and the Constitution,"" she continued.

""When our constitutional order is threatened as it is now, rising above partisanship is not simply an aspiration it is an obligation, an obligation of every one of us,"" she added.

Cheney went on to say that she disagrees with the policies of President Joe Biden while enumerating the ideals of conservatism.

""His policies are bad for this country. I believe deeply that conservative principles, limited government, low taxes, a strong national defense, the family, the family as the essential building block of our nation, and our society, those are the right ideals for this country,"" she said.

""I love my party,"" Cheney added. ""I love its history, I love its principles. But I love my country more.""

Trump has fired back at Cheney many times over her criticism, and has even backed a primary challenger to her congressional seat in the 2022 midterm election. Wyoming has only one at-large congressional district.

Louisiana GOP issues stinging rebuke of Sen. Bill Cassidy after he votes for constitutionality of trial against Trump,"The Louisiana state Republican Party issued a stinging rebuke of one of their U.S. senators after he voted in favor of the constitutionality of the impeachment trial against former President Donald Trump.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said that the House managers arguing for the constitutionality of the trial persuaded him to vote in favor of the resolution and the lawyers defending Trump did a poor job.

""It was disorganized, random. They talked about many things but they didn't talk about the issue at hand, and so, if I'm an impartial juror, and I'm trying to make a decision based upon the facts as presented on this issue, then the House managers did a much better job,"" Cassidy said to reporters.

The motion passed 56-44 with six Republicans, including Cassidy, voting with the Democrats.

""The issue at hand is, is it constitutional to impeach a president who has left office, and the House managers made a compelling, cogent case and the president's team did not,"" Cassidy explained.

He went on to say that he was approaching the trial as an impartial juror when asked if he was open to convicting Trump.

The Republican Party of Louisiana immediately issued a statement rebuking Cassidy for his vote.

""The Republican Party of Louisiana is profoundly disappointed by Senator Bill Cassidy's vote on the constitutionality of the impeachment trial now underway against former President, now private citizen, Donald J. Trump. We feel that an impeachment trial of a private citizen is not only an unconstitutional act, but also an attack on the very foundation of American democracy, which will have far reaching and unforeseen consequences for our republic,"" the statement read.

""We also remind all Americans that former President Trump is innocent of the politically motivated, bogus charges now pending against him in a kangaroo court presided over by an openly hostile, political opponent. How far justice has fallen in the short time that Democrats have been in control of the federal government!"" the statement concluded.

One Trump lawyer said he remained confident that they would win regardless of Cassidy's unexpected vote.

""We had a good day,"" Bruce Castor said.

When asked about Cassidy's vote, he responded, ""I don't think anything of it. If it leaks down to 34 then I'll start to worry.""



The former president is not likely to be convicted by the Senate given that Republicans control 50 seats and two-thirds (or 67 members) of the Senate needs to vote in favor of conviction in order for it to pass the constitutional threshold.

When Cassidy was asked what was so bad about the attorneys' argument, he responded, ""Did you listen to it? It speaks for itself.""

Luxury brand Dior apologizes to China for map flap: 'Dior always respects and upholds the one China principle',"Luxury brand Christian Dior has issued an apology to the nation of China for omitting Taiwan from a map used for a recruitment and internship demonstration at a Chinese college.

Taiwain has been self-ruled since the 1950s, but Beijing considers the island territory a Chinese province.

What are the details?

According to a Thursday Reuters report, the company came under fire after one of its recruiting demonstrators used a map that did not feature the island of Taiwan.

The incident took place during a Dior presentation at Zhejiang Gongshang University in the city of Hangzhou.

In its apology, the company insisted that it respected the country's territorial sovereignty and its citizens' feelings.

The news agency reported that the topic ""Dior statement"" was one of the most viewed on Chinese social media platform Weibo as of Thursday with approximately 100 million views.

In a statement, the company said, ""Dior first extends our deep apologies for the incorrect statement and misrepresentation made by a Dior staff member at a campus presentation.""

“Dior always respects and upholds the one China principle, strictly safeguards China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and treasures the feelings of the Chinese people,"" the statement added, and pointed out that it would work hard to avoid any future occurrence of similar incidents.

The South China Morning Post reported an additional statement from the French luxury brand.

""Dior is a friend of China and celebrates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with 1.4 billion Chinese people,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The outlet also pointed out that the employee who showed the map in question initially seemed to struggle to answer why Taiwan was not included on the map.

""During the presentation, a student questioned why the self-ruled island was not included in the map, according to a video widely circulated on Chinese social media,"" the outlet wrote. ""At first, the employee explained Taiwan was too small to be shown. But after it was pointed out that the much smaller Hainan island was included, the employee explained that Taiwan and Hong Kong were only included in Dior's presentations on 'Greater China.'""

What else?

This is the latest controversy in a string of many that have plagued western China relations.

In 2018, U.S. company the Gap issued an apology for a similar incident in which the clothing retailer failed to include Taiwan in a China map graphic.

More recently, there has been some head-butting between western companies and China over the Hong Kong protests that have played out in the region for the last several months, and even the NBA became embroiled in the debate after Houston Rockets exec Daryl Morey tweeted support for the protests and NBA commissioner Adam Silver defended Morey's right to such speech.

'I don’t cower to the mob' — GOP candidate Madison Cawthorn fires back at 'liberal lies' about his photos from Hitler's vacation retreat,"A Republican congressional candidate from North Carolina is fighting back against an attempt to discredit him based on photos he posted to Instagram from a location that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler used for a vacation retreat.

Madison Cawthorn, 25, fired back at reports trying to frame his posts as proof that he was supportive of racism and white supremacy.

""I don't cower to the mob. The new Republican Party that I represent will fight back against liberal lies,"" Cawthorn said on his Twitter account.

The post from his Instagram featured a photograph of Cawthorn and his brother at Eagle's Nest, a historical site that Hitler is known to have used as a vacation retreat.

""The vacation house of the Führer. Seeing the Eagles Nest has been on my bucket list for awhile, it did not disappoint. Strange to hear so many laughs and share such a good time with my brother where only 79 years ago a supreme evil shared laughs and good times with his compatriots,"" wrote Cawthorn in the post from July 2017.

Cawthorn said that he took his photograph in the same spirit as U.S. military forces did later to celebrate their defeat of the Nazi threat.

""Another fake news controversy,"" he tweeted. ""When our soldiers were photographed at the Eagle's Nest in 1945 they were clearly celebrating the Allies triumph over one of the greatest evils in human history. They weren't celebrating evil; they were celebrating their victory over evil.""

He reportedly archived the post and then reinstated it when liberal publications like the Huffington Post and Jezebel reported on the controversy.

A surprise victory

Cawthorn stunned the political world in June when he won the Republican nomination for the election for North Carolina's 11th Congressional District in a landslide victory. The motivational speaker trounced the GOP candidate who was backed by President Donald Trump, but he also ran in support of the president and his policies.

If he wins in the heavily Republican district, he would become the youngest member of Congress.

Cawthorn was paralyzed from the waist down in a 2014 car accident that nearly took his life.

Here's a video of Cawthorn addressing the controversy:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/madison-cawthorn-hitler-instagram-scandal,2020-08-13
MSNBC expert Malcolm Nance faces ridicule over bizarre claim about Chernobyl during attack on Ukraine,"MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance faced online ridicule and mockery over a bizarre claim he made about the infamous Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine amidst the Russian attack on the former Soviet republic.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian president confirmed that Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl site, where the world's worst nuclear disaster was contained in 1986. The report raised concern after higher than usual levels of radiation were detected, though they were still within safety guidelines.

When someone asked on social media, ""What does [Russian President] Putin want with Chernobyl?"" Nance had an odd response.

""It powers central North Ukraine,"" he replied.

Social media users immediately mocked the suggestion, given that the nuclear plant had been decommissioned for decades.

""What in the ever loving hell is wrong with Malcolm Nance?"" read one tweet. ""And he was in 'intelligence' for over 30 years?? Explains a lot, actually.""

""Malcolm Nance googled 'Chernobyl,' saw that it was a nuclear power plant, and then just stopped reading,"" joked another user.

""Malcolm Nance is a Russian expert & doesn't know Chernobyl is a nuclear waste land?"" asked another detractor.

""Please don't listen to him. I mean the rest of Chernobyl has been shut down since 2000, ffs. He's just a grifter,"" said another critic.

""Well, In fairness to @MalcolmNance.... If he were smart or had any credibility at all, he wouldn't be on @msnbc, now would he?"" read another tweet.

Nance later deleted the tweet, but it was documented at an online archive.

Despite Nance's odd explanation, other experts said that Chernobyl was simply in the path of one of the quickest routes to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

Nance previously outraged many when he told Americans to get over the bombing in Afghanistan during the U.S. withdrawal from that country. He later said that he tweeted before knowing about the U.S. casualties in the terror attack.

On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that the Chernobyl nuclear plant was safe and secure despite the military occupation by Putin's troops.

'Got a NYT journalist caught in my satire': NYT correspondent asks to interview man who tweeted that flight attendants removed their face masks and shouted 'this is MAGA airspace',"A New York Times journalist reportedly reached out to request to interview a man who made a social media post stating that flight attendants had removed their face masks aboard an airplane and shouted ""this is MAGA airspace.""

The tweet, which was satire, came on the day that U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle slapped down a federal mask mandate that required masks on public transportation — the ruling said that ""the Court declares unlawful and vacates the Mask Mandate.""

Jared Rabel, who describes himself in his Twitter biography as a ""Christian"" and a ""libertarian on the old right,"" posted a tweet that said: ""I boarded a plane today with my son and mid flight, the pilot announces that the mask mandate is over. Flight attendants pulled off their masks and sneezed directly into their hands while screaming 'this is MAGA airspace'. My son turned to me in tears. I don’t know what to do.""

Rabel did not label the tweet as satire, and Victoria Kim of the New York Times reached out and requested to interview him, according to a screenshot posted by Rabel.

""Hi Jared, I'm a New York Times journalist, I'd love to speak to you over the phone about what happened on your flight this evening. Can you please give me a call ... or let me know how I can reach you?"" Kim wrote, according to the screenshot. ""Hope this isn't coming too late in your day. Thank you, look forward to hearing from you.""

Rabel tweeted that, ""For those asking, this is 100% legit. I’m as surprised as you.""

""Got a NYT journalist caught in my satire today,"" Rabel declared.

""I’m glad I could assist, even a little bit, in undermining the credibility of the corporate press. Their depravity is coming to light more and more, which is a positive thing for the republic,"" Rabel tweeted on Tuesday.



The federal government could potentially pursue a legal challenge in a bid to reinstate the mask mandate.

""On April 13, 2022, before the district court’s decision, CDC explained that the order would remain in effect while it assessed current public health conditions, and that the Transportation Security Administration would extend its directive implementing the order until May 3 to facilitate CDC’s assessment,"" the U.S. Department of Justice noted in a Tuesday statement. ""If CDC concludes that a mandatory order remains necessary for the public’s health after that assessment, the Department of Justice will appeal the district court’s decision.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-posted-satire-and-nyt-journalist-reached-out-for-interview,2022-04-20
Man with loaded AK-47 arrested outside home of Iranian-American journalist known for criticizing the Iranian government and the hijab,"A man with a loaded AK-47 in his vehicle was arrested after the FBI says he ""behaved suspiciously"" outside the New York City home of Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-American journalist internationally known for her criticism of the Iranian government.

According to reports, Khalid Mehdiyev of Yonkers was recently arrested after he was supposedly seen peering into the windows of Alinejad's Brooklyn home and attempting to open the door. Mehdiyev's gray Subaru SUV with Illinois plates was likewise seen parked for hours in front of her home over the course of two days last week. Mehdiyev had also been issued a parking ticket in the area on July 23.

Mehdiyev was soon afterwards arrested after he failed to stop at a stop sign. He was also supposedly driving with a suspended license. When members of NYPD searched his vehicle, they found a suitcase containing a Norinco AK-47-style rifle with a magazine and a round in the chamber. He also had $1,100 in cash and license plates from other states besides Illinois.

Authorities said that, when questioned, Mehdiyev initially denied knowing that there was a gun in the suitcase and that he had insisted that he was in the area looking for a room to rent. He then supposedly changed his story, admitted that he owned the gun, said he was in the area ""looking for someone,"" and then asked to speak to a lawyer.

Alinejad, 45, was not specifically named in the criminal complaint filed in federal court. However, she tweeted out a video taken from a CCTV camera demonstrating that Mehdiyev had been on her front porch.

""These are the scary scenes capturing a man who tried to enter my house in New York with a loaded gun to kill me,"" Alinejad tweeted along with the video. ""Last year the FBI stopped the Islamic Republic from kidnapping me. My crime is giving voice to voiceless people. The US administration must be tough on terror.""

Alinejad is referring to allegations made last year by the U.S. Justice Department that the Iranian regime had orchestrated an attempt to kidnap Alinejad and transport her back to Iran. Iranian officials have supposedly targeted Alinejad, who has dual Iranian and American citizenship, because she criticizes many Iranian policies, especially regarding women wearing the hijab.

""While the international media is paying attention to my assassination plot in the US, let’s remember these women who have been forced to give false confessions against themselves on Iranian state TV,"" Alinejad tweeted on Sunday. ""These acts of terror won’t stop our fight against forced hijab.""

"Sen. Joe Manchin bucks Democrats on election reform bill, filibuster — and liberals are angry","Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) angered Democrats Sunday when he revealed opposition to the ""For The People Act,"" a sweeping federal election reform bill being pushed by Democrats.

What is the background?

The ""For The People Act"" passed the House in March with zero Republican support; even one Democrat voted against the bill.

The legislation would force states to allow mail-in voting and establish an independent commission to redraw congressional districts to, in theory, prevent partisan gerrymandering. The bill would also greatly increase voter registration efforts, and seeks to implement campaign finance reforms, among other measures.



The White House has said the bill ""is urgently needed to protect the right to vote and the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen American democracy,"" while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the bill ""would weaken the security of our elections and make it harder to protect against voter fraud.""

What did Manchin say?

Manchin published an essay in the Charleston Gazette-Mail explaining he will vote against the ""For The People Act"" because the bill has been advanced through partisan channels.

Manchin wrote:

Unfortunately, we now are witnessing that the fundamental right to vote has itself become overtly politicized. Today's debate about how to best protect our right to vote and to hold elections, however, is not about finding common ground, but seeking partisan advantage. Whether it is state laws that seek to needlessly restrict voting or politicians who ignore the need to secure our elections, partisan policymaking won't instill confidence in our democracy — it will destroy it.



As such, congressional action on federal voting rights legislation must be the result of both Democrats and Republicans coming together to find a pathway forward or we risk further dividing and destroying the republic we swore to protect and defend as elected officials.

Not only did Manchin say that he will oppose the ""For The People Act,"" but the moderate Democrat reaffirmed his opposition to ending the filibuster, which Democrats have pushed in order to more easily enact their agenda.

""I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy, and for that reason, I will vote against the For the People Act,"" Manchin said. ""Furthermore, I will not vote to weaken or eliminate the filibuster. For as long as I have the privilege of being your U.S. senator, I will fight to represent the people of West Virginia, to seek bipartisan compromise no matter how difficult and to develop the political bonds that end divisions and help unite the country we love.""

What was the reaction?

Angered liberals lashed out at Manchin over his continued refusal to support the Democratic Party's partisan agenda.

""Why did we elect Joe Biden president if we're gonna let Joe Manchin run the f***** country?"" one critic cried.

""Within the limits of the law, Manchin should never have a day of rest by the American people. He needs to be held accountable for his traitorous cowardice,"" another critic said.

""Manchin's op-ed might as well be titled, 'Why I'll vote to preserve Jim Crow,'"" Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) smeared.

""Joe Manchin... he's a Republican. That's why we have to win more seats in 2022 so we don't have to deal with his sorry ass,"" another critic cried.

""White supremacy is Joe Manchin choosing to help voter suppression efforts because he'd lose his power in West Virginia if he chooses the side of black and brown voters who have all been showing up to the polls to help save our democracy,"" another person said.

""This has nothing to do with being a moderate from a conservative state... this is just evil and bad,"" one person said.

""Manchin is handing Republicans the House for at least a decade. It doesn't get more partisan than that,"" the official People 4 Bernie account claimed.

""Tried to be patient w him, I get what state he's from. But if we lose our democracy bc he won't do the most basic thing to save it, he goes down w Quisling, Petain, Von Hindenburg--the worst fascist enablers in history. Enough carrots, whatev sticks they have, it's time,"" another person said.

""All of that work to flip Georgia blue and Manchin just s**** all over it,"" another critic cried.

By voting against the ""For The People Act,"" Manchin will effectively kill the bill.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/manchin-opposes-for-the-people-act-liberals-angered,2021-06-06
Marines face backlash for 'unacceptable & appalling' messages bashing Tucker Carlson,"An official United States Marines social media account drew sharp criticism over the weekend after publicly rebuking Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

What happened?

Carlson triggered a tsunami of backlash last week he criticized new uniform accommodations made by President Joe Biden for women serving in the military.

While China's military becomes more masculine as it's assembled the world's largest navy, our military, as Joe Biden says, needs to become more feminine — whatever feminine means anymore since men and women no longer exist. The bottom line is it's out of control and the Pentagon is going along with it. Again, this is a mockery of the U.S. military and its core mission, which is winning wars.

In response, the II Marine Expeditionary Force Information Group publicly blasted Carlson.

""What it looks like in today's armed forces @TuckerCarlson,"" the Marine group tweeted along with a picture of a female Marine carrying another Marine.

""Get right before you get left, boomer,"" the account mocked.

When one person asked the Marine group to ""please focus on China and not Tucker Carlson,"" the Marine group fired back, ""Come back when you've served and been pregnant.""

What was the response?

The response from the II MEF Information Group, along with other senior military leaders, was widely condemned as unbecoming behavior for American soldiers.

""Unconscionable that active duty military members - in uniform and from official military social media platforms - have leveled personal political attacks on a media figure. This is no longer the same military my grandfather, my father, my uncles, my brothers and I served,"" Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.), an Army veteran, said.

""With US Marines tweeting partisan views on Govt accounts — and keeping their jobs all the while — we've crossed a red line. The Republic will not stand long when our military, intelligence, & law enforcement become political tools. We are in desperate trouble,"" Bryan Dean Wright, a former CIA ops officer, said.

""Please focus on China and not Tucker,"" Joey Jones, a retired Marine, said.

""These political tweets to a civilian from official accounts, one from a senior enlisted in official uniform at official command are absolutely unacceptable & appalling. Marines need to be held accountable & there needs to be a @USMC wide message against this. @CMC_MarineCorps,"" Former Navy SEAL and Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) said

wide message against this. ""As a female Marine that served in II MEF, this attack on a reporter's free speech from an official account is completely unacceptable,"" Michele Perez Exner, who works for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said

Anything else?

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday demanding to meet with Marine Commandant David H. Berger over the political statements.

""Under Biden, the military is launching political attacks to intimidate Tucker Carlson & other civilians who criticize their policy decisions,"" Cruz tweeted. ""Officials in uniform are being used for the campaign. I've demanded a meeting with the Commandant of the USMC to put a stop to it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marines-group-attacks-tucker-carlson-backlash,2021-03-14
"Marjorie Taylor Greene files articles of impeachment against Merrick Garland for failing to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution, 'political persecution' of Donald Trump","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announced on Friday that she filed articles of impeachment against U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Republican representative for Georgia claimed that Garland helped facilitate a ""political persecution"" of former President Donald Trump.

Garland drew the ire of Garland after the FBI raid of Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. Taylor accused Garland of not ""faithfully"" executing the office of the attorney general's promise to ""preserve, protect and defend"" the United States Constitution.

Taylor told reporters outside the Capitol building, ""What they've been doing to [former] President Trump is political persecution.""

""Merrick Garland has abused his position of power as the attorney general to politically persecute Joe Biden's enemies,"" she added. ""And the whole purpose of this is to prevent President Trump from ever being able to hold office.""



""I'm introducing articles of impeachment on Merrick Garland,"" Taylor proclaimed. ""Because we cannot tolerate this in America, where our great institutions are welded and abused in such a way to impeach people's political enemies.""

Taylor's articles of impeachment accused the attorney general of ""endangering, compromising, and undermining the justice system of the United States by facilitating the persecution"" of President Joe Biden's political rival – Donald Trump.

""Personal approval to seek a search warrant for the raid on the home of the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, constitutes a blatant attempt to persecute a political opponent,"" the document read.



Taylor's resolution claimed that Garland's ""effort to unseal the search warrant for the home of former President Donald J. Trump constitutes an attempt to intimidate, harass, and potentially disqualify a political challenger to President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.""

Articles of impeachment against Garland are unlikely to pass in Congress since Democrats have a majority, and because it is unknown how many Republicans would support such a move. A two-thirds majority is needed for conviction.

Garland said on Thursday that he ""personally approved"" the FBI raid of Trump's residence.

""Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy,"" Garland said. ""Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly, without fear or favor.""

Other prominent Republicans, including Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have suggested that Garland's actions could merit impeachment.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) accused the Department of Justice of reaching an ""intolerable state of weaponized politicization."" McCarthy also promised an investigation into the DOJ if the Republicans retake the House after the 2022 midterm elections.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago is ""another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime's political opponents.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) declared, ""Using government power to persecute political opponents is something we have seen many times from 3rd world Marxist dictatorships. But never before in America.""

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said, ""In third world countries and banana republics they prosecute the former presidents/leaders and their staff. Right now, we look beneath them. We are in a race to the bottom.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-impeachment-merrick-garland-trump,2022-08-13
Mark Levin unloads on Trump raid: 'No justification for sending 30 freaking FBI agents',"BlazeTV host Mark Levin unloaded on the FBI Monday night, calling the raid on Donald Trump's home in Palm Beach, Florida, ""outrageous"" and the ""worst attack on this republic in modern history.""

Levin, a former chief of staff to U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, called in to ""Hannity"" on Fox News Monday to give his reaction to the then-breaking news that FBI agents executed a search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. Federal agents were reportedly searching for evidence that Trump violated federal records-keeping law by allegedly taking classified documents from the White House with him to Mar-a-Lago when he left office.



""First of all, I'm a former chief of staff to a United States attorney general. We would never ever have done this. Ever,"" Levin told Sean Hannity. ""Number two, it's 90 days before midterm election. That's outrageous.""

""Number three,"" he continued, ""everybody pretty much knows that Donald Trump is going to run in the Republican primary for president of the United States. And so you have a sitting president who wants to run against him and his attorney general acting like this.""

Drawing on his experience with the Department of Justice, Levin said that the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves, had jurisdiction over the Trump presidential records case because the National Archives is located in D.C. Graves is also the U.S. attorney overseeing the Jan. 6 investigations.



Levin said Graves' office likely coordinated with the U.S. attorney's office in Florida and that FBI agents in South Florida would have been the ones who conducted the raid, ""if they are playing it by the book.""

""[The U.S. attorney] wouldn't have done anything without the sign-off of the attorney general of the United States. Period,"" Levin emphasized. He also explained that the precision of the FBI raid suggests it had been planned for some period of time, possibly weeks.

For months, watchdog groups have accused former President Trump of violating the Presidential Records Act by improperly handling classified documents. The National Archives has said Trump tore up some documents he was supposed to preserve while in office and took other materials with him to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office.

Earlier this year, the National Archives and Records Administration recovered 15 boxes of presidential records from Trump's residence in Florida, which allegedly included ""classified national security information."" Trump said the records were given to the Archives upon request in accordance with federal law. But the agency referred the matter to the Justice Department.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman has written a forthcoming book that accuses Trump of attempting to flush some records down the toilet, an act that would potentially be illegal.

Levin said the accusations in Haberman's book and other reports of Trump's alleged misconduct served as a ""pretext"" for the raid on Mar-a-Lago.

""There is no justification for sending 30 freaking FBI agents to the former president’s compound in Mar-a-Lago in early morning and conducting themselves this way or in any other cases in which they’ve done exactly the same thing,"" Levin said.



""The FBI is corrupt. This guy [Attorney General Merrick Garland] goes after parents. He goes after Republican state legislatures, he goes after states he disagrees with their abortion positions, he doesn’t do a damn thing to protect the border, which is compelled by the Constitution. Nothing.""



""This is the worst attack on this republic in modern history. Period,"" Levin continued. ""And it’s not just an attack on Donald Trump. It’s an attack on everybody who supports him, it’s an attack on anybody who dares to raise serious questions about Washington, D.C., and the establishment in both parties.""

Marriott hotel refused to host pro-Uyghur conference due to 'political neutrality.' Critics say company 'caved to Communist Chinese interests.',"A Marriott hotel in the Czech Republic declined to host a conference of activists fighting for the human rights of the Uyghur people, according to a new report. Many commentators have suggested that the company capitulated to the Communist China regime, but the hotel claims that it canceled the conference in an effort to maintain ""political neutrality.""

The World Uyghur Congress is an international organization based in Germany that ""represents the collective interest of the Uyghur people both in East Turkistan and abroad."" The group planned on holding a conference at a Marriott hotel in Prague. Approximately 200 delegates from 25 countries gathered in Prague for the meeting. However, hotel management reportedly denied the use of the facilities.

Axios obtained an email to the World Uyghur Congress from the events manager at the Marriott location in Prague.

""Thank you very much for your visit today. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that we are not able to offer the premises,"" the events manager wrote in an Oct. 1 email. ""We consulted the whole matter with our corporate management. For reasons of political neutrality, we cannot offer events of this type with a political theme. Thank you once again for your time and understanding.""

Axios noted that the Chinese government has condemned the World Uyghur Congress repeatedly – including classifying the group as a terrorist organization for allegedly inciting unrest in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government operates ""re-education camps."" However, the group is not on any international terrorist lists.

The World Uyghur Congress says its goal is to ""promote democracy, human rights and freedom for the Uyghur people and use peaceful, nonviolent, and democratic means to determine their political future.""

The World Uyghur Congress has been extremely outspoken against the Chinese Communist Party for operating internment camps that have detained Uyghurs. The group has posted more than 35 articles bringing awareness to the Uyghur internment camps in China, as well as several videos.

In 2018, the United Nations said there are a million ethnic Uyghurs held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"" in China.

Marriott's senior vice president for global communications — Melissa Froehlich Flood — said that the decision made by the hotel ""was not consistent with our policies.""

""Marriott International is committed to giving a warm welcome to all,"" Flood told The Hill. ""We are in the hospitality business, welcoming people from all around the world and from all walks of life representing many beliefs.""

""The management team at the hotel is contacting the group to apologize, as the hotel's response was not consistent with our policies,"" Flood added. ""We are working with the hotel team to provide additional training and education on our longstanding practices of inclusion.""



Zumretay Arkin, a program and advocacy manager for the World Uyghur Congress, told Axios, ""We organize international events all the time and this is the first time we were given this excuse. It is chilling because of the broader concept of how China is really disrupting Western democracies.""

Many reactions to the hotel denying the human rights group space to hold the conference asserted that the hotel was bending the knee to China.

Prague Mayor Zdeněk Hřib said, ""I hear that China is unhappy about this conference being held here in Prague. Well, I am unhappy there's a country in 2021 that has concentration camps.""



Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) reacted by saying, ""Marriott refused to host a Uyghur conference. And tonight Senate democrats are suddenly objecting to my Uyghur forced labor prevention bill they all voted for just a few weeks ago. Sad to see American companies & leaders fighting for #China.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote on Twitter, ""Corporations that kowtow to Beijing Communists have no right to lecture American citizens about anything. The profiteers of slave labor and genocide have no moral standing.""

Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) exclaimed, ""Marriott in Prague turned away a conference of political leaders from China's Uyghur diaspora this month, under the guise of 'political neutrality.' Shameful. In the face of genocide and human suffering, Marriott has caved to Communist Chinese interests.""

Travel intelligence startup founder Rafat Ali said, ""These decisions are a lot more decentralized than this story makes it out to be. That said, terrible that the hotel caved in to what likely was lobbying pressure from Chinese.""

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) noted, ""In 2018, @MarriottIntl apologized to China for listing Taiwan & Hong Kong as separate nations. Now they refuse to host a group China is committing genocide against for 'political neutrality.' This company has lost all credibility to talk about democracy & human rights. Shameful!""



In 2018, the Marriott International hotel chain had its website and booking applications shut down for a week by the Chinese government for suggesting in a customer survey that some regions in the country were separate nations – including Hong Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan.

Marriott quickly apologized for the error, ""Marriott International respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. We don't support separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China,"" the company said in a statement. ""We sincerely apologize for any actions that may have suggested otherwise.""

"Massive ICE operation nabs child abusers, gang members,  internationally-wanted criminals","ICE immigration agents arrested 105 people in New Jersey in a five-day operation, despite state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal ordering local, county and state law enforcement to limit their cooperation with federal immigration police.

The sweep, led last week by the agency's Enforcement and Removal Operation, was already planned prior to the Grewal's directive, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stated in an announcement.

""These outstanding results, which were made possible by our officers and law enforcement partners, highlight the tremendous commitment that ICE ERO has to public safety throughout the state,"" John Tsoukaris, Field Office Director of ERO Newark, said in a prepared statement. ""Our focus has been and will continue to be on arrests of illegal aliens who have been convicted of serious crimes or those who pose a threat to public safety.""

Were criminals included?

ICE estimated that 80 percent of those arrested last week had either previous criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. The arrests included 24 in Hudson County, 10 in Midldesex County, 14 in Monmouth County, four in Bergen County, 11 in Passaic County, and 6 in Essex County.

""ICE will of necessity have to conduct additional enforcement operations if local police departments and county jails do not refer criminals and gang members they encounter to ICE for review and possible arrest on immigration violations,"" according to a statement by the agency.

Carlos Rojas Rodriguez, a community organizer for Movimiento Cosecha, a group that supports more rights for undocumented migrants, said he believes the new arrests were connected to the directive.

""It is a shame that while the new AG is trying to create trust between the immigrant community and law enforcement, the ICE director John Tsoukaris is trying to destroy that trust and criminalize immigrants across the state,"" Rodriguez told NorthJersey.com.

Seth Kaper-Dale, co-pastor of the Reformed Church of Highland Park, reported an increase in requests from a hotline it runs for an organization called DIRE, which stands for Deportation and Immigration Response Equipo, the news agency reported.

""The DIRE line usually rings three to four times a month,"" Kaper-Dale said. ""Right now, it's ringing more than five a week.""

Where are they from?

Among those arrested were citizens of Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Korea, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Taiwan, Trinidad, and Venezuela.

Others include a 59-year-old man from Korea who lives in Palisades Park who was wanted on a warrant to serve a sentence for distributing psychotropic drugs. Another suspect included a 25-year-old Guatemala male who was arrested on aggravated assault and possession of a weapon charges. He was previously deported by ICE.

At least three of the people arrested were members of street gangs, including one member of MS-13, according to the release. The arrests also included those with prior convictions for extortion and bank fraud, distribution of narcotics on school grounds, promoting prostitution with a child, and child endangerment.

"Mayor of Arizona city declares a state of emergency, says the mass release of migrants poses 'imminent threat'","Mayor Doug Nicholls has issued a state of emergency for the city of Yuma, Arizona, citing an ""imminent threat"" to residents and property over the mass release of migrants into the border city, the Arizona Republic reported.

The city's resources cannot handle the overwhelming number of migrants that continue pouring into Yuma, Nicholls said Tuesday during a press conference.

""Migrants continue to be released at a rate that cannot be sustained, overwhelming the current non-profit shelter system,"" Nicholls said in a statement.

At least 1,300 migrants were released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection over a three-week period into the local non-profit shelter.

What's the story?

The shelter, which has a maximum capability to house 150 to 200 migrants, has exceeded its ability to house and provide basic human needs, according to the mayor.

""Today is a day that we had talked about three weeks ago, hoping never to get to,"" Nicholls said.

""Throughout the country we are in a position that needs to be rectified on a national level, not just within the resources of our Yuma community, to avert the threat of hundreds of people roaming the streets looking to satisfy basic human needs in our community and not having the resources to do so and the reaction of the citizens of Yuma looking to protect their property and way of life,"" he continued.

The same day that Nicholls announced the proclamation, he received a call from Border patrol officials who alerted him that CBP would release 120 additional migrants into the city the same day.

""We need to make sure that our community is maintained and that the human rights of all the migrants are also maintained and that we have a path forward that respects both,"" he said.

Many of the migrant families released to the city's shelter were waiting for transportation to other cities across the country.

""The transportation network is just insufficient to keep up with demand,"" Nicholls said. ""And the backlog of people staying at the shelter has created this capacity issue.""

What else?

The city hopes that the emergency proclamation will draw national attention to the communities that are struggling with the immigrant crisis.



On Tuesday, CBP was holding at least 950 migrants, mostly family units, at its Yuma detention center. Agents apprehended at least 400 more on Wednesday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mayor-of-arizona-city-declares-a-state-of-emergency-over-migrant-releases-into-the-city,2019-04-18
McConnell implores fellow senators to not attempt to overturn Electoral College win for Joe Biden,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told his colleagues Wednesday that they should not attempt to overturn the Electoral College victory for President-elect Joe Biden.

What are the details?

""This will be the most important vote I've ever cast,"" McConnell said at the outset of a sober speech delivered from the Senate floor, adding that he supported President Donald Trump's desire to contest the election results, which were mired in controversy and hit with numerous charges of fraud.

But McConnell added that after recounts and court proceedings, the results stood — and therefore the outcome must be accepted and supported.

""Every election we know features some illegality and irregularity, and, of course, that's unacceptable,"" he said. ""I support strong state-led voting reforms. Last year's bizarre pandemic procedures must not become the new norm. But, my colleagues, nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale — the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election, nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break when the doubt itself was incited without any evidence.""

He added that Congress members have a ""limited role"" when it comes to election results: ""We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids. The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever. ... If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. We would never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost.""

McConnell continued, ""The Electoral College, which most of us on this side have been defending for years, would cease to exist, leaving many of our states with no real say at all in choosing a president.""

In one of the more stirring moments of his address, McConnell observed that ""we cannot keep drifting apart into two separate tribes with a separate set of facts and separate realities with nothing in common except our hostility toward each other and mistrust for the few national institutions that we all still share.""

Democrats don't get off the hook

McConnell didn't let Democrats off the hook either, for contesting Electoral College results as recently as in the aftermaths of the 2000, 2004, and 2016 elections.

""After 2004, a senator joined and forced the same debate, and believe it or not, Democrats like Harry Reid, Dick Durbin, and Hillary Clinton ... praised them and applauded the stunt,"" he recalled. ""Republicans condemned those baseless efforts back then, and we just spent four years condemning Democrats' shameful attacks on the validity of President Trump's own election.""



More from his speech:

So look, there can be no double standard. The media that is outraged today spent four years aiding and abetting Democrats' attacks on our institutions after they lost. But we must not imitate and escalate what we repudiate. Our duty is to govern for the public good. The United States Senate has a higher calling than an endless spiral of partisan vengeance. Congress will either override the voters, overrule them — the voters, the states, and the courts — for the first time ever or honor the people's decision.



We'll either guarantee Democrats' delegitimizing efforts after 2016 become a permanent new routine for both sides or declare that our nation deserves a lot better than this. We'll either hasten down a poisonous path where only the winners of [an] election actually accept the results, or show we can still muster the patriotic courage that our forebears showed not only in victory but in defeat.

McConnell concluded, ""It would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise American voters and overrule the courts and the states on this extraordinarily thin basis. And I will not pretend such a vote would be a harmless protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing. I will vote to respect the people's decision and defend our system of government as we know it.""

'Let’s not have any lectures': Mitch McConnell scolds hypocritical Dems about the results of the election,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ripped into Democrats who hypocritically called on President Donald Trump to concede the election.

McConnell addressed the demands from the other side of the aisle in a speech Monday on the Senate floor.

""The president has every right to look into allegations and to request recounts under the law and notably the Constitution gives no role in this process to wealthy media corporations. The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president of the United States,"" McConnell said.

""Let's not have any lectures, no lectures, about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election and who insinuated that this one would be illegitimate too if they lost again — only if they lost,"" he continued.

Democrats have accused the president of ignoring the results of the election after most national media outlets declared former Vice President Joe Biden the victor. The president has claimed numerous times that he has won the election and that the Democrats are committing voter fraud to steal the election.

McConnell went on to say the process was proceeding as it was intended.

""Our institutions are actually built for this. We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100 percent within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said.

The Senate majority leader went on to remind Democrats about the comments from former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who publicly advised Biden to not concede if the election results didn't go his way.

""A few legal inquiries from the president do not exactly spell the end of the republic,"" he added.

McConnell also pointed out that the election appeared to be completely free of any significant foreign intervention in the U.S. election.

"Meghan McCain suggests Capitol rioters be 'sent to Gitmo,' treated 'like any other terrorists'","Co-host Meghan McCain says the Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol building last week should be ""prosecuted like any other terrorists who have attacked our homeland,"" and suggested that those found guilty even be sent to prison in Guantanamo Bay.

What are the details?

During ABC's ""The View"" on Monday, McCain and her co-hosts were discussing the prospect and timeline of impeaching President Donald Trump when she interjected, ""I just think we need to treat domestic terrorists the way we do actual terrorists.""

""I think we need to consider all, all, all possibilities,"" she continued. ""I'm not against sending these people to Gitmo. And that may sound extreme, but these are domestic terrorists who attacked our own republic, they should be treated the same way we treat Al Qaeda.""

Meghan McCain Calls Trump Supporters Terrorist www.youtube.com

McCain delivered a similar statement on Twitter ahead of the show, writing, ""The MAGA terrorists should be prosecuted like any other terrorists who have attacked our homeland and be given the same severity of consequences. They should also be tried for treason. No mercy.""

According to Newsweek:

So far, more than 120 individuals have been arrested in connection to the pro-President Donald Trump riot that occurred at the Capitol on January 6. According to Associated Press, the U.S. Attorney's office for D.C. filed 17 federal court cases against alleged agitators, while 40 more cases were filed in the Supreme Court. More are expected to come as more arrests are made.

Also on Monday, it was announced that two U.S. Capitol Police officers were suspended for alleged misconduct during the Capitol siege, and another 10 to 15 investigations into law enforcement actions are ongoing.

Anything else?

McCain also joined her co-hosts on ""The View"" in urging for Trump to be ousted either by Congress or his own administration over the attacks ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. The president has been accused by Democrats and a number of Republicans of inciting the violence that occurred at the Capitol, which left five of his supporters and a police officer dead.

""They have to send a direct message, Republicans and Democrats, that this cannot stand and there have to be ramifications,"" she said. ""If we let this stand and we don't have — I'm 100% for impeachment, the 25th Amendment — anything and everything to get him out now, because the existential threat of violence is still here.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/meghan-mccain-suggests-capitol-rioters-be-sent-to-gitmo-treated-like-any-other-terrorists,2021-01-12
Men charged with having $7 million worth of fentanyl released without bail under New York's new criminal justice law,"A judge allowed six men charged with possession of millions of dollars worth of fentanyl to be released without bail, a result of New York's new criminal justice law, according to the New York Post.

Livo Valdez, Jaslin Baldera, Frederick Baldera, Frandi Ledema, Diego Tejada, and Parfraimy Antonio were arrested Monday in an alleged heroin and fentanyl packaging mill, in which police found hundreds of thousands of envelopes of fentanyl powder — valued at $7 million.

Authorities believe the massive amount of drugs was being packaged for distribution onto the streets of New York and the New England region.

The judge at Manhattan Criminal Court released the men after their arraignment Wednesday, citing the fact that they don't have previous criminal records and that their families showed up for the court proceedings. Assistant District Attorney Michael Di Paolo argued that ""none of them are eligible for bail.""

The men were ordered to surrender their passports due to ties to the Dominican Republic, and their family members celebrated as they were released.

The suspects are due back in court on Feb. 27. They face charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminally using drug paraphernalia.

Under New York's controversial new bail law, criminal courts are no longer allowed to set cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.

The law quickly came under fire from critics after Tiffany Harris, a woman who repeatedly attacked orthodox Jewish women, was arrested three times in one week for such assaults.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has acknowledged some problems and admitted there are some ""consequences we have to adjust for.""

New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said there is a clear connection between the law and increased crime.

""In the first three weeks of this year, we're seeing significant spikes in crime. So either we forgot how to police New York City, or there's a correlation,"" Shea said, according to the Washington Examiner.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/men-charged-with-having-7-million-worth-of-fentanyl-released-without-bail-under-new-yorks-new-criminal-justice-law,2020-01-30
Protests erupt in Michigan after police release videos of black man killed during struggle over a traffic stop,"Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets in Grand Rapids, Michigan, after police released video on Wednesday of the shooting death of a black man during a struggle with an officer after a traffic stop.

Patrick Lyoya, 26, was pulled over on April 4 after a police officer saw that the license plate on his car did not match the automobile he was driving.

In video from the officer's body camera, Lyoya tried to run away after the officer questions him and asked for his driver's license. A struggle ensued where the officer used his stun gun and then shot the man. The Grand Rapids police department said that the officer's body camera was deactivated during the struggle.

While the body camera footage did not record the moment of Lyoya's shooting, the passenger of the car recorded it on their cellphone and that video was released as well.

The graphic video from the cellphone shows the officer trying to control the man and kneeing him in the back while yelling at him to let go of the stun gun. After a few moments the officer reaches for his gun and shoots once.

Activists were angered that Lyoya was shot from behind and in the back of the head, arguing that this proves the police officer acted inappropriately.

The officer involved has not been identified or charged in the shooting, pending an investigation. He is a seven-year veteran of the force.

Some businesses in the city braced for the protests by shutting down for the day and sending employees home.

Prosecutor Chris Becker cautioned the public against hasty conclusions based on the limited evidence that was released.



“While the videos released today are an important piece of evidence, they are not all of the evidence,” said Becker.

Lyoya was a native of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The county's medical examiner said the autopsy of Lyoya had been completed but that the results of the toxicology tests had not yet been released.

"Mike Lee, furious, calls on fellow senator to take back the 'worst' thing any Democrat has said about Amy Coney Barrett","Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) lambasted one of his Democratic colleagues Tuesday for calling the originalist judicial philosophy racist, sexist and homophobic.

Ahead of the Senate vote confirming Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court Monday, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) bashed Barrett's originalist judicial philosophy on Twitter, accusing originalism of being ""just a fancy word for discrimination.""



Markey, who is up for reelection this year, also demanded that the Senate abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.



Lee, in an interview on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends,"" said Markey's comments were ""patently irresponsible"" in a rare show of anger.



""Of all the irresponsible and inflammatory statements I've heard over the last few weeks, and I've heard some doozies, this might well be the worst,"" Lee said.

""If you think about what he is really saying there, Senator Markey has essentially said that our Constitution is racist. And an effort to understand it, understand its words at the time they were written, is itself racist and bigoted. I can't think of a statement that has a greater tendency to undermine the foundation of our constitutional republic. I hope, expect, and demand that Sen. Markey retract his statement. It's irresponsible; he can't defend that,"" Lee said.

Watch:



Earlier in the interview, Lee said he attended the swearing-in ceremony for Justice Barrett.

""It was a fantastic moment,"" Lee said, praising President Trump for nominating her.



""This was the SCOTUS trifecta that he managed to pull off, in his first term alone having put three justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. That doesn't happen very often, and I'm glad it did, and I think he might well have saved the best for last, Justice Barrett is going to be terrific.""



Going on to explain why he supports Barrett's originalist philosophy, Lee said the reason she is ""making the heads of Democrats explode everywhere"" is because ""they don't want the courts to be limited to judging institutions. They want them to be institutions of social change, of social policy, they want them to take debatable matters beyond debate.

""They want something much bigger, much grander than what the Constitution actually allows. Justice Barrett sees the elegant simplicity of the fact that you want judges to interpret the law based on what it says,"" he continued.

Responding to Democratic calls to pack the Supreme Court, Lee said such an effort is ""threatening serious damage to the judicial independence of the Supreme Court.""

Missouri sues China for damages over coronavirus pandemic,"The state of Missouri has become the first in the U.S. to file a lawsuit against the Chinese government, seeking damages for the loss of lives and economic destruction resulting from the coronavirus pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China.

What are the details?

Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) sued the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and several other Chinese authoritative bodies on Tuesday, accusing the defendants of deceptive practices and downplaying the severity of the outbreak to the rest of the world.

""An appalling campaign of deceit, concealment, misfeasance, and inaction by Chinese authorities unleashed this pandemic,"" the suit reads. ""During the critical weeks of the initial outbreak, Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment—thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.""

Schmitt is seeking restitution and asked the court to ""order that the Chinese Government Defendants, the Communist Party, and the Laboratory Defendants cease engaging in the abnormally dangerous activities, reimburse the cost of [Missouri's] abatement efforts, and pay compensatory and other damages caused"" by the outbreak.

Fox News reported that ""Missouri has confirmed 5,963 cases of the virus and 215 deaths as of Tuesday morning,"" and noted that ""the economic shutdown the state imposed to reduce the spread of the disease has cost Missouri about $44 billion, according to one estimate.""

""In Missouri, the impact of the virus is very real,"" Schmitt said in a statement. ""Thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table.""

Anything else?

ABC News reported that ""it's unclear whether the lawsuit will have much, if any, impact,"" pointing out that ""U.S. law generally prohibits lawsuits against other countries with few exceptions.""

Chimene Keitner, an international law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, explained to Reuters, ""If the United States wants to bring claims against China, it will have to do so in an international forum.

Mitch McConnell goes scorched earth on House Democrats' new leader: 'A past election denier',"Sen. Mitch McConnell (R) took numerous shots at House Democrats' new leader, Hakeem Jeffries, on Thursday, magnifying the New York Democrat's proclivity for questioning the legitimacy of critical democratic institutions.

Speaking from the Senate floor, McConnell highlighted the irony he sees in Democratic rhetoric about the importance of institutional norms.

""It has been one of the big, unfortunate ironies of the past several years: Many of the same individuals and institutions on the political left who spent the years 2017 through 2020 yelling about the importance of norms and institutions have themselves not hesitated to undermine our institutions when they’re unhappy with a given outcome,"" McConnell began.



Then he zeroed in on Jeffries.

“For example, the newly elected incoming leader of the House Democrats is a past election denier who baselessly said the 2016 election was ‘illegitimate’ and suggested that we had a ‘fake’ president,"" McConnell noted.

""He has also mounted reckless attacks on our independent judiciary and said that justices he didn’t like have ‘zero legitimacy,'"" he added.



What is McConnell referring to?

Jeffries repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of Donald Trump's presidency, and subsequently, he has questioned the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.

Here are a few examples from Jeffries' official congressional Twitter account:

February 2018: ""The more we learn about 2016 election the more ILLEGITIMATE it becomes. America deserves to know whether we have a FAKE President in the Oval Office #RussianInterference.""

""The more we learn about 2016 election the more ILLEGITIMATE it becomes. America deserves to know whether we have a FAKE President in the Oval Office #RussianInterference."" September 2018 : ""LIE (more than any administration in the history of the Republic). CHEAT (2016 election/Russian Interference). STEAL (one or two Supreme Court seats). When will Republicans put country ahead of party.""



""LIE (more than any administration in the history of the Republic). CHEAT (2016 election/Russian Interference). STEAL (one or two Supreme Court seats). When will Republicans put country ahead of party."" February 2022: ""The Supreme Court majority has zero legitimacy. Ghosts of the confederacy are alive and well.""

""The Supreme Court majority has zero legitimacy. Ghosts of the confederacy are alive and well."" September 2021: ""Republicans hijacked the Judiciary by stealing two Supreme Court seats. And now they want us to respect illegitimate decisions from these people? Get lost.""



""Republicans hijacked the Judiciary by stealing two Supreme Court seats. And now they want us to respect illegitimate decisions from these people? Get lost."" November 2021: ""The right-wing majority on the Supreme Court is completely illegitimate.""

"Mitt Romney says Americans should 'get behind' Joe Biden, slams Trump: 'Don't expect him to go quietly'","Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Sunday that Americans should ""get behind"" Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the election.

Although President Donald Trump has not yet conceded — and vowed to continue challenging the outcome of the election in the court system — the media declared Biden the president-elect shortly before noon Saturday as it became more clear that Biden would win Pennsylvania.

What did Romney say about Biden?

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" the Utah Republican said Americans should ""get behind"" Biden as their new president because the ""statisticians have come to a conclusion.""

""The reality is, given the fact that the statisticians have come to a conclusion at this stage, I think we get behind the new president,"" Romney said. ""Unless, for some reason, that's overturned, we get behind the new president, wish him the very best.""

Meanwhile, Romney vowed to continue to fight for conservative causes, but said Senate Republicans have a ""responsibility"" to work with Biden as president.

But, according to Romney, the election proved cooperation is good news for Republicans because Democrats will have to do the lion's share of compromise.

""I think the president-elect recognizes that Republicans gained seats in Congress. Republicans overall did better than Democrats overall in this election,"" he explained. ""So, if it comes down to a question about, well, what does America want in terms of policy, pretty clear they don't want the Green New Deal. Pretty clear they don't want Medicare for all, don't want higher taxes, don't want to get rid of oil and gas and coal.""



""The American people are more conservative than they are progressive,"" Romney added.

What did Romney say about Trump?

When asked by show host Jake Tapper whether it concerns him that Trump and his team are ""out there saying that he won and lying about the integrity of the election,"" Romney suggested Trump's reaction to the election should not be surprising.

""You're not going to change the nature of President Trump in these last days, apparently, of his presidency. He is who he is,"" Romney said. ""And he has a relatively relaxed relationship with the truth.""

""And so he's going to keep on fighting until the very end,"" Romney continued. ""But I'm convinced that, once all remedies have been exhausted, if those are exhausted in a way that's not favorable to him, he will accept the inevitable. But don't expect him to go quietly in the night. That's not how he operates.""

However, Romney admitted that he understands ""why the president wants to keep on fighting,"" but said he has not seen evidence of wide-scale voter fraud.

Romney said:

I do believe, however, that it's destructive to the cause of democracy to suggest widespread fraud or corruption. There's just no evidence of that at this stage. And I think it's important for us to recognize that the world is watching. And I think, by the way, for all of us, whether we're in the Senate or the governor's homes, or whether the president himself, you think of the line from ""Hamilton."" History has its eyes on you.



And I think, in a setting like this, it's important to think about what the world is seeing, what history will see. It's important, I believe, for us to stand up and defend the institutions of democracy. It's essential for our democracy and our republic that these institutions are given credibility.And we will follow the normal course in an election, doing recounts, investigating irregularities. And, when it's over, it'll be over.



In the end, when Trump has exhausted his legal remedies, Romney said ""the president doesn't have a choice.""

Mafia fugitive was caught by cops after 7 years on the run when they identified his tattoos on his foodie YouTube channel,"A mafia fugitive was reportedly tracked down after seven years on the run after police were tipped off about a mysterious chef on a YouTube channel and identified him through his tattoos.

The incident was reported in Calabria News, an Italian news outlet.

Authorities caught up with Marc Feren Claude Biart in the Dominican Republic on Wednesday and arrested him on charges of drug trafficking. Biart had fled from Italy in 2014 when the Court of Reggio Calabria ordered him to remain in prison.

The 53-year-old reportedly fled to Costa Rica and eventually ended up in Boca Chica, a municipality near Santo Domingo, the capital city of the Dominican Republic.

He is said to have run a YouTube channel with his wife reviewing Italian cuisine, but he only showed his hands in the videos and never showed his face. Calabria News says that police were able to identify the man through tattoos that were visible on the videos.

Officials allege that the man is a member of 'Ndrangheta, an organized crime syndicate.

Video from Calabria News showed the man being arrested by Interpol agents and transported to Italy.

Biart is said to have taken residence in a resort with a large Italian community.

The charges against stem from allegations that he trafficked cocaine to the Netherlands on behalf of the mafia organization. 'Ndrangheta is considered a powerful crime syndicate because of their control over the cocaine trade in Europe.

His arrest involved the collaboration between the Central Criminal Police Directorate, Interpol and numerous law enforcement agencies from 10 nations.

Monkeypox declared a global health emergency by WHO,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the monkeypox outbreak a global health emergency.

""I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Saturday morning during a briefing in Geneva.

Members of an expert committee met on Thursday to decide if the current monkeypox outbreak should be escalated to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Of the virologists, vaccinologists, epidemiologists, and health experts, nine voted against declaring monkeypox a PHEIC, and six voted in favor, according to Reuters.

The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee were ""resolved by consensus to advise the WHO Director-General that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute a PHEIC.""

""However, the Committee unanimously acknowledged the emergency nature of the event and that controlling the further spread of outbreak requires intense response efforts,"" according to the WHO. ""The Committee advised that the event should be closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks, once more information about the current unknowns becomes available, to determine if significant changes have occurred that may warrant a reconsideration of their advice.""

In the end, Ghebreyesus overrode the committee and declared monkeypox to be a public health emergency of international concern – which is the WHO's highest level of alert.

According to The Nation's Health website, ""A PHEIC gives WHO authority to make formal recommendations to contain an outbreak. The declaration is intended to raise public awareness and can galvanize funding, expertise, and resources from other member nations, said Lawrence Gostin, JD, an international health law professor at Georgetown University.""

ABC News noted that this is the seventh event declared a PHEIC by the WHO since 2007, ""The other six include the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009; the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2015; the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2018 to 2020; the Zika outbreak in 2016; the ongoing spread of poliovirus that started in 2014; and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to the National Library of Medicine.""

Tedros stated, ""Although I’m declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment, this is an outbreak that’s concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners. That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.""

The World Health Organization director-general added, ""Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been more than 16,000 global cases of monkeypox in 2022 in 74 countries.

There have been nearly 3,000 cases in the United States this year, according to the CDC. As of Wednesday, there were 679 cases of monkeypox in New York – 94% of them in New York City, according to state officials.

There have reportedly been a total of five deaths from monkeypox worldwide.

The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy reported, ""Though the outbreak is heavily concentrated in Europe, the five deaths have been reported in African nations.""

The Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority (BARDA) – which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – has purchased a total of 6.9 million monkeypox vaccines through mid-2023.

The WHO noted that monkeypox is a ""viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from animals) with symptoms similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, although it is clinically less severe.""

""Monkeypox primarily occurs in central and west Africa, often in proximity to tropical rainforests, and has been increasingly appearing in urban areas,"" the global health agency stated. ""Animal hosts include a range of rodents and non-human primates.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/monkeypox-global-health-emergency-who,2022-07-23
Several more states' AGs offer support for Texas' Supreme Court election lawsuit,"Attorneys general in several additional states — Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri — appeared to throw their support behind a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton this week alleging that four battleground states exploited the coronavirus pandemic to make unconstitutional changes to mail-in voting rules.

In the lawsuit filed directly with the Supreme Court late Monday night, Paxton accused officials in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin of ""violat[ing] statutes enacted by their duly elected legislatures"" in order to allow for increased mail-in balloting, thus violating the equal protections clause and skewing the 2020 election results.



The lawsuit is seeking a delay to the Electoral College vote until investigations into potential election fraud can be completed.

""Their failure to abide by the rule of law casts a dark shadow of doubt over the outcome of the entire election,"" Paxton stated in a Tuesday news release about the complaint. ""We now ask that the Supreme Court step in to correct this egregious error.""

Other states are backing Texas

As of Wednesday morning, attorneys general in at least four additional states have expressed support for the lawsuit.

Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall seemed to indicate on Twitter that his state would join the suit, if it was granted a hearing by the Supreme Court.

""The unconstitutional and fraudulent votes in other states not only affect the citizens of those states, they affect the citizens of all states — of the entire United States. Every unlawful vote counted, or lawful vote uncounted, debases and dilutes citizens' free exercise of the franchise,"" he wrote in a statement. ""The State of Alabama will continue to pursue any legal remedy available to protect her people from such disenfranchisement.""

Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced after reviewing the lawsuit that she would ""support the motion by the State of Texas in all legally appropriate manners.""

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry also endorsed the lawsuit, noting in a statement that ""millions of Louisiana citizens, and tens of millions of our fellow citizens in the country, have deep concerns regarding the conduct of the 2020 federal elections. Deeply rooted in these concerns is the fact that some states appear to have conducted their elections with a disregard to the U.S. Constitution.""



""Louisiana citizens are damaged if elections in other states were conducted outside the confines of the Constitution while we obeyed the rules,"" he added.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt made no qualms about his state's position, saying plainly, ""Missouri is in the fight.""

""Election integrity is central to our republic. And I will defend it at every turn. As I have in other cases — I will help lead the effort in support of Texas' #SCOTUS filing today. Missouri is in the fight,"" Schmitt said in a tweet.

Anything else?

In his statement of support, Landry, the Louisiana attorney general, also made mention of a filing he and attorneys general from nine other states submitted last month that petitioned the Supreme Court to look into Pennsylvania's election conduct.

""In states like Pennsylvania, the judicial branch attempted to seize control of these duties and obligations and to set their own rules. These actions appear to be unconstitutional,"" he wrote. ""If it is unconstitutional for Pennsylvania to take this action, it is similarly unconstitutional for other states to have done the same.""

This filing is wholly separate from Texas' most recent filing, but nonetheless has been confused with the Texas filing by some on social media.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/more-states-back-texas-lawsuit,2020-12-09
"Mother murdered two young children after hearing voices telling her to do it, police say","An Arizona mother charged with murdering her two young children reportedly told police she heard voices in her head telling her to commit the heinous crime.

What happened?

The mother, 40-year-old Yui Inoue of Tempe, Arizona, was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder on Sunday after her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son were found dead in the family's apartment, the Arizona Republic reported.

According to the news outlet, Tempe Police Sergeant Steve Carbajal said authorities first became aware of the situation after Inoue flagged down officers at a nearby department substation and led them to the apartment, where the children's bodies were discovered. She reportedly told police at the time that she had heard voices telling her to kill her children.

Carbajal said there were ""obvious signs of physical trauma"" at the scene. Citing a police statement, he Arizona Republic noted that officers found large amounts of blood at the house and that the children sustained what appeared to be self-defense wounds, ""including cuts from a sharp object and some amputations.""

During an interview, Inoue reportedly told detectives that she had been in an argument with the children's father over finances the previous night. She claimed that after he left, she went to sleep with the two children, but then woke up at around 4:30 a.m. with blood on her hands and arms.



Inoue reportedly claimed she didn't believe she had killed the children, but couldn't remember. She explained that after she took a bath that morning she suddenly ""woke up"" to the situation and decided to alert the police.

What else?

The argument that Inoue described evidently had been so intense that police responded to the apartment following reports of a domestic dispute. But Carbajal said that incident didn't result in any arrests, since the parents agreed to separate and the two kids were safely in their beds when officers left. They had no idea of the atrocity that would occur only hours later.

""At that time everything seemed to be OK. There was no immediate information that something like this would happen,"" Carbajal said, noting that the father had reportedly gone to go sleep at his office. The father, who is not a suspect in the crime, reportedly broke down crying when he learned his two young children were dead.

Police said that the two parents were reportedly in the process of getting a divorce.

The horrific crime has reportedly taken a toll on officers as well as neighbors of the family.



""We have a lot of officers right now that are struggling,"" Carbajal said. ""Just me talking to you right now, just kind of thinking what they went through is something we can't even put into words right now.""

One neighbor recalled that she had recently seen the two children playing in the apartment complex's pool a couple times with their mom present.

""They were happy, beautiful children,"" she recalled. ""It's been heavy on a lot of our hearts here. A lot of people are really confused about what happened. A lot of us heard screaming. It's been scary.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-murdered-children-heard-voices,2021-05-17
MSNBC's Chris Hayes unleashes on conservatives over alleged 'simple truth' about Electoral College,"MSNBC host Chris Hayes lashed out at conservatives Saturday after he was sharply criticized over his recent commentary about the Electoral College.

What did Hayes say?

Hayes claimed that modern conservatism is a ""deeply paranoid and pessimistic"" movement that is ""retreating behind counter-majoritarian institutions."" He said modern conservatives desire to ""uphold minority rule.""

What led to Hayes' comments?

On his MSNBC show Friday, Hayes attempted to make the case that the Electoral College — the system established by the Founding Fathers to elect the president — is undemocratic.

""The weirdest thing about the electoral college is the fact that if it wasn't specifically in the Constitution for the presidency, it would be unconstitutional,"" Hayes said.

Hayes' point was this: Beginning in the 1960s, the Supreme Court ""started developing a jurisprudence of 'one person, one vote'"" to ensure equal civil rights for white and black Americans. But the Electoral College undermines this equality because each individual vote does not carry equal weight.

Such a system can be racially exploited, Hayes charged, providing an example of a majority black city being governed by a majority white city council.

Hayes was heavily mockedin response.

Critics argued the Electoral College is not unconstitutional because it is constitutionally-mandated. Further, Hayes was reminded that America is a republic — not a democracy whose leaders are elected directly by the people — an intentional design mechanism to ensure somewhat equal representation for each state.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbcs-chris-hayes-unleashes-conservatives-over-alleged-simple-truth-about-electoral-college,2019-09-01
"MSNBC's Chris Matthews compares Soleimani to Princess Diana, Elvis. Iranians say he's dead wrong and pushing 'propaganda.'","MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews on Wednesday compared Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani's death to the deaths of American rock legend Elvis Presley and the United Kingdom's Princess Diana. Presley died in 1977 following a fatal heart attack. Princess Diana was killed in 1997 following a fatal car accident in Paris.

The U.S. conducted an airstrike on Soleimani's convoy last week, killing the Iranian general who was responsible for carrying out acts of terror on both local and global levels. Soleimani led the nation's Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

What did Matthews say?

During a discussion with Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), Matthews said, ""When some people die, you don't know what the impact is going to be.""

""When Princess Diana died, for example, there was a huge emotional outpouring,"" he reasoned. ""Elvis Presley in our culture. It turns out that this general we killed was a beloved hero of the Iranian people to the point where — look at the people, we got pictures up now — these enormous crowds coming out.""

""There's no American emotion in this case,"" Matthews continued, ""but there's a hell of a lot of emotion on the other side.""

Matthews later asked Castro whether he believed U.S. leaders should be aware of what they're doing when they take out such public figures.

Castro responded by saying that the U.S. could have anticipated such a reaction from Iranians.

""They very much could have anticipated that Iranians would react in this way, both the Iranian public but also that the government would strike back,"" Castro reasoned. ""This speaks to a much larger issue, Chris, which is the president has had a very chaotic and erratic foreign policy, especially with respect to Iran.""

Is the Iranian mourning authentic?

The Washington Post and NBC News have both reported that the Iranian mourning of Soleimani was not necessarily authentic, and that Soleimani himself was not nearly as popular or beloved as Matthews apparently made him out to be.

According to a Post opinion article by Iranian journalist Masih Alinejad, ""Don't take what you're seeing at face value"" when it comes to the mass mourning.

Warning against Iranian propaganda, Alinejad wrote, ""[W]hat to make of the crowds of flag-waving mourners streaming across TV screens?""

""Without doubt, Soleimani had support among hard-liners and regime loyalists,"" Alinejad added. ""The regime is not taking any chances, though. In the city of Ahvaz, where large numbers of people turned out to mourn Soleimani, the government has forced students and officials to attend. It provided free transport and ordered shops to shut down.""

It only got worse, according to Alinejad.

""According to videos sent to me by people inside the country, the authorities are making little kids write essays praising the fallen commander,"" she said. ""First-graders who didn't know how to write were encouraged to cry for Soleimani.""

""The media in the Islamic Republic is heavily controlled,"" she insisted. ""Public gatherings are allowed only if they are pro-regime. Critics are jailed or shot. ... So it's not hard to use all the tools and resources of the state to stage a funeral procession.""

Is the U.S. media falling for Iran's 'propaganda'?

Iranian author Parnaz Foroutan wrote that Iran's ""propaganda"" implies that the nation is mourning Soleimani's death — which couldn't be further from the truth.

Foroutan warned that the U.S. media is falling for the ruse and running with the resulting stories.

""The Western media fail to discern between public displays of ideology sanctioned by the regime and quickly silenced opinions of those who dissent,"" she wrote.

""I listened to The New York Times say that 'Iran is in mourning' after [Soleimani's] death,"" she said. ""Headlines repeated the word mourning and showed crowds in the streets of Iran weeping and holding signs that promised revenge for the death of a beloved hero. The news has repeatedly referred to Soleimani as revered by the Iranian people.""

Foroutan said that the U.S. media has widely ignored how ""students are forced to participate"" and that ""public transportation in Iran has been at a standstill.""

""[F]amily members in Iran tell me, since all available buses are being used to round up scattered supporters throughout the country to fill the frame of the lens,"" she added.

Fouroutan noted that the media — both locally and internationally — has made a big deal of tearful Iranians publicly mourning Soleimani's death — but have ignored what the Iranian motivation may be.

""The international press has reported on those who have made public statements in Iran, their tear-filled condolences for the death of this revered hero, but virtually no one in the press has mentioned that some might be forced to do so in order to protect their livelihood,"" she warned. ""Because the state controls everything in Iran.""

'Mueller knows everything': Cohen denies latest report that he met with Russians in Prague,"Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, made a cryptic claim on Twitter about special counsel Robert Mueller while denying reports that he went to Prague to collude with Russians, according to The Washington Times.

McClatchy published a report Thursday repeating a Steele dossier claim that Cohen met with Russian officials in the summer of 2016 to work with Russia to influence the presidential election.

""I hear #Prague #CzechRepublic is beautiful in the summertime. I wouldn't know as I have never been. #Mueller knows everything!"" Cohen tweeted Thursday.

Some challenged Cohen's denial, asking him whether he had been somewhere else in the Czech Republic, such as a suburb near Prague.

What McClatchy reported: McClatchy reported that a cellphone tower ping from Cohen's phone indicated that he made or received a phone call while near Prague, and that Russian communications about Cohen's meeting have been intercepted by an Eastern European intelligence agency. From the report:

""The new information regarding the recovery of Cohen's cell phone location doesn't explain why he was apparently there or who he was meeting with, if anyone. But it adds to evidence that Cohen was in or near Prague around the time of the supposed meeting.""

What does this mean? McClatchy's report frames the newly-discovered information as more evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and they claim Mueller has this same evidence.



To this point, no other sources have corroborated the report that Cohen's cellphone was traced to Prague in late 2016. The Steele dossier, which originally made the claim that Cohen met with Russians in Prague, makes numerous claims about Trump and Russia that have not been confirmed as true.

Mueller's office has declined to comment about McClatchy's report about the alleged evidence of Cohen in Prague.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mueller-knows-everything-cohen-denies-steele-dossier-claim-he-met-with-putin-in-prague,2018-12-27
Music label indefinitely suspends country star Morgan Wallen — and radio stations drop his music — after video shows him using N-word,"Big Loud Records — country singer Morgan Wallen's record label — has issued an indefinite suspension of Wallen after video surfaced of him using the N-word.

What are the details?

According to a Wednesday report from ABC News, Big Loud Records suspended 27-year-old Wallen for an indefinite period of time after the video emerged.

On Tuesday, TMZ released a video featuring Wallen — who was shouting vulgarities during an apparent ""rowdy night out"" — using the racial slur.

According to TMZ:

The country star and a group of buddies had just spent a night out in Nashville. When they arrived at Morgan's home at around midnight, they were extremely loud ... honking horns and talking loudly ... loud enough to piss off neighbors. One of the neighbors began recording the antics.



As Morgan appears to stumble toward his house, he tells someone to watch over a guy in his group. He says ... ""take care of this ""p****-ass mother******"" — and then goes on to say, ""take care of this p****-ass n*****"" ... before finally heading in.

TMZ reported that the video was filmed on Sunday evening.

What did the music label do?

In a statement, Big Loud Records said, ""In the wake of recent events, Big Loud Records has made the decision to suspend Morgan Wallen's contract indefinitely. Republic Records fully supports Big Loud's decision and agrees such behavior will not be tolerated.""



According to the report, iHeartMedia and Entercom radio also announced that it has removed all of Wallen's music from its stations' playlists.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Entercom said, ""In light of Morgan Wallen's recent use of a racial slur, we've discussed the incident with our Country brand leadership team and together have made the decision to remove Morgan's music from Entercom's playlists.""

Viacom-owned CMT also suspended Wallen's music. In a Twitter post, CMT announced, ""After learning of Morgan Wallen's racial slur late last night, we are in the process of removing his appearances from all our platforms. We do not tolerate or condone words and actions that are in direct opposition to our core values that celebrate diversity, equity & inclusion.""

Wallen has since issued a public apology for the video, telling TMZ that his use of the word was ""unacceptable and inappropriate.""



""I'm embarrassed and sorry,"" he said in a statement. ""I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/music-label-indefinitely-suspends-country-star-morgan-wallen-after-video-shows-him-using-n-word,2021-02-04
United States and more than 30 other nations sign declaration that 'there is no international right to abortion' and that the family is 'fundamental' to society,"The U.S. and 32 other nations signed a declaration last week that made clear that ""there is no international right to abortion"" and highlighted the foundational importance of the family unit to society.

The document, called the ""Geneva Consensus Declaration On Promoting Women's Health and Strengthening the Family"" and co-sponsored by the U.S., Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, and Uganda, was signed at a virtual event.

What does the declaration say?

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement touting the document as an effort to achieve four main pillars:

better health for women; the preservation of human life; strengthening of family as the foundational unit of society; and protecting every nation's national sovereignty in global politics.

Cultural conservatives in the U.S. took particular note that the document took a stance that appears contrary to the increasingly liberal international community's stance on the right to life and the importance of the family unit.

The declaration stated a reaffirmation of ""the inherent 'dignity and worth of the human person,' that 'every human being has the inherent right to life,' and the commitment 'to enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.""

It went on to say that ""in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning"" and declared that ""any measures or changes related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level according to the national legislative process.""

It further reaffirmed that ""'the child ... needs special safeguards and care ... before as well as after birth' and 'special measures of protection and assistance should be taken on behalf of all children,' based on the principle of the best interest of the child.""

In order to make it clear they meant business on the pro-life front, the co-singers all committed to ""[r]eaffirm that there is no international right to abortion, nor any international obligation on the part of States to finance or facilitate abortion.""

Regarding families, the agreement said ""the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State"" and called the family ""foundational to society"" and noted that it is a ""source of health, support, and care.""

Secretary of State Michael Pompeo touted the agreement and President Donald Trump's guidance on protecting the unborn and the family. He noted in his remarks:

Under President Trump's leadership, the United States has defended the dignity of human life everywhere and always. He's done it like no other president in history. We've also mounted an unprecedented defense of the unborn abroad.



In front of world leaders at the 2019 United Nations General Assembly, President Trump said, ""We in America believe that every child — born and unborn — is a sacred gift from God."" [...]



Today, we're taking the next step, as we sign the Geneva Consensus Declaration. At its very core, the declaration protects women's health, defends the unborn, and reiterates the vital importance of the family as the foundation of society.

"Far-left NBA coach Gregg Popovich likens Columbus to Hitler, calls San Antonio 'backward' for schools' Columbus Day holiday — and folks bite back hard","Gregg Popovich — the outspoken, far-left coach of the San Antonio Spurs — once again veered away from the subject of basketball and delved into sociopolitical and historical commentary in front of reporters.

During a press conference prior to a preseason game last week, KSAT-TV reported that Popovich was asked about President Joe Biden recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day, which took place Monday alongside Columbus Day.

With that, the 72-year-old coach — in a subdued rant lasting over two minutes — likened Columbus to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and ripped the city of San Antonio as ""backward"" for having school districts that still observe Columbus Day.

What did Popovich say?

""It's way overdue for our country. and I would think there are a lot of people very happy about it,"" Popovich said regarding Biden's Indigenous Peoples' Day recognition, adding that ""the proclamation was obviously appropriate, important, needed, and all those sorts of things, but I'm a little confused about our city and why it's Indigenous Peoples Day/Columbus Day.""

The coach continued: ""Columbus? I mean, he initiated a new world genocide. That's what he did. And beginning with him and what he set in motion and what followed meant the annihilation of every indigenous person in Hispaniola, which was Haiti and the Dominican Republic today. That's what he did. He took slaves. He mutilated. He murdered. And we're gonna say say 'slash' and honor him?""

With that Popovich gave the San Antonio Independent School District ""a little bit of credit"" for adding Indigenous Peoples' Day alongside Columbus Day — and then blasted nearby Alamo Heights Independent School District for observing Columbus Day only.

""But what the hell is Alamo Heights thinkin'?"" he asked. ""It's Columbus Day. That's why they're off on Monday? You know, maybe there's something I'm missing, and I'm ignorant, but it makes me feel like they're living in a phone booth, and they're educating our kids. Columbus Day? And we're gonna honor that?""

While angrily saying his criticism of Columbus Day isn't a ""knock on Italian-Americans,"" Popovich likened Columbus to Hitler.

""That's a silly argument,"" he continued. ""You know, it's like saying we should be proud of Hitler because we're German. I mean, it makes no sense. It's about Columbus. It's not about Italian-Americans. And so there are a lot of states that have come out and scratched the Columbus Day and made it Indigenous Peoples' Day.""

Then Popovich ripped San Antonio as ""backward.""

""But in our city, are we that backward that we have school districts that do that?"" he asked. ""I'm amazed. Just amazed.""

How did folks react?

Twitter users had no mercy on Popovich for his comments. Here's a sampling:

""Anyone notice about the time this guy went looney and became a political pundit the Spurs went to s**t?!"" one commenter asked.

""He is a true idiot. Maybe he needs to get the hell of this country,"" another user said. ""Pathetic hypocrite just like the mentally deranged Biden.""

""Well I'm from Alamo Heights, and we vaguely remember Gregg Popovich. Wasn't he a contender at one time? A coach who made a difference on the basketball court?"" another commenter mocked. ""We're hoping he moves on soon and hopefully not into politics because his left-of-center ideology is getting old.""

""Stick with coaching, Pop, and stay out of politics,"" another user suggested. ""And shave that beard. You've been a woke lefty ever since you grew it.""

""I miss the days when coaches thought of themselves as coaches and not enlightened influencers,"" another commenter said.

"NBC praised China for its medical supplies. Turns out, Chinese COVID-19 tests don't work, masks are defective.","NBC News showered praise on China last week for shipping medical supplies and coronavirus test kits to countries now grappling with the coronavirus pandemic.

""As U.S. struggles to stem coronavirus, China asserts itself as global leader,"" an NBC News headline blasted.

The story said:

With Italy in dire need of medical equipment, an economic superpower stepped in to help. No, not the United States. It was China.

But as it turns out, the majority of COVID-19 test kits and N95-like masks manufactured in China and shipped to countries in dire need are defective.

The Netherlands announced on Saturday that they were recalling more than 1 million defective Chinese-made masks, which were nearly deployed to the Dutch medical workforce.

Meanwhile, both Spain and the Czech Republic, which purchased rapid COVID-19 test kits from a Chinese bio company, found that few of the tests actually detected the virus.

The Washington Free Beacon reported:

In Spain, which currently has the fourth-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, the government purchased 640,000 rapid test kits from China and South Korea as it fights the pandemic. Experts soon discovered, however, that the tests it purchased from Chinese company Bioeasy were only correctly identifying coronavirus cases 30 percent of the time, according to Spain's El Pais.



The Czech Republic also purchased 150,000 rapid test kits from China, and have likewise found problems. One doctor using the tests found that 80 percent of the kits were faulty and has reverted back to the conventional lab tests, which are significantly slower to process.

Nearly 100 indicted after immigration officials uncover huge sham marriage operation in Texas,"Ninety-six people have been criminally charged and 50 taken into law enforcement custody in connection with a large-scale alleged marriage fraud scheme based out of Houston.

What are the details?

According to a news release issued by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the alleged conspiracy involved operatives throughout the state of Texas and the Republic of Vietnam. So-called beneficiary spouses would purportedly pay $50,000 to $70,000 to marry a U.S. citizen for the sole purpose of gaining full U.S. permanent resident status.

The Daily Caller reported that the posing brides and grooms involved ""typically met only briefly before they obtained their marriage licenses and did not live together after becoming a 'married' couple.""

Individuals involved are accused of creating fake wedding albums in order to make the unions appear legitimate, and providing false tax ""and employment information to help ensure [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] would approve the false immigration forms.""

Investigators believe the mastermind behind the operation was Ashley Yen Nguyen, 53, who ran the scam out of her home. She and others named in the 206-count federal grand jury indictment allegedly recruited American citizens to act as ""spouses"" to Vietnamese nationals in exchange for a cut of the proceeds.

Nguyen's defense attorney, Mar Carter, maintains his client is innocent. After Nguyen's initial court appearance Monday, her lawyer told KFSN-TV, ""She has essentially become part of this indictment because she's helped people.""

Carter continued ""The government in these detention hearings always try to make these salacious kind of statements and arguments. They were also making a point to let the judge know she is a naturalized citizen that is somehow less than someone born here.""



Nguyen and her common-law husband were not granted bond, and were ordered to be held pending trial.



Anything else?

ICE reported that the criminal charges handed down by the grand jury after a yearlong investigation include ""47 counts of marriage fraud; 50 counts of mail fraud; 51 counts of immigration fraud; [and] 51 counts of false statements under oath in a matter relating to registry of aliens.""

The charges listed carry maximum federal prison terms ranging from 5 to 20 years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nearly-100-indicted-after-immigration-officials-uncover-huge-sham-marriage-operation-in-texas,2019-05-14
This pro-life mom got tired of fashion’s support for the abortion industry. So she started her own brand.,"People are working to spread the pro-life message through cultural media like music, movies, and poetry , but what about fashion? One homeschooling Philadelphia-area mom has that front covered.

Carla D'Addesi and her daughters have always had a passion for shopping. ""It's our cardio,"" she joked to me about their retail habits. But when they realized that so many of their favorite clothing lines were kicking back proceeds to organizations that didn't share their views, they decided to stop buying in and start their own fashion line.

""We felt very marginalized by the fashion industry,"" Carla told me at the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference last week. ""There were a lot of brands that were anti-American or they were giving our dollars to organizations like Planned Parenthood that went against our core principles.""

The relationship between the fashion world and the pro-abortion movement isn't a secret. In 2017, 43 fashion designers lined up to help out Planned Parenthood during New York Fashion Week.

Conservative corporate activism watchdog 2ndVote keeps a running list of companies that have either donated to Planned Parenthood or have given to third parties that do. That list includes several famous brands such as Converse, Dockers, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, and Old Navy. And if you want to support America's largest abortion provider more directly, there are several smaller brands that are more vocal about their pro-abortion stance.

Ultimately, the idea for the company started with a gradual ""build-up,"" Carla's 18-year-old daughter Vittoria told me. ""Over time we would joke about it, you know, 'Mom, you're gonna have to start sewing soon, because there's no more stores.'

""Then one day,"" Vittoria continued, ""like a good Italian family, we're sitting at our dinner table over a bowl of pasta and we were talking, you know, 'What can we do? What's something different that nobody else has done yet, but that can support the movement and be good for everyone?'""

""My family sits around the dinner table and we do discuss religion and politics from the time the kids were little,"" Carla explained, noting that she also homeschooled her three daughters. ""We have always stood outside of the Planned Parenthoods and prayed. We have been at rallies. We do the March for Life. And we just saw that the left so appeared to be reaching our kids in pop culture and we saw a huge gap.

""So we said, 'Let's try and reach the other side for life by making life glamorous and starting a fashion line,'"" Carla recalled. ""So this is absolutely a brand on a mission for people on a mission.""

Carla said that recent controversies over late-term abortion laws and infanticide have only increased the market for her brand.

""And believe me, there's never been a better time to launch a pro-life fashion line than today,"" Carla explained. ""Because forget about abortion; it's now about infanticide; it's now about botched abortions where there's babies gasping for breath on the table and we are denying them the right to life.

""We did the research,"" Carla said. ""There's 9 million teen, tweens, Millennial young women that identify as being pro-life.""

And she and her daughters want ""to empower them"" and ""to make them stronger and we're using the medium of fashion to do that.""

Right now the COL 1972 site features pieces like hoodies, knit hats, sweatpants, and travel bags, most of which are emblazoned with the company's logo. Over time, the goal is to build out more options for both men and women.

But where does the company's creative spark come from? So far, COL 1972 has gotten some help from a designer in Los Angeles, but Carla says that she and the girls are going to roll out their own designs this spring with their ""Life is Amazing"" campaign when the weather starts warming up.

""So you're going to be seeing beach bags, flip-flops, dresses that just have the simple message: 'Life is Amazing,'"" Carla says. ""Because it is!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-pro-life-fashion-line,2019-03-06
The New Republic gets roasted on social media over 'sexist' tweet politicizing alleged abuse by GOP senator's ex-husband,"The New Republic faced fierce criticism on Thursday over a tweet comparing the alleged abuse from an ex-husband of a Republican senator to the policies of President Donald Trump.

""Joni Ernst survived an abusive husband. Her Senate career may not survive an abusive president,"" read the later deleted tweet.

The wildly inappropriate comparison drew sharp responses from critics on social media.

""This is trash. This is sexist. This is gutter journalism at its worst,"" replied Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).

Hawley demanded that Joe Biden apologize for the tweet.



The publication deleted the tweet and reposted with a much less controversial description of the article.

The content of the article continued to compare the allegedly physical abuse from Ernst's former husband to her political relationship with the president, however. At the end of the piece, the comparison is openly presented to the reader:

There is, for instance, the feeling of deliverance that follows a bad relationship, the sense that finally, one is free to move unencumbered, to stop mopping the mess that follows in the wake of an embarrassing, needy, careless, abusive narcissist. ""I wouldn't have to make excuses for my inappropriate husband anymore!"" she writes of her divorce, a moment when it must have been possible to forget that she was heading toward an election year, a rush of relief before she recalled she would spend it making excuses for another man entirely.

'Retract this slander'

Republican Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri called the article a ""sexist smear"" against Ernst and demand a retraction.

""A hard working mom who balanced her career with her military service and giving back to the community does not deserve this type of hit job,"" tweeted Wagner. ""This would never be written about a male senator, and @newrepublic should have the stones to admit that and retract this slander.""

""I'm disgusted,"" tweeted Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally. ""This attack on my fellow survivor and combat veteran is appalling. The author should be embarrassed to have her name on this garbage, and let's all be honest: This would have never happened if Joni was a Democrat.""



""This is shameful, disgusting, embarrassing sexist smearing of a United States Senator, veteran, mother, and domestic abuse survivor. This writer isn't fit to lick her combat boots!"" replied Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.).

Ernst herself responded by tweeting links to organizations that help abused women.

""I'm used to vile partisan attacks, it comes with the job,"" said Ernst. ""I'm saddened that this article may silence or shame other survivors.""

Climate change activist calls for pipelines destroyed on New Yorker,"New Yorker magazine platformed a Swedish climate change activist who advocates blowing up pipelines in the name of climate justice on a recent episode of its ""New Yorker Radio Hour"" podcast.

Andreas Malm is an associate professor at Sweden's Lund University, and the author of the book ""How to Blow Up a Pipeline: Learning to Fight in a World on Fire."" Malm's book does not only have an eye-catching title; he actually advocates destroying any and all fossil fuel infrastructure.

Malm wrote in his book, ""Damage and destroy new CO2-emitting devices. Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up. Let the capitalists who keep on investing in the fire know that their properties will be trashed.""

Malm contends that obliterating private property associated with fossil fuels is ""precisely what the climate movement needs.""

When climate activists shut valves and destroy pipelines, when they set fire to heavy machinery owned by oil companies, they assert their rights to this infrastructure and their rights to the land and air and water that it is destroying. It is what I have referred to elsewhere as ""prefigurative expropriation""; a momentary, but informative and empowering challenge to the economic system of private property and the morality that it produces. Sabotage, as its earliest proponents understood, is a powerful threat to the owning class and this is precisely what the climate movement needs.

Malm appeared on the New Yorker podcast last week, where he literally championed destroying pipelines.

Malm said he felt ""panic and desperation"" in the summer of 2018 because of heatwaves, wildfires, and droughts in northern Europe, which pushed him into radical ideas in his climate change activism.



He called for an ""escalation,"" for the ""movement to diversify its tactics, and move away from an exclusive focus on polite, gentle, and perfectly peaceful civil disobedience.""

""I am recommending that the movement continues with mass action, civil disobedience, but also opens up for property destruction,"" Malm told host David Remnick. ""I do think we need to step up, because so little has changed, and so many investments are being poured into new fossil fuel projects.""

""So I am in favor of destroying machines, property, not harming people,"" he added. ""I think property can be destroyed in all manner of ways or it can be neutralized in a more gentle fashion...or in a very spectacular fashion as in potentially blowing up a pipeline under construction,"" Malm proclaimed.

The internet reacted with shock that New Yorker magazine would provide a platform to someone advocating for violence, and encouraging what many called ""terrorism.""













Other media outlets presented Malm's ideas of carrying out acts of violence against energy infrastructure. In May, the New Republic argued that Malm's proposal to destroy private property should be heard in an article titled: ""The Climate Case for Property Destruction.""



What, then, is to be done? The main argument of How to Blow Up a Pipeline is simple: The climate movement should itself enact, through direct action, that prohibition on new fossil fuel infrastructure, and that dismantling of existing pipelines and power plants, which governments have so far refused to take on. Only if such equipment is damaged often and badly enough as to make its continued operation unprofitable does the stabilization of the climate stand a chance. For climate activists to confine themselves to peaceful protest is meanwhile to watch the earth become less and less hospitable to human life. Plenty of readers will react (as I did) with a sort of instinctive skepticism to Malm's case that only widespread property destruction can forestall civilizational suicide, but his case deserves a hearing.

In July, another influential outlet platformed Malm's ideas of blowing up pipelines — the New York Times.

Former Vox co-founder Ezra Klein, who wrote the article, appeared to conflate possible eco-terrorist acts advocated by Malm to violence used during the American Revolution and during the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.

""Malm's rebuttal to potted histories of past social movements, which is persuasive in parts,"" Klein wrote. ""He's surely right that we sanitize past uprisings, lionizing the peaceful and blackening or forgetting the names of the violent. There is at least an argument that it's the interplay of forces that transforms societies. There was no peaceful American Revolution. There were riots and rifles woven into the civil rights movement. 'Does this movement possess a radical flank?' asks Malm.""

""Still, violence is often deployed, even if counterproductively, on behalf of causes far less consequential than the climate crisis,"" Klein reasoned.

Klein did acknowledge that blowing up pipelines would increase energy prices, which would hurt the poor the most.

Fox News noted, ""Ezra Klein previously denounced the violent actions of the January 6 Capitol riots as 'lunacy' and 'lawless' in a New York Times article published on January 7.""

Despite endorsing blowing up a pipeline, writing a book about blowing up a pipeline, and encouraging others to blow up a pipeline, Malm has yet to put his own words into action. Possibly because those who are caught sabotaging energy infrastructure go to prison for years.

In June, the Des Moines Register reported on two eco-terrorists who were sentenced to eight years in prison for causing millions of dollars in damage to the Dakota Access pipeline.



Climate activists Jessica Reznicek, 39, and Ruby Montoya, 31, were indicted on nine federal charges each in September 2019, including charges for damaging an energy facility, use of fire in the commission of a felony, and malicious use of fire. Reznicek and Montoya both pleaded guilty to a single count of damaging an energy facility. In July 2017 the women claimed credit for a series of acts of sabotage, including burning pipeline construction equipment at a Buena Vista County worksite in November 2016 and using oxyacetylene cutting torches or gasoline-soaked rags to damage other pipeline sites around the state between March and May 2017. At the time of their admission, they were affiliated with the Des Moines Catholic Workers' social justice movement.

In the name of climate activism, Malm has admitted that he deflated tires of SUVs in 2007, according to the Los Angeles Review of Books.

In the summer of 2007, five dozen SUV owners in an affluent part of Stockholm awoke to find their cars ""reclining on the asphalt."" On their windshields, they found a leaflet. ""We have deflated one or more of the tyres on your SUV,"" it read. ""Don't take it personally. It's your SUV we dislike."" The leaflets continued by pointing out how much gasoline the SUVs burned, this burning was directly connected to the rapid warming of the planet, and the drivers would be fine — they might be mildly inconvenienced, but clearly they had money and lived in a city with good public transit. At roughly the same time, the small band of SUV saboteurs published a statement taking credit for the action, exhorting others to copy their work, and making available a ""simple manual"" for how to release the air from a tire.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-yorker-climate-activist-pipelines-destroy,2021-09-26
Twitter reactions to NFL map showing Taiwan a part of China,"The NFL is facing backlash for sharing a world map that showed Taiwan belonging to China.

On Wednesday, the National Football League announced a new international home marketing program for select franchises.

""NFL announced that 18 teams have been granted access to 26 International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA) across eight different countries,"" the NFL statement said. ""This ground-breaking, new initiative grants clubs access to international territories for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization as part of an important, long-term, strategic effort to enable clubs to build their global brands while driving NFL fan growth internationally.""



The NFL posted a world map on Twitter showing which teams would be promoted and in what international markets.

As the map made the rounds on social media, keen-eyed commentators noticed that the map showed China colored red as well as Taiwan — also called the Republic of China. Online critics questioned why the NFL included Taiwan as part of China when it is a separate, independent nation.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) slammed the sports league, ""The NFL, which is chasing dollars from the Chinese Communist Party, shows Taiwan as part of China. Disgraceful cowardice.""



Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez (R-Fla.) also blasted the National Football League, ""Hey @NFL, why are you depicting China and Taiwan as the same country? Do you not believe in the freedom of Taiwan? Stop shilling for the #CCP. It’s shameful to profit off the oppression of the Taiwanese people and the slavery of the Uyghurs.""

Columnist Jon Gabriel asked, ""Why do you include Taiwan as part of China? Taiwan is an independent country.""

Writer Ian Miles Cheong tweeted, ""The NFL caves to communist China and falsely lists Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory.""

Republican political operative Logan Dobson reacted by saying, ""Just the @NFL erasing the independent nation of Taiwan to suck up to genocidal Chinese Communists for money.""



Author Dan K. Eberhart pointed out, ""The @NFL and @NBA can virtue signal about human rights all they want. Your words mean absolutely nothing if you're too cowardly to put human rights above making money in China's market.""

The Economist's China affairs editor Gady Epstein quipped, ""NFL seems to have decided which team Taiwan is on.""

Sarah McLaughlin – director of targeted advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education – responded by saying, ""I would love to hear how the NFL is planning (if at all) to deal with the free speech challenges that will inevitably develop here. Their initial response to these issues in the U.S. was bad enough; what can we expect if they get their own NBA/China-type controversy?""

The Los Angeles Rams are assigned to China, so Fox News contributor Johnny ""Joey"" Jones asked the team, ""Do you endorse this erasure of an entire country?""



Brendan Carr – commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission – shared a map depicting Taiwan as its own country with the caption: ""Fixed it for you, @NFL.""

The NFL did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

In November, the CCP declared that it would punish enterprises that support Taiwan's independence from mainland China.

""We welcome Taiwan-based enterprises to invest and develop in the mainland and will continue to protect their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law,"" Zhu Fenglian, the spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said, according to Business Insider. ""But we will never allow those that support Taiwan independence or damage cross-Straits relations to make money on the mainland. They and their associated companies and financiers must be punished in accordance with the law.""

Also last month, China's Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing warned, ""The mainland will pursue criminal responsibility for Taiwan independence diehards in accordance with the law, to be effective for life,"" the Daily Mail reported.

During President Joe Biden's Summit for Democracy earlier this month, the video feed of a slideshow presentation from Taiwanese Digital Minister Audrey Tang abruptly stopped. There are reports that the White House censored the presentation because it promoted Taiwan as separate from China – which would be a violation of the ""One-China policy"" that only recognizes the People’s Republic of China and not the Republic of China. U.S. and Taiwan officials blamed ""technical problems"" for the disruption that caused the video to fail.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nfl-china-taiwan-map-reactions,2021-12-16
Photos appear to show NFL wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins giving Trump supporters two middle fingers,"Photos appear to show an NFL player giving Trump supporters the middle finger as he drove past in a sports car on Arizona's I-10 highway Sunday.

Multiple reports indicate that Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, 28, appeared to flip off a miles-long caravan of Trump supporters as he drove past in his Ferrari on the way to State Farm Stadium for Sunday night's game against the Seattle Seahawks.

According to KSAZ-TV, a caravan of people supporting President Donald Trump for re-election rallied that day on several Arizona highways, including I-17, Loop 101, 202, and I-10.



Hopkins was reportedly seen driving past the caravan, making obscene gestures along the way, around 1:30 p.m. According to the Arizona Republic, Hopkins was wearing a distinctive shirt that he was seen wearing when he arrived at the stadium later that afternoon.

Members of the pro-Trump caravan accused Hopkins of driving recklessly, speeding and swerving in and out of the caravan line.

""It's scary when they are coming up fast and swerving into you,"" April Garcia, one of the drivers in the caravan, said. She also noted other ""intolerant"" people threw water and other objects at the Trump supporters.

Others on social media called out Hopkins for his behavior.



So far neither the Cardinals nor the Arizona Department of Public Safety have released a statement about the incident, KSAZ reported.

The Cardinals beat the formerly undefeated Seahawks Sunday night 37-34. Hopkins, one of the NFL's best wide receivers, ended the game with 10 receptions for 103 yards, scoring one touchdown.

Hopkins is a vocal Black Lives Matter supporter and critic of President Trump.

In June, Hopkins starred in a video along with other NFL stars including Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Cleveland Browns receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry, Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, and others condemning police brutality after the death of George Floyd.

""How many times do we need to ask you to listen to your players? What will it take? For one of us to be murdered by police brutality?"" the players asked the league.

""I am George Floyd,"" Hopkins and the others said.

Back in 2018, Hopkins, then playing for the Houston Texans, said Trump is too ""closed-minded"" to understand the NFL national anthem protests.

""I think Trump is more closed-minded and he thinks the reason that we're kneeling is because of the flag,"" Hopkins told TMZ Sports. ""When that's like not at all the reason we're kneeling. I kneeled last year and one of my best friends is a Purple Heart veteran and my uncle is a Purple Heart veteran and they understand that it's not about the flag.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nfl-deandre-hopkins-flips-off-trump-supporters,2020-10-26
Nike CEO touts company as ‘of China and for China’,"Nike's chief executive officer recently made a strong defense of its business prospects in China, issuing comments that are sure to spark controversy regarding where the sports apparel company's loyalties lie.

""Nike is a brand that is of China and for China,"" insisted Nike CEO John Donahue during an earnings call last week, according to BBC News.

The comments reportedly came as part of a discussion on the company's fourth-quarter earnings. Despite making significant gains across the board, Nike's earnings in China fell short of Wall Street analyst estimates.

The dip appears to be the result of a consumer boycott in the country over a recent statement it made raising concerns about forced labor practices in Xinjiang.

In the statement, the sportswear giant said it was ""concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR)"" and maintained it ""does not source products from the XUAR and [has confirmed with] contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region.""

Last year, Nike — along with several other U.S. companies — came under fire in the West over its alleged use of forced labor linked to the Muslim Uyghur slave trade in Xinjiang, a massive Chinese region where roughly one-fifth of the world's cotton is sourced.

The Chinese Communist Party has characterized Western companies' decisions to avoid using cotton sourced from the region as an effort to hamper the country's economy.

Yet despite the dip in Chinese business, Donahue asserted that the company would double down on its outsized efforts there.

""We've always taken a long-term view. We've been in China for over 40 years,"" Donahue said.

""We are the largest sport brand there, and we are a brand of China and for China,"" he reportedly added. ""And the biggest asset we have in China is the consumer equity. Consumers feel a strong, deep connection to the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands in China. And it's real.""

Critics of the sportswear company are sure to perceive the move as another example of its bending the knee to communist China in shameless pursuit of more profit.

""Nike cannot serve America and China. It has chosen its master, and it is not us,"" conservative sports commentator and BlazeTV host Jason Whitlock wrote over the weekend.

He added: ""China is a communist-run, authoritarian, racist country. America is (or has been) a democratic republic pursuing freedom and fairness. You can't be of China and for China and serve America.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nike-ceo-of-china-for-china,2021-06-28
Nikki Haley says political rhetoric is 'reaching the point of hate',"Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley voiced her concerns over the current political climate, telling an audience of young conservatives last week that some rhetoric is ""really reaching the point of hate.""

What are the details?

The Daily Caller reported that Haley sat down with Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk for a question-and-answer session at his organization's Young Women's Leadership Summit on Friday.

According to the outlet, Haley warned, ""My concern really is the fact that when I hear how toxic the politics are — I believe in being passionate, I do. But when it gets toxic and I say now it's getting to where people are calling each other evil. They're hiding behind anonymous things and they're saying things that are really reaching the point of hate.""

She went on to explain, ""When I hear them call each other evil, it bothers me because I've seen evil. I've been to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where they use rape as a weapon of war. I've been to South Sudan where they've taken babies from women's arms and thrown them into fire,"" adding, ""That's evil.""

""What we're having in our country is a debate of ideas. ... That's it."" the former South Carolina governor continued. ""And what I worry about is that Americans are forgetting to be grateful, because on our worst day we are blessed to be in America.""

Days before Haley's discussion with Kirk, ""The View"" host Whoopi Goldberg attacked Haley and other pro-life conservatives for being ""anti-human"" and declared, ""I don't want you in my coochie.""

Haley responded via Twitter, saying, ""I'm not going to get in the gutter with Whoopi on this, but listen to both of us and you decide.""



The former governor referred to the exchange while speaking with Kirk, saying, Goldberg ""made my point, because she immediately started attacking the other side without listening to what I was trying to say. I wasn't judging anyone. I wasn't criticizing anyone. I was saying why I continue to fight.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nikki-haley-hateful-political-rhetoric,2019-06-10
North Korea fires off short-range missiles after warning Biden administration not to cause 'a stink',"North Korea fired off two-short range missiles over the weekend, days after the sister of dictator Kim Jong Un warned the Biden administration against ""causing a stink"" in its dealings with the communist regime.

What are the details?

The Washington Post first reported on the missile tests, saying they represent Kim's ""first direct challenge to President [Joe] Biden, whose aides have not yet outlined their approach to the regime's nuclear threat amid an ongoing review of the U.S.-North Korea policy.""

A U.S. official later confirmed that North Korea conducted the missile tests over the weekend.

Thus far, North Korea has ignored the Biden administration's attempts to talk directly, but Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, issued a statement via the country's state-run news agency last week, CNN reported.

Ms. Kim's statement read:

""We take this opportunity to warn the new US administration trying hard to give off powder smell in our land: If it wants to sleep in peace for (the) coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.""

According to ABC News, North Korea also ""recently complained publicly about a new round of American and South Korean military exercises taking place in South Korea.""

Also last week, North Korea's first vice minister of foreign affairs, Choe Son Hui, issued a statement saying, ""We have already declared our stand that no [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]-U.S. contact and dialogue of any kind can be possible unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK,"" The Hill reported.

Former President Donald Trump famously met with Kim in 2018, establishing a handshake deal wherein the North Korean dictator agreed to cease his government's testing of long-range missiles.

Since then, the isolationist nation has not fired off long-range missiles, but continued to conduct short-range tests during the Trump administration.

Then, in October of last year, North Korea rolled out what appears to be one of the largest intercontinental ballistic missiles in the world during a military parade.

The commander of U.S. Northern Command, Gen. Glen VanHerck, told Congress last week in written testimony:

""The Kim Jong Un regime has achieved alarming success in its quest to demonstrate the capability to threaten the U.S. homeland with nuclear-armed ICBMs, believing such weapons are necessary to deter U.S. military action and ensure his regime's survival.

""The North Korean regime has also indicated that it is no longer bound by the unilateral nuclear and ICBM testing moratorium announced in 2018, suggesting that Kim may begin flight testing an improved ICBM design in the near future.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-fires-off-short-range-missiles-after-warning-biden-administration-not-to-cause-a-stink,2021-03-23
US says North Korean launches have been testing new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile system,"The U.S. believes that two recent North Korean missile tests featured a new intercontinental ballistic missile system that was initially revealed during a parade in 2020, according to a statement from Pentagon press secretary John Kirby.

""The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) conducted two ballistic missile tests on February 26 and March 4, 2022 EST. Based on analysis of these launches, the United States Government has concluded that these launches involved a new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system that the DPRK is developing, which was originally unveiled during the Korean Workers Party parade on October 10, 2020,"" Kirby said.

""The purpose of these tests, which did not demonstrate ICBM range, was likely to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future, potentially disguised as a space launch,"" he noted.

Kirby said that the tests mark a flagrant breach of United Nations Security Council resolutions.



""The United States strongly condemns these launches, which are a brazen violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, needlessly raise tensions and risk destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" he said.

He also declared that America remains dedicated to defending South Korea and Japan.

""Earlier this week, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command ordered intensified surveillance activity in the Yellow Sea, as well as enhanced readiness among our ballistic missile defense forces in the region. Our commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad. We have been and will continue to coordinate closely with our allies and partners to address the threats posed by the DPRK and to advance our shared objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" he said.

The Associated Press reported that during Biden's tenure, the administration has reached out in attempts to get North Korea to negotiate. But the outlet reported that according to a senior U.S. administration official, North Korea has been unresponsive to the U.S. requests.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-tests,2022-03-10
North Korea reportedly fires ICBM for the first time since 2017,"North Korea has test-fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time since 2017, according to South Korean and Japanese officials, in a provocative action that was condemned by President Joe Biden.

Japan's Defense Ministry tracked what is believed to be an ICBM, which flew to an altitude of 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) and to a distance of 1,080 kilometers (671 miles) with a flight time of 71 minutes before landing in waters near Japan's western coast, CNN reports.

Thursday's missile launch is the 11th test North Korea has conducted this year, including one test on March 16 that South Korean officials said exploded in mid-air. News of the test broke while President Biden is meeting other Western leaders in Brussels for a high-stakes summit to discuss Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The missile launch is the longest-range test conducted by North Korea since the country's dictator Kim Jong Un imposed a moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing during diplomatic talks with President Donald Trump's administration. The resumption of ICBM testing is yet another destabilizing action taken by an American adversary under Biden's watch since the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday to discuss the matter.

""The two Leaders discussed DPRK’s launch of a long-range ballistic missile, which both Leaders strongly condemned, stressed the need for diplomacy, and agreed to continue working together to hold the DPRK accountable,"" a White House official said in a statement, according to The Hill.

Officials from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea have each condemned the missile test.

""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

""This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people. We urge all countries to hold the DPRK accountable for such violations and call on the DPRK to come to the table for serious negotiations,"" she continued.



""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions. The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies,"" she said.



The missile test comes two weeks after South Korea elected a new conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who is widely expected to be tougher on North Korea than his predecessor, according to CNN.

In response to the suspected ICBM test, South Korea's military conducted exercises, launching several warning missiles for the first time since 2017, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

""Our military is monitoring North Korean military's movements and have confirmed that we have the capability and posture to accurately strike the origin location of the missile launch and command and support facilities any time North Korea launches a missile,"" the JCS said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-provokes-with-suspected-icbm-test,2022-03-24
North Korea now says it won't denuclearize unless the US removes its 'nuclear threat' first,"Through a state-run newspaper, the government of North Korea has indicated that it will not denuclearize until the U.S. ""nuclear threat"" is eliminated.

What did North Korea say?

A commentary from the Korean Central News Agency laid out the government's position on denuclearization:

The proper definition of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is completely eliminating the American nuclear threat to North Korea before eliminating our nuclear capability.

It went on to say:

When talking about the Korean peninsula, it encompasses not only our republic's territory but also South Korea where the American nuclear weapons and armed forces for invasion are spread out. When talking about denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, [the United States] needs to know that it means eliminating all nuclear threat factors.

While the United States has halted large-scale joint military exercises with South Korea, there is no indication that the Trump administration would agree to remove U.S. troops from South Korea.

This comes less than a week after an editorial published in the same state-run news outlet blamed U.S. sanctions on North Korea for slowing down denuclearization talks. ""[A]dded sanctions pressure will block the path to denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula forever — a result desired by no one,"" it warned.

In a state like North Korea, where the media has no freedom and everyone in the news industry must act in compliance with the state, opinions featured in state-run news outlets are often considered to be the official opinion of the government.

What does this mean for peace talks?

During their June 12 summit in Singapore, President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un signed a declaration that read:

President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

However, since that time multiple reports from news agencies and the United Nations have indicated that North Korea has been continuing to develop its nuclear program, despite promises to the United States. On Dec. 4, national security adviser John Bolton admitted that the Kim regime had ""not lived up to the commitments so far.""

On Dec. 14, Trump tweeted that negotiations with North Korea were ""doing just fine"" and that he was ""in no hurry"" because Kim saw the ""wonderful potential for great economic success"" that would come from such a deal.

If Kim continues to resist giving up his nuclear program, this would be the seventh time that the North Korean regime has agreed to denuclearize and then not followed through. The other six were in 1985, 1992, 1994, 2005, 2007, and 2012.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-says-it-wont-denuclearize-unless-us-removes-its-nuclear-threat-first,2018-12-20
Another undisclosed missile site found in North Korea; report says there may be as many as 19 more,"Researchers have discovered a secret missile base in North Korea, which could be one out of as many as 20 undisclosed sites in the country, according to a report released Monday.

The Beyond Parallel report identified the Sino-ri Missile Operating Base, which has never been declared by Kim Jong Un's regime. Beyond Parallel, a project sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, provides strategic information for policymakers and leaders about Korean unification.

""The North Koreans are not going to negotiate over things they don't disclose,"" Victor Cha, one of the authors of the report, said, according to NBC News. ""It looks like they're playing a game. They're still going to have all this operational capability,"" even if they destroy their disclosed nuclear facilities.""

The ballistic missile base discovery comes on the heels of Friday's White House announcement that President Donald Trump would be meeting for a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un next month.

What's the background?

Last summer during their first summit, Trump and Kim signed an agreement that provided security guarantees to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in exchange for the nation's commitment to completely denuclearize.

Kim initially showed an attempt to decommission the Sohae satellite launch facility and the Punggye-ri nuclear testing site, but later the U.S. government concluded that Kim was not giving up his nuclear ambitions. In August, national security adviser John Bolton told NPR that North Korea had ""not taken effective steps"" to denuclearize.

What were some of the report's key findings?

The Sino-ri is an operational missile base which sits about 131 miles north of the Koreas demilitarized zone. It houses a regiment-sized unit equipped with Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM). The missiles have the capability of reaching South Korea, Japan, and Guam, according to the report.

It's one of the oldest of an estimated 20 undeclared missile operating bases. It reportedly serves as the headquarters of the Strategic Rocket Forces Nodong missile brigade. It may have also played a role in the development of the newest Pukkuksong-2 (KN-15) ballistic missile which was first tested in February 2017.

The base doesn't appear to be part of denuclearization negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea. Only operating bases that have been disclosed would be subject the agreement between the nations.

The decommissioning of the Sohae satellite launch facility ""obscures the military threat to U.S. forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases,"" the report said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-undisclosed-missile-site,2019-01-21
NY Times reporter rips Trump for telling Iran to 'let reporters roam free' while calling US press 'enemy of the people.' Reporter gets slammed.,"After President Donald Trump tweeted a warning and appeal to the leaders of Iran over the weekend to not kill their protesters and to leave their reporters alone, New York Times' White House correspondent Maggie Haberman took issue with that.

""'Let reporters roam free' says the president, who routinely refers to the U.S. press as 'enemy of the people,' to Iranian leaders,"" she tweeted Sunday.

What's the background?

Things have suddenly turned in Iran since thousands of mourners chanted ""America is the Great Satan"" during the funeral of bloodthirsty Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, killed earlier this month in a U.S. airstrike on Trump's orders.

But over the weekend protesters flooded the streets of Tehran and demanded that Ayatollah Khamenei step down as supreme leader after the Iranian government admitted its armed forces shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board. Video posted to social media showed protesters shouting ""death to liars,"" ""death to the Islamic Republic,"" and ""Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is also a murderer.""

As the protests intensified, the Iranian government's security forces reportedly shot live rounds and tear gas to disperse demonstrators, ABC News said.

Trump weighed in with his tweet to the leaders of Iran: ""DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your Internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!""

And then Haberman let Trump have it with her Twitter post.

How did folks react to the NYT reporter's tweet?

As you might expect, many commenters pointed out that Haberman was propagating a false equivalence by seemingly suggesting that Trump's disgust with ""fake news"" — and the left-wing media that puts it out there — is on the same level of Iran's totalitarian regime, which commonly arrests and jails journalists and generally is viewed as among worst countries in the world when it comes to freedom of the press:

Here are a few other perspectives from Haberman's detractors:

""Are you seriously comparing Trump to the Iranian government literally silencing their media? Get a grip.""

""Thank you for calling this out. Trump's mean tweets about journalists are exactly like the Iranian government imprisoning and torturing journalists.""

""Stop being a Drama Queen Maggie. More people would respect you if you told the truth. Go to Iran and badmouth your Ayatollah and see how long you last. You badmouth President Trump 24/7, and I don't see you in jail or worse yet.""

""Did I miss where Trump had your phones bugged, and your parents' phones, too?""

""Maggie freely tweets and writes whatever she wishes without the slightest worry of being arrested. Just like it is in Iran.""

Hannity demanded a retraction of a coronavirus article and the New York Times just responded,"The New York Times responded Tuesday to a demand from Fox News host Sean Hannity to retract claims made against him in their article about the coronavirus and apologize.

""The columns are accurate, do not reasonably imply what you and Mr. Hannity allege they do, and constitute protected opinion,"" wrote David E. McCraw, the attorney representing the New York Times.

""In response to your request for an apology and retraction, our answer is 'no,' "" he concluded.

Hannity's lawyers threatened to sue the Times over an article published on April 18 that documented the death of Joe Joyce from the coronavirus.

The family of Joyce say that he was warned not to go on a cruise during the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, but that he ignored the warnings because of the news broadcasts on Fox News downplaying the threat.

One of those cited was a segment by Hannity.

On Monday, Hannity sent a demand from his lawyers that they apologize and retract the story because his report was chronologically a week after Joyce decided to go on the cruise.

""We demand that you promptly remove the foregoing false and defamatory statements from the Stories and any subsequent republications in print or any other medium, and publish a full, fair and conspicuous retraction, correction and apology as to each of the false and defamatory statements identified above,"" read the letter from Hannity.

In 2017, Hannity threatened to sue former President Barack Obama with the ""biggest lawsuit"" possible over reports that he had been incidentally surveilled as part of the investigation into Russian election interference.

NYU professor writes book comparing Trump to Hitler,"Liberal commentators have compared President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler since he announced his candidacy for president in 2015, but the Hitlerian comparisons may be reaching new lows.

An New York University Law professor has penned a whole book that, according to RedState's Alex Parker, is largely dedicated to comparing the country's 45th president to the Austrian-born dictator.

In ""When at Times the Mob Is Swayed: A Citizen's Guide to Defending Our Republic,"" liberal news website CommonDreams.org says professor Burt Neuborne lists ""20 Ways Trump Is Copying Hitler's Early Rhetoric and Policies.""

Among the similarities between Trump and Hitler, according to the law school professor:



Neither was elected by a majority.

Both found direct communication channels to their base.

Both blame others and divide on racial lines.

Both relentlessly demonize opponents.

They unceasingly attack objective truth.

They relentlessly attack mainstream media.

Their attacks on truth include science.

Their lies blur reality — and supporters spread them.

Both orchestrated mass rallies to show status.

They embrace extreme nationalism.

Both glorify the military and demand loyalty oaths.

Both relegate women to subordinate roles.T

They proclaim unchecked power.

They embraced mass detentions and deportations.

Conservative writer responds



Parker notes that Neuborne's comparison is absurd. ""Remember, he's referring to the 'mass detentions'… of Hitler — a man responsible for the deaths of an estimated six million. That's something Donald Trump has in common,"" he said.

Parker also points out that in Hitler's Germany, the Nazis were the media and cited from the Holocaust Encyclopedia:

The Nazi Propaganda Ministry, directed by Dr. Joseph Goebbels, took control of all forms of communication in Germany: newspapers, magazines, books, public meetings, and rallies, art, music, movies, and radio. Viewpoints in any way threatening to Nazi beliefs or to the regime were censored or eliminated from all media.

""Additionally, of course, the suggestion establishes the following: No matter what the media says about you, if you speak against them, you're Hitler,"" Parker wrote while citing a passage from Neuborne's book.

""Trump echoes Hitler's jingoistic appeal to ultranationalist fervor, extolling American exceptionalism right down to the slogan 'Make America Great Again,' a paraphrase of Hitler's promise to restore German greatness,"" he added.

Democratic leaders have also compared Trump to Hitler



Democratic leaders have also made similar arguments in the past. As CNN reported, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in March that the president's rhetoric on immigration is similar to Hitler's treatment of Jews.

""You've heard the President and the administration say that immigrants are thieves, that they bring in drugs, that they're responsible for lots of crime, that they're -- a crisis at our border, they're bringing in drugs and crime,"" Nadler said.

""This is the same type of propaganda that we heard in the 1920s and World War I against Jews. 'Jews are Bolsheviks. Jews are thieves. Jews are violent' -- that was the propaganda. And, we were that against the Irish early. Now, we're hearing it against this generation's immigrants -- and it's just as false now,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyu_professor_compares_trump_to_hitler,2019-11-30
"Obama hits out at ‘dangers’ of cancel culture, jokes about critical race theory, and says 'right-wing media' stoking fear in white Americans","Former President Barack Obama said this week that he believes cancel culture has become a dangerous social plague upon America and that ""certain right-wing media venues"" are stoking ""fear and resentment"" among America's white population.

During a wide-ranging special titled ""Barack Obama on Fatherhood, Leadership, and Legacy,"" the former president also joked about critical race theory and suggested Republicans should be more concerned with climate change and the country's economy.

'We're just going to be condemning people all the time'

During the Monday night special, Obama told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he believes people today are going overboard with cancel culture.

""At least in conversations with my daughters, I think that a lot of the dangers of cancel culture are that we're just going to be condemning people all the time, at least among my daughters they will acknowledge sometimes among their peer group or in college campuses you'll see folks going overboard,"" he said.

On his daughters, Obama added, ""[T]hey have a pretty good sense of look, we don't want — we don't expect everybody to be perfect. We don't expect everyone to be politically correct all the time. But we are going to call out institutions or individuals if they're being cruel, if they are, you know, discriminating against people.""

Media stoking 'fear and resentment' in America's white population

The former president also argued that the media — specifically ""certain right-wing media venues"" — are stoking ""fear and resentment"" among white people.

He told Cooper that he believes the nation's race problems are indicative of the United States and its citizens not having ""fully reconciled"" with America's history, and insisted that it was difficult for a majority of white people to ""recognize that you can be proud of this country and its traditions and its history and our forefathers, yet it is also true that this terrible stuff happened.""

""The vestiges of that linger and continued,"" Obama insisted.

""I also think that there are certain right-wing media venues ... that monetize and capitalize on stoking the fear and resentment of a white population that is witnessing a changing America and seeing demographic changes,"" he added. ""... [They] do everything they can to give people a sense that their way of life is threatened and that people are trying to take advantage of them.""

Obama also addressed critical race theory in America and joked that Republicans are more keen to focus on CRT rather than ""major issues"" such as ""the economy and climate change.""

""Who knew that was the threat to our Republic?"" he joked.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-cancel-culture-critical-race-theory,2021-06-08
Off-duty firefighter holds armed suspect in body armor at gunpoint at Missouri Walmart,"An off-duty firefighter with a concealed carry permit is being hailed a hero tonight, after he held an armed suspect wearing tactical gear at gunpoint at a Missouri Walmart.

What are the details?

At around 4:10 p.m. Thursday, a white male suspect in his 20s entered a Walmart Neighborhood Market in Springfield, Missouri, wearing a bulletproof vest and armed with two firearms while carrying more than 100 rounds of ammunition on his person.

The incident was called in to 911 as an active shooter situation.

According to Lt. Mike Lucas of the Springfield Police Department, the man pushed a shopping cart through the store while taking video on his phone as shoppers panicked and ran. KSPR-TV reported that the store manager pulled the fire alarm and urged patrons to flee, while ""the suspect made his way out an emergency exit where a firefighter held the man at gunpoint.""

The firefighter reportedly held the man for roughly three minutes before police arrived and arrested the suspect. Lucas later told reporters of the suspect, ""His intent was not to cause peace or comfort to anybody that was in that business. He's lucky he's alive still, to be honest.""

Ozarks First reported that no shots were fired, no one was injured, and the suspect is still in custody. No charges have yet been filed, but Lt. Lucas assured, ""We definitely have some crimes here.""





Anything else?

Authorities across the country are on high alert after a series of high-profile mass murders in recent weeks. Lt. Lucas confirmed that sentiment, telling KSPR, ""Obviously, what's happened in Texas and Dayton...in the last seven days — that's on everyone's mind.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/off-duty-firefighter-holds-armed-suspect-in-body-armor-at-gunpoint-at-missouri-walmart,2019-08-09
Ohio GOP calls on Rep. Anthony Gonzalez to resign for voting to impeach Trump,"The leadership of the Ohio Republican Party has censured Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) and is calling for him to resign from Congress for voting to impeach former President Donald Trump.

On Friday, the party's central committee adopted two resolutions — the first censuring Gonzalez and nine other Republican representatives for ""their votes to support the unconstitutional, politically motivated impeachment proceeding against President Donald J. Trump."" The second resolution, which narrowly passed, called on Gonzalez to resign, WCMH-TV reported.

Gonzalez, a former NFL wide receiver, is currently serving his second term in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Ohio's 16th Congressional District. He was one of 10 Republican House members to vote in favor of impeaching Trump after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. He is now facing a primary challenge from Max Tiller, a former Trump aide who is running with an endorsement from the former president.

The resolution censuring Gonzalez called the impeachment — which was tried in the U.S. Senate after Trump had left office — ""meritless, unprecedented, unconstitutional and purposeless.""

At the time, Gonzalez explained his vote, saying, ""The President of the United States helped organize and incite a mob that attacked the United States Congress in an attempt to prevent us from completing our solemn duties as prescribed by the Constitution.

""During the attack itself, the President abandoned his post while many members asked for help, thus further endangering all present. These are fundamental threats not just to people's lives but to the very foundation of our Republic,"" he said.

""When I consider the full scope of events leading up to January 6th including the President's lack of response as the United States Capitol was under attack, I am compelled to support impeachment.""

Two of the prominent Republican candidates running to succeed retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) in the U.S. Senate came out in support of the Ohio GOP's decision.

Jane Timken, who served as the state party chairwoman before stepping down to run for Senate, said she was in full agreement with Gonzalez's censure.

""As President Trump's hand-picked Party Chair who traveled 150,000 miles across Ohio supporting his agenda, I fully agree with the censure of Anthony Gonzalez,"" she tweeted. ""The impeachment was a sham that betrayed the Constitution and went against Ohioans' interests.""

Former state treasurer Josh Mandel, who is running against Timken in the GOP Senate primary, criticized her for not censuring Gonzalez sooner.

""Tomorrow the Ohio Republican Party will finally vote to censure Anthony Gonzalez for his vote on the sham impeachment of President Trump,"" said Mandel. ""Question: Why did Jane Timken refuse to censure Gonzalez when she was Chairman? She clearly had time to do so. So what's the real reason?""

Gonzalez is not the only pro-impeachment Republican to face backlash from his state's party. In February, the Wyoming Republican Party officially censured Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) for her vote to impeach Trump. Now it appears that Cheney will be ousted from Republican leadership in the House, demonstrating that the political future of Trump-critical Republicans looks bleak.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ohio-gop-anthony-gonzalez-resign-impeachment,2021-05-07
"One-armed high school star to play Division I college basketball, may have overall NIL value of $1.2 million","Editor's note: The headline and second paragraph have been amended to clarify that Enmanuel has an NIL value of $1.2 million. The original article stated that he had signed an NIL deal with Gatorade for $1.2 million. He has signed an agreement with Gatorade, but the value of the agreement has not been made public.



A Florida high school basketball star, who has only one arm, has just accepted two major deals.

Hansel Enmanuel, the 6'4,"" 175-lb. guard originally from the Dominican Republic, has not only signed up to play basketball at a Division I school, but many also say that the value of his name, image, and likeness is somewhere around $1.2 million.

Though Enmanuel is now making a name for himself in college basketball circles and with corporate sponsors, there was a time when most predicted he'd never have a future in sports. When he was just 6 years old, his left arm had to be amputated above the elbow. A cinder block wall had collapsed on him and pinned him to the ground for nearly two hours, until his father, Hansel Salvador Donato, rescued him.

Through the guidance of his father, who played professional basketball in the Dominican Republic, Enmanuel soon got back into the game he loved. He then moved to Florida in 2020 and soon became a star player at Life Christian Academy in Kissimmee, Florida, where he averaged a double-double.

He has now accepted an offer to play for Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana, though the terms of the offer are not clear. Enmanuel also received offers from the University of Memphis, Tennessee State, and Bethune-Cookman.

Enmanuel's story has garnered national attention in the last couple of years. He was featured on ""SportsCenter"" on ESPN and even was nominated for an Espy for ""Best Play"" for this dunk:

He ultimately lost the award to women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe.

Enmanuel has also partnered with Gatorade, which featured him in a recent ad.

“Want doesn’t come from anywhere but within. I’ve got a drive to be great. So can you! @gatorade #gatoradepartner,” Enmanuel posted to Instagram.

Though the details of the deal are not known, On3 suggested that Gatorade selected Enmanuel in order to add more diversity to its NIL sponsorships.

Rapper J. Cole also featured Enmanuel in a recent video, tweeting out the video with the message, ""The Audacity II Dreamer. I believe.""

Despite the national spotlight, Enmanuel has remained grounded. He does not speak fluent English, but he gave an interview in Spanish to the Orlando Sentinel and expressed his hope that people would ""not see me as a special kid who has a disability. [I wish] that they only see me as a great player who will go as far as many. That I am a good player.""

“It’s not about what I want to achieve or do in life, it’s what God wants from me,” he said.

Oregon city issues emergency declaration to fight liberal governor's COVID edicts. Now other local governments are asking them how they did it.,"The state of Oregon suffers a problem similar to its neighbor to the north, Washington. Much of the state — especially the east side — is conservative but is dominated by the hard-core liberalism of its biggest urban center in the northwest corner. For Washington it's Seattle. For Oregon it's Portland.

Because of the left's power, the Democratic governors of those states have been emboldened to push pandemic restrictions, mask mandates, and health edicts upon their subjects.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) ordered all indoor dining to stop, forced gyms and entertainment activities to be shuttered, closed outdoor recreation, required businesses to mandate work-from-home and close offices to the public, limited churches to 25 people, kept kids out of school, told Oregonians to call the police to rat on neighbors who violate her lockdown orders, and even reportedly used CPS to retaliate against a salon owner for reopening early.

Last month, one Eastern Oregon city decided it had had enough and came up with a unique way to fight Brown's orders — and now other cities and counties are coming to its leaders asking how they did it.

What happened?

Immediately after Baker City Mayor Kerry McQuisten was sworn in to her first term on Jan. 12, business leaders began asking her for help fighting Brown's mandates, the mayor told PJ Media this week.

The push started with a discussion of how to make Baker City a ""sanctuary city.""

“After we were all sworn in back on January 12th, local businesses brought forth to [city] council an idea of a Common Sense Sanctuary City,"" McQuisten said. ""The idea was pretty funny, actually. It was a good idea. They were asking for local businesses to be able to adhere, or not adhere to the mask mandates, the OSHA [Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division] restrictions, as they saw fit individually.""

The mayor told PJ Media that a town hall meeting on the issue showed how concerned her constituents were.

""Business owners poured in to give testimony,"" she said. ""Some questioned whether the city could protect them from state OSHA regulations and targeting by these agencies.""

As time went on, the discussions and meetings led to action. The city council sent a letter to Brown with their concerns and discussed a possible resolution.

They soon learned that would not be enough.

""After we got no response from the governor,"" McQuisten told PJ Media, ""we brought forth the Emergency Declaration, and batted the language back and forth for a couple of weeks.""

That led to the emergency declaration the city council passed March 23. The declaration cites Brown's ""arbitrary, ineffective, and draconian"" executive orders and the lack of legal ability the city has to ""flout"" the mandates, which keeps the municipality from defending local businesses.

It also notes that ""that neither city, county nor state government has the legal right to flout the Oregon State Constitution or the United States Constitution"" and that ""our citizens are fully capable of making their private, individual healthcare and lifestyle decisions themselves.""

The declaration also cites other negative impacts Brown's edicts have had and the legal dubiousness of the orders.

It resolves that the city is in ""an economic, mental health, and crime crisis due to the current COVID-related State Emergency Declaration and related OSHA mandates and guidances"" and that city leaders will support legislation to provide ""reparations to business owners who have had their businesses and income taken without compensation"" and ballot initiatives to limit the governor's powers.""

The declaration concludes:

[T]he City recognizes the citizenry of Baker City are free, sovereign individuals within a Constitutional, Representative Republic, not subjects or slaves, and will be recognized as such as we firmly stand to represent them.""

The mayor posted the entire declaration on her Facebook page:

Since the passage of the emergency declaration, officials across the Beaver State have apparently been seeking to emulate Baker City's moves.

""The League of Oregon cities is spotlighting us in their podcast,"" McQuisten told PJ Media, “and several other mayors across the state are looking at the resolution.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oregon-city-emergency-declaration-fight-governors-covid-edicts,2021-04-29
"Parents of aid worker raped, murdered by ISIS take shot at Obama, praise Trump after al-Baghdadi's death","Kayla Mueller was an aid worker who was brutally raped and murdered while imprisoned by ISIS. On Sunday, Mueller's parents responded to the news of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death by praising President Donald Trump — and taking a shot at former President Barack Obama.

Marsha Mueller, Kayla's mom, said she believes her daughter would still be alive had the Obama administration acted more decisively to save Kayla.

""I still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,"" she told the Arizona Republic.

Kayla was imprisoned by the Islamic State in 2013 after temporarily visiting a hospital in Syria. At the time, she was serving as a humanitarian aid worker in Turkey. Kayla was held by her terrorist captors for 18 months, being subjected to rape and brutal torture. The New York Times reported after Kayla's death that she was even forced to marry al-Baghdadi.

Kayla's death was announced in 2015, but her body has never been recovered. Now, her parents believe Trump — who mentioned Kayla twice on Sunday when announcing al-Baghdadi's death — will help them find the answers they have been seeking.

""I still want to know, 'Where is Kayla?' and what truly happened to her and what aren't we being told. Someone knows, and I'm praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers,"" Marsha Mueller told the Republic.

The Muellers have taken particular exception with what they believe was inaction by the Obama administration.

Fox News correspondent Catherine Herridge reported in May 2014, citing sources, the White House had extremely detailed intelligence information about a group of Western hostages being held by ISIS, including Kayla. However, the White House sat on the intelligence for seven weeks before making a decision about a rescue attempt. By that time, ISIS had moved the hostages.

There was one attempt to rescue Kayla by Delta Force and Navy SEAL operators in July 2014, but it was unsuccessful.

News of Kayla's death surfaced in early February 2015. At first, the Islamic State claimed Kayla was killed in Jordanian airstrikes. However, just days later, ISIS privately emailed the Muellers three photos of Kayla's mutilated body to prove she was dead.

In a final ode to Kayla's life, the operation that killed al-Baghdadi was named in her honor.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/parents-of-aid-worker-killed-by-isis-rip-obama-praise-trump-after-al-baghdadi-death,2019-10-28
Nancy Pelosi calls federal officers 'stormtroopers'; Chuck Schumer says Trump order is un-American,"Democratic leaders used very strong terms when they decried the order by President Donald Trump to send federal troops to various U.S. cities to help quell violence from protests and rioting.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took turns condemning the action in a media briefing on Thursday.

""Police officers, any federal officers, have to have ID [stating] where they're from and what their name is, and more importantly if they go off federal property itself and patrol streets or anything else, they have to get the permission of the executive in charge, mayor or governor,"" Schumer said.

""President Trump always likes diversions,"" he continued. ""He's miserable failing at testing. He's miserable failing at contract tracing. He's miserable failing at getting the economy going. He's miserable failing on the greatest crisis that America has and the American people know it, so he tries a diversion.""

Pelosi used a term referring to the political militia of the Nazi regime when describing U.S. federal officers.

""It's very very important. The use of stormtroopers under the guise of law and order that is a tactic that is not appropriate to our country in any way,"" Pelosi said.

""It's so un-American what is happening,"" interrupted Schumer.

""It's so in keeping with Third-World countries and dictatorships, you haul someone off the streets, don't tell them who you are, why you're doing it, et cetera,"" he added.

""It's also unconstitutional,"" he concluded.

Schumer was referring to unmarked masked federal agents arresting people in the streets of Portland, Oregon, on the order of the president. One such incident was captured on video and spurred critics of the regime to compare the act to dictatorships where dissidents ""disappeared"" from the streets.

Others questioned the constitutional issues surrounding the order after some mayors and governors made public declarations against receiving aid from federal officers.

Pelosi faced criticism on social media when she used the same term on Friday to describe the federal officers.

""Unidentified stormtroopers. Unmarked cars. Kidnapping protesters and causing severe injuries in response to graffiti,"" tweeted Pelosi.

""These are not the actions of a democratic republic,"" she tweeted.



Not all local authorities refused the help. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she would coordinate local efforts with the federal officers after the president spoke to her personally on the phone.

"Pelosi sidesteps on Iranian protesters, citing 'different reasons why people are in the street'","In the wake of Iran's admission that the country shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, many of the Islamic republic's people have taken to the streets in protest of the regime. Video from the weekend's demonstrations show some people shouting ""death to the dictator , "" in reference to the ayatollah, and others refusing to step on U.S. and Israeli flags.



Back in Washington, however, Nancy Pelosi's response to the protests was entirely predictable, given how the Iran debate has gone over the last couple of weeks.

When asked whether or not she supports the anti-regime protests on ABC's ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, Pelosi felt it necessary to say that there were ""different reasons why people are in the street"" and tried to draw parallels between these protests and the demonstrations and the regime-backed funeral mourning that took place after the Soleimani strike earlier this month.

In contrast, President Trump warned the regime Sunday morning not to kill the protesters and reminded them that the world is watching in a record-breaking tweet, which is unfortunately necessary, given the fact that we're talking about a brutal, repressive dictatorship.

"Pelosi taps Liz Cheney for Jan. 6 committee. Despite GOP Leader McCarthy’s threats, Cheney accepts.","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday announced that she will appoint Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) to serve on the new select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to create the committee, which will combine the various House investigations into the events of Jan. 6 under one roof. Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), two of the most vocally anti-Trump Republicans, were the only GOP lawmakers to join Democrats in voting to establish the select committee.

""We are very honored and proud she has agreed to serve on the committee,"" Pelosi told reporters during her weekly news conference.

The committee will consist of eight lawmakers appointed by the speaker and five lawmakers nominated by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ""in consultation"" with Pelosi.

Pelosi said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) will serve as the chairman of the committee. Thompson was the Democratic architect of a deal struck with Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) to form a bipartisan investigation into the Jan. 6 riot, but that legislation died in the U.S. Senate. The other Democrats Pelosi tapped include Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), Stephanie Murphy (D-Calif.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), and Elaine Luria (D-Va.).

Cheney's inclusion on the committee is a finger in the eye to McCarthy and the rest of the GOP conference, who kicked her out of Republican leadership for her vocal criticism of former President Donald Trump. Cheney was the highest-profile Republican to vote to impeach Trump, whom she blamed for instigating the violence at the Capitol, claiming he ""summoned"" the rioters there and then ""lit the flame of this attack.""

In a statement, Cheney said she was ""honored"" to have been asked to join Pelosi's select committee.

""Congress is obligated to conduct a full investigation of the most serious attack on our Capitol since 1814. That day saw the most sacred space in our Republic overrun by an angry and violent mob attempting to stop the counting of electoral votes and threatening the peaceful transfer of power,"" she said.

""What happened on January 6th can never happen again. Those who are responsible for the attack need to be held accountable and this select committee will fulfill that responsibility in a professional, expeditious, and non-partisan manner.""

McCarthy led Republicans in opposition to creating the select committee after also opposing the failed bipartisan effort. He has not made any indication about who he intends to appoint to the select committee, and on Wednesday, he threatened to strip away the committee assignments of any Republican lawmaker who accepted an offer from Pelosi to join the Jan. 6 investigation.

The Democratic majority on the select committee is likely to seek details of McCarthy's Jan. 6 phone conversation with Trump as part of its investigation. McCarthy has accused the committee of being a ""partisan"" effort by Democrats and his threat to Republicans appears to be an effort to prevent any probe into his conversation of having the appearance of legitimate bipartisan inquiry.

Cheney was apparently unfazed by the threat, but given how she is reviled among Republican voters for opposing Trump, her presence is unlikely to persuade many that the investigation is anything but a political stunt.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-taps-liz-cheney-for-jan-6-committee,2021-07-01
"In apparent push to funnel planes to Ukraine, Poland says it is prepared to place MIG-29s at America's 'disposal,' but the US says the plan is not 'tenable'","Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Tuesday that the country is prepared to dispatch its fleet of MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, placing the aircraft at the American government's ""disposal.""

The proposal appears to be aimed at funneling the aircraft to Ukraine as that country seeks to repel Russian invaders — but the U.S. has indicated that it is not on board.

""The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the statement of Poland's minister of foreign affairs declared.



""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes. The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies – owners of MIG-29 jets – to act in the same vein,"" the statement added.



U.S. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby poured cold water on Poland's plan, saying that it is not ""tenable.""



""The prospect of fighter jets ""at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America"" departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said in a statement. ""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.""

According to Reuters, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Tuesday that ""any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis.""

""This is why we are ready to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because, as I said, we are not party to this war,"" Morawiecki said, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-pushes-back-after-poland-announces-plan-to-send-planes-to-ramstein,2022-03-09
Peter Doocy confronts Karine Jean-Pierre on her election-denying hypocrisy,"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy on Tuesday confronted White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on her past claims that the 2016 election was ""stolen"" after Democrats and President Joe Biden have tied election denial to ""fascism.""

As the November midterm elections approach, Biden has used increasingly incendiary rhetoric against so-called ""MAGA Republicans,"" accusing GOP officials who followed former President Donald Trump and challenged the results of the 2020 presidential election of embracing ""semi-fascism."" In a highly controversial prime-time speech last Thursday, Biden denounced Trumpism as ""extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.""

In remarks on Friday, Biden attempted to clarify what he meant, saying that he was not referring to Trump voters, but rather the failure of certain politicians to condemn the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, or ""failure to acknowledge when elections were won or lost.""

During Tuesday's press briefing, Jean-Pierre emphasized that Biden is not labeling GOP voters extremists, just the elected officials who represent their interests and beliefs.



""He has been very clear that he's talking about office-holders, he's talking about elected officials who have these MAGA, ultra-MAGA Republican agendas,"" she told reporters.

But Doocy questioned whether the president's remarks also apply to Democrats who falsely claimed the 2016 election was rigged by Russia in favor of Trump. ""If we're all in agreement that it is incorrect to say the 2020 election was stolen, what about the 2016 election?"" Doocy asked. But Jean-Pierre dodged the question.



""Look, I'm not going to go back to where we were or what happened in 2016. We're going to focus on the here and now, we're going to focus on what's happening today,"" she replied.

Doocy followed up with questions about Jean-Pierre's own statements. In December 2016, she tweeted, ""Stolen emails, stolen drone, stolen election. ... welcome to the world of #unpresidented Trump.""

And in 2019, Jean-Pierre denied that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) was the legitimate winner of the gubernatorial election against Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams, who alleged Republicans cheated with voter suppression and did not concede the race.

""Yes - the race was stolen,"" Jean-Pierre tweeted in response to someone who called the 2018 contest a ""stolen election."" She later said in April 2020 that Kemp ""stole the gubernatorial election from Georgians and Stacey Abrams.""

""With the new attention on the 'MAGA Republicans,' you tweeted in 2016, 'Trump stole an election,'"" Doocy said.



""Oh, I knew this was coming,"" Jean-Pierre interrupted, smiling and laughing. ""I was waiting, Peter, when you were going to ask me that question.""

""Well, great, here we go,"" Doocy said. ""You tweeted Trump stole an election. You tweeted Brian Kemp stole an election. If denying election results is extreme now, why wasn't it then?""

""So let's be really clear, that comparison that you made is just ridiculous,"" Jean-Pierre responded.

""I was talking specifically at that time of what was happening with voting rights and what was in danger of voting rights. That's what I was speaking to at the time,"" she continued. ""And here's the thing: I have said, Governor Kemp won the election in Georgia. I've been clear about that. I have said President Trump won the election of 2016, and I have been clear about that.""



Jean-Pierre seized on the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to draw a distinction between her false claims and those made by Trump, who she said ""incited"" an ""insurrection.""



""It was an attack on our democracy,"" she said. ""Let's not forget, people died that day. Law enforcement were attacked that day. That was the danger that we were seeing at the time. That's what the president has called out and that's what he's going to continue to call out.

""So yes, when you have MAGA Republicans, an extreme part of Republicans who just deny or do not want to really say what exactly happened on that day, or say it was a protest when it clearly was not a peaceful protest, that's not what we saw on that day, yes the president is going to call that out.""

Police haul man out of school board meeting about mask mandates for not wearing a mask,"Police had to physically remove a South Dakota man from a school board meeting Monday night because he refused to wear a mask. One of the primary topics of the meeting was public opposition to the district's mask mandate, according to the Mitchell Republic.

The man who refused to wear a mask was Reed Bender, who had reportedly attended meetings in the past and spoken against mask mandates. Bender would not put on a mask even though the district offered to provide him one. When Bender wouldn't comply, Superintendent Joe Graves called the police.

The Republic reported that Mitchell police officers arrived about 20 minutes later and attempted to speak with Bender to get him to wear a mask. Bender still refused, so the officers tried to physically remove him from the library where the meeting was being held.

Bender still wasn't ready to go without a fight and began resisting officers as other attendees urged him not to resist the officers, for fear of how the encounter might escalate. At one point during Bender's resistance, one officer pulled out his Taser, apparently on the verge of using it to subdue the uncooperative man.

""You're not going to tase me in front of all these people,"" Bender told the officer. ""I want people to video this while their cops, of minority descent, have to do this to everybody.""

Bender resisted a bit more after that, but the officers were able to restrain him and escort him out.

Wild night at the Mitchell school board meeting youtu.be

""Never in my entire career as a superintendent have I had that happen before,"" Graves told the Republic. ""The board said there is a masking mandate and everyone in the school building must wear a mask. We gave the gentleman fair warning of that and offered him a mask. He refused, so the board had to enforce the mandate.""



Bender was not arrested or charged with any crimes, but the Mitchell Police Division said the incident is still under investigation and a final decision has not yet been made.

Despite heavy public opposition in the district to the mask mandate, some school board members are steadfast on the matter.

""A survey wouldn't change my mind, the medical professionals have recommended (masks), and my wife cares for and has treated several patients who have had COVID-19,"" board member Kevin Kenkel said. ""She has seen the long-term effects on people. Even if 75% said we don't want masks, I would still vote in favor of masks.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-school-board-meeting-maskless-man,2020-09-15
Police shoot protester in Hong Kong as tensions rise on anniversary of Communist rule in China,"Police shot a protester in Hong Kong Tuesday as officers employed live rounds in an effort to control escalating pro-democracy demonstrations in the city on the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in mainland China, according to NBC News.

Hong Kong officials reported that at least 31 people were injured Tuesday, with two of them in critical condition and one in serious condition.

The shooting victim was an 18-year-old male who was shot at approximately arms-length distance in the chest near the left shoulder during an altercation with police. He was conscious as he was transported to the hospital. Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu said the lives of the officers ""were under serious threat"" during the confrontation.

Video shows the protester swinging a baton at the officer before being shot:

Protesters aimed bricks and molotov cocktails at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons, turning the streets of the Chinese financial hub into a dangerous battleground. Police accused protesters of attacking them with ""corrosive fluid,"" posting pictures of an officer who allegedly was hit with it.

""Rioters have used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun area, injuring multiple Police officers and reporters,"" read a tweet by Hong Kong police. ""The Police strongly condemn the violent acts and appeal to members of the public to mind their personal safety.""



Protests in Hong Kong have been occurring since March in response to the proposal of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation bill, which would have created an extradition agreement with other jurisdictions, including Taiwan and mainland China. Protesters fear the encroachment of mainland China into Hong Kong affairs.

Protests began in March and escalated sharply over the summer, with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators participating. The bill was suspended in June and eventually withdrawn on Sept. 4, but Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has resisted other protester demands, which include the release of protesters who have been arrested, the opening of an independent inquiry into police brutality, a retraction of the official designation of the protests as riots, universal suffrage, and Lam's own resignation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-shoot-protester-in-hong-kong-on-anniversary-of-communist-rule-in-china,2019-10-01
French police launch terror investigation after knife attack near Charlie Hebdo's former office,"Police are investigating a knife attack that took place near the former Paris offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the site of a 2015 radical Islamist terror attack, CNN reported Friday.

The stabbing occurred Friday morning and has left two individuals seriously injured, police said. The victims are said to be employees of the French documentary production company Premières Lignes. They are in serious condition but are expected to survive.

The attack comes as a long-awaited trial unfolds of 14 people accused of assisting the two gunmen, brothers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, in their attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices nearly five years ago.

Shortly after the attack, an unidentified suspect was arrested near Place de la Bastille, and as of Friday afternoon, two suspects were being held by police.

""The main perpetrator has been arrested and is currently in police custody, the second individual was placed in custody for his relations with the main perpetrator,"" Jean-François Ricard, France's anti-terror prosecutor, said.

A terror investigation has been launched

French prosecutors have reportedly opened a terrorism investigation due to the attack's proximity to the 2015 terror attack, which took the lives of 12 people and injured 11 others, and its timing in relation to the current trial.

Ricard added that the two victims were on a cigarette break when they were attacked.

According to CNN, Premières Lignes' founder, Paul Moreira, told BFM TV that it ""all happened very quickly"" and that ""a few blows were given to the two people in front of the office"" by an attacker wielding some ""sort of cleaver.""

The company's director, Luc Hermann, criticized what he described as a ""total absence of protection of this building since the attacks on Charlie Hebdo.""

""We're journalists. Our job is to inform, not to get attacked like this morning,"" he added.

Following the incident, Charlie Hebdo tweeted out ""support and solidarity"" to its ""neighbors and colleagues at [Premières Ligne] and to those affected by this heinous attack.""

Earlier this week, the magazine's head of human resources, Marika Bret, was forced to flee her home forever as a result of ""precise and detailed"" death threats.

As the trial loomed, the magazine decided to republish the Mohammed cartoons that sparked the original attack.

""Since the start of the trial and with the republication of the cartoons, we have received all kinds of horrors, including threats from al-Qaeda and calls to finish the work of the [gunmen from the 2015 attack],"" Bret told Le Point magazine.

"Polish national team refuses to play Russia in the World Cup playoffs, Swedish and Czech teams also boycott","Poland’s national soccer team is refusing to play Russia in a 2022 World Cup playoff match in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.



The president of the Polish football association, Cezary Kulesza, said that the Polish national team “does not intend” to participate in the playoff match, the BBC reported.

In a joint statement, members of the Polish team said, “We, the players of the Polish national team, together with the Polish Football Association, decided that as a result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, we do intend to play in the playoff match against Russia.”

“It is not an easy decision,” the statement continued, “But there are more important things in life than football. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian nation.”

Polish footballer Robert Lewandowksi said, “It is the right decision! I can’t imagine playing a march with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can’t pretend that nothing is happening.”

Cezary Kulesza, the current president of the Polish Football Association, said, “Due to the escalation of the aggression of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine the Polish national team does not intend to play the play-off match against Russia.”



Polish President Andrezj Duda replied to Kulesza’s statement saying, “Rightly so, Mr. President. You don’t play with bandits!”



Poland’s Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, also chimed in saying, “You cannot play a match against Russia under such circumstances … Thank you so much for this decision.”

National teams from Sweden and the Czech Republic joined Poland in a joint statement.

The Swedish and Czech teams are to play each other in a playoff match and whichever team wins would likely advance to play the Russian team in the World Cup tournament.

The Swedish team said on Twitter that they “will not play against Russia – regardless of where the match is played.” In a statement, the team said, “The Federal Board also urges FIDA to cancel the playoff matches in March in which Russia participates.”

On Saturday, Roman Abramovich, Russian billionaire and owner of the Chelsea Football Club, handed over the “stewardship and care” of the Premier League club to the trustees of its charitable foundation. Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, forfeited ownership of the team after the British parliament pressured him to do so in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Associated Press reported.



Abramovich said, “I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/polish-national-team-refuses-to-play-russia-in-the-world-cup-playoffs-swedish-and-czech-teams-also-boycott,2022-02-26
Poll: Only 16% of Americans say US democracy is working,"Most Americans are feeling pessimistic about the state of democracy in their country, according to a new poll conducted by the Associated Press.

Only 16% of Americans surveyed said that democracy is working well or extremely well in the United States, a sentiment shared by individuals of all political persuasions. Almost half of Americans, 45%, think that democracy isn't functioning properly. A little more than a third, 38%, say democracy is working only somewhat well.

According to the Associated Press, the poll's findings are ""broadly consistent with how Americans graded democracy before the election,"" however there was a noticeable partisan swing in views about democracy since the 2020 election.

Last October, 68% of self-identified Republicans said democracy was working at least somewhat well. After the election, though, only 36% of Republicans felt that way. Conversely, in October, just 37% of Democrats believed democracy was working at least somewhat well, but after Joe Biden won the election, that number increased to 70%.

In other words, when Donald Trump was president, most Republicans believed democracy was at least partially working, while most Democrats disagreed, and after Joe Biden won, most Republicans thought democracy wasn't working, but Democrats were more optimistic.

Roughly two-thirds of Americans say Joe Biden is the legitimately elected president, but only one-third of Republicans believe the election was legitimate, according to the survey.

The Associated Press report blames former President Donald Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen for at least in part eroding Republicans trust in the election:

But Democrats and the mainstream media are not without blame either.

In the wake of the 2016 election and Trump's surprise win, many Democrats advanced claims that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton. The mainstream media in 2017 spread a misleading story that ""Russian government cyber actors"" attempted to hack the 2016 election results. A poll conducted in 2018 found that 67% of Democrats believed that ""Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get Donald Trump elected."" Further, the 2018 Georgia Democratic candidate for governor, Stacey Abrams, never conceded the election to her Republican opponent Brian Kemp, the legitimately elected governor, whom Abrams accused of engaging in voter suppression tactics to win.

Both political parties have criticized the electoral system in America when it was politically convenient to do so. Perhaps that's why so many Americans have doubts about their democracy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-only-16-of-americans-say-u-s-democracy-is-working,2021-02-08
Sec. of State Pompeo determines China’s crimes against Uyghurs amount to ‘genocide’,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has determined that China's ""morally repugnant"" treatment of the predominantly Muslim Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in the country's Xinjiang region amounts to ""crimes against humanity"" and ""genocide.""

Pompeo made the official determination in a State Department news release Tuesday, just one day before President-elect Joe Biden's administration assumes power.

""After careful examination of the available facts, I have determined that since at least March 2017, the People's Republic of China (PRC), under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has committed crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang,"" Pompeo wrote in the news release.

""These crimes are ongoing and include: the arbitrary imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty of more than one million civilians, forced sterilization, torture of a large number of those arbitrarily detained, forced labor, and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement,"" he continued.

""In addition, after careful examination of the available facts, I have determined that the PRC, under the direction and control of the CCP, has committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang,"" Pompeo added. ""I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state.""

On Tuesday during his confirmation hearing, Biden's pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he agreed with Pompeo's determination that China is committing ""genocide.""

Starting in 2017, reliable reports of ethnic cleansing and forced sterilization of Uighurs in Xinjiang started spreading, but Chinese officials continued to deny the accusations and hindered international observers from accessing the region.

Last summer, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 13 tons of human hair from China that the agency said pointed to ""potential human right abuses of forced child labor and imprisonment"" of the Uighur population.

Also last summer, even after being confronted with damning and disturbing drone footage showing hundreds of Uighurs with shaved heads being led bound and blindfolded onto trains by soldiers, the Chinese ambassador to the U.K. still denied claims of ethnic cleansing.

The determination from the State Department is the strongest denunciation made by any country regarding China's actions and the latest in a series of blows the Trump administration has dealt against China of late. The move may also open the door to stricter sanctions against China under the Biden administration.

Pompeo names Weingarten as 'most dangerous person',"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten the ""most dangerous"" individual on the planet, accusing teachers' unions of pushing ""filth"" on children.

""I tell the story often — I get asked 'Who's the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping?' The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten,"" Pompeo said, according to Semafor. ""It's not a close call. If you ask, 'Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?' It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don't know math and reading or writing.""



""If our kids don't grow up understanding America is an exceptional nation, we're done. If they think it's an oppressor class and an oppressed class, if they think the 1619 Project, and we were founded on a racist idea — if those are the things people entered the seventh grade deeply embedded in their understanding of America, it's difficult to understand how Xi Jinping's claim that America is in decline won't prove true,"" Pompeo said, according to the outlet.

Weingarten has retweeted a post that claimed ""it's crucial to teach queer history"" amid ""#LGBTQIA+ History Month, AND the rest of the year, too.""

Weingarten noted that she was unsure whether to describe Pompeo's characterization of her ""as ridiculous or dangerous.""

""So Mike, let me make it easy for you. We fight for freedom, democracy, and an economy that works for all. We fight for what kids & communities need. Strong public schools that are safe and welcoming, where kids learn how to think & work with others. That's the American Dream!"" Weingarten asserted. ""And we fight against this kind of rhetoric and hate. Maybe spend a minute in one of the classrooms with my members and their students and you will get a real lesson in the promise and potential of America,"" she added.

Pompeo served as the CIA director during part of former President Donald Trump's tenure before moving on to serve as secretary of state — Pompeo had previously served as a lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives. Now, he's considering the possibility of running for president.

""I haven't decided whether I'm going to run, and my decision whether to run doesn't depend on what lane I'm in or who else gets in the race. I've been at this for decades. The central thesis of the conservative movement is deeply embedded in my DNA, and I care about it. I think it makes America better. I think it makes life for families better,"" Pompeo said, according to Semafor.

"President Trump follows lead of Ted Cruz, announces possibility of designating Antifa terrorist org","President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he is considering designating Antifa a ""major"" terrorist organization.

""Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!"" the president tweeted.

Trump's announcement comes just days after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called on Attorney General William Barr to launch an investigation into Antifa under the RICO Act, a prosecutorial tool typically reserved for toppling organized crime.

""I write to urge you to open an organized crime investigation into Antifa, a left-wing anarchist terrorist organization that routinely relies on violence to intimidate and punish its political opponents,"" Cruz wrote to Barr.

""Our Republic depends on free and open participation in the political process. These acts of brazen political violence and intimidation strike at the heart of that process. Given your commitment to the rule of law, I hope you will respond to Antifa's organized criminal activity, and [Portland] Mayor Ted Wheeler's refusal to protect Portland's citizens from that activity, with all speed and vigilance,"" he said.

Antifa, a far-left organization, has become a household name in recent years due to the group's brazen use of violence against those with whom the group disagrees.

The assault of journalist Andy Ngo brought renewed scrutiny to the group last month after Ngo was brutally injured at a Portland rally, resulting in a brain bleed.

In addition to calling for Antifa to be investigated under the RICO Act, Cruz, along with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), introduced a non-binding resolution this month that would classify violent Antifa protesters as ""domestic terrorist.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-trump-follows-lead-of-ted-cruz-announces-possibility-of-designating-antifa-terrorist-org,2019-07-27
"President Trump must turn over tax returns to NY prosecutors, federal appeals court rules","A federal appeals court ruled Monday that President Donald Trump must turn over eight years of personal and corporate tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance had formerly subpoenaed the tax documents from Trump's accounting firm as part of an investigation into payments made pre-election to porn star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, two women who alleged having affairs with Trump, and reimbursements made to Michael Cohen, Trump's ex-attorney who is now serving a three-year federal prison sentence for campaign finance violations, among other crimes.

Trump lost the initial case before a federal district court on Oct. 7 before making his appeal to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.

According to NBC News, Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow said he would appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

""The decision of the Second Circuit will be taken to the Supreme Court,"" Sekulow said. ""The issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our Republic. The constitutional issues are significant.""

The Trump legal team's major argument is that Trump should be granted presidential immunity, previously writing in attempt to block the subpoena that a sitting president can not be criminally investigated.

The three-judge panel that made its ruling Monday did not take an explicit opinion on the Trump team's argument of presidential immunity. Instead, they claimed that the since the subpoena was directed at the president's accounting firm, and not the president himself, that presidential immunity does not apply.

""We emphasize again the narrowness of the issue before us. This appeal does not require us to consider whether the president is immune from indictment and prosecution while in office, nor to consider whether the president may lawfully be ordered to produce documents for use in a state criminal proceeding,"" an excerpt from the decision said, according to the New York Times.

The presidential immunity argument has never been tested in court. But with Monday's decision and Trump's resolve to take the case to the Supreme Court, the question actually may be resolved in due time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-trump-must-turn-over-tax-returns-to-ny-prosecutors-federal-appeals-court-rules,2019-11-04
Viral 'nodding lady' from Trump town hall says her employees are getting hate mail because she supports the president,"The woman who went viral for sitting behind President Donald Trump and vigorously nodding in agreement during a nationally televised town hall last week says her employees have been receiving hateful messages since the Oct. 15 event.

Mayra Joli, a Miami immigration lawyer and former independent candidate for Congress, became known on social media as the ""nodding lady"" after clips of her enthusiastic support for President Trump during an NBC News town hall last Thursday were widely shared.



In an interview with Fox News, Joli, herself an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, described how she and her employees at her law firm have been receiving hateful messages because of her support for Trump.

""Nobody can call an employer to fire me,"" Joli said. ""What they're doing is calling my employees so they quit.""

""They start sending other [messages] saying, 'I can't believe you're working for that person. I thought you were better,'"" she added. ""I am a fighter, but [my employees] have a private life. They aren't used to this commotion.""



Her law firm has also been targeted in online reviews, Fox News reports, with several people leaving one-star reviews without comment.



Joli said the negative attention doesn't bother her and that she'd support President Trump even if no one supported her.



""Somebody's going to see that review, then see the career I've led helping people, so I don't need that client,"" Joli said.



She said her own experiences as an immigrant inspired her to help others through the naturalization process to become American citizens. Though Trump was elected in 2016 on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigration, Joli says she tells her clients that their problems with immigration aren't the president's fault. She also said that since Trump was elected more illegal immigrants have come to her for help legalizing their immigration status.

""They were coming to me, telling me, 'I want to fix my situation because of Donald Trump.' I told them, 'No, you want to fix your situation because of you.' The fact that Donald Trump is the president means nothing because with or without Donald Trump ... nothing will change. It just prolongs your agony. You have to find a way to fix it, and that's why attorneys are there,"" she said.

""With Donald Trump, he showed people they have to carry their own weight; they have to make themselves responsible for their pasts, their presents and their futures,"" she added. ""The clientele, now, is more proactive.""

Joli said she came to support Trump in 2016 after previously supporting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The constant attacks on Trump made her curious about what he really had to say.

""The more they trashed him, the more I wanted to find out more about him, and I've been supporting him since. The rest is history,"" Joli said. ""Donald Trump taught me that I cannot just be silent, and I have to think for myself.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-trump-nodding-lady-hate-mail,2020-10-21
Pro-Trump students ordered to leave campus over MAGA banner. Principal caught on video saying carrying banner is 'disrespectful.',"A handful of students at an Arizona public high school on Friday decided to wear outfits supporting President Donald Trump to celebrate ""Party in the USA"" day as part of Perry High School's Spirit Week — and a Trump ""Make America Great Again"" banner made the trip as well.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

And that all soon spelled trouble at the Gilbert school.

What happened?

Parents told the Arizona Republic that school administrators demanded their children remove their pro-Trump clothing and accessories — but a Chandler Unified School District spokesman on Monday said students weren't asked to put away any Trump gear other than the banner.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Principal Dan Serrano said in a statement to KSAZ-TV that during lunch ""students carrying political signage caused a disruption and created safety concern. The students were asked to put away the signage and they complied. However, after school ended for the day, the students unveiled the signage again in a manner that again caused concern for student safety. When the school's Resource Officer asked the students to leave campus, they declined. They also refused to respond to my request to provide their names and school identification when I sought to interview them.""

Principal tells mother that students carrying Trump banner is 'disrespectful'

One mother, Jennifer Farris, told the Republic she drove to the school after hearing her kids were being asked to remove the pro-Trump clothing — and that within four minutes of walking into the office, school officials ordered her to leave and that she wouldn't be allowed on campus again.

""As soon as they realized I was protecting my daughter, they were immediately rude, dismissive, and told me to get off the property,"" Farris told the paper.

Farris added to the Republic that she was told officials deemed the Trump gear ""offensive"" and that students could face sanctions for non-compliance.

Check out the video of Farris arguing with Serrano, the school principal. At one point he said students carrying the pro-Trump banner was ""disrespectful"" and that — seemingly to back up his assertion — he ""has a kid in the Army"":

A school district spokesman told the Republic in separate story that the issue with the banner ""was related to the interactions it was causing, not that carrying a flag in itself was disrespectful.""

""I'm infuriated,"" Farris told KSAZ. ""I feel like they don't support our president, and they are inflicting those thoughts on our kids.""

Alleged office interrogation



Heidi Jones, a mother of one of the students in question, told the Republic that students gathered outside after school to take photos wearing their pro-Trump gear and holding the banner — and then noticed the resource officer taking photos of them without their permission. When the officer asked her freshman daughter Logan for her name, Jones told the Republic her daughter refused and asked why he needed her name.

Jones told the paper that the officer told her daughter she'd been a part of a disruption all day, no one was allowed to have a Trump banner, and to go the school office. Jones added to the Republic that administrators in the office asked for her daughter's name but that her daughter refused to answer questions until her mother arrived.

Once at the office 10 minutes later, Jones told the paper she learned her daughter got suspended for 10 days.

""She came here today to support America, which is what your Spirit Day is all about,"" Jones told the Republic. ""And now that she has refused to give her name, you're suspending her after she's complied with everything else?""

Part of the principal's statement to KSAZ noted that ""information circulating about student discipline is incorrect, but the District is unable to correct the record due to federal privacy laws relating to disclosure of student information"" and that it's ""false"" that students were being ""disciplined for expressing their political viewpoints or wearing political attire.""

The station said the district confirmed that Logan Jones was suspended but ""for a different reason."" Logan told KSAZ she plans to apologize to school staff for being defiant.

Arizona GOP lawmakers want action

Amid a pro-Trump protest outside Perry High School on Monday morning over how officials handed the controversy, KPHO-TV reported that Arizona Republican lawmakers sent a letter to state Attorney General Mark Brnovich asking him to look into possible free speech violations at the school.

The letter was signed by 26 GOP members of the Arizona House of Representatives, the Republic said.

Brnovich spokesman Ryan Anderson told the paper the situation is being evaluated in regard to what jurisdiction the state might have and that students' free speech is taken seriously.

""We received the letter,"" Anderson told the Republic. ""We'll look at all of the facts. We just don't know enough about the situation right now.""

Protesters object to Chinese flag being raised at Boston City Hall Plaza to mark the 70th anniversary of China's Communist regime,"A Chinese flag was raised at Boston City Hall Plaza on Sunday to mark the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in China, but not all Bostonians were happy with the move.

What happened?

Boston City Hall Plaza is an open space outside of the actual City Hall. On Sunday, the Chinese Progressive Association organized the raising of the Chinese flag in order to celebrate ""National Day,"" and the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in China.

This anniversary marks a particularly bloody period in Chinese history. At least 45 million people were killed by regime founder Mao Zedong during a four-year period as he established his government in China. The Chinese government has also attempted to crush groups it views as not being in line with its vision for China, including Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities.

Lhadon Tethong, director of the Tibet Action Institute, told WHDH-TV at a protest Sunday that she objected to the move since the Chinese flag ""stands for none of the values that this country was founded on."" Protesters included supporters of Tibet, Hong Kong, and the Uighur people who are all targeted by the Chinese government.

But Suzanne Lee, the founder and president emeritus of the city's Chinese Progressive Association, said the event was important to encourage the American and Chinese people to ""learn from each other and understand each other better to promote a more peaceful world.""

Meanwhile, the Chinese government is preparing for National Day by reportedly doubling the number of military troops in Hong Kong, to prevent the pro-democracy protesters in that semi-autonomous region from causing too much trouble for the regime during the celebrations. Hong Kong citizens have been protesting for months in an attempt to get China to institute democratic reforms.



This isn't the first time that the current Chinese flag, or Chinese Progressive Flag, has been raised in Boston City Hall Plaza. It has been raised within a few days of National Day for years.

According to the City Hall Plaza website, a raising of the pre-Communist takeover Republic of China flag was held at the plaza on Oct. 7, 2017, but no such event seems to be scheduled for this year.

What else?

Two months ago, a group sued the city of Boston for not allowing it to raise an interdenominational Christian flag at the same site.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/protesters-object-to-chinese-flag-being-raised-at-boston-city-hall-plaza,2019-09-30
Putin declares military invasion of Ukraine,"Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, announced a military invasion of Ukraine at about 5 a.m. Thursday local time.

He had previously said on Monday that Russia would recognize the independence of two regions where pro-Russian troops had held a presence for years.

In a video announcement, Putin claimed that the military operation was to demilitarize Ukraine because of the threat of it joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""All responsibility for the possible bloodletting will be on the conscience of the current Ukrainian regime,"" said Putin according to one translation. ""Truth and strength are on our side.""

He went on to claim that it was not Russia's intention to occupy the country.

Those comments are in contrast to his previous statements that Ukraine was an invention of Russia and his lamentations that the old Soviet republics should not have been allowed to leave Russia.

President Joe Biden issued a statement from the White House after the announcement from Putin.

""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" wrote Biden.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,"" he continued.

""The world will hold Russia accountable,"" Biden added.

He had previously called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but also ordered economic and financial sanctions against Russian leaders in response to the aggression against Ukraine.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament voted to ease gun restrictions in order to allow their citizens to arm up ahead of the expected attack.

CNN's Matthew Chance said that he could hear loud explosions near Kyiv, the capitol of Ukraine, just minutes after the announcement from Putin.

Here's more about the crisis in Ukraine:

"Putin orders 'peacekeeping' troops to invade Ukraine, US to respond with sanctions","Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, ordered an invasion of Ukraine on Monday after declaring the ""independence"" of two separatist regions of the country.

Russia has accused Ukraine of oppressing Russian-speaking populations in Donetsk and Luhansk, two regions in southeastern Ukraine. Putin on Monday said Russia would send ""peacekeeping"" troops into the separatist areas, which critics say is a brazen excuse to invade a sovereign neighbor state.

Russian-backed rebels in regions of Ukraine have called for separation since 2014, but in recent months Russia has placed more than 150,000 troops on its border with the country. In response, Ukrainian citizens have armed themselves in anticipation of the expected invasion.

A senior Biden administration official reportedly told journalists that Russia sending ""peacekeeping"" troops into Ukraine didn't necessarily constitute an invasion.

""We will observe and assess what actions Russia actually takes and respond,"" the official said.

Biden also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call after the announcement from Putin.

President Joe Biden has warned that the United States would hit Russia with punitive economic sanctions if they invaded. Those sanctions are expected to be announced on Tuesday.

The United States agreed to defend Ukraine in 1994 after the country agreed to dismantle more than 5,000 nuclear weapons left over from the fall of the Soviet Union.

Putin has reiterated many times his belief that the fall of the Soviet Union was the worst geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. In his speech Monday, he said it was ""madness"" that former Soviet republics were allowed to leave the USSR.

"Putin recognizes independence of Ukrainian rebel regions, moving toward war","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday announced in a televised address that Russia will recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine — defying Western governments and further escalating a situation that could erupt into war.

""I deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago - to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic,"" Putin said, referring to areas where fighting has broken out between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian government forces.

Western officials have warned that Russia may use conflict in these regions as a pretext to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The announcement comes after Putin informed Germany and France of his decision, which was received with ""disappointment,"" the Kremlin said Monday according to Reuters. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Putin's decision to recognize the two separatist regions in Ukraine was ""plainly in breach of international law.""

""It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine,” Johnson added, according to the Guardian.

In a rambling, at times angry speech, Putin lamented the fall of the Soviet Union, twisted history, and essentially denied Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state.

""Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia, more precisely, Bolshevik, communist Russia,"" Putin inaccurately claimed, asserting that the country ""never had a tradition of genuine statehood.""

Putin characterized the current government of Ukraine as a corrupt oligarchy and accused western governments of supporting a violent coup d'état against the old pro-Russian government in 2014. He leveled numerous accusations against the Ukrainian government, claiming there is a ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people taking place in Donetsk and Lugansk and that Ukraine is attempting to develop nuclear weapons that pose a threat to Russian national security. He further claimed that Russia has ancient connections to territory in eastern Ukraine and that the Russian-speaking people there support independence

The Russian president also alleged that attempts by Ukraine to join NATO pose a threat to Russian national security, and that the United States' threat of sanctions in response to an invasion of Ukraine were policies designed to ""limit the development of Russia.""



""Russia has the duty to take all necessary measures to protect our security, which is what we'll do,"" said Putin.

As Putin delivered that ominous message, an estimated 150,000 Russian troops have amassed on three sides of Ukraine's eastern border. President Joe Biden on Friday said he is ""convinced"" that Russia has already decided to invade, including an assault on Ukraine's capital Kyiv.



By recognizing two independent states in eastern Ukraine, Russia has created an excuse to deploy troops there. The separatists do not hold all of the territory they claim. Should they request assistance from the Russian military, Putin will claim an invasion is an intervention to protect independent Russian allies from Ukraine's alleged tyranny. Analysts expect Russia to send ""peacekeeper"" forces into the area, Axios reported.

Though Russia has repeatedly denied having a desire to invade, it has claimed Ukraine is preparing for a major military offensive in the east, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials say is not true. Russia claimed on Monday that it killed five Ukrainian troops crossing the border, which Ukraine denied and which the U.S. said was one of several ""transparent, hackneyed plots to justify an invasion.""

Following Putin's speech, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the United Nations security council to ""discuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine.""

"Radio host Dean Obeidallah claims 'The GOP is a white supremacist, fascist movement that has rejected democracy and embraced both autocracy and violence'","Dean Obeidallah, who hosts an eponymous radio program on SiriusXM called ""The Dean Obeidallah Show,"" is drawing a comparison between the GOP and Nazis.

""If you ever wondered what it felt like to live in 1930's Germany, you're getting a sense of it today. The GOP is a white supremacist, fascist movement that has rejected democracy and embraced both autocracy and violence. Today's GOP is how democracies die,"" Obeidallah tweeted.

""Reading Winston Churchill's book 'The Gathering Storm' about the rise of Nazi Germany. As he notes there were numerous times the world could've stopped the rise of the Nazis but instead simply hoped for the best.

South Carolina considers bill to require colleges and universities to teach America's founding documents,"Lawmakers in South Carolina are nearing passage of a bill that would require all public college and university students in the state to study America's founding documents. While the legislation has broad support, some Democrats in the state House opposed the bill in committee, referring to it as ""indoctrination"" and suggesting that requiring schools to offer a course that teaches the U.S. Constitution and other documents is just ""blowing smoke.""

Senate Bill 38, the ""Reinforcing College Education on America's Constitutional Heritage Act"", or REACH Act, was introduced in the state Senate by Sen. Larry Grooms (R-Berkeley) to reform state education law. The bill would require all South Carolina public college students to take a three-credit hour class on American history, American government, or an equivalent course that requires at minimum reading the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, and the Emancipation Proclamation.

Grooms' bill would update and modernize existing state law that requires institutions of higher learning to teach a yearlong course on America's founding documents, a law that the bill's supporters say is largely not enforced. The existing law, which is 97 years old, mandates that students complete a ""one year"" class on America's founding documents and be examined on their ""loyalty"" to the United States.

The REACH Act would shorten the course requirement from one year to three credit hours, remove the ""loyalty"" provision — which is problematic for foreign students — and empower the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to enforce the law.

The bill passed the state Senate in March in an unanimous roll call vote of 45-0. It will be considered in the state House as early as Wednesday this week after advancing through committee on March 16 over the objections of some Democrats.

State Rep. Michael Rivers (D-St. Helena Island) was one of the House Democrats who opposed the bill. Calling it ""indoctrination,"" Rivers said, ""we talk about America being built on God ... but until there's repentance there's no forgiveness of sins. And we can write the Federalist Papers, we can write whatever we want. But until there's some acknowledgement about the sins of the past we are just whistlin' Dixie.""

Rivers suggested that requiring students to read the Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, and other documents could perpetuate ""falsehoods"" about American history that could lead to ""1861 again in South Carolina.""

""This stuff in S. 38, what it's saying, is that we want to indoctrinate college students on their dime to what we think is important,"" Rivers said. ""It's just blowing smoke.""

State Rep. Garry Smith (R-Greenville), the REACH Act's chief sponsor in the House, told TheBlaze in an interview Monday that studying America's founding documents will ultimately make South Carolina students better citizens.



""An idea of liberty for all, that whole idea in the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, those things are found in the Constitution. It flows, it goes together, it was meant to do that. And when we're looking at education in the United States and in South Carolina, we're looking at education to build good citizens who can function in our representative republic,"" said Smith, who is an affiliate professor of political science at North Greenville University.

By reading America's founding documents, he explained, students will be taught the ideas and principles that animate American government, ideas like federalism — how state governments have some powers under the Constitution that the national government must not infringe upon.

""We're in such danger right now of losing these ideas because you've got a Congress and an administration in Washington, D.C., that is looking to take those rights that under the Constitution were reserved for the states and for the people and make them federal rights. That's completely contrary to what's intended,"" Smith said.

""When you have citizens that don't understand that liberty for all — and they're thinking about equity instead of equality, and dividing us instead of uniting us, then we've got a real problem,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reach-act,2021-04-06
"NYPD officer arrested, charged with spying for Chinese government","A New York City police officer and U.S. Army reservist was arrested on Monday, accused of spying on behalf of the Chinese government for the past several years.

What are the details?

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced that Officer Baimadajie Angwang, 33, was arrested for ""acting as an illegal agent of the People's Republic of China as well as committing wire fraud, making false statements and obstructing an official proceeding.""

Federal authorities claim that Angwang, a naturalized U.S. citizen and ethnic Tibetan native to China, ""allegedly acted at the direction and control of officials at the PRC Consulate in New York City"" since ""at least 2014,"" using his position to spy at the behest of China while serving at the NYPD's community affairs unit.

CNBC reported that Angwang was born in the autonomous region of Tibet, and used his position as an officer to report back to Chinese officials ""on the activities of other ethnic Tibetans in the New York area.""

The New York Post reported that according to court documents, Angwang ""stated that his motivation to be promoted in the NYPD was to assist the PRC and bring ""glory to China,"" and that if he was not able to be promoted within the department, ""he stated that 'he might as well be a government employee in China.'""

Officer accused of lying on military form

Angwang is also accused of lying in order to obtain secret clearance as a member of the military.

The Department of Justice news release noted:

As part of his employment with the U.S. Army Reserve, Angwang maintained a ""SECRET""-level security clearance. According to court documents, in 2019, Angwang completed and electronically submitted an SF-86C form for a background investigation. On the form, Angwang lied by denying that he had contacts with a foreign government or its consulate and by denying that he had close and continuing contacts with foreign nationals, including his family members who live in the PRC, some of whom are affiliated with the People's Liberation Army.

""The defendant allegedly violated the trust of his community and the New York City Police Department on behalf of a foreign power, the People's Republic of China,"" Assistant FBI Director Alan E. Kohler said in a statement. ""This type of conduct simply cannot be tolerated. This case serves as yet another reminder that China represents the biggest counterintelligence threat to the United States and that the FBI and our partners will be aggressive in investigating and stopping such activities within our nation.""

"Report: Israel suspected in large explosion at Iranian nuclear site, a 'severe blow' that may prevent uranium enrichment there for rest of 2021","Israel is suspected of being behind a large explosion at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment site Sunday, which resulted in a blackout and the complete destruction of its power system. It could prevent the facility from enriching uranium for the rest of year, the New York Times reported, citing anonymous intelligence officials.

What are the details?

The Times cited two officials who described a classified Israeli operation that dealt a ""severe blow"" to Iran's ability to enrich uranium — and that it could take at least nine months to restore Natanz's production.



Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, called it an act of ""nuclear terrorism"" and said the international community must confront the threat, the paper reported.

""The action this morning against the Natanz enrichment site shows the defeat of those who oppose our country's nuclear and political development and the significant gains of our nuclear industry,"" Salehi said, according to Times, which cited Iranian news media. ""The incident shows the failure of those who oppose Iran negotiating for sanctions relief.""

The act also ""injected new uncertainty into diplomatic efforts that began last week to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal repudiated by the Trump administration,"" the paper noted.

More from the Times:

Iran did not say precisely what had caused the blackout at the heavily fortified site, which has been a target of previous sabotage, and Israel publicly declined to confirm or deny any responsibility. But American and Israeli intelligence officials said there had been an Israeli role. [...]



It was not immediately clear how much advance word — if any — the Biden administration received about the Natanz operation, which happened on the same morning that the American defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, was visiting Israel. But Israeli officials have made no secret of their unhappiness over Mr. Biden's desire to revive the nuclear agreement that his predecessor renounced in 2018.

The talks to salvage the nuclear agreement — i.e., Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — are set to resume this week, the paper added.

'Sabotage and infiltration'

Malek Shariati Niasar, an Iranian lawmaker and spokesman for the Parliament's energy committee, said on Twitter that the outage was ""very suspicious"" and raised the possibility of ""sabotage and infiltration,"" the Times reported.

More from the paper:

Some Iranian experts dismissed initial speculation that a cyberattack could have caused the power loss. The Natanz complex has its own power grid, multiple backup systems and layers of security protection intended to stop such an attack from abruptly shutting down its system.



""It's hard to imagine that it was a cyberattack,"" said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. ""The likely scenario is that it either targeted the facility indirectly or through physical infiltration."" The intelligence officials said it was indeed a detonation of explosives.

What else has gone down?

Iranian military leaders threatened Israel following mysterious explosions at Iranian nuclear and military sites last year, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

""We warn the Zionist liars and their puppeteers that if they continue their prattle, they will see the upper hand of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the resistance front in action,"" Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi was quoted as saying in the country's state-controlled press, the Free Beacon said.

In November Iran claimed one of its top nuclear scientists was assassinated with Israeli involvement. The Israeli government believed Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the mastermind directing Iran's nuclear weapons program in the early 2000s.

Immediately following Fakhrizadeh's death, the New York Times was blasted for calling Iran's nuclear program ""peaceful.""

In December Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he had ""no doubt"" that then-President-elect Joe Biden will ""bow"" to Iran and rejoin the nuclear deal.

Indeed, the Biden administration in February said it was ready to begin talks with Iran to rejoin the deal.

WHO chief warns worst of COVID-19 pandemic is 'yet to come',"The head of the World Health Organization warned Monday that despite months of governments battling the coronavirus pandemic, ""the worst is yet to come.""

What are the details?

During a virtual news conference, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""Six months ago, none of us could have imagined how our world — and our lives — would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus. We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is this is not even close to being over.

""Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,"" he continued. ""We're all in this for the long haul.""

Tedros went on to encourage unity as the pandemic continues to drag on, urging, ""We will need even greater stores of resiliency, patience, humility and generosity in the months ahead. We have already lost so much — but we cannot lose hope.""

The WHO chief added, ""The worst is yet to come. I'm sorry to say that.""

CBS News reported that Tedros' remarks come as the WHO marks six months since the organization was made aware of COVID-19, and ""just as the death toll surpassed 500,000 and the number of confirmed infections topped 10 million"" globally. The U.S. has had more than 2,500,000 confirmed cases along with over 126,000 deaths.

Tedros also dismissed claims that the WHO's recommendation for countries to conduct contract tracing is impossible to carry out.

According to the Associated Press, ""in recent months, countries with large outbreaks of COVID-19, including Britain and the U.S., have said there are simply too many contacts to trace for an effective system to be put in place.""

Report: Congolese women offered Ebola vaccine in exchange for sex as epidemic spreads,"As an Ebola epidemic spreads in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, researchers say multiple women have come forward reporting that they were offered medical treatment such as vaccinations in exchange for sexual favors.

What are the details?

The reports of exploitation were revealed during a recent national task force meeting in the city of Beni, according to The Guardian, and were based on feedback from focus groups conducted by researchers from the International Rescue Committee.

Trina Helderman, a senior health and nutritional adviser for aid organization Medair, asserted that given the DRC's track record, authorities battling the crisis should have anticipated relief efforts would be compromised.

""This region of DRC has a long history of sexual violence and exploitation of women and girls,"" Helderman said. ""Humanitarian actors should have been more prepared to put safety measures in place to prevent this from happening.""



Congo's health minister told Agence France-Presse Friday that more than 500 have died since the outbreak began in August, but that more than 76,000 people have been vaccinated — preventing thousands of deaths.

The government acknowledged that in addition to reports that women were being offered vaccinations in exchange for sex, separate rumors were swirling on social media that women were selling their bodies in order to gain employment in the ranks of those fighting the epidemic.

Such reports underscore the already existing distrust of the public against health care workers in the country, some of whom have been killed trying to treat vulnerable populations in the war-torn nation.

The discord is one of the reasons the World Health Organization fears that in spite of the effectiveness of the Ebola vaccine, there is a high risk that the virus could spread to other countries such as Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.

Anything else?

Despite having among the world's largest untapped mineral reserves, DR Congo is the third poorest country in the world due to years of political corruption and perpetual war. Ongoing attacks from a Muslim militant group called the Allied Democratic Forces have further hindered efforts to quash the country's current Ebola outbreak, which is the second largest in history.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-congolese-women-offered-ebola-vaccine-in-exchange-for-sex-as-epidemic-spreads,2019-02-12
Report: Democrats face voter fraud allegations after ballot review by Dem judge erased Republican lead,"Democrats are reportedly facing voter fraud accusations in an extremely tight New York congressional race that resulted in a Republican candidate having her lead over a Democratic incumbent completely erased, the Washington Examiner reported.

What are the details?

On election night, freshman Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi (N.Y.) trailed Republican challenger Claudia Tenney by over 28,000 votes. Then, as mail-in ballots were counted over the coming weeks, Brindisi's deficit was erased, and he trailed Tenney by just 100-200 votes, the Examiner noted.

That's when Oswego County state Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte, a Democrat, intervened, reviewing ""spoiled"" ballots that had been initially rejected, which gave Brindisi the lead — by just 13 votes.

""BREAKING: sources on both Dem & GOP sides confirm that the final counts submitted by all 8 counties in #NY22 to NY Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte will show Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D) *ahead* of Claudia Tenney (R) by either 12 or 13 votes. Wow,"" Cook Report's Dave Wasserman reported following the development.

""In NY-22, the Democrat incumbent was trailing by almost 30K on election night. The mail-in ballots got him close. Then a Democrat judge from Syracuse ruled he would personally 'review' all of the spoiled ballots that had been rejected. Guess what happened next,"" Hot Air editor Jazz Shaw explained. ""The judge miraculously 'found' enough ballots that he felt were okay and the incumbent now 'leads' by 13 votes.""



How did the campaigns respond?

Despite the narrow gap, Brindisi responded to the judge's actions by declaring victory.

""This process and the integrity of our election are critical to our republic. This judicial review has been fair, open, honest, and transparent and I remain confident that voters' voices will be heard,"" Brindisi said. ""In January I will be sworn in and continue to work with both parties and stand up to anyone on behalf of all of New York's 22nd district.""

Meanwhile, Tenney's campaign explained in a statement they essentially believe that voter fraud gave Brindisi the edge.

Campaign spokesman Sean Kennedy said, according to WSTM-TV:

Governor Cuomo's unfair, unwise, and unilateral rules changes and administrative burdens overwhelmed our voting system and created this utter dysfunction. As a result, the law was not followed when ballots were challenged and tabulated in this election. The result remains far from resolved. Hundreds of ineligible ballots were illegally or improperly cast including votes by the dead, non-residents, or unregistered voters. Those ballots should not – and must not – be counted. The hearing in court has already established that the current tally includes invalid votes and that the process to review and count the massive amount of paper ballots is fractured. Today's misleading and inaccurate tally is rife with errors and mistakes that must be rectified before this election is certified. It is far from final. Our team will fight to ensure the rights of every voter who cast a legal and proper ballot are preserved and not diluted. We cannot sacrifice accuracy for speed. When that is done, we feel strongly that Claudia Tenney will be certified the winner of the race for the 22nd District of New York.

Anything else?

On Monday, all eight counties in New York's 22nd Congressional District delivered their first official cumulative vote count, showing Tenney with the lead — by just 12 votes, 155,492-155,480.

Tenney's lead was later corrected by a single additional vote after one county revised its final tally.

However, the final winner of the race will be decided by about 2,500 contested mail-in ballots, according to Syracuse.com.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-democrats-face-voter-fraud-allegations-after-ballot-review-by-dem-judge-erases-republican-lead,2020-12-01
"Republican National Committee censures Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, will 'immediately cease any and all support of them as members of the Republican Party'","The Republican National Committee voted on Friday to censure Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, two outspoken critics of former President Donald Trump who are the only Republicans serving on the House select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

The censure resolution and several other resolutions were all approved together via a voice vote.

The resolution declares that the RNC ""formally censures"" the the two lawmakers ""and shall immediately cease any and all support of them as members of the Republican Party for their behavior which has been destructive to the institution of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Republican Party and our republic, and is inconsistent with the position of the Conference.""

It declares that they ""have engaged in actions in their positions as members of the January 6th Select Committee not befitting Republican members of Congress, which include the Committee’s disregard for minority rights, traditional checks and balances, due process, and adherence to other precedent and rules of the U.S. House and which seem intent on advancing a political agenda to buoy the Democrat Party’s bleak prospects in the upcoming midterm elections.""

The resolution says that the lawmakers ""are participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse, and they are both utilizing their past professed political affiliation to mask Democrat abuse of prosecutorial power for partisan purposes.""



While Kinzinger is not seeking re-election, Cheney is pursuing another term in office. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a challenger seeking to defeat Cheney in the Republican primary.



""This was January 6th. This is not 'legitimate political discourse,'"" Cheney tweeted in a post Friday that also included a video.

""Cheney and Kinzinger chose to join Pelosi in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol,"" RNC chair Ronna McDaniel tweeted. ""I have repeatedly condemned violence on both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, this committee has gone well beyond the scope of the events of that day.""



Cheney and Kinzinger were among the 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching then-President Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6 episode.

Cheney was ousted from her role as House Republican conference chair last year.

Both lawmakers had already issued statements prior to Friday.

""Rather than focus their efforts on how to help the American people, my fellow Republicans have chosen to censure two lifelong Members of their party for simply upholding their oaths of office. They've allowed conspiracies and toxic tribalism hinder their ability to see clear-eyed,"" Kinzinger had said in a statement.

""The leaders of the Republican Party have made themselves willing hostages to a man who admits he tried to overturn a presidential election and suggests he would pardon Jan. 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy,"" Cheney had said in a statement. ""I’m a constitutional conservative and I do not recognize those in my party who have abandoned the Constitution to embrace Donald Trump. History will be their judge. I will never stop fighting for our constitutional republic. No matter what.""

"Mitt Romney, Pat Toomey blast Senate Republican colleagues for opposing Electoral College certification","Republican Sens. Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey on Saturday blasted their Senate Republican colleagues who plan to vote against certifying the Electoral College results, and therefore Joe Biden's presidential victory, during a joint-session of Congress on Jan. 6.

What's the background?

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced Saturday that he and 10 other Senate Republicans would not support the Electoral College certification unless Congress established a commission to conduct an emergency audit of the election.

""Voter fraud has posed a persistent challenge in our elections, although its breadth and scope are disputed. By any measure, the allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes,"" the Republicans said in a joint statement.

Cruz's announcement came after Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) became the first Senate Republican to declare that he would oppose the Electoral College certification. Hawley, however, did not cite election fraud, but claimed that Pennsylvania and other states did not follow their election laws in the 2020 presidential election.

What did Romney say?

The Utah Republican called Cruz's argument for an election commission established by Congress ""nonsense"" because Congress, by its very nature, is a partisan body.

""Were Congress to actually reject state electors, partisans would inevitably demand the same any time their candidate had lost. Congress, not voters in the respective states, would choose our presidents,"" Romney said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Romney declared that the action of his fellow Republicans to object to Biden's win ""dangerously threatens"" the American republic.

The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic. The congressional power to reject electors is reserved for the most extreme and unusual circumstances. These are far from it. More Americans participated in this election than ever before, and they made their choice. President Trump's lawyers made their case before scores of courts; in every instance, they failed. The Justice Department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election. The Presidential Voter Fraud Commission disbanded without finding such evidence.

What did Toomey say?

The Pennsylvania Republican denounced the decision of Cruz, Hawley, and other Republicans, saying their effort ""undermines"" the American electoral process.

""A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders. The effort by Senators Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right,"" Toomey said in a statement.

Addressing allegations of election fraud, Toomey explained such claims have been made in court — and they've failed spectacularly.

""The senators justify their intent by observing that there have been many allegations of fraud. But allegations of fraud by a losing campaign cannot justify overturning an election. They fail to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in courtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence,"" Toomey said.

He continued, ""President Trump's own Attorney General, Bill Barr, stated 'we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.'""

However, Toomey acknowledged that ""irregularities"" were likely present in the election. Still, he said the ""evidence is overwhelming"" that Joe Biden won the election.

""I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others,"" Toomey said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/romney-toomey-respond-senate-republicans-electoral-college-certification,2021-01-03
Sen. Marco Rubio calls on Biden to immediately fire Gen. Milley over 'treasonous' report he undermined Trump,"Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called on President Joe Biden to immediately fire Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after a report claiming he undermined former President Donald Trump in calls to China.

""I write with grave concern regarding recent reporting that General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, worked to actively undermine the sitting Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forced and contemplated a treasonous leak of classified information to the Chinese Communist Party in advance of a potential armed conflict with the People's Republic of China (PRC),"" wrote Rubio in the letter Tuesday.

Milley is accused of calling his counterpart in the Chinese government to assure them that he would prevent an attack ordered by Trump and that he would let them know beforehand of a surprise attack if it were to be launched.

The report says that Milley's actions stemmed from his fears that the former president had become unstable after the attack on the U.S Capitol by some of his supporters who were angry at the official results of the 2020 presidential election.

Rubio said in the letter that Biden should fire Milley in order to protect the U.S. principle of civilian rule over the military.

""These actions by General Milley demonstrate a clear lack of sound judgement, and I urge you to dismiss him immediately,"" continued Rubio.

""General Milley has attempted to rationalize his reckless behavior by arguing that what he perceived as the military's judgement as more stable than its civilian commander. It is a dangerous precedent that could be asserted at any point in the future by General Milley or others. It threatens to tear apart our nation's longstanding principle of civilian control of the military,"" he added.

""You must immediately dismiss General Milley,"" Rubio concluded. ""America's national security and ability to lead in the world are at stake.""

The claims against Milley are made in a yet to be released book by journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa entitled, ""Peril.""

Jen Griffin of Fox News reported that the Pentagon responded to the claims by saying that Milley did not interfere with the chain of command but that he only made sure that everyone knew what their proper roles were in the event of a nuclear launch order.

They added that Milley had routine calls with China and NATO allies of the U.S. where he reassured them that the government was stable and that they were not plotting a surprise attack.

Trump responded to the report by accusing Milley of being guilty of treason, if the claims were true.

"Rubio warns against broad use of executive power: 'Tomorrow, the national emergency might be climate change'","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R) says he's not ready to endorse President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency in order to build a border wall, warning that such broad use of executive power sets the stage for future actions that might not be as palatable to conservatives.

What are the details?

Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday, Rubio said, ""I think the president has broad powers to declare national emergencies. I think they should be used very judiciously. I'm not prepared to endorse that right now; I want to think about it some more, I want to dig in to some of the historical record as to why that power is there, how it's been used in the past.""

""I think we need to be very careful about that,"" the senator continued. ""It sets long-term precedents, and I can tell you, that for people on my side of the aisle, one of our concerns we should have is: If today, the national emergency is border security and it entitles him to go out and do something, and we all support that — tomorrow, the national security emergency might be, ya know, climate change, so let's seize fossil fuel plants or something.""

Sen. Rubio added, ""Maybe it's an exaggeration, but my point is we've got to be very careful about endorsing broad uses of executive power in our Republic.""

So, what does constitute a national emergency?

That matter is up for interpretation.

As Professor Andrew Rudalevige wrote in The Washington Post on Thursday, ""nothing in the [National Emergencies Act of 1976] says there actually has to be a national emergency — only that the president has to declare one.""

Rudalevige also points out that ""as of 2019, the United States has been in a continuous state of emergency for four full decades"" — just as it was from 1933 to 1973, which saw emergencies declared for The Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean War.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice, U.S. presidents have declared 58 national emergencies since 1979. Many of those declarations, which were issued under the NEA, involve trade restrictions or the prohibition of transactions with different foreign entities.

With such vague guidelines on executive powers, a controversial declaration could end up being decided on by a judge. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Thursday that's exactly what he fears might happen if President Trump uses the NEA statute to build a border wall.

""I think we should do it legislatively,"" Jordan told reporters, ""because if [Trump] goes the emergency route, I'm convinced it's going to wind up in court.""

"Rush Limbaugh's widow opens up on losing the legendary broadcaster, details his incredible funeral: 'Rush is just shy of a president'","Kathryn Limbaugh, widow of the late Rush Limbaugh, says that losing her husband has been very difficult for her and the legendary broadcaster's loved ones.

The 70-year-old conservative icon passed away in February after battling Stage 4 lung cancer.

What are the details?

In a Tuesday discussion with ""The Rush Limbaugh Show"" guest host Todd Herman, Kathryn said that grieving the loss of her husband is a process.

""I'm doing OK,"" she told Herman. ""Of course, it's a very difficult time. But I really, truly feel we are all going through this process together, and it's very much a process. And I think it helps us to all be together and grieve in a sense and keep our Rush with us in that way.""

Kathryn recalled Rush's funeral, saying that the day of his burial was a beautiful one.

""It was an absolutely gorgeous day, slightly chilly, but nothing like the icy snow that Missouri had a few days prior,"" she said. ""The sun was shining brightly and the really crisp air, and this cemetery is very historic. It has a lot of historic figures such as William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition and others. And just to picture it, it might remind you a bit of Arlington or other historic cemeteries around the world, with winding hills and pathways and big trees that are bare right now, but in the upcoming months, they will be full and green and very lovely to walk around.""

She continued, ""I've always said Rush is just shy of a president, in my opinion. And we did a funeral that was very worthy of him. So we concentrated a lot on tradition and ceremony at every turn. From the moment that he left the house here in Palm Beach, there was a procession escorting Rush to the transport plane that would take him to St. Louis, and then when we arrived in St. Louis, there was a procession leading to the cemetery.""

""So he was never left alone in any aspect of this, and then once we got to the cemetery there was a horse-drawn carriage waiting for him, and it was simply stunning,"" she recalled. ""There will be some pictures for you to see, but you could hear the clacking of the horse hooves as we walked through the cemetery following behind Rush. You could hear the singing of the birds. It was very peaceful, very beautiful. And we followed behind the horse-drawn carriage until we reached the chapel. And when we reached the chapel, we had a small service in the chapel, which is located in the cemetery. Rush was escorted into the chapel to his favorite version of The Battle Hymn of the Republic.""

""And you can picture hearing that song and seeing the American flag draped over Rush at the front of the chapel,"" Kathryn added. ""It was perfectly fitting and absolutely beautiful. And then once we had a small ceremony there within the chapel, we followed behind Rush again in the carriage leading down towards the burial site. And it was just stunning, if you can imagine, looking forward through a winding road to see this beautiful carriage with Rush in it and then flags around his gravesite. So as we approached the gravesite you could see these powerful American flags waving in the wind and the sun was shining directly on that spot. It couldn't have been more fitting.""



Of her husband's death, Kathryn said that Rush went peacefully into the afterlife.

""I have his wedding ring and a cross on a chain around my neck, keeping him with me every day, every moment,"" she said. 'Rush didn't know after which EIB show he would follow God's plan to return to heaven. He went peacefully. Yes, he was greeted by many when he arrived back home.""

Russia offers aid to Belarus in what could be an attempted takeover,"On Friday, the president of Belarus announced that the Russian government had offered his country a financial lifeline, in return for integrating more with Russia, a move that he said was a Russian plan to take over his country.

What's the situation?

Belarus is a former Soviet republic that gained its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It borders Russia, as well as Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine.

In 1999, Belarus and Russia signed an agreement to form a union that would share foreign policy, currency, and a legal system.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been in power since 1994. According to the CIA World Factbook, Lukashenko “has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means and a centralized economic system. Government restrictions on political and civil freedoms, freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly, and religion have remained in place.""

While the Belarusian economy has improved in 2017 and 2018, it struggled in the five years prior to that.

What happened now?

On Thursday, Russian Prime Minister and former President Dmitry Medvedev announced that Russia would be willing to offer Belarus financial assistance in return for Belarus adhering to the 1999 agreement. This comes as Russian tax rules threaten to increase the cost of oil and gas entering Belarus. Belarus is dependent on Russia for these vital resources.

At a news conference Friday, Lukashenko said that Medvedev's offer was an attempt by the Russian government to reabsorb Belarus.

“I understand those hints: here's your oil, but you must destroy your country and join Russia,"" he said.

“Splitting us into separate regions and merging with Russia — that will never happen,"" Lukashenko told the Belarusian news outlet Belta, according to a translation by Bloomberg News. He told Belta that the Russian oil and gas policies could cost his country more than $10 billion over the next six years, but that this was not worth giving up Belarusian independence.

“Sovereignty is a sacred thing for us,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-takeover-belarus,2018-12-14

""No to war,"" Natalia Sindeyeva, the station's general director, said on Thursday as staff left the studio and made the decision to air Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake,"" which according to the report, ""was aired on Soviet state TV during the collapse of the Soviet Union.""

""We need strength to exhale and understand how to work further,"" Sindeyeva said in a statement shared on the channel's website. ""We really hope that we will return to the air and continue our work.""

Ukraine News UK tweeted video footage of the walkout and captioned it, ""The Entire staff of the Russian TV channel 'the rain' resigned during a live stream with last words: 'no war' and then played 'swan lake' ballet video (just like they did on all USSR tv channels when it suddenly collapsed).""

Ruth Bader Ginsburg shuts down talk on eliminating Electoral College,"Since President Donald Trump's 2016 victory, Democrats have increased calls to eliminate the constitutionally mandated Electoral College. MSNBC host Chris Hayes, for example, argued on his show last month the Electoral College is undemocratic and potentially perpetuates systemic racism.

""The weirdest thing about the Electoral College is the fact that if it wasn't specifically in the Constitution for the presidency, it would be unconstitutional,"" Hayes said.

But, according to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Electoral College is here to stay.

Speaking at the University of Chicago on Monday, Ginsburg, the eldest Supreme Court judge, said constitutional changes like abolishing the Electoral College are ""more theoretical than real,"" the Chicago Tribune reported.

""It's largely a dream because our Constitution is ... hard to amend,"" she said. ""I know that from experience.""

Though amending the Constitution is an intentionally difficult process, Ginsburg has previously voiced support for eliminating the Electoral College.

""There are some things I would like to change, one is the Electoral College,"" she said in 2017. ""But that would require a constitutional amendment, and amending our Constitution is powerfully hard to do.""

Many Democrats believe that America should elect presidents in a directly democratic fashion — despite America being established as a constitutional republic — to prevent a presidential candidate who earns the majority of votes from losing an election.

However, the Founding Fathers established the Electoral College to provide states with somewhat equal representation, although larger states still maintain a considerable power advantage over smaller states. For example, California, the most populous state, has 54 electoral votes, whereas Montana has just three.

If the Electoral College did not exist, then America's urban centers, which heavily lean to the left, would likely decide the presidency while smaller, more rural states would have less influence on who becomes president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ruth-bader-ginsburg-shuts-down-talk-on-eliminating-electoral-college,2019-09-11

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was so concerned about potential discrimination against the Asian American community and ramifications of the name of the coronavirus that she went to San Francisco's crowded Chinatown in late February and told people:""Come to Chinatown, here we are — we're, again, careful, safe — and come join us.""

The city of San Antonio has taken it one step further by outlawing words associated with the coronavirus that it deems to be racist or xenophobic.

The resolution states: ""The City of San Antonio denounces antisemitism, anti-Asian bigotry, and all hateful speech, violent action and the spread of misinformation related to COVID-19 that casts blame, promotes racism or discrimination or harms the City of San Antonio Asian and Pacific Islander, Jewish, immigrant or other communities.""

San Antonio reporter Jaie Avila was covering the meeting and tweeted: ""Council regular Jack Finger was speaking against the resolution when his mic was cut off.""

Avila added that Council Member Manny Pelaez said that ""hate speech is more dangerous than the virus itself."" There are over 271,000 worldwide deaths from the novel coronavirus and 77,000 American deaths.

The city council also said that ""all persons are encouraged to report any such anti-Semitic, discriminatory or racist incidents to the proper authorities for investigation."" City council members unanimously voted in favor of the resolution 11-0.



The resolution was put forward by San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg.

""We've seen incidents that are clearly racist in nature all around this country, and we've even seen some incidents here. But this is really about standing in solidarity with all the members of our community,"" Nirenberg told reporters following the council vote.

Ted Cruz slammed the council members for their decision to make terms relating to COVID-19 hate speech.

""This is NUTS. SA City Council behaving like a lefty college faculty lounge, triggered by Chick-fil-A & the words 'Wuhan virus,' Cruz wrote on Twitter. ""If they want to investigate someone, start with NYT & CNN who both repeatedly (and rightly) referred to it as 'the Chinese coronavirus.' #NoSpeechPolice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-antonio-hate-speech-chinese-virus,2020-05-08
'Your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war': Arnold Schwarzenegger appeals to Russian people against the invasion of Ukraine,"Arnold Schwarzenegger sent a video message to the Russian people to appeal to them to not believe war propaganda and reject the invasion of Ukraine.

The video went viral online with more than 11 million views on Twitter.

""I'm speaking to you today because there are things that are going on in the world that are being kept from you, terrible things that you should know about,"" said Schwarzenegger.

He went on to relate his personal ties to Russia and how he grew to respect and love the country since he had been 15 years old.

""I know that your government has told you that this is a war to denazify Ukraine. Denazify Ukraine? This is not true! Ukraine is a country with a Jewish president, a Jewish president I might add, whose father's three brothers were all murdered by the Nazis,"" Schwarzenegger continued.

""You see, Ukraine didn't start this war. Neither did nationalists or Nazis. Those in power in the Kremlin started this war. This is not the Russian people's war,"" he added.

Schwarzenegger praised the thousands of Russians who risked imprisonment and worse to protest in the streets against the war. He then addressed the Russian soldiers and told them they were being told lies by the Russian government.

""Your lives, your limbs, and your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war condemned by the entire world,"" Schwarzenegger said.

He also compared the lies of the Russian government to that of the Nazis and talked about how his father felt guilty for fighting on the side of the Nazis.

""He lived the rest of his life in pain,"" Schwarzenegger explained. ""Pain from a broken back. Pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years. And pain from the guilt that he felt.""



22 days since the initial invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military continues to bomb major cities in the former Soviet republic. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the fighting.

Schwarzenegger successfully ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2003 after gaining fame as a Hollywood actor.

Perry says FBI seized his phone,"GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania has said that the FBI seized his cell phone on Tuesday.

""This morning, while traveling with my family, 3 FBI agents visited me and seized my cell phone. They made no attempt to contact my lawyer, who would have made arrangements for them to have my phone if that was their wish. I'm outraged — though not surprised — that the FBI under the direction of Merrick Garland’s DOJ, would seize the phone of a sitting Member of Congress,"" Perry said in a statement, according to Fox News. ""My phone contains info about my legislative and political activities, and personal/private discussions with my wife, family, constituents, and friends. None of this is the government's business.""

The outlet reported that the lawmaker also said in the statement, ""as with President Trump last night, DOJ chose this unnecessary and aggressive action instead of simply contacting my attorneys. These kinds of banana republic tactics should concern every Citizen — especially considering the decision before Congress this week to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to further persecute law-abiding Citizens.""

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky shared a link to the Fox News report about the seizure of Perry's phone and remarked, ""The Biden regime is out of control.""

Former President Donald Trump issued a statement on Monday announcing that the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.

In the statement, Trump declared, ""my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.""

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" Trump said in the statement on Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scott-perry-fbi-seize-phone,2022-08-09
Scottsdale councilman shouts 'I can't breathe!' during protest against mandatory mask order,"A councilman in Scottsdale, Arizona, is in hot water after he used the infamous phrase, ""I can't breathe!"" during his rally to protest against a mandatory mask order.

Councilman Guy Phillips made the comments before an audience of supporters at City Hall in Old Town Scottsdale on Wednesday.

""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" he said as his supporters cheered for him to take off the mask.









'I can't breathe' Scottsdale council member says at anti-mask rally www.youtube.com





The video immediately made the rounds on social media with many criticizing him for using the phrase in apparent disrespect of Eric Garner and George Floyd, who both died while being arrested by police.



Phillips later denied in a statement to the Arizona Republic that he was referring to the Black Lives Matter phrase.

""It was hot and stuffy,"" Phillips explained. ""I did not mean any disrespect and there was no connection.""

The apology

He then offered a statement of apology hours later to the Floyd family.

""I am sorry about a comment I made today that was the same comment Mr. Floyd had made,"" Phillips said. ""He didn't deserve what happened to him and I by no means was trying to make light of it by saying I cant breathe in a mask. Please accept my sincerest apology and that goes out to anyone who became offended.""

The response

Many on social media assumed that Phillips used the phrase intentionally and excoriated him for it.

""Guy Phillips, let's hope this clip buries your career. Vile,"" responded New York Times writer Wajahat Ali.

""What a POS Guy Phillips is. This is disgusting and if Guy Phillips has a job tomorrow something is serious wrong. You don't Eric Garner and George Floyd or ANY of the MANY black men chocked, strangles and suffocated by police. Disgusting,"" replied author Don Winslow.

""I demand the immediate removal of Guy Phillips form @scottsdaleazgov City Council immediately,"" tweeted voice actor Charles Adler. ""If this is acceptable to you than no one should visit or stay in your city until you correct this disgusting display and prevent it from ever happening again !""

Scottsdale police take action after discovery that school board president kept creepy dossier on parents,"Police in Arizona have launched an investigation into Scottsdale Unified School District president Jann-Michael Greenburg after allegations surfaced that he kept a dossier of information on parents who oppose COVID restrictions and critical race theory.

What is the background?

News of the dossier broke last week after Greenburg reportedly shared it with a parent by accident.

The Arizona Republic reported:

A copy of the Google Drive that parents created was obtained by The Arizona Republic and it included screenshots of Facebook conversations parents had about their opposition to topics such as critical race theory and COVID-19 mask mandates. It also included emails sent to school board members calling for Greenburg's resignation, photos and videos of parents protesting the school district and screenshots of parents' Facebook profiles that indicated their support for former President Donald Trump.

Even more shocking, the dossier allegedly contained Social Security numbers, property records, and divorce decrees, among other personal information. Information had been collected on nearly 50 parents.

What happened now?

The Scottsdale Police Department released a statement saying the agency is ""aware of the allegations against Scottsdale Unified School District President Jann-Michael Greenburg.""

""We are conducting an investigation into the matter and will report our findings once it is complete,"" the statement added, the Associated Press reported.

The statement, however, did not specify any details about the investigation. It is not clear if Greenburg is accused of breaking crimes.

Scottsdale Unified School District superintendent Scott Menzel similarly announced on Friday an investigation into Greenburg and the dossier.

Menzel said in a letter:

Today, the Scottsdale Unified School District (SUSD) began the process of hiring an independent forensic investigator to determine if any school resources were used to compile, access or modify the private dossier allegedly created and maintained in Google drive folders by Mark Greenburg, the father of SUSD Board President Jann-Michael Greenburg, and shared by the latter. We want to determine if school resources were used inappropriately. We take our responsibility as good stewards of public funds very seriously.



It is important to emphasize the District did not create, maintain or have control over the dossier. The information it contains appears to be largely from public documents, and parents are rightly upset that certain data, photography and video has been collected and shared.

According to the Arizona Republic, more than 1,200 parents have signed a petition demanding Greenburg's resignation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scottsdale-police-take-action-after-discovery-that-school-board-president-kept-creepy-dossier-on-parents,2021-11-14
SCOTUS temporarily blocks release of President Trump's financial information via court order,"The judicial fight over legal demands to release President Donald Trump's financial records took another step forward Monday when the Supreme Court of the United States temporarily stopped President Donald Trump's longtime accounting firm from having to turn over information to congressional investigators.

The order, which was signed by Chief Justice John Roberts, gives the House of Representatives until Thursday to respond in the matter. The decision comes after President Trump's lawyers asked the court to stop the records from being released under subpoena and after the House of Representatives' general counsel told the high court in a letter that the lawmakers would agree to ""a short ten-day administrative stay"" beginning on Wednesday in order to allow both sides of the case to file necessary legal paperwork.

The case has to do with a subpoena that the House Oversight Committee sent to the president's longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, back in April for records related its investigation into Trump's business dealings from both before and after he took office. While the committee said it needed the documents for an evaluation of current government ethics laws, the president's team told the court that the investigation ""serves no legitimate legislative purpose.""

In October, a majority decision of a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to uphold the subpoena.

The lone dissenter in the three-judge decision was Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee confirmed to the bench earlier this year, who said the court's opinion blurred the ""consistent line"" between Congress' legislative powers and its impeachment powers.

""When Congress seeks information about the President's wrongdoing, it does not matter whether the investigation also has a legislative purpose,"" Rao wrote. ""Allowing the Committee to issue this subpoena for legislative purposes would turn Congress into a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government.""

Last week, a panel of judges consisting of the entire D.C. Circuit Court of appeals upheld the ruling enforcing the subpoena with an 8-3 majority. Rao was joined in her dissent this time by another Trump appointee and another judge appointed by George H.W. Bush.

The D.C. Circuit case is happening alongside a similar subpoena case in New York, in which the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled earlier this month that Mazars had to turn over the president's financial records to an investigation being conducted by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.

""[A]fter reviewing historical and legal precedent, we conclude only that presidential immunity does not bar the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce non‐privileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the President,"" the federal court decided.

After the 2nd Circuit ruling, Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow, said his team planned to take the fight to the Supreme Court. ""The issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our Republic,"" Sekulow said in a statement. ""The constitutional issues are significant.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-temporarily-blocks-release-of-trumps-financial-information-via-court-order,2019-11-18
"In huge boon to GOP election security efforts, SCOTUS upholds Arizona voting rules","The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld two Republican-backed voting rules in Arizona, providing a boon to ongoing Republican efforts in other states to pass laws aimed at ensuring the integrity of elections.

What happened?

In a 6-3 decision, the top court determined that two Arizona voting rules — one requiring that provisional ballots be tossed if submitted at the wrong precinct and another making it a felony for third parties to collect and submit another person's ballot — do not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The case landed before the high court after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the voting rules disproportionately burdened minority voters, thus violating the law. But in Thursday's decision, the court's band of conservative justices overturned the lower court's ruling.

""Arizona's out-of-precinct policy and HB 2023 do not violate [Section 2] of the VRA,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority opinion. He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.

In general, the court found that Arizona law ""makes it quite easy for residents to vote,"" and when restrictions are applied, the state goes out of its way to alleviate any substantive burdens to voting. Any burdens that remain are commonplace and not discriminatory, the court concluded.

""Having to identify one's own polling place and then travel there to vote does not exceed the 'usual burdens of voting,'"" Alito argued. ""On the contrary, these tasks are quintessential examples of the usual burdens of voting.""

He added elsewhere that the ""mere fact there is some disparity in impact does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote.""

Besides, states have a legitimate interest in guarding against fraudulent activity, the justice added.

""Fraud can affect the outcome of a close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of citizens to cast ballots that carry appropriate weight,"" he wrote. ""Fraud can also undermine public confidence in the fairness of elections and the perceived legitimacy of the announced outcome.""

Dissenting from the majority were liberal Justices Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor.

Why does it matter?

The court's decision comes as Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country consider new laws to tighten election security. In response, Democrats have argued that the new measures are nothing more than voter suppression tactics.

President Joe Biden's Justice Department has even filed a lawsuit against the state of Georgia over such reforms. But the Supreme Court's Thursday ruling may foreshadow the DOJ's defeat.

On Thursday, the president called the ruling a ""broad assault against voting rights.""

""In a span of just eight years, the Court has now done severe damage to two of the most important provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 – a law that took years of struggle and strife to secure,"" Biden added.

On the other hand, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who appealed the Ninth Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court, celebrated the ruling as ""a win for election integrity safeguards in Arizona and across the country.""

""Fair elections are the cornerstone of our republic, and they start with rational laws that protect both the right to vote and the accuracy of the results,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-upholds-arizona-voting-rules,2021-07-01
Sean Hannity threatens to sue the New York Times if they don't apologize and retract coronavirus story,"Fox News host Sean Hannity threatened to sue the New York Times over a coronavirus story unless they retracted and apologized for including him.

In a letter from Hannity's lawyer to the New York Times, his lawyer demands the newspaper retract a story that connected Hannity's statements about the coronavirus to a man who later died from the disease.

The letter accused the Times of ""blatant and outrageous disregard for the truth in mischaracterizing Mr. Hannity's coverage of the coronavirus pandemic and blaming him for the tragic death of Joe Joyce.""

The Joyce story was published on April 18 and detailed how the family of Joyce said that he was a Fox News viewer and believed the virus was a hoax intended to damage President Donald Trump.

The letter continues on to explain that although Joyce took off on his cruise on March 1, the comments that Hannity made and supposedly influenced Joyce were made more than a week later on March 9.



""Moreover, you were fully aware that this was the actual timeline, and in order to mislead your readers and support your false narrative, you withheld the date of Mr. Hannity's comments from your story,"" the latter claimed.

""We demand that you promptly remove the foregoing false and defamatory statements from the Stories and any subsequent republications in print or any other medium, and publish a full, fair and conspicuous retraction, correction and apology as to each of the false and defamatory statements identified above,"" the latter added.

"Second worst outbreak of Ebola in history hits the Congo; more than 1,000 infected","The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been hit by the second worst outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in recorded history. More than 1,000 people have been confirmed to have been infected, and hundreds have already died from it.

Here's what we know

Since the start of the outbreak, 610 people have died, according to the World Health Organization — 62 percent of the total number infected. In the past week alone, there were 58 reported cases of the virus.

Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's assistant director general for emergencies, told The Hill that ""[a] lot of patients are arriving quite sick. Five, six, 10 days after infection. It's also bad for their families, it's also bad for their communities, because they're transmitting the disease before they are isolated.""

The deadlier outbreak occurred in 2014, when 11,000 people in West Africa died from Ebola. At this point, the outbreak seems contained to two northern provinces of the country: Kivu and Ituri.

Even before the outbreak, Kivu was the site of increasing conflict. The situation there is so unstable, according to The Hill, that the State Department has banned U.S. government aid workers from traveling to the area to help treat Ebola patients.

These precautions do not seem to have been without merit. In February, Ebola treatment facilities were attacked by angry mobs. The threat of violence was severe enough that Doctors Without Borders decided to recall its people from the region.

What else?

All of these factors have made it more difficult for the health workers who are still in the area to effectively treat the disease. But, thankfully, they're still trying.

According to the World Health Organization, despite the obstacles, ""over 90% of people eligible for vaccination have accepted to do so, and over 90% of these individuals having participated in follow-up visits. To date, 89,855 people have been vaccinated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/second-worst-outbreak-of-ebola-in-history-hits-the-congo-more-than-1-000-infected,2019-03-25
"Sen. Menendez touts bill to protect journalists, gets called out by reporter he threatened a month ago","Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) reintroduced legislation aimed at protecting journalists on Tuesday, and was quickly accused of hypocrisy by a reporter he threatened just a month ago.

What are the details?

Menendez co-authored the Journalist Protection Act with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.). The act would make it a federal crime to ""intentionally cause bodily injury to a journalist affecting interstate or foreign commerce in the course of reporting or in a manner designed to intimidate him or her from newsgathering for a media organization,"" Fox News reported. The legislation was originally proposed in February 2018.

While promoting the bill's second rollout on Twitter, Menendez criticized President Donald Trump's ""dangerous rhetoric"" against the media before declaring, ""We must work to make gov't more transparent and to protect the journalists dedicated to holding those in power accountable.""





Capitol Hill reporter Henry Rodgers — who Menendez threatened last month — seized the opportunity to call out the senator for hypocrisy and ask whether he was protected under the act, too.





Rodgers works for right-leaning outlet The Daily Caller. He approached Menendez in February to get the senator's take on the Green New Deal. The New Jersey Democrat refused to answer the journalist, called his publication ""trash,"" and threatened to call the police on Rodgers for ""harassing"" him.

In a statement published by The Daily Caller on Tuesday, Rodgers said, ""If Sen. Menendez is so interested in protecting the rights of journalists, why did he threaten to call the police on me just a month ago, for asking a simple question about the Green New Deal? He called my organization 'trash' and told me he would call Capitol Police on me if I continued to ask him questions.""

Anything else?

Menendez and The Daily Caller have a history. In 2012, the publication was first to report on allegations that the senator had solicited underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic along with a wealthy donor. Then, in 2015, The Caller broke the story that the Department of Justice had discovered ""corroborating evidence"" in the case.

Sen. Menendez was charged with bribery, and his trial resulted in a hung jury. Thereafter, the DOJ dropped its corruption charges against him.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sen-menendez-touts-bill-to-protect-journalists-gets-called-out-by-reporter-he-threatened-a-month-ago,2019-03-13
Sen. Ron Johnson: Biden is 'highly compromised' because of Hunter Biden's Chinese influence-peddling,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) underscored on Sunday that President Joe Biden has been ""highly compromised"" by China. As a result, Biden may have been leveraged and ineffective going into his Nov. 14 meeting in Indonesia with Chinese communist dictator Xi Jinping.

The accusation



On Nov. 13, Fox News' Maria Bartiromo asked Johnson, ""How is Joe Biden going to protect America meeting Xi Jinping tomorrow when we know he's taken in all that money from Chinese officials tied to the CCP?""

Bartiromo's suggestion that Biden took money from Chinese officials is partly a reference to allegations that Chinese elites paid an estimated $31 million to Hunter Biden and members of the Biden family.

Johnson replied, ""It's obvious that President Biden is highly compromised because of Hunter Biden's influence peddling. ... The FBI's known about this probably going back to 2014, 2015, when you had prosecutions or investigations of Devon Archer, Hunter Biden‘s business partner. This corruption has been going back quite a few years. It needs to be fully exposed.”

TheBlaze previously reported on claims that the president's son and brother had a ""lucrative"" business deal with the foreign energy company CEFC China Energy, which is connected to the Chinese Communist Party — a deal Hunter Biden said was ""interesting for me and my family.""

Joe Biden may have kept many of these dealings at arm's length, but his hand was allegedly always open.

The New York Post reported in October that the Biden family allegedly received a $5 million interest-free loan from the Chinese energy conglomerate in 2017.

The Post previously suggested that Hunter may have been receiving a $10 million per year fee from a Chinese billionaire for ""introductions alone.""

As of Oct. 26, White House spokesman John Kirby still cannot confirm whether Hunter Biden still co-owns an investment firm with the Chinese regime.

Johnson told Bartiromo, ""My feeling is that Joe Biden is highly compromised. Why else would we cancel the China Initiative, the DOD program designed to investigate China's theft of our intellectual property from colleges and universities. It made no sense whatsoever.""

In February, the Department of Justice announced that it was ending the ""China Initiative"" program.

The purpose of the program, launched under the Trump administration, was to bolster national security, identify and prosecute ""those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking and economic espionage,"" and to protect critical American infrastructure ""against external threats through foreign direct investment and supply chain compromises.""

There is only one explanation for the initiative's cancellation, said Johnson: ""Joe Biden is compromised.""

The Washington Times indicated that Johnson, ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, will have an opportunity this week to grill FBI Director Christopher Wray about the Justice Department's lackluster investigation into Hunter Biden.

Ron Johnson: 'My feeling' is Joe Biden is 'highly compromised' by China youtu.be

Biden's meeting



According to the White House, Biden and Xi spoke candidly about:

the need to ""maintain open lines of communication"";

the alleged need to ""work together to address transnational challenges — such as climate change, global macroeconomic stability including debt relief, health security, and global food security"";

""peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"";

encouraging North Korea to exercise some modicum of responsibility;

""China's non-market economic practices""; and

the need to avoid the use of nuclear weapons.

On Tuesday, retired Gen. Jack Keane told Bartiromo that Biden's meeting with Xi amounted to a ""squandered opportunity.""

Keaned suggested that China wants ""to see political division and social dislocation as a result of their actions, and they should be called on this action. And it's shameful that the president has not taken that action to deal directly face-to-face with President Xi over these issues.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sen-ron-johnson-biden-is-highly-compromised-because-of-hunter-bidens-chinese-influence-peddling,2022-11-15
Senate Democrats introduce constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College,"A group of Senate Democrats say the Electoral College is an unfair system that needs to go and have introduced a constitutional amendment in order to have it abolished.

What are the details?

On Tuesday, the measure — sponsored by Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin (Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), and Brian Schatz (Hawaii) — was officially introduced in the upper chamber, as companion legislation to a proposal already offered in the House.

According to CBS News, the campaign to get rid of the Electoral College gained steam among Democrats after the party's 2000 and 2016 presidential nominees, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, both lost White House bids despite garnering more of the popular vote than their Republican opponents.

Durbin issued a statement, saying, ""Before the 2000 election, I introduced a bipartisan resolution to amend the Constitution and create a system of direct election for presidents. And I still believe today as I did then that the Electoral College is a relic from a shameful period in our nation's history, and allows some votes to carry greater weight than others,"" Fox News reported.

""In an election, the person who gets the most votes should win,"" Schatz added, according to WTVF-TV. ""No one's vote should count for more based on where you live. The Electoral College is outdated and it's undemocratic. It's time to end it.""

The idea of switching to a simple popular vote for presidential elections has also been endorsed by several 2020 Democratic candidates, including former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.).

Anything else?

Durbin and Schatz are correct in pointing out the Electoral College does give greater weight to votes in some regions over others — that's the point. The system was crafted to be a mechanism for protecting states' rights in America's democratic republic and providing a counterweight to areas with greater populations that would otherwise hold an advantage.

Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, pointed out to CBS that the Electoral College ""also sets a precedent for the Senate, which is also very unrepresentative of the population: Two senators per state.""

"Senate unanimously passes bill banning imported goods made from Uyghur slave labor, punishes China for human rights abuses","The Senate unanimously passed a bill punishing the Chinese Communist Party for a history of human rights abuses. The Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act would ban all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless there is ""clear and convincing evidence"" that the ""products were not produced wholly or in part by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions.""

""In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, the Government of the People’s Republic of China has, since 2017, arbitrarily detained as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups in a system of extrajudicial mass internment camps, and has subjected detainees to forced labor, torture, political indoctrination, and other severe human rights abuses,"" the bill states.



The Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act states that efforts to certify that products are not made by forced labor are ""unreliable due to the extent forced labor has been integrated into the regional economy, the mixing of involuntary labor with voluntary labor, the inability of witnesses to speak freely about working conditions given government surveillance and coercion, and the incentive of government officials to conceal government-sponsored forced labor.""

The bill hopes to open the door for other countries to stop importing goods made with forced labor from the Xinjiang region.

NBC News reported, ""Xinjiang is a resource-rich mining region, important for agricultural production, particularly cotton and tomatoes, and home to a booming industrial sector.""

Axios noted, ""Major corporations like Nike and Coca Cola had lobbied against the bill, which has far-reaching consequences for U.S. supply chains deeply integrated with Chinese industry.""

The bipartisan bill was first introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), and James P. McGovern (D-Mass.) in 2020.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act last week by an overwhelming vote of 428-1. The bill now heads to the desk of President Joe Biden.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration ""welcomes"" the legislation.

""The President welcomes the agreement by Congress on the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act,"" Psaki said in a press release. ""We agree with Congress that action can and must be taken to hold the People’s Republic of China accountable for genocide and human rights abuses and to address forced labor in Xinjiang.""

""That is why the Administration has already taken concrete measures including imposing visa restrictions, Global Magnitsky Act and other financial sanctions, export controls, import restrictions, and the release of a business advisory,"" the statement reads.

""The Administration will work closely with Congress to implement this bill to ensure global supply chains are free of forced labor, while simultaneously working to on-shore and third-shore key supply chains, including semiconductors and clean energy,"" she concluded.



China denies any human rights abuses. In April, CCP foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said accusations of forced labor or concentration camps in Xinjiang are ""lies and false information concocted by anti-China forces"" in an effort to ""undermine Xinjiang’s stability and security and curb China’s development.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-passes-uyghur-forced-labor-protection-act,2021-12-16
"Senate passes resolutions condemning Saudi Arabia, crown prince over Khashoggi murder","The United States Senate sent a strong message to Saudi Arabia and its crown prince on Thursday, passing two resolutions: 1, a bipartisan resolution to withdraw American support from the Saudi-backed war in Yemen, and 2, a unanimous resolution condemning the kingdom's involvement in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

What are the details?

A joint resolution led by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called for the ""removal of United States armed forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress."" The measure passed 56-41.

Republicans Susan Collins (Maine), Steve Daines (Mont.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Todd Young (Ind.), Rand Paul (Ky.), Jerry Moran (Kans.) and Lee voted in favor of the resolution, along with all 49 Senate Democrats. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) abstained from voting on the measure.

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told Politico that the resolution's passage was ""the Senate's first response to the Saudi royal family, and to the Trump administration."" He added that ""the disaster in Yemen is so appalling, and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi so wicked, so repulsive, that no amount of money, no amount of oil, and no amount of lies can obscure it.""

Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) offered a separate resolution ""holding Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a former Saudi journalist and columnist for The Washington Post."" The measure passed unanimously.

Following the vote on his resolution, Corker was quoted by CNN as declaring that, ""Unanimously, the United States Senate has said that the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is a strong statement...I think it speaks to the values that we hold dear, the rest of this resolution does. I'm glad the Senate is speaking with one voice unanimously towards this end.""

Sidney Powell responds after Trump campaign says she is not part of legal team: '#KrakenOnSteroids',"Sidney Powell, the headline-grabbing attorney who was seemingly part of President Donald Trump's legal team, responded late Sunday to the Trump campaign's statement that she was, in fact, never a member of the campaign's legal team.

What's the background?

In a shock move late Sunday, Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis and Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani released a statement that said:

Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own. She is not a member of the Trump Legal Team. She is also not a lawyer for the President in his personal capacity.

The announcement was, of course, surprising given that Powell appeared at a press conference last week with Trump's legal team during which she claimed widespread voter fraud had occurred through voting software. Powell was even identified on TV as a member of Trump's legal team.

Even Trump himself referred to Powell as a member of his legal team just nine days ago.

What did Powell say?

In an initial statement provided to CBS News, Powell said she was aware of the Trump team's statement and continued to claim that Trump had votes ""stolen"" in the election.

""I understand today's press release. I will continue to represent #WeThePeople who had their votes for Trump and other Republicans stolen by massive fraud through Dominion and Smartmatic, and we will be filing suit soon. The chips will fall where they may, and we will defend the foundations of this great Republic. #KrakenOnSteroids,"" she said.

In a second, more lengthy statement, Powell said she ""agreed"" that she is not a member of Trump's legal team:

I agree with the campaign's statement that I am not part of the campaign's legal team. I never signed a retainer agreement or sent the President or the campaign a bill for my expenses or fees. My intent has always been to expose all the fraud I could find and let the chips fall where they may–whether it be upon Republicans or Democrats.



The evidence I'm compiling is overwhelming that this software tool was used to shift millions of votes from President Trump and other Republican candidates to Biden and other Democrat candidates. We are proceeding to prepare our lawsuit and plan to file it this week. It will be epic. We will not allow this great Republic to be stolen by communists from without and within or our votes altered or manipulated by foreign actors.

Confusion over Powell's status, and the Trump campaign's clear attempt to distance themselves from Powell, came after Republican lawmakers and Fox News host Tucker Carlson exerted pressure on Trump's legal team to prove their voter fraud allegations.

On Sunday, even former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a staunch Trump ally, called Trump's legal team and their unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud a ""national embarrassment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sidney-powell-responds-trump-campaign-kraken-on-steroids,2020-11-23
Attorney Sidney Powell says 'no reasonable person would conclude' her claims about Dominion were facts,"Attorney Sidney Powell said Monday that Dominion Voting Systems' defamation lawsuit against her should be dismissed, arguing that its complaint was filed in the wrong jurisdiction and ""no reasonable person would conclude"" that her public claims that the company rigged last year's general election were actually ""statements of fact.""

What are the details?

Dominion filed a $1.3 billion lawsuit against Powell in early January after the pro-Trump attorney alleged during several public appearances that the company's voting machines were able to be manipulated, were involved in overturning elections in several countries, and that she would release the ""Kraken"" and prove that they had been involved in former President Donald Trump losing the election.

Powell promised during a nationally broadcasted news conference at the Republican National Committee's headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 19, 2020, that she would present evidence to prove her assertions. Shortly thereafter, the Trump campaign announced that she did not represent the campaign.

In response to Dominion's lawsuit, Powell's attorneys claimed in court filings, citing another case, that ""the 'language of the political arena, like the language used in labor disputes...is often vituperative, abusive and inexact.'""

Powell's counsel went on to assert, ""Such characterizations of the allegedly defamatory statements further support Defendants' position that reasonable people would not accept such statements as fact but view them only as claims that await testing by the courts through the adversary process.""

Claiming Powell is protected by free speech, it also argued, ""Those members of the public who were interested in the controversy were free to, and did, review that evidence and reached their own conclusions — or awaited resolution of the matter by the courts before making up their minds.""

The Washington Examiner pointed out that Powell told former Fox News host Lou Dobbs last year:

""I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact that it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one.""

Powell's claims against Dominion were tested in court and failed, but she argues in her response to the lawsuit that her statements were protected by free speech.

The pro-Trump attorney also argued in her filings that Washington, D.C., was the ""improper venue"" to file such a claim, and that it should be dismissed and transferred to the state of Texas where Powell's law firm is ""registered and domiciled.""

Dominion said in its original complaint that ""Powell's wild accusations are demonstrably false,"" arguing, ""Acting in concert with allies and media outlets that were determined to promote a false preconceived narrative about the 2020 election, Powell launched a viral disinformation campaign about Dominion that reached millions of people and caused enormous harm to Dominion.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sidney-powell-says-no-reasonable-person-would-conclude-her-claims-about-dominion-were-facts,2021-03-23
Sidney Powell says White House officials have blocked her from speaking to President Trump,"Attorney Sidney Powell says White House officials have barred her from speaking to President Donald Trump, claiming the president's ""own people are misleading and undermining him.""

What are the details?

Powell told The Washington Examiner that her access to Trump has been cut off since Friday, when the president reportedly floated the idea of appointing her to serve as a special counsel to investigate voter fraud — which was an idea shot down by some of his advisers.

""I haven't met or spoken with the President since Friday night,"" Powell told the Examiner. ""The President knows this election was stolen but he is not getting the support he, the Constitution, and the Republic deserve. His own people are misleading and undermining him while protecting their own careers and agendas.""

She added:

""I haven't spoken with the DNI on these issues at all. My efforts to educate [Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani] on demonstrable foreign interference in the election including multiple CISA and FBI findings have been met with irrational hostility. I have been blocked by White House counsel and others from seeing or speaking to the President since I raised the public formal findings and even more evidence of the foreign interference from IRAN and CHINA in this election.""

Powell became nationally recognized due to her defense of Trump's former national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, and her profile has been raised following the election with her filing of several unsuccessful ""Kraken"" lawsuits alleging widespread voter fraud.

What did the Trump campaign say?

More than a month ago, the Trump campaign publicly distanced itself from Powell, after she alleged during a campaign news conference that voting machines were manipulated nationwide to flip the election for President-elect Joe Biden as part of a widespread conspiracy involving foreign powers.

Giuliani reiterated Monday on Newsmax:

""Let me say definitively: Sidney Powell is not part of our legal team. She hasn't been for five weeks. She is not a special counsel for the president. She does not speak for the president, nor does she speak for the administration. She speaks for herself. And she's a fine woman, a fine lawyer, but whatever she is talking about, it's her own opinions. I'm not responsible for them, the president isn't, nor is anybody else on our legal team.""

On Tuesday, longtime Republican adviser and strategist Karl Rove blasted Powell, telling Fox News, ""Ms. Powell has peddled theories that have little basis in fact.""

He picked apart several witnesses that Powell has presented in court for ""Kraken"" lawsuits.

""What she has done to sort of throw mud on the president through her antics is unbelievable,"" Rove said. ""The president has been so ill-served by this crowd, and she's chief among them.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sidney-powell-says-white-house-officials-have-blocked-her-from-speaking-to-trump,2020-12-23
Sinema opposes Democrats' $3.5 trillion price tag for spending bill,"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) has upset the Democratic Party's plans to pass a $3.5 trillion spending bill that contains major components of President Joe Biden's progressive agenda, telling the Arizona Republic on Wednesday that she doesn't support the plan's price tag.

Sinema said she has reviewed the Senate Budget Committee's framework for the budget reconciliation package and told the president and Democratic leaders that she supports their goals of economic growth.

""I have also made clear that while I will support beginning this process, I do not support a bill that costs $3.5 trillion — and in the coming months, I will work in good faith to develop this legislation with my colleagues and the administration to strengthen Arizona's economy and help Arizona's everyday families get ahead,"" Sinema said in a statement.

Her opposition to the $3.5 trillion package puts Senate Democrats in a bind. With a slim 50-50 majority, Democrats cannot afford to have moderates like Sinema or Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) defect from any major vote. They need all 50 Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris' tiebreaking support to pass Biden's so-called ""human infrastructure"" priorities, which include expanding Medicare, free community college tuition, national paid family leave, extending Biden's revamped child tax credits, and various climate change policies watered down from the Green New Deal.

Democrats intended to have this $3.5 trillion advance along with a bipartisan agreement for a $1.2 trillion ""hard infrastructure"" package, which would provide funding for roads, bridges, and other projects traditionally associated with infrastructure spending.

Sinema has been working with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) to put together a deal that will win support from 10 Senate Republicans, providing the Senate with the necessary 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass compromise legislation. The White House wants a bipartisan deal very badly, as Biden had promised unity and bipartisan compromise would be key features of his presidency.

On Wednesday, Sinema met with the president to report on the progress she's made negotiating with Republicans on issues like funding for transit, broadband, and water systems. Senate Democrats believe they have a compromise that will overcome a filibuster attempt, the New York Times and Politico reported.

""While bringing both parties together can seem impossible these days, Arizonans elected me to do the hard work,"" she told the Arizona Republic. ""Our historic legislation would make the strongest investment in America's critical infrastructure in a century — creating Arizona jobs, expanding economic opportunities for our state, securing our water future, and protecting our communities from wildfires.""

However, progressive Democrats want the Biden administration to swing for the fences on progressive priorities and ignore Republicans entirely. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has vowed that the House will not bring a bipartisan infrastructure deal up for a vote unless the Senate also passes the $3.5 trillion Democratic bill, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) must force through the Senate using a process called budget reconciliation to pass it without GOP support.

She told reporters Wednesday that her position hasn't changed.

Sinema's opposition to the $3.5 trillion price tag of the reconciliation bill means Democrats will have to cut spending from the package to win her support and move it through the Senate. If they don't pass the reconciliation bill, Pelosi will ensure that the bipartisan infrastructure bill dies in the House.

Still, there's no guarantee Pelosi will allow a watered-down reconciliation bill to have vote on the House floor either. She may instead support the progressives in her conference, who are furious with Sinema and unwilling to compromise on the reconciliation package.

""We didn't elect Sinema as President and we won't let her obstruction put a Republican in the Oval Office in 2024. It's the reconciliation bill or GOP controlling every level of government again, period,"" said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).

One of two things will happen: Either pressure from progressives will cause Sinema to cave and support the full $3.5 trillion bill, or Biden will have to persuade Pelosi to take the best offer the House will get from Senate, else infrastructure will go nowhere.

South Korean president accused of 'major diplomatic mishap' after remarks insulting US caught on hot mic,"South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol was accused of a ""major diplomatic mishap"" Wednesday after his insult of the United States was caught on a hot mic.

What did Yoon say?

President Joe Biden delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in which he pledged to increase American contributions to the U.N. General Fund, action that would require congressional approval.

After meeting with Biden on Wednesday, Yoon was caught on camera insulting Congress, suggesting lawmakers may block Biden from fulfilling his promise.

""How could Biden not lose damn face if these f***ers do not pass it in Congress?"" Yoon told his aides, a comment caught on a hot mic, Agence France-Presse reported.

Park Hong-keun — the top member of South Korea's Democratic Party, the opposing party to Yoon's People Power Party — condemned Yoon and alleged his ""foul language tarnishing the U.S. Congress caused a major diplomatic mishap.""

Yoon's office, however, defended the remarks.

""He wasn't speaking publicly on the stage but in passing, and although I don't know who recorded it and how, I actually think it should be verified,"" said an official for the South Korean presidential office.



""I think it's highly inappropriate to draw a link between private remarks and diplomatic accomplishments,"" the official added, apparently referring to Park's criticism. ""It's quite regrettable that a diplomatic disaster is being talked about over something like that when he is doing everything to complete a demanding schedule in the national interest of the Republic of Korea.""

Although he has only been president since May, Yoon is unpopular. His approval rating tanked to just 24% recently before rising to a paltry 32%, AFP reported.

What did the WH say?

The White House has not responded directly to Yoon's remark.

However, after Biden informally met with Yoon, the White House released a statement explaining what the world leader's discussed.

""The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen the U.S.-ROK alliance and ensure close cooperation to address the threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK),"" the White House readout of the meeting said.

""The Presidents also discussed our ongoing cooperation on a broad range of priority issues including supply chain resilience, critical technologies, economic and energy security, global health, and climate change,"" it added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/south-korean-president-insult-congress,2022-09-22
State Department says US officials will meet with their North Korean counterparts next week,"The U.S. State Department has announced that U.S. officials will resume meetings with officials from North Korea, after initial talks broke down. The U.S. has been trying to get North Korea to agree to denuclearize.

What's the background?

After a promising first summit, President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's second summit broke down in February after Kim demanded an end to all U.S. sections against North Korea.

""It was all about the sanctions,"" Trump explained. ""They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that. They were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted, but we couldn't give up all of the sanctions for that.""

""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" he added.

While he did not remove all existing sanctions like Kim wanted, Trump did order the U.S. Treasury Department in late March not to implement planned additional sanctions.

What did the State Department say now?

""I can confirm that U.S. and (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) officials plan to meet within the next week. I do not have further details to share on the meeting,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement, according to CNN.

This comes less than a week after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly that while ""our team is prepared to meet with them, I think it's important that we do,"" they had ""not been able to make those [working level meetings] happen and we don't have a date yet when we will be able to get together.""

US State Department requires Americans fleeing Ukraine to show proof of vaccination to enter Poland despite Poland not requiring proof of vaccination for travelers,"The U.S. State Department announced Saturday that Americans fleeing Ukraine may enter Poland, but U.S. citizens must present proof of vaccination against COVID-19. This appears to be a U.S. State Department requirement since Poland does not require vaccinations against COVID-19 to enter the country.

""The security situation in Ukraine continues to be unpredictable due to the increased threats of Russian military action and can deteriorate with little notice,"" the announcement reads. ""U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately using commercial or other privately available transportation options.""



""Poland has indicated to the U.S. government that U.S. citizens may now enter Poland through the land border with Ukraine,"" the State Department bulletin notes.

According to the State Department, ""U.S. citizens must present a valid U.S. passport and proof of COVID-19 vaccination"" in order to gain entry into Poland.

""Travelers are also encouraged to present a negative test result from a PCR or antigen COVID-19 test,"" the notice states.

However, Poland doesn't require U.S. citizens to be vaccinated to enter the country.

The official website of the U.S. embassy in Poland restrictions for Americans traveling to Poland:

Starting December 15, every person arriving in Poland from outside the Schengen area has to present a negative test result from a PCR or antigen COVID-19 test to enter the country. Children who are under 5 years of age are exempt from the testing requirement. There must be no more than 24 hours between obtaining the test result and crossing the border into Poland. Vaccination does not exempt an individual from the obligation to test. These regulations will be in place until February 28, 2022.

The official government website for the Republic of Poland:

Until February 28, 2022, travelers crossing the Polish border as an external EU border are required to present to a Border Guard officer a negative diagnostic test result for SARS-CoV-2, in Polish or in English, performed within 24 hours before crossing the border and counting from the time the test result was generated (the test can be performed either in the country where the person begins his/her journey, at the airport in Poland before the border check or within 3 hours after crossing the border). Any person who fails to present a negative test result to a Border Guard officer will be required to undergo a compulsory quarantine. In the event that a test is performed after crossing the border, the procedure for releasing a traveler from quarantine rests solely with the health inspection authorities, and as such, the traveler does not have to return to the border control area.

The Polish Border Guard (Straż Graniczna) COVID-19 restrictions for travelers:

In accordance with the regulations of the Regulation of the Council of Ministers of May 6, 2021 on the establishment of certain restrictions, orders and bans in connection with the outbreak of an epidemic by February 28, 2022 - every person crossing the border of the Republic of Poland, constituting the external border (as a rule) is obliged to present a negative result of the diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 (in Polish or English) to a Border Guard officer (in Polish or English) performed, mainly before crossing the border, within 24 hours, counting from the moment of obtaining this result test.

The New York Times detailed the COVID-19 restrictions for Americans traveling to Poland:

Tourists coming from the United States may enter by air only. They can avoid a mandatory quarantine by presenting a negative test result (either P.C.R. or antigen) administered no more than 24 hours before arrival. The U.S. Embassy notes that on-arrival testing is also available at Warsaw Airport. Children under 5 are exempt from the test requirement. Anyone who fails to present a negative test result must quarantine for 14 days; however, this can be shortened if the traveler obtains a negative result on a P.C.R. test that is administered no sooner than seven days after their arrival.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/state-department-ukraine-poland-vaccination,2022-02-13
"State lawmaker joined Capitol siege — and livestreamed himself hooting, hollering as he entered building. Now colleagues want him gone.","UPDATE, 2:49 p.m. EST: A charge of entering restricted government buildings is a misdemeanor punishable by fines and up to a year in prison — but punishment could increase significantly if ""the offense results in significant bodily harm,"" McElhinny's Metro News story noted.

The charge applies to buildings that anyone protected by the Secret Service is visiting or buildings hosting an event of national significance, the outlet reported.

U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Friday said Evans should be charged to the fullest extent of the law.

""I guarantee the FBI will do their job,"" Manchin told WCHS-AM, according to Metro News. ""I don't know the person. It's very, very bad judgment. Very poor judgment.""

UPDATE, 2:23 p.m. EST: Derrick Evans, a Republican state lawmaker from West Virginia, was federally charged Friday for entering a restricted area in connection with his participation in the siege of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, according to Brad McElhinny, statewide correspondent for West Virginia Metro News.

McElhinny tweeted that the news came during a national call with Department of Justice officials and that more details are coming.

Original story below

A West Virginia Republican lawmaker livestreamed himself hooting and hollering while taking part in Wednesday's siege of the U.S. Capitol — and now his colleagues from both parties want him gone, the Associated Press reported.

What are the details?

State Del. Derrick Evans wore a helmet as he and other supporters of President Donald Trump pushed their way inside the building, the AP said, citing the now-deleted video.

But the video is still readily available on the internet. In the portion of the video below, Evans yelled at one point, ""Trump! Trump! Woooo!"" He apparently added in another clip that doesn't show his face, ""The door's cracked! Yes! We're going in! ... They're in! They're in! They're in!""

And as a shield blocked the rioters' way inside, Evans apparently can be heard chanting, ""Move! Move!""

West Virginia Delegate Derrick Evans Records Himself Storming U.S. Capitol youtu.be

The AP said video also showed Evans imploring others to not vandalize artwork and busts inside the grand Capitol Rotunda, where historic paintings depict the republic's founding.

""Our house!"" Evans yelled inside the Capitol halls, the outlet added. ""I don't know where we're going. I'm following the crowd.""

More from the AP:

Evans, a vocal conservative activist with more than 30,000 followers on Facebook, has not publicly posted on social media since issuing a statement Wednesday that he attended the events as an ""independent member of the media to film history."" He took his Twitter account private late Wednesday and didn't respond to emailed questions.

What did Evans' colleagues have to say?

Roger Hanshaw, the Republican speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates, told the outlet Wednesday night that Evans will need to ""answer to his constituents and colleagues"" for his actions.

The AP also said Democratic leadership called for his prosecution, and about 40,000 people signed a petition on change.org asking for Evans' removal. The chairwoman of the state GOP, Melody Potter, declined to answer questions about Evans, the outlet noted.

What did Evans' attorney have to say?

Attorney John Bryan is representing Evans and told the AP that his client will not resign despite a bipartisan effort to expel him.



""He committed no criminal act that day,"" Bryan said in a Thursday statement, the outlet noted. ""At no point was Mr. Evans located in the crowd on the West side of the (Capitol) building, nor anywhere else on the Capitol grounds, where violence and destruction of property was, or had been, occurring,"" the AP said.

But two U.S. Attorneys in West Virginia noted to the outlet in a statement that they are in touch with attorneys in other states and are ""prepared to enforce the Rule of Law and the laws of these United States.""

More from the AP:

Like several other political first-time winners in November's West Virginia elections, Evans swept aside a Democratic rival to win his seat representing Wayne County. High GOP turnout credited to Trump elevated down-ballot Republicans in the state and gave the party a statehouse supermajority.

Anything else?

Lawmakers from other states attended Wednesday's pro-Trump rally in Washington, D.C., which stood in opposition to the election of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, the outlet said.

More from the AP:

Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano said he helped organize a bus ride to the demonstrations but left the U.S. Capitol area after the eruption of violence, which he called ""unacceptable."" The top Democrat in the Pennsylvania Senate, and eight of his colleagues, want him to resign, saying his actions and words disputing the election's integrity encouraged a coup attempt and inspired the people behind it.



Tennessee state Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver said Wednesday night that it had been an ""epic and historic day."" The Republican lawmaker told The Tennessean she was ""in the thick of it"" but hadn't seen any violence. Weaver did not respond to emailed questions from The Associated Press about whether she entered the Capitol.



Incoming Nevada state Assemblywoman Annie Black, a Republican, said she marched from the White House to the U.S. Capitol, where she saw men on megaphones revving the crowd to storm the security barrier. She said she retreated to avoid being associated with the mob.

""We all had a choice when that fence came down,"" she said, according to the outlet. ""Whether it was our group that incited that to happen or another group, every single person had the choice to make.""

Republican Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem posted photos of himself attending the protest outside the Capitol, the AP said. Finchem's office told the outlet he observed from afar, yet liberal groups in the state want him expelled for backing the effort to overturn the election, the outlet added.

More from the AP:

Virginia state Sen. Amanda Chase, an outspoken Trump supporter who is running for governor, attended the president's rally Wednesday in which Trump urged supporters to march to the Capitol. Chase said in a Facebook video that she left near the end of the rally on the advice of her security team, and there is no indication she was part of the group that stormed the Capitol.



Republican state Reps. David Eastman of Alaska and Justin Hill of Missouri both said they went to Washington to object to the Electoral College votes of several states confirming Biden's election, but didn't participate in the demonstrations.

Hill said the Trump rally was ""very peaceful,"" the outlet reported.

""But what I saw at the Capitol was not the same people,"" he added. ""I wasn't there rallying troops to overthrow the government.""

Store manager yells 'f*** Donald Trump' at man with pro-Trump face mask. Manager now out of a job.,"A Bath & Body Works manager is no longer employed by her Arizona store after yelling ""f*** Donald Trump"" at a passerby wearing a face mask supporting the president, the Arizona Republic reported.

What are the details?

Jeremiah Cota, director of strategic initiatives for AZ Trump Victory, tweeted Friday that he was ""accosted"" by the store's manager ""simply for wearing a Trump face mask. She yelled at me 'F*** Donald Trump' while I was simply walking by the store. I went to ask if I misheard her and she said no.""

In Cota's clip of the short chat with the woman — whose name tag reads ""Karren,"" the paper reported — she acknowledges that she's the manager and that she indeed told Cota ""f*** Donald Trump.""

Her reason? ""Yeah, because that's how I feel,"" she adds.

Here's the video. ( Content warning: Language):

Cota tagged Bath & Body Works in his tweet, saying the company was guilty of ""poor customer service."" He added in a subsequent tweet that the incident took place at Scottsdale Fashion Square.

What happened next?

Trump Victory Committee spokesperson Keith Schipper told the Republic that Bath & Body Works in a phone call said ""how very sorry they were"" for what happened to Cota and that they ""respect all beliefs.""

Bath & Body Works also confirmed with the paper that it connected with Cota to share its ""deepest apologies.""

""We absolutely do not condone these actions as all customers should be treated with respect,"" the statement read, according to the Republic.

Bath & Body Works added to the Republic that the company no longer employed the manager, whose name was not released, but didn't immediately respond to the paper's question regarding if she was fired or quit.

'Intolerance'

Schipper also told the Republic that Cota hasn't been deterred from wearing his Trump mask and that the incident was one of many cases of ""intolerance"" toward Trump supporters.

""All of our hopes is that there can just be more tolerance so supporters of the president don't have to have their head on a swivel, looking over their shoulder, wondering who's going to accost them,"" he told the paper.

The virus continues its spread

Trump Derangement Syndrome is still infecting leftists and is showing no signs of dying down. As TheBlaze has previously reported, leftists sometimes turn cranky at pro-Trump objects. For instance, one individual outside a recent Bernie Sanders' rally didn't fare too well when a security guard took issue with his Trump 2020 flag.

Leftists also have been know to flip out at other visual reminders of their president, such as ""Make America Great Again"" hats:

They've also resorted to taking off or knocking the caps off their heads, spitting at the wearers, and actually stealing the hats as video runs:

Students who harassed Border Patrol officers during campus presentation face criminal charges,"Two college students face criminal charges after harassing Border Patrol agents visiting the University of Arizona in March.

What's the brief history on this?

The students harassed the Border Patrol agents during an event to benefit criminal justice majors at the University of Arizona.

Agents were addressing a classroom full of students when protesters converged on the classroom and commanded attention. The demonstrators compared the agents to the Ku Klux Klan, called them ""murder patrol,"" and later followed the agents to their cars.

""I don't know who allowed the murder patrol. They allow murderers to be on campus where I pay to be here. Murderers! On campus. Murderers on campus!"" one student can be heard yelling in a video of the incident.



Other students ended up phoning authorities over the students' behaviors.

(Content warning: Rough language):

So what's happening now?

On Monday, the Arizona Republic reported that authorities arrested two students in connection with the purported harassment.

Robert Robbins, the president of the University of Arizona, confirmed that two university students will be charged with misdemeanors in connection with the incident.

A portion of a letter from Robbins read, ""The incident between the protesting students and the Criminal Justice club members was a dramatic departure from our expectations of respectful behavior and support for free speech on this campus.""

Robbins said that university police charged two students with ""interference with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution.""

""At the core of these inquiries is the University of Arizona's commitment to free speech,"" Robbins' letter added. ""The student club and the CBP officers invited by the students should have been able to hold their meeting without disruption.

'The time for civility is over': Angry pro-abortion activists stage protests outside homes of Supreme Court justices in 'vigil' for Roe v. Wade; more protests planned,"Pro-abortion activists marched to the residences of Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday night. The protests right outside of the homes of the Supreme Court justices were backlash to a leaked draft decision that indicates that the U.S. Supreme Court could potentially overturn the controversial Roe v. Wade decision.

Roughly 100 pro-abortion activists gathered outside the homes of the Supreme Court justices in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The flyer for the demonstration called for ""reproductive freedom.""

In videos posted to social media, protesters are heard chanting, ""Keep abortion safe and legal,"" ""You don't care if people die,"" ""The whole world is watching,"" ""We will not go back,"" and ""My body, my choice.""

The protesters drew hangers outside the homes of the Supreme Court justices. The pro-abortion activists held up signs that read, ""F*** your God"" and ""Abortion is healthcare.""





Douglas Blair – a news producer at the Daily Signal who covered the protests – noted, ""The energy is markedly more negative outside Kavanaugh’s house. The anger has become much more palpable than outside any other justices’ house.""



""The time for civility is over, man,"" a protester told Bloomberg. ""Being polite doesn’t get you anywhere.""

Another protester called the possible overturning of Roe V. Wade ""bulls**t,"" and said, ""You don't get to take away our bodily autonomy and enjoy your Saturday night at home – you get to do one or the other.""

""This is personal, so we're going to take it to the personal space,"" the activist said. ""They did this, not us.""

Police showed up to disperse the protesters. One police officer appears to be informing the protesters that the demonstration is a violation of 18 U.S. Code § 1507 – Picketing or parading.

18 U.S.C. § 1507 states:

Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the United States, or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

It was not clear if either justice and their family were at the residences during the protests. Kavanaugh has two daughters – both of whom are minors. Roberts has two adopted children.



Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the planned protests outside the homes of U.S. Supreme Court justices, and she said, ""We certainly encourage people to keep it peaceful and not resort to any level of violence.""

The far-left activist organization ShutDown DC has already planned a march at the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.

The evening of Monday, May 9, we will hold a vigil for all these rights that Alito is threatening to take away. Because it’s been impossible to reach him at the Supreme Court (especially now with the enormous fences), we will do it at his home. At 7:30 pm we will gather at a nearby location and walk together to his house. At the foot of his driveway, on the public street, we will light candles and speakers will share their testimony. We will hold a moment of silence for the rights we know are ours, then walk back together to the meeting location.

Ruth Sent Us — another far-left activist group named after late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — announced a ""Walk-By Wednesday"" protest on May 11 ""at the homes of the six extremist justices, three in Virginia and three in Maryland.""

Last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) floated the idea that the leaked opinion was done so to ""intimidate"" the justices.

""The next time you hear the far left preaching about how they are fighting to preserve our Republic’s institutions & norms remember how they leaked a Supreme Court opinion in an attempt to intimidate the justices on abortion,” Rubio wrote on Twitter.



On Friday, CNN warned that the leak of the Supreme Court potentially overturning Roe v. Wade could ignite protests by the ""far-right.""

""CNN has learned that the U.S. Capitol police are bracing for large demonstrations that are being organized by far-right groups to protest abortion rights,"" said CNN guest host Alex Marquardt.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-justices-abortion-protests-homes,2022-05-08
Taiwan reports Chinese aircraft in its air defense zone after Russia invaded Ukraine,"Nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone, Taiwan's defense ministry said Thursday, on the same day that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Tawian reported eight J-16 sorties and one Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft flying over an area to the northeast of the Pratas Islands, at the top end of the South China Sea, which prompted the island nation to scramble its air force. According to Reuters, the number of aircraft involved in the incursion is smaller than the last large-scale incident, when 39 Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwanese territory on Jan. 23.

China claims Taiwan, the seat of the exiled Republic of China government, as its own territory, and over the past two years it has regularly conducted fly-over missions in Taiwanese air space.

Taiwanese fighters were deployed to warn the Chinese aircraft to back off and air defense missiles were set up to ""monitor the activities,"" the defense ministry said, according to Reuters.

The government in Taipei is paying close attention to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the response from Western governments over concerns that China may use the situation to move against the island.

Chinese officials have dismissed comparisons between the situation in Ukraine, where Russia has claimed historical ties to the region as a pretext to invade, and China's relationship with Taiwan.



On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry said that Taiwan is ""not Ukraine"" and claimed the territory has always been part of China. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made those remarks responding to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have widespread consequences, including for Taiwan, if the western nations failed to rally to support Ukraine.

""Taiwan is not Ukraine,"" Hua said while speaking in Beijing. ""Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact.""

After Russia began its attack on Thursday, Hua refused to condemn Putin's actions and urged western nations to refrain from intervening.

""We are closely following the situation and we need more information to make our judgement, isn't that enough?"" Hua said.



U.S. defense officials have previously warned there is an ""urgent"" need to strengthen Taiwan's defenses against the ""real and dangerous"" possibility of an attempt by China to invade the nation.

""Bolstering Taiwan's defenses is an urgent task,"" Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said in December. ""We are modernizing our capabilities, updating U.S. force posture and developing new operational concepts.""

Reacting to U.S. policy in the region, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said Thursday that Taiwan remains a ""core issue"" for China and that foreign interference will not be tolerated, Reuters reported.

""We urge the U.S. side to recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue,"" Tan said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taiwan-reports-chinese-aircraft-in-its-air-defense-zone-after-russia-invaded-ukraine,2022-02-24
"Taliban militants fire into crowd to disperse protests, reportedly kill at least three people and injure dozens","Anti-Taliban protests have broken out in Afghanistan as the radical Islamist military organization works to establish a new government, having overthrown the one backed by the United States. At least three people were reportedly killed in the eastern city of Jalalabad when Taliban militants opened fire at a protest against the removal of the Afghan national flag.

Reports indicate hundreds of protesters also took to the streets in Khost province, according to Al Jazeera.

In Jalalabad, street demonstrators and journalists were beaten by Taliban soldiers, who squashed the public display of dissent. The Taliban seized control of the city, which is about 80 miles east of the capital Kabul, four days ago after negotiating a surrender from local leaders. Taliban soldiers are patrolling the city streets with pickup trucks seized from the police force, which has been disbanded, the New York Times reports.

The protesters were carrying large flags of the Afghan Republic and shouting their defiance at the new government. Taliban soldiers first fired warning shots into the air, but the protesters would not disperse. Then the Taliban used violence, reportedly killing at least three people and injuring dozens more.

Publicly, spokesmen for the Taliban maintain that the reinstated Islamist regime will not have the same despotic character as the last Taliban government that ruled Afghanistan. The new government will be an ""inclusive, Islamic government,"" one that will respect women's rights and invite them to participate in government as long as they follow Sharia law, the Taliban claims. But Afghans who remember the old regime, which carried out public executions by stoning at a soccer stadium; barred women from work and girls from school; and banned television, videos, and music; those Afghans have sought to flee the country.

Images and video of the Taliban violently breaking up public dissent has undermined their claims of forming a new, peaceful government.

The violent response to these protests follows reports of executions and forced marriages in parts of Afghanistan the Taliban seized before taking control of Kabul. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen has denied the accuracy of these reports, claiming that if such atrocities are happening, they are ""not Taliban.""

Taliban leaders are reportedly meeting with former Afghanistan officials, including former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official in the deposed government, to negotiate the establishment of a new Islamic government, according to the Associated Press.

Meanwhile, hundreds of Afghan citizens are still flocking to the international airport in Kabul, seeking to leave the country. The Taliban has established a checkpoint and is demanding that would-be evacuees show documents before being let inside the airport. When a passenger is let through, which happens rarely, dozens of people attempt to rush through the gate, which provokes more warning shots from Taliban soldiers to disperse the crowds.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-militants-fire-into-crowd-to-disperse-protests,2021-08-18
Ted Cruz and John Brennan battle on Twitter over Logan Act,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former CIA director John Brennan traded barbs regarding the killing of Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.

""This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict,"" Brennan wrote on Twitter. ""Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits.""



""I do not know whether a foreign government authorized or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh,"" Brennan continued. ""Such an act of state-sponsored terrorism would be a flagrant violation of international law & encourage more governments to carry out lethal attacks against foreign officials.""

""These assassinations are far different than strikes against terrorist leaders & operatives of groups like al-Qaida & Islamic State, which are not sovereign states,"" he tweeted. ""As illegitimate combatants under international law, they can be targeted in order to stop deadly terrorist attacks.""

Cruz reacted by saying, ""It's bizarre to see a former head of the CIA consistently side with Iranian zealots who chant 'Death to America.' And reflexively condemn Israel. Does Joe Biden agree?""

Brennan, who was director of the CIA between 2013 and 2017, retorted, ""It is typical for you to mischaracterize my comment.""

""Your lawless attitude & simple-minded approach to serious national security matters demonstrate that you are unworthy to represent the good people of Texas,"" Brennan said, besmirching the senator.

Cruz then hit back, by pointing out that Brennan voted for Gus Hall, a U.S. Communist Party candidate who only secured 0.07% of the vote in 1976.

""Gosh, I touched a nerve. Facts matter,"" Cruz tweeted. ""FACT 1: you've admitted, in 1976 you voted for the Communist candidate for President because, I guess, Jimmy Carter wasn't liberal enough for you.""

Then the Texas senator took aim at the Obama administration's cozy relationship with the Iranian government.

""FACT 2: you gave $150 Bn to Ayatollah Khamenei, knowing it would be used to kill Americans,"" Cruz said.

The two then exchanged blows about the Logan Act, which ""forbids private citizens from engaging in unauthorized correspondence with foreign governments,"" and nobody has been indicted on the legislation since 1852.

""@tedcruz is now misrepresenting the Logan Act. Apparently, he is a poor Senator & a bad lawyer,"" Brennan wrote. ""A private citizen publicly criticizing what could be a state-sponsored assassination of a government official & cautioning against retaliatory killing is called freedom of speech.""

""In contrast, an individual tapped to be National Security Advisor (but not yet one) in an incoming Administration who privately contacts a foreign government official & advises how to conduct relations with the U.S. could be in violation of the Logan Act,"" Brennan said.

""My commitment to Israel's security & my efforts to counter Iran's malign activities are well documented throughout my 33 years of national security work serving Republican & Democratic Administrations,"" Brennan stated, then attacked Cruz. ""Aside from his tiresome rhetoric, what has Senator Cruz ever done?""



Cruz fired back, ""Ok, let's apply your proffered standard: Ben Rhodes has publicly stated, 'foreign leaders are already having phone calls with Joe Biden, talking about the agenda they're going to pursue on Jan. 20.' Does that mean you think Joe Biden should be prosecuted under the Logan Act?""

""The only coherent answer is NO, neither Biden nor Gen. Flynn violated the Logan Act bc it's unconstitutional—which is why nobody has been convicted of violating it in the history of the US,"" Cruz contended. ""But you want to use it as a partisan cudgel, a weapon to attack your political opponents.""

Fakhrizadeh, who was considered the top architect of Iran's nuclear program, was gunned down in a road ambush in broad daylight on Friday. The black sedan the scientist was traveling in was riddled with bullets.



Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the assassination was ""an act of state terror,"" there were ""serious indications"" of Israeli involvement.

On Saturday, Iran's supreme leader promised to retaliate for the killing of Fakhrizadeh. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demanded that Iranian officials make a pledge into ""pursuing this crime and punishing its perpetrators and those who commanded it.""

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani vowed that the Islamic republic ""will respond in time to the assassination of Martyr Fakhrizadeh.""



""Once again, the evil hands of Global Arrogance and the Zionist mercenaries were stained with the blood of an Iranian son,"" Rouhani added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-john-brennan-iran-logan-act,2020-11-28
Starbucks kicks out Arizona police officers on July Fourth because customer 'did not feel safe',"An Arizona Starbucks employee kicked out Tempe police officers on July Fourth after a customer complained they ""did not feel safe"" in the presence of law enforcement officers.

Six Tempe officers were waiting for their coffee at the front of the restaurant before starting their holiday shift when a barista approached them, KSAV-TV reported.

The barista requested the officers move out of the complaining customer's line-of-sight or leave the coffee house altogether. The officers then left as requested, the Tempe Officers Association explained on Twitter.

Two of the officers were also military veterans.

In a statement, TOA president Rob Ferraro denounced the hostile reaction police officers increasingly face in public.

""It's become accepted to not trust or to see police and think that we're not here to serve you, and again, it goes back to — we take great pride of the level of customer service we provide to citizens, and to be looked at as feeling unsafe when you have law enforcement around you is somewhat perplexing to me,"" he told KSAV.

While the TOA did not necessarily advocate for a Starbucks boycott, the organization posted a picture on social media Friday that said ""Dump Starbucks""

Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges expressed remorse over the incident.

""We have a deep respect for the Tempe Police and their service to the community,"" he told The Arizona Republic. ""We've reached out to the Tempe Police Department and Tempe Officers Association to better understand what happened and apologize. We want everyone in our stores to feel welcomed and the incident described is not indicative of what we want any of our customers to feel in our stores.""

However, Borges declined to comment on possible disciplinary action against the employee who requested the officers leave.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tempe-police-officers-arizona-kicked-out,2019-07-06
"Tennessee mayor lowers town's American flag on day of Biden inauguration, sparks massive criticism. But he's sticking to his guns.","A Tennessee mayor lowered his town's American flag to half-staff in mourning for the country on the day of President Joe Biden's inauguration. He posted about lowering the flag on Facebook.

While many critics accused him of trying to incite anger with the post, the mayor insisted that his post had nothing to do with Biden's inauguration.

What are the details?

Bruceton Mayor Robert T. Keeton III announced Wednesday that the town is grieving for the nation for various reasons.

In the Facebook post, Keeton wrote, ""The Town of Bruceton grieves for our Republic and our loss of freedoms. We mourn the victims of the Chinese plague and those that have suffered its depredations. We pray that God delivers and restores us and that we do not fall to the clutches of communism.""

Keeton's Facebook post drew a plethora of attention, which forced him on Thursday to clarify the intent of the original posting, which remains active at the time of this reporting.

As highlighted by WSMV-TV, one commenter wrote, ""This is one of the most unpatriotic things I have ever seen. As friends and neighbors die from COVID and our nation hurts, you use the town page to air your personal grievances? This is not the way to promote Bruceton as a nice place to live. Shame on you.""

Another critic added, ""This is a slap in the face of all of our military heroes and leaders who have sacrificed their lives for this country. That's why we lower the flag. Mayor, you're placing the importance of your own personal, childish pouting on the same level with the men and women who have died fighting for you. This is shameless. I'm embarrassed for my friends who live in Bruceton.""

""This is a flagrant incitement of anger and disunity on a public platform,"" another person added. ""The mayor is not The Town of Bruceton. Was this statement approved by the city council? It seems like it is pandering to the worst characteristics of human nature. I expect better of my elected representatives.""



Keeton fires back

The Jackson Sun reported that Keeton, also a lawyer, said that the post was ""just a commentary and prayer for our country.""

""I'm an attorney, and I'm seeing our constitutional rights being trampled on virtually every day, and I'm concerned for our republic, even though I've lost people that I know to this Chinese virus,"" he explained.

The outlet added, ""Keeton said he's concerned with what he's seeing in the country starting with social media platforms not allowing certain communication to remain on their sites. Twitter and Facebook recently banned former President Donald Trump from posting on their sites in the final two weeks of his presidency, and Apple and Google removed the social media platform Parler – which had become a site many conservatives were going to once they felt they were being censored on Facebook and Twitter – from being available to download and access through their platforms.""

He proclaimed, ""That's not right, and the government isn't doing anything about it. And I was raised that everyone had the right to say what they wanted to, and if someone disagreed with you, then that's the way it is.""

Keeton added that the lowering of the flag had nothing to do with Biden's inauguration.

“If anyone thinks this was because of the inauguration happening today or anything else, it's not,"" Keeton insisted. “We had a man in his mid-60s who called up to City Hall from the nursing home that died yesterday from the virus. He was in the nursing home alone and he died alone, and my post was a reaction to that and everything that's happened because of it.""

Texas GOP chairman Allen West floats secession in reaction to SCOTUS shooting down election suit,"Allen West, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, suggested Friday that some states secede from the United States in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court turning down his state's lawsuit seeking to overturn election results in four other states.

What are the details?

West, a former Florida congressman, issued a statement, saying:

""The Supreme Court, in tossing the Texas lawsuit that was joined by seventeen states and 106 US congressman (sic), have decreed that a state can take unconstitutional actions and violate its own election law. Resulting in damaging effects on other states that abide by the law, while the guilty state suffers no consequences. This decision establishes a precedent that says states can violate the US constitution and not be held accountable. This decision will have far reaching ramifications for the future or our constitutional republic. Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the constitution.""

He added, ""The Texas GOP will always stand for the Constitution and for the rule of law even while others don't.""

The word ""Confederacy"" began trending on Twitter following the decision and West's remarks.

But not all Republicans who supported the suit agreed with West. Arkansas GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman, who signed on in support of Texas' litigation, issued a statement calling for unity in the country.

Westerman said, in part:

""Although there are other election lawsuits in courts around the country, I believe the Texas attorney general's case was the best and likely last opportunity for SCOTUS to hear claims of fraudulent voting that could have had an impact on the presidential election results...SCOTUS rejected the case, and I believe closed the books on challenges to the 2020 election results.""

He added, ""The only milestone left in completing the election process will be Congress counting the votes on January 6. The casting of electoral votes will end a hotly contested election, and we should come together as Americans to work together for the future of our country.""

Another House Republican, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) called for West's termination over the statement, tweeting, ""I believe @TexasGOP should immediately retract this, apologize, and fire Allen West and anyone else associated with this. My guy Abraham Lincoln and the Union soldiers already told you no.""

President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and their campaign have filed dozens of lawsuits nationwide seeking to overturn what they call a ""rigged"" election that has been widely called for Democratic nominee Joe Biden by mainstream media. The Trump camp has not been successful in their litigation efforts.

Two cases filed separately by pro-Trump politicians seeking to challenge state election results have now been rejected by the Supreme Court.

Earlier this week, the high court turned down a lawsuit led by Rep. Mike Kelly (R), which sought to reject mail-in ballots filed in his home state of Pennsylvania.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-gop-chairman-allen-west-floats-secession-in-reaction-to-scotus-shooting-down-election-suit,2020-12-12
Texas files election challenge in Supreme Court against four battleground states,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit directly with the U.S. Supreme Court, accusing officials in four battleground states of exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to make unconstitutional last-minute changes to mail-in voting rules.

Paxton, a vocal supporter of President Trump, argues that officials in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin ""violated statutes enacted by their duly elected legislatures"" in order to allow for increased mail-in balloting, thereby violating the Constitution. Because of the states' mail-in vote meddling, he alleges at present that electors for the states should not be allowed to cast their Electoral College votes.

""The four states exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to justify ignoring federal and state election laws and unlawfully enacting last-minute changes, thus skewing the results of the 2020 General Election,"" reads a Tuesday press release announcing the lawsuit. ""The battleground states flooded their people with unlawful ballot applications and ballots while ignoring statutory requirements as to how they were received, evaluated and counted.""

The lawsuit, which includes similar allegations made by President Trump and his allies, was filed on the ""safe harbor deadline"" for states to settle election disputes and lock in their presidential electors, but ahead of the Dec. 14 Electoral College vote. In the suit, Paxton is requesting that the Supreme Court delay the Electoral College vote and allow for investigations into election fraud to be completed.

""Their failure to abide by the rule of law casts a dark shadow of doubt over the outcome of the entire election,"" Paxton stated in the press release. ""We now ask that the Supreme Court step in to correct this egregious error.""

Paxton was able to file the suit with the Supreme Court because the high court has exclusive jurisdiction over legal disputes between states, the Hill noted. In the filing, the Texas attorney general also argued that the nation's highest court is the only judicial body capable of handling such an important case dealing with the Electoral College.

If the court should fail to intervene before the Electoral College vote is cast, ""a grave cloud will hang over not only the presidency but also the republic,"" Paxton argued.

The filing was met with immediate criticism from some officials in the four battleground states.

""The motion filed by the Texas attorney general is a publicity stunt, not a serious legal pleading,"" blasted Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in a statement. ""The erosion of confidence in our democratic system isn't attributable to the good people of Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia or Pennsylvania but rather to partisan officials, like Mr. Paxton, who place loyalty to a person over loyalty to their country.""

Katie Byrd, spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, argued that Paxton ""is constitutionally, legally and factually wrong"" about the state.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-sues-four-battleground-states,2020-12-08
I am grateful for one of God's greatest blessings to mankind — the free market,"First of all, thank you for coming to my free market Ted Talk, and I'd like to acknowledge that you here reading this sentence are among the blessed few who actually read an article instead of simply react to the headline.

So now, let's talk about the free market.

It really should be four words, not two. People often use the word ""capitalism"" to refer to the free market system, but historically, this appears to be a term used to deride those proponents of the free market. The word ""capitalism"" implies that the system is set up to benefit only those with capital, not all participants.

I think even a cursory review of poverty statistics over the last hundred years shows this is simply not true. Across the globe, millions of people have had their lives improved when the free market is allowed to allocate resources to achieve the most effective and profitable outcome for everyone involved.

This is why I think it should be referred to instead as the ""blessed free market system."" I admit, this change in nomenclature would be an uphill battle.

In so many ways, the free market has improved our lives to such a degree that it would be completely impossible for the vast majority of humanity to imagine living like their forebears did just a hundred years ago. Compare this to those living a thousand years ago. Their circumstances did not change or improve much from generation to generation for countless years. But thanks to the free market system and the societies that implemented the circumstances for it to flourish, our quality of life has improved incredibly quickly.

Here is the section that will upset many people on the right, but I must state out of good conscience and intellectual honesty. It would be absurd to sing the praises of the free market without acknowledging the abuses. Wherever there is a good thing granted to humanity by God, there will be terrible humans to take advantage of it and ruin it for others. This is of course the same with the free market.

I will not address all the critiques of the free market system except to point out one major fallacy that underlines many of them. Many, though not all, of the critics of the free market do not compare it to other systems already in place in the world but instead compare it to a magical concept of a utopian ideal that exists only in their minds. This is irrational for all the obvious reasons that readers can ascertain for themselves.

This is not to say that we should never criticize our particular expression of the free market. A great theory can be implemented in various different ways, and we should be allowed to criticize its various applications in aid of seeking to improve it for all members of our society.

Lastly, it is important to note that this system is not good because it will make you happy. It won't. The ability to make money and save money and invest money is a good thing. But as the founders noted about the republic they created for us, it cannot give you happiness; it can only give you the opportunity to pursue your own happiness.

And that brings us to Thanksgiving. The holiday where we pause to visit with friends and family and remember what really makes us happy. Wealth doesn't make us happy, but instead it gives us the opportunity to seek those relationships that truly make our life blessed on this miraculous Earth.

So enjoy your time with friends and family, and be grateful for all the blessings God has given you. Including the blessed free market system.

That's it. Thank you again for coming to my Ted Talk. Enjoy your turkey, and in all things, be thankful to God.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thanksgiving-free-market-capitalism-thanks,2020-11-26
"World wakes up to all-out war: Ukraine says more than 40 soldiers, 10 civilians killed during ongoing invasion; Putin issues ominous threats to West as Ukraine declares martial law","All-out war is unfolding across Ukraine as Russian forces have invaded the neighboring country.

What are the details?

Ukraine officials say that more than 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians have been killed thus far in the early hours of the Russian invasion as explosions have rocked cities across Ukraine.

In response to the violent attacks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared martial law.

Residents have taken to the highways in an attempt to to flee Ukrainian capital Kyiv, while others have taken to subway stations as fortified, improvised bunkers.

Ukraine Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, noting that Russia is on a ""path of evil,"" comparing Russian President Vladimir Putin's attack to that of Adolf Hitler.

In Thursday remarks, Zelenskyy called for ""everyone who is able"" to join the military and called on veterans to help.

Putin took to the airwaves early Thursday morning and issued disturbing threats while detailing the invasion — which he referred to as a ""special military operation.""

In a series of implausible remarks, he claimed that two ""people's republics"" — Ukrainian regions of Donbas — of Donetsk and Luhansk ""turned to Russian with a request for help.""

In response, Putin said, he vowed to ""demilitarize"" and ""deNazify"" Ukraine, which he claimed had been subjected to genocide.

""Our actions are self-defense against threats,"" he falsely claimed. ""We do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone. ... NATO supports Ukrainian neo-Nazis ... our actions are self-defense against threats.""

He concluded, ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history. We are ready for any development of events. All necessary decisions in this regard have been made. I hope that I have been heard.""



You can read more on the background here.

What else?

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed to hand down the ""harshest ever sanctions"" against Russian in response to the ""barbaric attack,"" threatening to ""weaken Russia's economic base"" as well as its ""capacity to modernize.""

""We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets,” Von der Leyen told reporters during the early hours of Thursday morning. “We condemn this barbaric attack and the cynical arguments that are being used to justify it.”

She added, “These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war. And we know that millions of Russians do not want war. We will not allow President [Vladimir] Putin to replace the rule of law, by the rule of force, and ruthlessness. Ukraine will prevail.""

NATO member states Estonia, Latvia, Lithiuania, and Poland have all triggered NATO Article 4, CNN reported, to ""launch consultations within the alliance over Russia's attack on Ukraine.""

“The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any of the Parties is threatened,” Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty states. While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, previous invocations of NATO Article 4 have resulted in a NATO response to include military aid and more.

Later Thursday morning, CNN reported that NATO is set to ""increase land, sea, and air forces on its eastern flank"" amid the attack.

In a statement, the security alliance said, ""Russia’s actions pose a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security, and they will have geostrategic consequences. NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the security and defense of all Allies.""

“We are deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the Alliance, as well as additional maritime assets,"" the statement continued. ""We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.""

“Today, we have held consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty,"" the statement concluded. ""We have decided, in line with our defensive planning to protect all Allies, to take additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defense across the Alliance. Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.""

President Joe Biden on Wednesday night condemned the attack.

Indiana AG vows investigation into doctor who gave 10-year-old girl abortion: 'We’re going to fight this to the end',"The physician at the center of a national story about a 10-year-old rape victim could become the target of an investigation herself, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R) disclosed on Wednesday.

What is the background?

Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an Indianapolis OB/GYN and abortion advocate, told multiple news outlets that she provided care to a 10-year-old girl from Ohio after being contacted by a child abuse doctor in the Buckeye State last month.

According to Bernard, the child was pregnant — six weeks and three days — but could not receive an abortion in Ohio after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

The story raised significant red flags because, despite being repeated by national news outlets and even President Joe Biden, no one had independently corroborated the story. Even Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost (R) said this week that his office had heard ""not a whisper anywhere"" about the victim or the perpetrator.

The tragic story was ultimately confirmed after police arrested 27-year-old Gershon Fuentes, an immigrant in the U.S. illegally, for the heinous crime on Tuesday.

What did Rokita say?

Speaking with Fox News host Jesse Watters, Rokita said his office will investigate Bernard because she purportedly failed to disclose the case to law enforcement.

Indiana's mandatory reporting law requiresany person who suspects child abuse to report the incident to law enforcement.

""We have this abortion activist acting as a doctor with a history of failing to report,"" Rokita said. ""So, we’re gathering the evidence as we speak, and we’re going to fight this to the end, including looking at [Bernard’s] licensure if she failed to report. In Indiana it’s a crime to intentionally not report.



""This is a child, and there’s a strong public interest in understanding if someone under the age of 16 or under the age of 18 or really any woman is having an abortion in our state,"" he added. ""And then if a child is being sexually abused, of course parents need to know, authorities need to know, public policy experts need to know. We all need to know as citizens in a free republic so we can stop this.""

Rotika went on to blast Bernard and the media for allegedly having ""politicized"" the tragic story ""for the gain of killing more babies.""

""They were right there jumping in on all this, thinking that it was gonna be great for their abortionist movement when this girl has been so brutalized,"" Rotika said.

Anything else?

Bernard released a statement Wednesday after news of Fuentes' arrest broke.

""My heart breaks for all survivors of sexual assault and abuse. I am so sad that our country is failing them when they need us most,"" Bernard said. ""Doctors must be able to give people the medical care they need, when and where they need it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/todd-rokita-investigation-caitlin-bernard,2022-07-14
Democrats claim PAC money is evil — but most of the Top 20 labor PAC contributions have gone to Dems. And it's not even close.,"Democrats have cried for years that America must get money out of politics. They claim that big money has a corrupting influence on our elections — and point to political action committees, or PACs, that are allegedly bringing down our republic (well, they call it a ""democracy"" — tomato, tomahto).

Therefore, because they are holier than Republicans, they have sworn off money from all outside PACs.

Well, not all outside PACs, just PACs connected to businesses.

Well, not all PACs connected to businesses, just any so-called ""corporate PACs"" that have direct ties to specific companies.

See, Democrats are happy to take money from PACs for trade association, which are just private groups that are formed by companies from the same industry. For example, big bad oil companies have a trade association called the American Petroleum Institute, and as the Intercept noted a year ago, banks have multiple associations, including the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable.

What about labor union PACs? Anyone who has followed U.S. politics for any amount of time knows the close ties the Democratic Party has to Big Labor. And that relationship has been lucrative for the campaigns of Democratic candidates for decades.

What is the difference between a dollar from a corporate PAC and a dollar from a labor union PAC? Not a thing.

Except that Democrats are happy to take the labor union PAC dollar.

And the labor union PACs are happy to give it. The most recent FEC data on labor PAC contributions compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows just how willing Democrats are to take PAC money — as long it's from a union.

Here are the top 20 labor PAC contributors to candidates in the 2020 election so far, and the political breakdown for where those dollars went — and it's not even close.

Top 25 countries with the most competitive tax codes in 2020 revealed,"Though not usually considered the sexiest of topics, national tax polices impact the daily lives of billions of people a year. For that reason, the Tax Foundation, a tax policy nonprofit, issues an annual International Tax Competitiveness Index.

The organization posted its 2020 index Wednesday, and the news isn't great for the U.S., which ranked No. 21 in the report.

What is this report?

It's important to understand countries' tax policies to have an idea of how those countries' economies might fare.

As the Tax Foundation noted in its report Wednesday:

The structure of a country's tax code is an important determinant of its economic performance. A well-structured tax code is easy for taxpayers to comply with and can promote economic development while raising sufficient revenue for a government's priorities. In contrast, poorly structured tax systems can be costly, distort economic decision-making, and harm domestic economies.

The index is designed to offers a look at Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member nations' tax systems and how closely they stick to the important aspects of competitiveness and neutrality. From the report:

A competitive tax code is one that keeps marginal tax rates low. In today's globalized world, capital is highly mobile. Businesses can choose to invest in any number of countries throughout the world to find the highest rate of return. This means that businesses will look for countries with lower tax rates on investment to maximize their after-tax rate of return. If a country's tax rate is too high, it will drive investment elsewhere, leading to slower economic growth. In addition, high marginal tax rates can lead to tax avoidance.



According to research from the OECD, corporate taxes are most harmful for economic growth, with personal income taxes and consumption taxes being less harmful. Taxes on immovable property have the smallest impact on growth.



Separately, a neutral tax code is simply one that seeks to raise the most revenue with the fewest economic distortions. This means that it doesn't favor consumption over saving, as happens with investment taxes and wealth taxes. This also means few or no targeted tax breaks for specific activities carried out by businesses or individuals. [...]



A tax code that is competitive and neutral promotes sustainable economic growth and investment while raising sufficient revenue for government priorities.

The index scores OECD nations on their corporate, individual, consumption, and property taxes, as well as their international tax rules. The combination of those scores is used to create an overall score.



The United States came in 21st in the 2020 ranking, dropping from 20th place in the 2018 and 2019 rankings.

Below are the 25 OECD member nations with the most competitive tax codes, according to the index, along with their overall scores in the 2020 report and their 2018 and 2019 rankings.

Leading House Democrat admits impeachment could backfire on Dems in 2020 — but that won't stop them from pursuing it,"Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the House Majority Whip and third-ranking House Democrat, admitted Sunday that pursuing the impeachment of President Donald Trump could backfire on Democrats in 2020 — but stated that they will continue to pursue it, anyway.

Recent polling indicates that voters in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin generally oppose impeaching Trump and removing him from office. When confronted with that fact on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Clyburn acknowledged the political dangers of pursing impeachment.

""Is it possible that this could have a negative impact on your party's prospects in 2020?"" host Dana Bash asked.

""Sure, it could,"" Clyburn admitted. ""And that would make this whole process much more political than I would like for it to be.""

The 14-term congressman explained that Democrats will continue to pursue impeachment even without bipartisan support because, for him at least, the process is about ""preserving this republic.""

""I believe that this whole process, to me, is about preserving this republic, protecting the democracy that we hold dear. And I do not believe that we ought to allow our political feelings to get in the middle of this,"" Clyburn said. ""This country is worth saving. And I do believe that we are in a crisis, much like that Thomas Paine wrote about back in 1776, when he talked about summer soldiers and sunshine patriots.""



Interestingly, Clyburn also admitted that he has ""no idea"" what crime, if any, the president has committed. However, he stressed that is exactly why the impeachment inquiry is necessary — to determine if the president has cleared the constitutional hurdle for impeachment.

'Sure it could': House Democrat admits Trump impeachment could backfire on his party in 2020 www.youtube.com

Analysis by the New York Times shows that registered voters in the six closest 2016 battleground states generally favor the impeachment inquiry — 50 percent to 45 percent — but those same voters oppose impeaching Trump and removing him from office, 53 percent to 43 percent.



However, registered voters nationwide support Trump's impeachment and removal from office.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-house-democrat-admits-impeachment-could-backfire-in-2020-but-that-wont-stop-them-from-pursuing-it,2019-11-04
Top NJ pollster apologizes for wild election miss: 'I blew it.',"A top pollster in New Jersey has publicly apologized for being drastically wrong with a prediction about the results of the state's 2021 gubernatorial election.

A Monmouth University poll predicted that Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy would defeat Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli by 11 points ahead of Tuesday's election.

But political observers were shocked when Murphy narrowly defeated Ciattarelli by less than two percentage points — a horrific result for Democrats in a state President Joe Biden won by more than 15 percentage points last year.

""I blew it,"" Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray wrote in an op-ed published by NJ.com.

""I owe an apology to Jack Ciattarelli's campaign — and to Phil Murphy's campaign for that matter — because inaccurate public polling can have an impact on fundraising and voter mobilization efforts. But most of all I owe an apology to the voters of New Jersey for information that was at the very least misleading,"" Murray wrote.

Monmouth polls for months leading up to the election had shown Murphy leading the race with double-digit support over his opponent. However, the most accurate pollster proved to be the Trafalgar Group, which in the weekend before Tuesday's election had Murphy just four points ahead of Ciattarelli.

Murray acknowledged there's a ""growing perception that polling is broken,"" which has led some firms to stop polling elections to avoid damaging the reputations of their public interest polling.

""If we cannot be certain that these polling misses are anomalies then we have a responsibility to consider whether releasing horse race numbers in close proximity to an election is making a positive or negative contribution to the political discourse,"" he wrote.

""This is especially important now because the American republic is at an inflection point. Public trust in political institutions and our fundamental democratic processes is abysmal,"" Murray continued. ""Honest missteps get conflated with 'fake news' — a charge that has hit election polls in recent years.""

Murray suggests that if polling firms continue to get election results wrong and undermine public confidence in polling, it may be better not to do horse race polls of elections at all.

""Most public pollsters are committed to making sure our profession counters rather than deepens the pervasive cynicism in our society,"" he said. ""We try to hold up a mirror that accurately shows us who we are. If election polling only serves to feed that cynicism, then it may be time to rethink the value of issuing horse race poll numbers as the electorate prepares to vote.""

"Tributes pour in for the late Rush Limbaugh, beloved American patriot","Rush Limbaugh, the founding father of conservative talk radio, died Wednesday after losing his battle with stage 4 lung cancer. He was 70. His wife, Kathryn, made the tragic announcement on his radio show, which was dedicated to celebrating his legacy.

Immediately following the news of Limbaugh's passing, conservatives who were inspired, entertained, and educated by his radio program, many of whom would not have their careers were it not for the trail he blazed, offered their tributes to the uncontested greatest conservative radio host of all time.

""God Bless you Rush. I love you. Always and ever,"" said Bo Snerdley, aka James Golden, Limbaugh's longtime call screener, producer, and program engineer.

BlazeTV host and conservative radio host Mark Levin eulogized Limbaugh on Fox News, remarking that he made it ""cool to be a patriot.""

Levin, who at the beginning of his radio career was a frequent guest on Limbaugh's radio program and was a close friend, said, ""We lost a tremendous patriot.""

""I've known Rush for 25 years. I want your audience to know how much he profoundly loved them,"" he told Fox News host Harris Faulkner. ""An incredibly wise man, a very, very smart man. A dear person. If you thought somebody needed help, he would help them. Nothing like what the liberal media has tried to do to him.""



Levin said Limbaugh should be remembered as ""a tremendous patriot of this country who refused to accept the attacks that came against this country from within. He refused to accept the ideological changes in this country. He defended the traditions of this country, and he spoke for tens of millions of us and, you know, I've met a lot of smart people in my life, dealt with a lot of smart people, never smarter than Rush, never wiser, and never kinder.""

Radio and Fox News host Sean Hannity also called in to Fox News, acknowledging that ""there's no Fox News or even some of these other opinionated cable networks"" without Rush Limbaugh.

Other stars in conservative media shared similar feelings about Limbaugh.



""No words ... I just got news the Rush Limbaugh has passed away. Thanks Rush for all you taught, gave and were,"" said BlazeTV host Glenn Beck. ""A hero to many. An icon. A patriot. A revolutionary that saved radio. Heaven's gain, our loss.""

""No conservative would have a voice on ANY platform today if not for Rush Limbaugh,"" said BlazeTV host Steven Crowder. ""The world is a sadder place with him not in it.""

""RIP Rush Limbaugh, the creator of talk radio and by extension the alternative media, an indispensable and iconic conservative voice,"" Daily Wire editor emeritus Ben Shapiro tweeted.

""None of us, NONE OF US, would exist in conservative media without his success,"" said BlazeTV host Steve Deace. ""We all owe him a massive debt of gratitude. He leaves behind an unmatched legacy. Prayers to my friend @DavidLimbaugh for his loss.""

""RIP. More than any single person, Rush Limbaugh helped break the left's monopoly in the media,"" observed Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. ""The left is still dominant, but not to the extent it was before he came along. He waged a brave struggle against deafness and later, the cancer that killed him. He was a giant.""

""The legacy of Rush Limbaugh is clear: the most successful radio broadcaster in history,"" said former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. ""Mr. Limbaugh provided a conservative balance against the dangerous left wing corporate media machine. History counts few entertainers among those who made a difference in the country. Rush Limbaugh did.""

""Rush Limbaugh had unrelenting boldness to proclaim the truth. Watching his wit, passion, and willingness to hold the media accountable informed my entire career,"" former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a tweet thread offering a longer tribute to Limbaugh. ""Growing up in Plant City, Florida, my dad would always play the Rush Limbaugh program in his pick-up truck. My fellow classmates from my all girls Catholic school knew if they [rode] in my car, we would be listening to Rush Limbaugh.



""I am the definition of a 'Rush Baby,' and it's not just me. There are tens of thousands of us all across the conservative movement. He has built a legacy that will endure for many generations to come and will continue to inform our country.

""Thank you, Rush, for all you have done for this nation. The United States of America is better because of you,"" McEnany concluded.

Several Republican politicians, including two former presidents, expressed their admiration for Rush and their condolences for his family.

""He was a fantastic man, a fantastic talent. People, whether they loved or hated him, respected him,"" said former President Donald Trump on Fox News Wednesday.

""Laura and I are sorry to learn that Rush Limbaugh has passed away,"" former President George W. Bush said in a statement. ""A son of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Rush rose as a pioneer of talk radio starting in the 1980s, and was a friend throughout my Presidency. While he was brash, at times controversial, and always opinionated, he spoke his mind as a voice for millions of Americans and approached each day with gusto.""

""Rush Limbaugh revolutionized American radio. His voice guided the conservative movement for millions every day,"" said Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). ""Rest In Peace, Rush.""



""Rush was a voice for forgotten Americans long before the internet gave us a voice. His was a voice that helped shape our thinking; but more than that, it reminded us to stay the course. I am saddened that I will never hear that voice again,"" said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas).

""He was, like all of us, imperfect; but he was unapologetic and unafraid to advance the cause of freedom and limited government. He stood strong when so many others turned tail and ran away from the fight. He leaves behind an army of freedom-loving Americans who are more-ready and better-prepared to defend this great Republic as a direct result of his life's work.""

""A proud son of Missouri, Rush Limbaugh was a voice for the voiceless,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). ""He changed talk radio, but more importantly, Rush changed the conversation to speak up for the forgotten, and challenge the establishment. He lived the First Amendment and told hard truths.""



""Rush Limbaugh was a giant,"" said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). ""With his straightforward, simple articulation of conservatism, he inspired millions. He was one-of-a-kind and he will be missed.""

""Rush Limbaugh was an inspiring and important voice for the conservative movement. He will be missed dearly. My sincere condolences to the Limbaugh family,"" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).

Conservative radio host Erick Erickson wrote a tribute to Rush that concluded:

Rush Limbaugh was the best and will perpetually be the gold standard by which everyone else in talk radio is measured.



There's a public caricature of Rush Limbaugh that exists formed by those jealous of his success and contemptuous of his views. Then there is the Rush Limbaugh — a friend, a mentor, and now the man who gets to personally deliver back his talent to the God of all [creation] who, yes, Rush knew, loved, and served.

Rush Limbaugh's radio show drew an estimated 43 million listeners over its three-hour runtime. Many, many more people who listened to Limbaugh regularly or were impacted by his work offered their own tributes to Rush, too many to report.

Throughout his life, and here at the end, Rush Limbaugh was loved. And he is missed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tributes-pour-in-for-rush-limbaugh,2021-02-17
"Trump administration makes new moves to protect religious freedom, including the right to pray in school","The Trump administration observed National Religious Freedom Day on Thursday with a series of executive efforts to protect the conscience rights of students, teachers and religious organizations, including the right to pray at school.

During a phone call briefing with reporters on Thursday, Domestic Policy Council director Joe Grogan said that the administration was taking ""three big actions to ensure that people of faith are always able to exercise their rights to religious expression.""

The first of those actions would be new federal regulations issued by nine different federal agencies that would ""ensure that religious and nonreligious organizations are treated equally by the federal government, and that organizations are not discriminated against simply because they are religious in nature,"" Grogan explained on the call.

One of those departments — the Department of Education — announced a lengthy proposed rule on Thursday dealing with ""five general areas of importance to religious organizations, faith-based institutions, and their students"" in regards to the first amendment. Among its other provisions, the rule includes language meant to protect the rights of religious student organizations at colleges and universities that receive federal money.

""Our actions today will protect the constitutional rights of students, teachers, and faith-based institutions,"" said Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. ""The Department's efforts will level the playing field between religious and non-religious organizations competing for federal grants, as well as protect First Amendment freedoms on campus and the religious liberty of faith-based institutions.""

Similarly, the Justice Department also announced a proposed rule that would ""remove regulatory burdens on religious organizations and ensure that religious and non-religious organizations are treated equally in DOJ-supported programs.""

""Since our nation's founding, there has always been a strong consensus about the centrality of religious liberty in the United States and the freedom of religious expression,"" Attorney General William Barr said of the proposal. ""The Framers of the Constitution believed that both were indispensable to sustaining our free system of government.""

Grogan also said that the president would announce updated federal guidance on prayer in public schools, which he said hadn't been updated since 2003.

""Although the Constitution forbids public school officials from directing or favoring prayer in their official capacities, students and teachers do not 'shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,'"" the guidance explains, citing a Supreme Court ruling.

The guidance requires that school districts have to annually certify in writing that they have ""no policy that prevents, or otherwise denies participation in, constitutionally protected prayer in public schools"" in order to receive federal funds, citing federal education laws; it also requires state education departments to annually notify the Department of Education ""that have not filed the required certification or that have been the subject of a complaint"" about policies impeding the right to pray.

The third action Grogan described was an Office of Management and Budget memo requiring federal agencies to ensure that their grant practices and the grant practices of state entities that take federal fundings comply with the religious freedom precedent set down by the Supreme Court in its 2017 Trinity Lutherancase. In that case, the court ruled it unconstitutional for the government to disqualify religious organizations access to public benefits because of their religious nature.

At a White House event announcing the prayer guidance on Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump called the right to pray ""a very important and powerful right,"" adding ""there's nothing more important than that, I would say.""

""In a sacred principle of our republic, the government must never stand between the people and God,"" Trump continued. ""Yet in public schools around the country, authorities are stopping students and teachers from praying, sharing their faith or following their religious beliefs; it is totally unacceptable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-administration-makes-new-moves-to-protect-religious-freedom-including-the-right-to-pray-in-school,2020-01-16
Trump administration urges UN to drop pro-abortion language,"Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar asked the United Nations on Monday to remove what he referred to as pro-abortion language from official documents, arguing that certain terms cause confusion because there is no international consensus on the practice.

What are the details?

""We do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health and rights in U.N. documents, because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices, like abortion, in circumstances that do not enjoy international consensus and which can be misinterpreted by U.N. agencies,"" Azar said at a General Assembly meeting on universal health.

""Such terms do not adequately take into account the key role of family in health and education, nor the sovereign right of nations to implement health policies according to their national context,"" he continued. ""There is no international right to an abortion and these terms should not be used to promote pro-abortion policies and measures.""

The Hill reported that ""Azar made his remarks on behalf of the U.S. and several other nations whose officials were present, including Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Saudi Arabia."" The newspaper pointed out that abortion is banned in several of the countries backing the U.S. in the coalition.

According to The Guardian, Azar and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent a (leaked) letter to several nations, asking them to join the U.S. in signing a statement pushing the U.N. to remove pro-abortion language.

""As a key priority in global health promotion, we respectfully request that your government join the United States in ensuring that every sovereign state has the ability to determine the best way to protect the unborn and defend the family as the foundational unity of society vital to children thriving and leading health lives,"" the letter reportedly read.

""We remain gravely concern that aggressive efforts to reinterpret international instruments to create a new international right to abortion and to promote international policies that weaken the family have advanced through some United Nations fora.""

Vice President Pence announces Trump administration will fight back against lower courts' nationwide injunctions,"At a Federalist Society event Wednesday in Washington, D.C., Vice President Mike Pence took aim at judicial activism and the practice of lower courts of unilaterally blocking laws and policies from taking effect.

The administration plans to fight this practice, Pence explained, by bringing the question of nationwide injunctions before the Supreme Court.

""The Supreme Court of the United States must clarify that district judges can decide no more than the cases before them,"" Pence said. ""And it's imperative that we restore the historic tradition that district judges do not set policy for the whole nation. In the days ahead, our administration will seek opportunities to put this very question before the Supreme Court to ensure that decisions affecting every American are made either by those elected to represent the American people or by the highest court in the land.

""The kind of government control that our Founders were concerned about is too often exerted by the administrative state in this country,"" Pence explained. ""And it's been emerging in recent years in the federal judiciary in the form of nationwide injunctions.""

A nationwide injunction is a court order sent out by lower judges that prevents the executive branch from enforcing policies, statutes and/or regulations all across the country. Such orders affect parties who aren't remotely involved in the case and are one of the most popular tools of activist judges to thwart the efforts of the Trump White House.

And it's not just the White House that has a problem with nationwide injunctions. During his remarks, Pence also cited a 2018 Supreme Court Opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote:

These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system — preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.



I am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions. These injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding. And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts. If their popularity continues, this Court must address their legality.

Indeed, while our federal courts go back to the earliest days of our republic, the ability of lower court judges to unilaterally hamstring the executive with the flick of a pen and bang of a gavel is a far more recent innovation.

""This obstruction at the district [court] level is unprecedented. Studies show that there's not a single example of a nationwide injunction in the first 175 years of our nation's history,"" Pence said. ""The truth is, our administration has been unfairly hit with more nationwide injunctions than the first 40 American presidents combined.""

The vice president also made the case that such injunctions are hazardous to Americans' safety, arguing that they compromise national security by ""obstructing the lawful ability of the President to stop threats to the homeland, where he sees them.""

Lest we forget, Trump v. Hawaii — about which Justice Thomas wrote the earlier opinion — was over Trump's ability to use the president's plenary powers to pause immigration due to national security concerns.

""These injunctions undermine the rule of law and the separation of powers that are central to our nation's founding, that lie at the very heart of our Constitution,"" Pence concluded. ""And so I say to all those gathered here, for the sake of our liberty, our security, our prosperity, and the separation of powers: This era of judicial activism must come to an end.""

While new legal precedent from the Supreme Court might be the most realistic way to end the capricious practice of nationwide injunctions with a divided national government, it isn't the only way; Congress also has the power to act.

Last session, the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee considered and approved a bill that would have ended the universal injunctions once and for all, despite protests from committee Democrats.

""We are at a crossroads in our nation,"" wrote Conservative Review's Daniel Horowitz about a recent nationwide injunction case out of California. ""Either we have three branches of government, or we have one branch of government, with the most liberal of the 94 district courts controlling every aspect of our country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-administration-will-fight-back-against-lower-courts-nationwide-injunctions,2019-05-09
Trump signs executive order effectively banning TikTok in 45 days; China threatens consequences,"President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Thursday that will prohibit U.S. transactions with Chinese technology giants Tencent and ByteDance. The orders, which go into effect in 45 days, will effectively ban Tencent's WeChat app and ByteDance's TikTok app. The executive order escalates the already-tense tech war between the U.S. and China.

President Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act to ban the social media apps from China.

The Trump administration argues that a ban of the apps is necessary because of security concerns with TikTok, a short-form video app, as well as WeChat, a social media and mobile payment app.

The executive order says, ""The spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.""

""TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users, including Internet and other network activity information such as location data and browsing and search histories,"" the executive order states. ""This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.

""Like TikTok, WeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information,"" the second executive order says. ""In addition, the application captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States, thereby allowing the Chinese Communist Party a mechanism for keeping tabs on Chinese citizens who may be enjoying the benefits of a free society for the first time in their lives.

""The United States must take aggressive action against the owner of WeChat to protect our national security,"" the executive order stated.

The owner of WeChat is Tencent Holdings, an internet, artificial intelligence, and entertainment behemoth. Tencent is the largest video game publisher in the world.

Before Trump signed the executive order, Tencent was valued at $686 billion, making it the world's eighth-largest company by market capitalization. However, WeChat's potential loss of the U.S. market erased $34.6 billion from Tencent's value.

The executive orders did not specify what kinds of transactions would be prohibited. The executive order noted that after 45 days, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross ""shall identify the transactions"" that will be banned.

Transactions could include American companies advertising with the two Chinese companies, or it could mean that app stores, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, are prohibited from offering the apps.



TikTok was the second-most popular free app in the world in 2019. More than 100 million Americans have already downloaded the TikTok app, and there are 80 million daily active TikTok users in the United States.

The executive order did not stipulate what penalties will be levied out to any person or company that violates the order.



TikTok said it was ""shocked"" by Trump's executive order, and claimed it was ""issued without any due process."" The Chinese tech company declared that it would take legal action.

""For nearly a year, we have sought to engage with the US government in good faith to provide a constructive solution to the concerns that have been expressed,"" TikTok's statement said. ""What we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses.""



""And it sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets,"" TikTok added. ""We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly — if not by the Administration, then by the US courts.""



China's foreign ministry said it firmly opposed the executive orders against the Chinese companies, according to Reuters.

Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters during a press briefing on Friday that Beijing will defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese businesses. He warned that the U.S. would have to bear the consequences of its actions.

""The U.S. is using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses. That's just a hegemonic practice. China is firmly opposed to that,"" Wang said.

On Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to ban TikTok on government-issued devices. Earlier this year, the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Navy, and Army prohibited TikTok from being used on government-issued phones.



Last Friday night, President Trump said that he was going to ban TikTok. That declaration sparked rumors that Microsoft was interested in purchasing the Beijing-based social media platform's U.S. operations.

On Sunday, Microsoft confirmed the rumors and admitted they were not only interested in U.S. operations, but also TikTok's platforms in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Financial Times reported that Microsoft has discussed the possibility of acquiring TikTok's business in Europe and India as well.

Microsoft, a company valued at $1.6 trillion, owns the Xbox video game brand, networking site LinkedIn, and messaging service Skype.



Trump's executive order comes on the same day that Instagram launched Reels, a new feature that gives users augmented reality effects and audio on videos, much like TikTok already does. Facebook, which bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, saw its shares rise 6% on Thursday following the launch of Instagram's TikTok alternative.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-bans-tiktok-wechat-executive-order,2020-08-07
Trump adopts Nancy Pelosi's rhetoric — calls Biden 'enemy of the state' for 'vilifying 75 million citizens',"On Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump held his first ""Save America"" rally since the August 8 FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago residence. The former president, who continues to tease a potential 2024 run for re-election, hit back at President Joe Biden over his September 1 ""anti-MAGA speech.""

Trump characterized Biden's address to the nation last week as the ""most vicious, hateful, and divisive speech ever delivered by an American president.""

Biden in his speech suggested that ""MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic"" and that the Republican Party, insofar as it is influenced by Trump, ""is a threat to this country."" These remarks buttressed his August claim that MAGA philosophy is ""like semi-fascism.""

Despite an aborted attempt to walk back the president's comments, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that Biden does in fact regard the people who voted for Trump as an ""extreme threat to our democracy, to our freedom, to our rights.""

""Vilifying 75 million citizens — plus another probably 75 to 150 [million], if we want to be accurate about it — as threats to democracy and as enemies of the state"" was the function of Biden's speech in Philadelphia, said Trump.

""You're all enemies of the state,"" Trump told the crowd. ""[Biden's] an enemy of the state, if you want to know the truth. The enemy of the state is him and the group that control him.""

Trump redirected Biden's thematics around extremism, suggesting that the November elections are an opportunity for Americans to rebuke ""the corruption and extremism of Joe Biden and the radical Democrat Party.""

In his speech, he repeatedly insinuated that the midterm elections serve as a ""referendum"" on Democrat policies and leadership: ""This election is a referendum on skyrocketing inflation, rampant crime, soaring murders, crushing gas prices, millions and millions of illegal aliens pouring across our border, race and gender indoctrination.""

Given the strategic location of his rally, Trump noted further that ""the people of Pennsylvania are going to fire the radical left Democrats, and you are going to elect Doug Mastriano as your next governor, and ... an amazing slate of true 'America First' Republicans to Congress.""

The former president emphasized that, contrary to Biden's claims, ""Republicans in the MAGA movement are not the ones trying to undermine our democracy. We are the ones trying to save our democracy.""

Rhetorical precedent set by Democrats and media

Although criticism is mounting online about Trump's accusation, the use of the term enemy of the state (""any country, government, group, or person that has been engaged in hostilities, whether or not lawfully authorized, with the United States"") has been bandied about a number of times in recent years.

In 2020, Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi suggested that then-President Trump was an ""enemy of the state"" and that she would have to ""defend the Constitution from him."" Trump's allies and other Republicans, she alleged, constituted ""domestic enemies.""

UNHINGED: Nancy Pelosi labels Republicans as “domestic enemies” and “enemies of the state” YouTube

U.S. Democrat Rep. Mike Thompson (Calif.) followed suit one year later, calling then-President Trump an ""enemy of the state"" in January 2021.

The mainstream media has also utilized this terminology. The New Republic ran a piece in 2019 calling Trump an ""enemy of the state,"" insinuating that he had invited foreign meddling in American democracy. The New York Times' Katie Benner also suggested that Trump supporters should be regarded as ""enemies of the state.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-calls-biden-enemy-of-the-state,2022-09-05
"After President Trump's de-platforming, his Facebook page is drawing in a colossal number of new 'likes'","President Donald Trump's Facebook page continues to draw new ""likes"" despite the president having been de-platformed, Newsweek reported.

What are the details?

According to a Thursday report, Trump's Facebook page has brought in nearly 150,000 new likes since Facebook indefinitely suspended the president from using his account on Jan. 7.

Citing analytics information from Social Blade, Newsweek reported that Trump's YouTube channel — which was also ultimately suspended — has gained 100,000 new subscribers since Jan. 6., the very day that a violent mob descended on the U.S. Capitol.

On Jan. 7, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a post announcing that Trump's Instagram and Facebook accounts would be indefinitely blocked.

""Over the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies,"" Zuckerberg wrote in his widely viewed Facebook post. ""We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech.

""But the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,"" he added.

On Monday, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said that the company has ""no plans"" to rescind the suspension.

What did Trump say?

The riots resulted in a historic second impeachment against the president after much of the media and many government officials accused him of inciting the riots as insurrection.

Following the impeachment, Trump issued a statement on the violence that took place at the U.S. Capitol.

""As I have said, the incursion at the U.S. Capitol struck at the very heart of our Republic. It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum,"" he said in a Wednesday statement. ""I want to be very clear. I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country, and no place in our movement.

""Making America great again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacred traditions and values,"" he added. ""Mob violence goes against everything I believe in, and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-de-platformed-facebook-page-likes,2021-01-14
"Trump's impeachment lawyers deny charges that the president incited violence, sought to overturn election; say the process is unconstitutional","The legal team defending former President Donald Trump in the upcoming Senate impeachment trial denied that Trump incited the crowd to violence in the Capitol building at his Jan. 6 rally and denied that the former president attempted to pressure state election officials to overturn President Joe Biden's electoral victories.

In legal documents filed Tuesday, Trump's lawyers responded to arguments put forth by the nine Democratic House impeachment managers who will prosecute the case against Trump next week when the unprecedented second impeachment trial of a former U.S. president begins. House Democrats filed impeachment articles for the second time against President Trump last month, this time on charges that he incited an insurrection against the U.S. government by falsely claiming the 2020 election was fraudulent.

According to CNBC, Democrats argue in their 80-page trial briefing that Trump was ""personally responsible"" for the violence at the Capitol building, which left five people dead and dozens of police officers injured after an unruly mob stormed the building in an attempt to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the Electoral College.

""President Trump's conduct offends everything that the Constitution stands for,"" the Democratic brief said.

""The Senate must make clear to him and all who follow that a President who provokes armed violence against the government of the United States in an effort to overturn the results of an election will face trial and judgment.""



Before the mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, President Trump spoke to the crowd, blasting ""weak"" Republicans who he said had failed to stand up to the Democratic Party's policy agenda and repeating his allegations that the 2020 election was ""rigged""

""You can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules,"" Trump said.

""If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country any more,"" Trump also told the crowd.

Democrats claim that statement and others the president made were ""calculated to incite violence.""

Trump's defense lawyers, Bruce Castor Jr. and David Schoen, dispute this in their filing. They deny that Trump's comments ""had anything to do with the action at the Capitol as it was clearly about the need to fight for election security in general.""

""It is denied that President Trump incited the crowd to engage in destructive behavior,"" they wrote. ""It is denied that President Trump intended to interfere with the counting of Electoral votes.""

Trump's lawyers also defended the president's claims of widespread voter fraud, which were never proven in a court of law or confirmed by the Department of Justice.

""The 45th President exercised his First Amendment right under the Constitution to express his belief that the election results were suspect,"" Trump's lawyers state.

""Insufficient evidence exists upon which a reasonable jurist could conclude that the 45th President's statements were accurate or not, and he therefore denies they were false,"" they added.



They further denied claims that President Trump told Georgia election officials to illegally overturn Biden's victory.

From the Washington Post:

Trump's defense team also denied that the president sought to pressure state election officials to overturn President Biden's victory, addressing an episode cited in the House impeachment article in which he called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger early this year to discuss that state's election results.



They argued that Trump's exhortation during the Jan. 2 phone call that Raffensperger ""find"" the votes to overturn President Biden's victory was simply an expression of the president's belief that a careful examination of the evidence would produce a more accurate vote count that favored Trump.

Trump's lawyers also argue that the process of impeaching a president after he has already vacated office is unconstitutional, a claim that 45 Republican senators agreed with by voting for an amendment offered by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to declare it as such.

Democrats vigorously argued that the impeachment trial is constitutional.

""There is no 'January exception' to the Constitution that allows a President to organize a coup or incite an armed insurrection in his final weeks in office. The Senate must convict President Trump, who has already been impeached by the House of Representatives, and disqualify him from ever holding federal office again. We must protect the Republic from any future dangerous attacks he could level against our constitutional order,"" Democrats said in the brief.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-impeachment-lawyers-respond-to-impeachment-managers,2021-02-02
Jan. 6 committee votes unanimously to subpoena Trump,"The congressional committee investigating the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 voted unanimously to subpoena former President Donald Trump on Thursday.

The committee presented witnesses and evidence meant to tie Trump directly to the violence at the capital before voting to call him to testify.

""We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion. And every American is entitled to those answers so we can act now to protect our Republic,"" said Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the vice chair of the committee.

The subpoena asked for testimony under oath from the former president as well as documents relating to the attack.

""We just voted unanimously to subpoena Donald Trump,"" tweeted Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. ""Our democracy demands it. Our constitution demands it. The truth demands it.""

The committee presented evidence in support of its contention that Trump knew he had lost the election but persisted in seeking to stay in power. Among that evidence was a secret order to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Somalia days after the election. Testimony from Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, claimed that Trump wanted to leave the problem up ""to the next guy.""

Among those critical of the subpoena was Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona.

""The illegitimate January 6 Committee's vote to subpoena President Trump is a political hatchet job read by a political hatchet committee,"" tweeted Biggs.

""This committee is illegitimately formed, in violation of House rules, and is organized to search and destroy perceived political enemies,"" he added.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted from his motorcade on his way to the golf course that he isn't too concerned.

South Korean officials reported that the North fired ""short-range projectiles"" early Saturday local time (Friday night in the U.S.), having revised earlier language that referred to a ""missile"" launch.

""At present, our military has intensified surveillance and vigilance to prepare for North Korea's additional launches,"" said the Republic of Korea joint chiefs in a statement.

In a statement to press, Secretary Sarah Sanders said ""We are aware of North Korea's actions tonight. We will continue to monitor as necessary.""

The projectiles were fired into the Sea of Japan, and did not travel more than 120 miles, according to the South Korean report on the incident.

Original story below

Hundreds of Trump supporters breached security barricades and stormed up to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., as both chambers of Congress convened to affirm the Electoral College votes cast in the 2020 election Wednesday afternoon.

Thousands had traveled from out of state to gather in Washington in protest of the election, which President Trump and his allies have maintained was fraudulent.

Things appeared to carry on peacefully earlier in the day, but as the joint session of Congress kicked off in the early afternoon, a large group of individuals appeared to storm through outer barricades surrounding the Capitol building, where lawmakers deliberated inside.

Video posted to Twitter by Washington Post reporter Rebecca Tan showed Trump supporters approaching the rear of the building.

Then, BlazeTV reporter Elijah Schaeffer posted video as the group reached the outside of the building and were confronted by police.

""Trump supporters have breached the Capitol building, tearing down 4 layers of security fencing and are attempting to occupy the building — fighting federal police who are overrun,"" he tweeted. ""This is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. Thousands, police can't stop them.""

(Content Warning: Video contains vulgar language)

More video from the scene posted on social media showed a large group of individuals continuing to wrestle with law enforcement outside the U.S. Capitol.

Politico's Melanie Zanona reported that the Madison building on Capitol Hill was evacuated as a result of the increasingly hostile protests.



It is unclear at this point whether the storming of the Capitol was a coordinated or impromptu event. Interestingly, a paper notice found in the National Mall indicated that ""a national militia"" was being organized to ""defend the Constitution and the Republic."" However, there is no evidence connecting the movement from the crowd with the notice.

President Trump threatens Guatemala with tariffs over its refusal to become a safe third country for asylum-seekers,"President Donald Trump has threatened Guatemala with tariffs following the country's government's decision not to meet with Trump to reach a deal regarding asylum-seekers from other nations.

What's the background?

Trump has been trying to make asylum-seekers apply for asylum in other countries, rather than entering the United States first. In May, a federal court said that he could legally make these asylum-seekers wait in Mexico, provided that these people were not seeking asylum from Mexico. This type of arrangement is known as a ""safe third country"" agreement.

Guatemala's president had initially agreed to a similar deal for his country, before internal pressure and Guatemala's top court prevented the deal from going through.

What did Trump say now?

On Twitter, Trump said:



Guatemala, which has been forming Caravans and sending large numbers of people, some with criminal records, to the United States, has decided to break the deal they had with us on signing a necessary Safe Third Agreement. We were ready to go. Now we are looking at the ""BAN,"" Tariffs, Remittance Fees, or all of the above. Guatemala has not been good. Big U.S. taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago.

Guatemala is part of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, and has been since 2006. However, existing trade agreements seem to have not been a barrier for Trump when implementing tariffs. Although conservatives have traditionally opposed tariffs, Trump has praised them as a bargaining tactic and called them ""the greatest.""

What about the U.S. taxpayer dollars he mentioned?

In October, Trump announced that the U.S. would be cutting off aid to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador after those nations failed to stop a migrant caravan passing through their borders. Guatemala had received around $229 million from the U.S. in 2017.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-threatens-guatemala-with-tariffs-over-its-refusal-to-become-a-safe-third-country-for-asylum-seekers,2019-07-23
President Trump just issued the second veto of his presidency to block Congress,"President Donald Trump issued the second veto of his administration to block a vote from Congress to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.

The Senate voted 54-46 in favor for the resolution while the House of Representatives voted 247-175.

The administration issued a scathing statement rejecting the resolution and accusing the Congress of trying to undermine his executive authority.

The statement described the congressional action as ""a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, with certain exceptions.""

""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities,"" the statement continued, ""endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.""

The president issued his first veto of legislation out of Congress in March when they voted to block his declaration of a national emergency on the border.

Congress is not likely to have the votes to override the president's veto, which would require 2/3rds support of each of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

""There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here and Washington, and across the country. I have been briefed by the U.S. Secret Service on the potential threats,"" Trump continued.

""Every American deserves to have their voice heard, in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment right, but I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence, no law-breaking, and no vandalism of any kind,"" he added.

The president also addressed what he called the ""unprecedented assault on free speech"" in his video statement.

""These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancor, and find common ground and shared purpose,"" said Trump.

The president also didn't mention President-elect Joe Biden in his video address. He was impeached for the second time by a vote of 232 to 197.

Tucker Carlson says the NSA spied on him and then leaked to the media,"Conservative television host Tucker Carlson is alleging that the National Security Agency spied on his electronic communications and then leaked material to the media.

Last week, Carlson said on his Fox News program that a whistleblower said that the government agency had been surveilling his electronic communications and planning to leak the material in an effort to get his show removed from the air.



The NSA released a statement in which it said that the TV host ""has never been an intelligence target of the Agency"" and that it ""never had any plans to try to take his program off the air.""

Carlson decried the NSA's statement as ""infuriatingly dishonest"" and said that the agency had not denied that it read his emails.



""But the question remains: Did the Biden administration read my personal emails? That's the question that we asked directly to NSA officials when we spoke to them about 20 minutes ago in a very heated conversation. Did you read my emails? And again, they refused to say. Again and again. And then they refused even to explain why they couldn't answer that simple question,"" Carlson said on his show last week.

Tucker to the NSA: You didn't answer the question www.youtube.com

During a Wednesday interview with Maria Bartiromo, Carlson said that he found out on Tuesday that the agency had leaked the contents of his ""email to journalists in an effort to discredit me. I know because I got a call from one of 'em saying, 'Oh this is what your email was about.'



""So, it is not in any way a figment of my imagination. It's confirmed. It's true. They're not allowed to spy on American citizens — they are. I think more ominously they're using the information they gather to put leverage and to threaten opposition journalists, people who criticize the Biden administration. It's happening to me right now. And I think it's shocking and I don't think we should put up with it in a free country"" Carlson said.

Bartiromo responded by saying, ""This is the stuff of banana republics and Third-World countries.""

""Tucker Carlson was talking to U.S.-based Kremlin intermediaries about setting up an interview with Vladimir Putin shortly before the Fox News host accused the National Security Agency of spying on him, sources familiar with the conversations tell Axios,"" the outlet reported on Wednesday.

""Axios submitted a request for comment to the NSA on Wednesday, asking whether the agency would also be willing to categorically deny that the NSA intercepted any of Carlson's communications in the context of monitoring somebody he was talking to in his efforts to set up an interview with Putin,"" the outlet said. ""An NSA spokesperson declined to comment and referred Axios back to the agency's earlier, carefully worded, statement. In other words, the NSA is denying the targeting of Carlson but is not denying that his communications were incidentally collected,"" Axios noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tucker-carlson-says-the-nsa-spied-on-him-and-then-leaked-to-the-media,2021-07-07
Tulsi Gabbard slams Nancy Pelosi for calling GOP enemies within,"Former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii denounced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for her ""broad, inflammatory rhetoric"" that is ""incredibly dangerous.""

Pelosi maligned Republicans this week by saying, ""I do believe, and I have said this all along, that we will probably need a supplemental for more security for members when the enemy is within the House of Representatives, a threat that members are concerned about in addition to what is happening outside.""

When asked by the press to clarify what she meant by ""the enemy"" within, Pelosi doubled-downed, ""It means that we have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.""



On Friday night, Gabbard appeared on ""The Ingraham Angle,"" where she reprimanded Pelosi for her remarks.

""This kind of broad, inflammatory rhetoric is like throwing a match into the tinderbox,"" Gabbard said of Pelosi's ""enemy"" within comments.

Regarding the claim of GOP lawmakers threatening ""violence on other members of Congress,"" Gabbard clamored for Pelosi to get law enforcement involved if the threats are legitimate.

""What Speaker Pelosi is talking about is a very serious thing,"" the former Democratic representative told Fox News host Lauran Ingraham. ""If there is evidence to back what she is saying ... is true, this is a legal issue for law enforcement. Because members of Congress are not above the law either.""

Ingraham asked Gabbard if the claims made by Pelosi could incite more division and fuel more animosity.

""Isn't this also inciting? If you think there is someone among the Republican caucus who's actively plotting the murder of Nancy Pelosi or other members of Congress, that could then bring violence upon those individuals,"" Ingraham said.



""That's really the issue here. If this is a criminal threat, let law enforcement deal with it,"" Gabbard responded. ""If there is no evidence of what she is talking about, and if it is not true, it is inciting further division and further harm potentially and further destroying the possibility of our country coming together.""



Gabbard challenged the speaker of the House, ""This is why it's so important for Nancy Pelosi – again if these accusations are baseless – she needs to apologize, not so much to her colleagues but really to the American people who right now, more than ever, need leadership coming from the speaker of the House, who represents all members of Congress and the American people to bring us together.""

""For her and President Biden to deescalate these tensions, to turn down the temperature, to denounce those who are seeking to undermine our civil liberties and our constitutional rights, and who are inflaming these tensions,"" Gabbard advised her fellow Democratic leadership. ""To say, 'Hey, we're all Americans, and we need to come together.'""



Ingraham questioned if the Democrats in power are weaponizing the Jan. 6 Capitol riots ""to justify future encroachment on civil liberties."" She hypothesized if Democrats might be ""setting the stage"" for ""aggressive gun control,"" putting a ""wall around the Capitol,"" or making Washington, D.C. a state.

Gabbard agreed, ""I share your same concerns."" She reasoned that if the ""party in charge can extend this kind of government overreach and using the military and intelligence agencies against people who are of the opposing party or hold different views, then what's to say the next party who comes in and takes charge can't do the same? That really leaves us with a banana republic, not a democracy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-nancy-pelosi-enemy-capitol,2021-01-30
"Twitter suspends data analyst who testified that up to 300,000 fake people voted in Arizona election","Twitter on Monday suspended an account belonging to a Trump campaign witness who testified about voter irregularities at an election integrity hearing in Phoenix, Arizona.

Bobby Piton, an investment adviser and managing partner at Pre-Active Investments, LLC, was suspended by Twitter on the same day he testified that as many as 306,000 ""fake people"" voted in the Arizona election. He claimed that after analyzing government voter registration and census data, in his opinion the ""biggest fraud in the history of our constitutional republic is taking place right before our eyes.""

A spokesperson for Twitter told TheBlaze Piton's account ""was permanently suspended for violating Twitter Rules on Platform Manipulation and Spam."" The spokesperson did not say which specific rules Piton violated. TheBlaze has asked for clarification.

Piton appeared as an expert witness at a public hearing held by Arizona state GOP lawmakers. The hearing featured members of President Donald Trump's legal team, who presented their claims of voting irregularities and allegations of voter fraud in the Arizona election. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his legal adviser Jenna Ellis both attended the proceedings.

While the hearing took place, Arizona officials certified the results of the 2020 election. Former Vice President Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump, earning 49.4% of the vote to Trump's 49.1%. More than 3.2 million ballots were cast and voter turnout surged to nearly 80%.



""I would have never ever have certified, I would rather resign than have certified those results,"" Piton said during his testimony.

""If I was an executive at a publicly traded company, I would never sign that because I risk jail time and having all my money taken from me in lawsuits,"""" he added. ""I believe [the numbers] are fraudulent based on the data. … I'd be willing to put my life on it, I'm that sure about the analysis.""



Giuliani told lawmakers state officials were ""certifying a false statement to the United States of America.""

Both Republican and Democratic state officials expressed confidence in the results after they were certified, the Arizona Republic reported.



""Despite the unprecedented challenges, Arizonans showed up for our democracy,"" Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, said. ""Every Arizona voter has my thanks and should know they can stand proud that this election was conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona's laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary.""

Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who campaigned with Trump, said, ""We do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong and that's why I bragged on it so much.""

Piton's Twitter suspension follows another controversial incident where a Pennsylvania Republican state lawmaker had his personal account temporarily suspended and later reinstated. State Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican who organized election integrity hearings in Pennsylvania, accused Twitter of censorship.

The suspension drew the attention of President Donald Trump, who accused Twitter and the news media of working together to ""SILENCE THE TRUTH.""

Twitter later revoked the suspension and said in a statement: ""This account was mistakenly suspended for perceived violations of our impersonation policy. This was an error. We have immediately reversed the decision and the account has been reinstated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-suspends-data-analyst-testified-arizona-election,2020-12-01
Ukraine says Russia kidnapped Melitopol mayor,"Ukraine is saying that Russia has abuducted Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol.



""They have transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine’s lawful local authorities,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared in a video address Friday, according to the Associated Press.

Zelenskyy's comments come as Ukraine fights to repel Russian invaders who have been conducting a brutal campaign that has wreaked death and destruction.

The AP reported that the website for the prosecutor's office of the Luhansk People's Republic, a Russia-backed rebel area of Ukraine, indicates that there was a criminal case against the mayor. The outlet said that the office accused the man of ""terrorist activities.""

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared in a Facebook post, ""Russian troops, who have been launching missile and bomb attacks on civilian facilities and infrastructure in Ukraine, including children's hospitals and schools, over the course of two week, are cynically accusing the Mayor of 'terrorism.'""



""We call on the international community to respond immediately to the abduction of Ivan Fedorov and other civilians, and to increase pressure on Russia to end its barbaric war against the Ukrainian people,"" the statement said.

""We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,"" President Biden said on Friday. He warned that conflict between NATO and Russia would mark ""World War III.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-says-russia-kidnapped-mayor,2022-03-12
Ukrainian foreign minister smacks down suggestion that Russian incursion is 'minor': 'Invasion is an invasion',"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba rebuffed any attempt to soften language of Russia's invasion into eastern Ukrainian provinces.

What is the background?

After Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk — two provinces in eastern Ukraine — and ordered Russian ""peacekeeping"" troops into those regions, the Biden administration initially refused to describe the incursion as an ""invasion.""

According to the Washington Post, the Biden administration on Monday wrestled over whether Russian troops entering Ukrainian provinces constituted an ""invasion."" One administration official even reportedly said the development was not an ""invasion"" because the territories have been disputed and not without some Russian troops, at least in part, since 2014.

President Joe Biden later described Russia's actions as an ""invasion"" worthy of the swift response he promised last month, which meant imposing harsh economic sanctions meant to deter Putin from further action.

What did Kuleba say?

During a joint press conference with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the Ukrainian foreign minister made it clear that Russia's actions could only be described as an ""invasion.""

Kuleba's remarks came in response to a question from Fox News reporter Ben Hall, who observed that ""there is a suggestion that what we’ve seen so far is a minor invasion,"" a reference to the Biden administration's initially soft response and potentially Biden's reference last month to a ""minor incursion.""

""First, there is no such thing as minor, middle, or major invasion. Invasion is an invasion,"" Kuleba said.

LIVE: Secretary of State Blinken, Ukraine Foreign Minister Kuleba hold a press conference youtu.be

Kuleba then addressed sanctions the Biden administration enacted on Donetsk and Luhansk, criticizing the move, considering that Kyiv says each region remains part of Ukraine.

""I can say frankly that yesterday (Monday), when we learned about the first executive order to impose sanctions on — related to economic activities with Donetsk and Luhansk — we were puzzled, because we saw how the side that sought recognition from Russia is being punished, but we didn’t see how Russia, who granted its recognition, is punished,"" Kuleba said.

However, Kuleba also praised Biden for action taken on Tuesday with new sanctions against Russia. Kuleba said that Ukraine hopes Biden issues more sanctions as Russia aggression continues.

""We do appreciate today’s — the sanctions which were announced today. They target Russia. They’re very specific. They are painful,"" Kuleba said. ""And this strategy of imposing sanctions by waves, if I may put it this way, is something that can work if it continues in a sustainable way.""

UN experts say the world will face a global famine of ‘biblical proportions’ due to COVID-19 pandemic,"The United Nations warns that the COVID-19 pandemic is on the cusp of causing global famines of ""biblical proportions.""

What are the details?

According to CNN, the famines will affect the world in a matter of months and will likely push an already coronavirus-struck population of 130 million people to the brink of starvation.

In a Tuesday address, David Beasley — the executive director of the World Food Programme — told the UN Security Council during a video conference that widespread famines could affect ""about three dozen countries"" in the coming months.

CNN reported that Beasley — a former Republican South Carolina governor — cited ""conflict, an economic recession, a decline in aid, and a collapse in oil prices"" as factors that could lead to massive food shortages.

""While dealing with a COVID-19 pandemic, we are also on the brink of a hunger pandemic,"" Beasley said. ""There is also a real danger that more people could potentially die from the economic impact of COVID-19 than from the virus itself.""

A report from the agency identified at least 55 countries around the world that are at elevated risk of famine due to the virus.

A portion of the report read, ""These countries may face an excruciating trade-off between saving lives or livelihoods, or, in a worst-case scenario, saving people from the coronavirus to have them die from hunger.""

What countries will most likely be impacted?

Those countries include:

Afghanistan

Democratic Republic of the Congo

Ethiopia

Haiti

Nigeria

South Sudan

Sudan

Syria

Venezuela

Yemen

CNN reported that while those countries have been mostly spared from the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic when compared to places like China, Italy, and North America, the countries' food supply was previously being impacted by locust swarms and crop failure.

""Exceptional drought followed by extremely heavy rainfall markedly decreased the seasonal crop yield in the Horn of Africa during 2019,"" the outlet added. ""These irregular weather and climate patterns also contributed to the worst desert locust invasion in 25 years, which further threatened the crop supply in the region.""

Beasley added that other measures — such as lockdowns and recessions — will also lead to a ""major loss of income among the working poor"" around the world.

""The loss of tourism receipts will damage countries such as Ethiopia [and] the collapsing oil prices in lower-income countries like South Sudan will have an impact significantly,"" he pointed out.

""There are no famines yet. But I must warn you that if we don't prepare and act now — to secure access, avoid funding shortfalls, and disruptions to trade — we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a few short months,"" he added.

""The truth is,"" he concluded, ""we do not have time on our side, so let's act wisely — and let's act fast. I do believe that with our expertise and partnerships, we can bring together the terms and the programs necessary to make certain the COVID-19 pandemic does not become a humanitarian and food crisis catastrophe.""

Anything else?

Beasley told the Guardian that famine is more than just hunger.

""We are not talking about people going to bed hungry,"" he said. ""We are talking about extreme conditions, emergency status – people literally marching to the brink of starvation. If we don't get food to people, people will die.""

He added, ""This is truly more than just a pandemic — it is creating a hunger pandemic. This is a humanitarian and food catastrophe.""

Communist Chinese government flexes international 'clout' by defeating UN vote to debate China's genocide of the Uyghurs,"On Thursday, the United Nations' human rights council voted on an American-led motion to hold a debate about human rights abuses committed by communist China against Uyghurs in the nation's western region of Xinjiang. Of the council's 47 nation state members, 36 voted: 19 against and 17 for the motion. The result, said to be an ""abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of Uyghur victims"" by Human Rights Watch's China director, Sophie Richardson, is regarded as a win for the communist regime.

The motion proposed debate regarding the findings of a 48-page U.N. rights office report published on August 31 that detailed potential ""crimes against humanity"" in Xinjiang. While the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and a number of other countries have already formally declared the Chinese communist party's (CCP) internment and ethnic cleansing of the country's Uyghur population a genocide, this debate would have invited greater international scrutiny.

The result of the vote also revealed China's growing international influence and leverage over third-world countries.



The vote

The following countries voted against the motion to debate whether the CCP's genocide constitutes a human rights concern: Bolivia; Cameroon; China; Cote d'Ivoire; Cuba; Eritrea; Gabon; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; Mauritania; Namibia; Nepal; Pakistan; Qatar; Senegal; Sudan; United Aram Emirates; Uzbekistan; and Venezuela.



A number of countries abstained from voting, including Brazil, India, Mexico and Ukraine.

In addition to the European powers, a handful of countries supported the American motion including the Republic of Korea, Japan and Somalia.

The response

Though not surprised by the result, Olaf Wientzek of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation suggested that it damaged the credibility of the UN and ""shows China's diplomatic clout."" He emphasized that the motion did not propose a monitoring mechanism, but simply debate, but ""that was too much for many members.""

The U.K. ambassador in Geneva, Simon Manley, stated: ""China's attempts to stifle debate and hide the truth will not succeed.""

Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group said, ""It's a serious blow for the credibility of the council and a clear victory for China ... Many developing countries will see it as an adjustment away from Western predominance in the UN human rights system.""

Zhang Meifang, consul general of China in Belfast, tweeted ""Justice prevails!""

A spokesman for the communist Chinese regime's ministry of foreign affairs stated, ""The issues related to Xinjiang are not about human rights. They are about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism.""

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said, ""Today's vote protects the perpetrators of human rights violations rather than the victims — a dismaying result that puts the U.N.’s main human rights body in the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the U.N.’s own human rights office.""

The report

The topic for the precluded debate was the Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner's report. This report countered the CCP's claims that its suppression, internment, and murder of Uyghurs were justifiable as part of a broader ""counter-extremism"" strategy.

Among the report's recommendations, it suggested that a thorough investigation be undertaken into ""allegations of torture, sexual violence, ill-treatment, forced medical treatment, as well as forced labour and reports of deaths in custody.""

Uyghurs who have escaped China have detailed forced late-term abortions, routine tortures, and forced labor in China's re-education camps (called ""Vocational Education and Training Centers"" by the CCP) where an estimated 1 million people have been confined in recent years.

Xinjiang itself has reportedly been transformed into an open air prison camp.

Uyghur neighborhoods are surrounded by militarized checkpoints. Those who want to leave are retinal-scanned. Each neighborhood is assigned a ""grid monitor"" who surveils their activities and ensures against their adherence to religious customs.

According to Nury Turkel, the chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Uyghurs outside the camps are subjected to ""a barrage of scans, tests and examinations ... [including] retinal scans and fingerprints ... blood or hair samples ... for DNA profiling.""

The New York Post reported that they must also ""read from a set text for forty-five minutes so their voices could be recorded and identified,"" enabling spies to determine who was talking in tapped and taped communications.

Cullen Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote that Xinjiang, home to nearly 12 million Uyghurs, ""may be the most tightly controlled media environment on Earth, on part with North Korea.""

A 2020 report from the Washington-based Center for Global Policy indicated that under the pretenses of a ""poverty alleviation"" scheme, the CCP forces an estimated 570,000 Uyghurs to to pick cotton by hand for the CCP.

The UN high commissioner's report suggested that the CCP's actions may also ""constitute international crimes.""



Just as Christians who have fled China are hunted down internationally by the CCP, so too are Uyghurs. In fact, the recently exposed international network of communist Chinese police stations that operate in the U.S., Canada and Europe, reportedly help keep tabs on those who have escaped persecution in Xinjiang.

Safeguard Defenders, a European pan-Asian human rights NGO, issued a September report entitled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" documenting these extralegal forward operating communist bases.

While touted as pseudo-embassies, the primary function of these forward operating bases is instead to compel persons to return to China whenever the regime has determined them to have broken Chinese law. Uyghurs who have fled China are regarded by the regime as lawbreakers.

In fact, many of the estimated 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs who were hunted down and detained in the Near East and North Africa have been extradited back to China.

According to a 2021 Freedom House report, ""China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" The CCP ""targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption.""

International implications

All of the nations that voted against the motion have been pulled into China's sphere of international influence.

China, which has been materially supporting Russia during its war on Ukraine, has expanded this influence, in part, through its Belt and Road Initiative. Through its BRI, the CCP helps poorer nations build ports, rail lines and telecommunications networks, as well as secure financing. Since this assistance is usually unaffordable by design, the BRI transforms countries into politically malleable debtors. The Economic Times characterized BRI as one of ""China's colonial advances wrapped in benign global treaties.""

The New York Times reported that extra to economic leverage, some in the U.S. suspect that BRI is enabling China to build ""a globe-spanning bloc of nations that will mostly buy Chinese goods and tilt toward China's authoritarian political model.""

Every one of the countries on the human rights council that voted with China are part of the BRI. Somalia was the outlier, which is part of BRI but nevertheless took a stand.

Liu Mingfu, a retired colonel in the Chinese communist military, wrote a book to which Chinese president Xi Jinping has referred, entitled ""The China Dream."" Liu, a proponent for communist Chinese global supremacy, characterized the competition between China and the U.S. not a ""shooting duel"" or ""boxing match,"" but as a ""track and field"" competition, or a marathon.

Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, indicated in the book ""The Hundred-Year Marathon"" that elements of the communist Chinese regime have long aspired to ""replace the United States as the economic, military, and political leader of the world by the year 2049 (the one hundredth anniversary of the Communist Revolution),"" in part to ""avenge or 'wipe clean' (xi xue) past foreign humiliations,"" such as the Chinese addiction to opium in the 19th century.

Pillsbury stated that the CCP's aim is ""a world without American global supremacy.""

Pillsbury detailed how Liu and other influential Chinese political thinkers believe China to have a responsibility ""to 'improve' all the nations and people of the world by 'harmonizing' them—spreading Chinese values, language, and culture so they can better fit into under heaven. This empire 'values order over freedom, ethics over law, and elite governance over democracy and human rights.'""

In addition to evidencing China's growing political clout, Thursday's UN vote hints at the nature and priorities of the world order the CCP seeks to establish.



'Cesspool of political bias'

The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the council because of its inclusion of numerous human rights abusers such as China, Cuba, Pakistan and Venezuela. The U.S. was the first country in the council's 12-year history to drop out voluntarily.

Then-U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said, ""We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights."" She added, ""the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.""

The Biden administration had the U.S. rejoin the council last year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/un-vote-to-debate-chinas-genocide-of-the-uyghurs-indicative-of-growing-communist-clout-and-an-increasingly-bipolar-world,2022-10-08
Political science class outline at taxpayer-funded college calls Trump 'catastrophically unfit egomaniac',"A political science course at the publicly funded University of Wisconsin-Madison calls President Donald Trump a ""catastrophically unfit egomaniac,"" ""spectacularly unqualified,"" as well as a ""threat to the Republic.""

No, it's not a course about Trump — the course title is ""The American Presidency"" — but you wouldn't necessarily pick that up based on the opening three paragraphs of professor Kenneth Mayer's syllabus, which was acquired by The College Fix.

""We are 2 years into the most (how shall we put it?) unconventional presidency in American history, with a president who gleefully flouts the norms of governing and presidential behavior that have structured the office since George Washington,"" the syllabus states.

""To his supporters, this is not a bug, but a feature, and they rejoice in his contempt for what they insist is a corrupt D.C. establishment,"" the course outline adds. ""If elites are against it, Trump's supporters are for it.""

Then comes a long rant, er, paragraph further spelling out all things Trump to students:



To others, he is a spectacularly unqualified and catastrophically unfit egomaniac who poses an overt threat to the Republic. And this was before U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian operatives, with the approval of Putin himself, hacked DNC computers and carefully leaked embarrassing emails as a way of damaging Clinton, all with the goal of helping Trump; before multiple campaign officials pled [sic] guilty to lying to the FBI or to other crimes; before federal prosecutors said in a court filing that Michael Cohen was acting at Trump's direction to violate campaign finance laws by making payoffs to multiple women who said they had affairs with Trump in order to buy their silence during the campaign, or that Cohen lied about ongoing efforts during the campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Other shoes are almost certain to drop, and evidence continues to emerge of ongoing contacts and engagement between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence assets and government officials.

Not that the prof's taking sides or anything.

What did one student have to say?



McKenna Collins, a student in the class, provided the syllabus to The College Fix and said she's disappointed by its bias.

""His one-sided, lengthy articulation of the anti-Trump position in the syllabus stands in stark contrast to the feeble, effortless explanation he offers for the pro-Trump position,"" Collins told the outlet in an email. ""His choice of language serves only to set a negative, partisan tone about the subject matter before students even set foot in the classroom.""

She added: ""The professor's implicit bias against Trump supporters has robbed students of the opportunity to think objectively about the subject matter and formulate their own opinions.""

What did the professor have to say?

The College Fix said Mayer didn't respond to its email request for comment on the syllabus.

What did the college have to say?

UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone told the outlet in a statement that Mayer ""is a popular instructor and award-winning presidential scholar who leaves his political opinions at the classroom door and asks his students to do the same.""

""At a time of perhaps unprecedented political polarization, he balances the readings for this class to represent both conservative and liberal views and encourages students to draw their own conclusions based on evidence and thoughtful debate,"" McGlone added to The College Fix.

More from the outlet:



Required readings for the class, according to the syllabus, include reading a national newspaper of record, with The New York Times and the Washington Post cited by name. Other readings include various books addressing presidential power and political systems, as well as ""To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment"" by Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz.



Mayer will also have students read Federalist Papers 67, 70, 71, 72 and George Washington's inaugural address from 1789.



A section on ""The President and the Public and the Media"" assigns study on ""the rise of the 'public presidency'"" and cites some examples, such as an FDR fireside chat, Ronald Reagan's July 1981 tax speech, and Donald Trump's Twitter feed.

Anything else from the syllabus on Trump?

The College Fix noted that it's ""clear Mayer's special focus of the class is Trump.""

The outlet said the syllabus' other assigned readings include ""Hostile Sexism, Racism Denial, and the Historic Education Gap in Support for Trump,"" ""Understanding Trump's Voters: How He Pulled it Off and What Lies Ahead,"" ""How Rural Resentment Helps Explain the Surprising Victory of Donald Trump,"" ""How Trump Won,"" and ""What Trump Got Right About American Democracy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/univ-wisconsin-class-syllabus-blasts-trump,2019-01-23
US billionaires — including George Soros — beg to be taxed at a higher rate in order to help bolster economy: 'A wealth tax is patriotic',"A group of U.S. billionaires has proposed to lawmakers the notion of taxing the wealthy more to help the nation's economy.

According to the Daily Mail, billionaire liberal activist George Soros is one of those people.

What are the details?



The group — featuring 19 billionaires — penned and signed a letter addressed to candidates in the 2020 presidential election.

The letter calls on the government to increase taxes on the wealthy to positively impact the economy, provide tax relief for the low-income, student loan relief, clean energy, subsidized child care, infrastructure, and more.

The letter opens, ""We are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest 1/10 of the richest 1% of Americans — on us. The next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate[.]""

The letter's signatories also include filmmaker Abigail Disney and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Other signees include Louise Bowditch, Robert Bowditch, Sean Eldridge, Stephen English, Agnes Gund, Catherine Gund, Nick Hanauer, Arnold Hiatt, Molly Munger, Regan Pritzker, Justin Rosenstein, Stephen Silberstein, Ian Simmons, Liesel Pritzker Simmons, Alexander Soros, and Anonymous.

Another part of the lengthy letter reads, ""America has a moral, ethical, and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more. Taking on this tax is the least we can do to strengthen the country we love. Instituting a wealth tax is in the interest of our republic.""

According to the outlet, ""the tax could generate nearly $3 trillion in revenue over 10 years.""

Ian Simmons, co-founder of the Blue Haven Initiative and one of the letter's authors, told The New York Times, said that the proposal is just good sense.

"US launches multiple airstrikes in Syria, Senator questions constitutionality","The United States military announced on Tuesday that it launched airstrikes this week in northeastern Syria. The strikes were targeted at militant groups linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The U.S. carried out additional airstrikes on Shia militants in Syria on Thursday.

The Pentagon said a total of four Iranian-backed militants had been killed in the series of U.S. strikes, reports CNN. In response, the militants launched rocket attacks that wounded three U.S. servicemen.

""We'll continue to assess the situation,"" Pentagon spokesman Gen. Pat Ryder said at a press briefing on Thursday.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) expressed concern over the Biden administration’s actions in Syria and questioned the U.S.’s overall strategy in the Middle East. “It is past time for a rethink about the wisdom of having so many Americans so thinly spread across the region,"" Murphy noted in a statement. Murphy added, ""I remain concerned about any decision to undertake unauthorized military action when the Constitution and the War Powers Act require the President to come to Congress to obtain that authority.""

The fighting in Syria has also led to calls from Republicans to end discussions with Iran over reviving the Iran nuclear deal. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) stated, ""These attacks by Iran’s proxies against U.S. servicemembers show why we cannot cut a bad nuclear deal with Iran. The Biden administration must walk away from this bad deal that will fuel Iran’s terrorist attacks on U.S. soldiers and civilians.""

The New York Times notes that Syria, which has faced over a decade of civil war, has served as the setting for multiple proxy wars involving Iran, Israel, the United States, Russia, Turkey, and the Islamic State. The Times reports that attacks on two U.S. bases in Syria earlier this month “could have been an Iranian attempt to avenge a previous Israeli attack by targeting Israel’s U.S. allies.”

Iran has denied any connection to the groups in Syria. Newsweek reports that Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani described the American bombings as a “terrorist act against the popular groups and fighters against the occupation and denied any affiliation of them to the Islamic Republic of Iran.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-launches-multiple-airstrikes-in-syria,2022-08-28
"US Senate predicted to approve Finland and Sweden’s request to join NATO – Sen. Hawley says ‘I intend to vote no,’ receives backlash from Sen. Cruz and Sen. Rubio","The U.S. Senate voted today on a resolution to ratify Finland and Sweden's applications to join NATO. The request has largely received bi-partisan support and was expected to pass through the Senate easily.



Finland and Sweden requested to join following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Putin reportedly stated that the two countries could ""join whatever they want."" However, Putin also warned that ""if military contingents and military infrastructure were deployed there, [Russia] would be obliged to respond symmetrically and raise the same threats for those territories where threats have arisen for [them.]""

After applying for membership, the Nordic countries were met with resistance from Turkey, which alleged that Finland and Sweden supported groups Turkey had designated as terrorists. Since then, the three countries came to an agreement and signed an accord to allow the application to move forward.

Referring to today's vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stated, ""The NATO vote is a very important vote for American security around the world. Finland's and Sweden's membership will strengthen NATO even further, and is all the more urgent given Russian aggression.""



While most senators have voiced support for the two countries joining NATO, Senator Josh Hawley recently wrote an op-ed explaining why he would not be voting for the ratification. Hawley explained that if the vote passed, ""According to the terms of NATO's founding treaty, that means the United States would be obliged to defend both countries in the event of a military attack. I intend to vote no.""

Hawley expressed concern that America is not in a position to commit to protecting another country. He wrote, ""When it comes to Chinese imperialism, the American people should know the truth: the United States is not ready to resist it. Expanding American security commitments in Europe now would only make that problem worse—and America, less safe.""

The Missouri senator mentioned that European countries are not paying their fair share regarding defense responsibilities. He called on them to invest more in national defense to alleviate costs for the United States. ""All the way back in 2006, NATO member states pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on national defense. It should be higher. The United States spends far more than that on defense. But many NATO members still haven't met even this minimal commitment,"" Hawley noted.

In an interview with Politico, Senator Ted Cruz disagreed with Hawley's points. Cruz argued, ""We don't beat China by retreating from the rest of the world. We beat China by standing with our allies against our enemies.""

Yesterday, Senator Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed in reply to Hawley's. In it, Rubio claimed, ""NATO would be stronger with Finland and Sweden. And while President Joe Biden's record is proof that weakness invites aggression and breeds chaos, the converse is also true. As Ronald Reagan would say, peace comes through strength.""

Rubio argued that by adding Finland and Sweden to NATO, America would have more resources to defend itself against the People's Republic of China.

On July 5, all 30 NATO members signed an accession protocol, granting Sweden and Finland the ability to join the alliance. Since the accession was signed, the two Nordic countries have been allowed to participate in some meetings.

However, the decision must first be ratified by all 30 parliaments before the two countries can become official members. The ratification process could take up to a year, at which point, the defense clause will protect them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-senate-predicted-to-approve-finland-and-sweden-s-request-to-join-nato-sen-hawley-says-i-intend-to-vote-no-receives-backlash-from-sen-cruz-and-sen-rubio,2022-08-03
"US officials tell Nvidia not to send top AI chips to China, prompting backlash","On Friday, American officials told Nvidia that the technology company needs a U.S. government license in order to export products whose performance equals or exceeds the capabilities of its A100 graphics processing chips to China, Russia, or Hong Kong.

When the company revealed this on Wednesday, its shares fell by 4% and fell again Thursday morning. The company had allegedly booked $400 million in sales to China of products that fall under the new requirement, which may now have to be scrapped.

This move by the U.S. government constitutes a significant crackdown on Chinese technological capabilities. It comes amid increased uncertainty regarding the fate of the Republic of Taiwan, which has faced recent escalations and encroachments by Chinese communist forces.

The majority of Nvidia's chips and those of virtually every other major chip manufacturer are produced in Taiwan, upon which both the U.S. and China are heavily reliant. The U.S. regards the potential of Chinese technological supremacy as both a strategic threat and a challenge to American interests.

Nvidia alleged that part of the American motive behind the new rule was addressing ""the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in China.""



The A100 chips are used to power high-performing data centers for AI, data analytics, and supercomputing. Such technology would enable the communist Chinese regime to continue to execute advanced work like image recognition or to further power the kind of systems it has employed in its Xinjiang concentration camps.

As for military uses, such chips can be utilized to analyze satellite imagery for weapons and military installations, as well as to sift through digital communications for intelligence-gathering purposes.

A group of experts chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt stated last year that the U.S. was ""not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era.""

The group's 756-page National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence report indicated that the possibility of Chinese technological supremacy poses a threat to the homeland: ""We will not be able to defend against AI-enabled threats without ubiquitous AI capabilities and new warfighting paradigms.""

The report also indicated that the CCP ""has embarked on a multi-pronged campaign of licit and illicit technology transfer to become a 'science and technology superpower' by 2050."" The communist regime deliberately seeks to target ""U.S. critical sectors, companies, and research institutions,"" stealing their technology and costing America $300 billion to $600 billion per year.

The new rule intended as a check on Chinese ambitions does not only target Nvidia. Rival tech company Advanced Micro Devices, whose shares similarly dropped after the announcement, told Reuters that it too received similar license requirements. It is no longer permitted to export its MI250 artificial intelligence chips to China.

The communist Chinese regime responded on September 1, condemning the curb on Nvidia's exports and demanding its reversal. ""China firmly opposes this,"" said Shu Jueting, a CCP spokesperson. ""The U.S. side should immediately stop its erroneous practices ... and do more to contribute to world economic stability.""



China is heavily reliant upon the Republic of Taiwan's high-end chips, as it is presently unable to produce them despite spending heavily in an effort to develop the capability.

The U.S. is similarly reliant. Recognizing its dependency on foreign supply, in 2021 Congress included incentives in its national defense bill to establish leading-edge chip manufactures stateside.

Last month, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law, sending $53 billion to U.S. chip manufacturers. In August, Intel announced it would spend over $20 billion building chip factories in Ohio. The trouble is that, as with the Intel factories, American chip manufacturers generally will not be able to ramp up production for years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-tells-nvidia-no-export-top-chips-to-china,2022-09-01
Venezuela's Congress declares President Nicolas Maduro a 'usurper' as opposition leader rises,"Venezuela's Congress officially declared President Nicolas Maduro a ""usurper"" on Tuesday, making his actions null and void just days after he was sworn in for a disputed second term in office.

Under the country's constitution, Juan Guaido, the head of the National Assembly, can step in to lead the country as a whole in the absence of a legitimate national president; meaning all eyes are now transfixed on whether opposition leader Guaido has the backing to grab the reins from the socialist dictator Maduro.

What are the details?

Reuters reported that opposition lawmaker Jorge Millan said in a speech following the vote, ""Today, Congress declares that at this time there is no president of the republic. Let's start the process to recover the constitutional order.""

The National Assembly also agreed on a measure asking dozens of foreign governments to freeze any bank accounts linked to Maduro's government.

While Article 233 of the Venezuelan constitution allows for Guaido to take power under this circumstance, he would need the backing of the military and the international community in order to do so — and Maduro has made it clear that he will not give up his position without a fight.

On Monday, Maduro laughed off the notion that he would cede power to Guaido, mocking him in a speech by saying, ""I'm going to give you the sash, big boy, to see what you do with the country,"" referring to the official banner the president dons.

Government leaders in the Constitution Assembly — a rival body created in 2017 and stacked with supporters of Maduro —have threatened to have Guaido tried for treason. According to CNN, government operatives briefly detained Guaido on Sunday, but he was released a few hours later.

Meanwhile, Maduro continues to dig the country further into its socialist hole, ordering a 300 percent increase in the minimum wage on Monday while annual inflation currently runs at roughly 240,000 percent, Bloomberg reported.

So, what do we care?

CNN reported that President Donald Trump is considering recognizing Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, a move that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) endorsed on Tuesday.

Over 60 countries including the U.S. have stated that Maduro is not the legitimate President of #Venezuela.



I have asked @POTUS to recognize @jguaido as the legitimate transitional President of #Venezuela if the National Assembly invokes Article 233 of the constitution.

— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) January 15, 2019

"VIDEO: Florida man tears into school board over ‘equity’ and inclusivity mission: ‘Your only job is education, not indoctrination!","A Florida man who indicated he was a member of the U.S. military embarked on an angry rant at an area school district after it unveiled its new equity statement.

A portion of the new statement decries ""white advantage"" and vows to dismantle racism and ""other systems of oppression and inequity.""

District parents have been flooding the district with complaints about the racially divisive language used in the new equity statement, which was approved earlier in May, and now the district is considering pulling back on using the controversial terminology.

What are the details?

In a now-viral video, an unidentified man can be seen shouting at members of Palm Beach County's school district over the district's current mandatory mask policy and its equity statement.

The man, who can be seen on video speaking during the public comments section of the Wednesday night meeting, can be heard saying, ""The school board recently adopted an equity statement. Why? Your only job is education, not indoctrination.""

Audience members cheered the man's statement.

The man continues growing more and more agitated and continues, ""Attention board members: Our nation is a republic! We are the people, we have a voice, our votes are our weapons, and we will use them in 2022 and beyond! We in the military, our blood, our sweat, is the equity. It is courage, character; not color, not gender, that makes this nation great. Working Americans are united, we are not divided. Stop trying to incite division among us!""

He concludes, ""We are Americans first, and we will be free always!""

What else?

The school district's new equity statement and mask mandate have raised many questions and concerns from district parents, and Wednesday night's public session lasted for more than seven hours, according to a Thursday report from WPTV-TV.

The statement says that ""each student — regardless of race, ethnicity, poverty, disability, language status, undocumented status, religious affiliation, gender identity, and sexual orientation — will have access to the opportunities, resources, and support they need to imagine, nurture, and achieve their dreams.""

You can read the equity statement in its entirety below:

The School District of Palm Beach County is committed to dismantling racism and other systems of oppression and inequity. We will create equitable and inclusive schools that ensure students have what they need to be successful in school and life.



Achieving racial equity requires proactive and continuous investment in historically marginalized groups who have endured centuries of systemic oppression. The School District of Palm Beach County is committed to dismantling structures rooted in white advantage and transforming our system by hearing and elevating under-represented voices, sharing power, recognizing and eliminating bias, and redistributing resources to provide equitable outcomes.



The School District of Palm Beach County will take ownership for students' academic mastery, emotional intelligence, and social-emotional needs by creating environments where students, families, staff, and communities will develop agency and voice.



The School District of Palm Beach County acknowledges the existence of—and will eliminate—systems, processes, and mindsets that perpetuate race, ethnicity, poverty, disability, language status, undocumented status, religious affiliation, gender identity, and sexual orientation as predictors of achievement.



The School District of Palm Beach County will embrace, celebrate, and honor our students, families, staff, and community members and their unique cultural histories, while ensuring each student achieves personal and academic success.

What else?

According to WPTV, there was an ""enhanced police presence and security measures"" both inside and outside the building during the contentious meeting, a move the board said was ""done in an abundance of caution.""

More than 100 people spoke during the meeting, and the board said it received ""hundreds"" of emails in protest of both the mask mandate and equity statement.

Last week, Superintendent Dr. Donald Fennoy announcedthat face masks will be optional for students for the 2021-2022 school year. Masks are still required for the remainder of the current academic year, which ends June 18.

District may now pull back on 'white advantage'

On Friday, the Palm Beach Post reported that the school board is now considering removing the reference to ""white advantage"" from its recently approved declaration.

In response to the backlash, board member Karen Brill recommended that the reference to ""structures rooted in white advantage"" be removed from the statement.

""It is evident that a few of the words are not helpful, and in fact, are harmful,"" Brill said.

According to the outlet, Brill proposed that board members consider revising the language for a new approval.

""School Board Chairman Frank Barbieri echoed Brill's proposal, saying that the statement was being so widely misinterpreted it had created an 'untenable situation,'"" the Post added. ""The equity statement, he said, was intended to explain the school board's dedication to offset the effects of inequities between children, not to draw a distinction between the school district's white and non-white students.""

Barbieri said, ""I think it's important that we understand that was the purpose of the equity statement. It wasn't to make it a black and white issue, which is what the perception is now.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-florida-man-school-board-equity-indoctrination,2021-05-21
Video: Granddaughter of elderly Hispanic woman killed by illegal immigrant blasts 'sanctuary' laws,"Daria Ortiz, the granddaughter of a 92-year-old Hispanic woman who is said to have been murdered by an illegal immigrant in New York that was previously spared deportation under the city's sanctuary ordinance, blasted the controversial policy on Friday.

At a press conference alongside Donald President Trump, Ortiz said her grandmother would still be alive if the New York Police Department had complied with a standing order to turn-over the alleged killer to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in November when he was in police custody for a separate matter.

""The tragedy in all of this is the fact that this could have been avoided, had there been no sanctuary law,"" Ortiz said. ""The tragedy is my grandmother is not ever going to be here again.""

She added: ""The man who was responsible for this should have never had the opportunity to do this.""

Her grandmother was 'a shining example of people who come legally' to America

Ortiz was President Trump’s guest at the National Border Patrol Council where she delivered an emotional tribute to her grandmother, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. The young woman described 92-year-old Maria Fuertes as a ""shining example of when people come legally to this country, work hard, and do the right thing and are law-abiding citizens.""



Ortiz said Furtes ""raised her children and her grandchildren while working hard to give us a future.""

www.youtube.com

NYPD ignored an ICE detention order



As TheBlaze previously reported, Maria Fuertes was sexually assaulted and murdered just steps from her home in Queens on Jan. 6.

Initially, police officers thought her death was the result of a slip-and-fall accident. Upon further investigation, law enforcement officials arrested 21-year-old Reeaz Khan and charged him with raping and then strangling the nonagenarian to death.

According to WABC-TV, Khan is a Guyanese national who was in the country illegally despite having a violent criminal record. He was arrested in November after stabbing his own father. While he was in police custody, immigration enforcement ordered Khan to be detained. Had the NYPD followed the detainer order, Khan would have been turned over to ICE. Instead, pursuant to Mayor Bill de Blasio's ""sanctuary city"" policy, the alleged violent criminal was released back to the streets.

Following Fuertes' murder, police leaders and federal immigration officials slammed de Blasio's policy as ""dangerously flawed.""

""Make no mistake, it is this city's sanctuary policies that is the sole reason this criminal was allowed to roam the streets freely and end an innocent woman's life,"" ICE Acting-Director Matthew Albence said.

VIDEO: Iranian authorities attempt to burn Israeli flag — but 'karma' turns the tables all the way over,"Iranian journalist and activist Masih Alinejad reported Sunday that ""authorities in the Islamic Republic attempted to burn the Israeli flag, as they usually do.""

However, Alinejad took note that ""this time karma got them, and they ended up burning themselves.""

Here's the clip:

Iranian burns Israel flag then gets caught on fire. youtu.be

Alinejad added on Twitter that ""unlike the regime, ordinary Iranians increasingly refuse to burn or walk on Israeli and American flags.""

Indeed, TheBlaze in January 2020 reported that when thousands of Iranians marched in the streets of Tehran calling for the resignation of Ayatollah Khamenei, most of them carefully walked around images of U.S. and Israeli flags painted on the ground.

How did folks react to the video?

While there's always plenty of anti-Israel sentiment to be found on social media — particularly amid reports of Palestinian casualties following Israel's retaliation against Hamas militants who fired rockets into Israel Monday — some folks who commented on the tweeted video weren't too sympathetic to the Iranian guy after his backside caught fire:

""When it comes to venting Islamic radical hate, taking everything to excess is the rule,"" one commenter said. ""It can't just be a little handheld flag, it has to be a battalion banner. They can't just light a match or use a Bic, it has to be a bucketful of gasoline. They're idiots.""

""Stupidity to the moon,"" another user observed.

""Is this a lost episode of The Three Stooges?"" another commenter asked. ""I think I see Curly, but where's Moe and Larry?""

""Did you notice a gust of wind came in just at the right time?"" another user noted.

""He made an ash of himself,"" another commenter quipped.

""Don't mess with Israel,"" another user declared.

""Guess they didn't teach fire safety at terrorist school,"" another user offered. ""Stop. Drop. Roll.""

""I'll take my xenophobia extra crispy, thanks!"" another commenter joked.

""Good thing they were wearing masks,"" another user noticed.

Video: ‘Lifelong Democrat and proud feminist’ joins conservatives to oppose House Dems’ transgender bill,"A Democratic effort to codify transgenderism into federal civil rights law has drawn the criticism of yet another prominent feminist activist.

At a Thursday Capitol Hill news conference put together by Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), Women's Liberation Front board member Kara Dansky introduced herself as a ""lifelong Democrat and a proud feminist"" and said the socially conservative politicians alongside her at the event probably ""profoundly disagree"" with her on several issues.

""But we are here together to take a strong stand for the rights, privacy, and safety of women and girls,"" Dansky continued, ""all of which are threatened by the so-called 'Equality Act.'""

H.R. 5, the so-called ""Equality Act,"" is expected to go to a floor vote in House of Representatives this week. Basically, it would add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes to federal civil rights law.

Dansky went on to list multiple reasons why the legislation would be bad news for women if it were enacted, because it would ""reconfigure"" sex based on the ""ill-defined and nebulous"" idea of gender identity. She explained that ""there is no way both do that and also protect women's rights"" and provided three reasons why:

""One: The word woman means 'adult human female.' Women have been fighting for our rights as women for thousands of years,"" Dansky said. ""As the men who excluded us from the franchise at the dawning of the republic knew, the word 'sex' has meaning.

""Two: Women and girls fought hard for sex-segregated spaces, and we're not giving them up,"" she continued. ""Not so long ago, there were no such things as women's bathrooms, locker rooms, or changing rooms. … As long as the epidemic of male violence against women continues, women have the right to demand separate spaces from males, regardless of how they identify.

""Three: The notion of defining sex to include gender identity has material consequences for women and girls,"" Dansky concluded. ""Over the centuries, our society has created schools, scholarships, dormitories, business loans and other concrete benefits for women and girls precisely because we had been excluded from the public sphere for so long.""

But under the provisions of the ""Equality Act,"" those spaces and opportunities would have to be open to biological males as well.

Dansky is not the first left-leaning feminist to voice opposition to the bill's provisions redefining sex and gender. At a hearing on the legislation in April, lesbian activist Julia Beck called the bill a "" human rights violation.""

""If the act passes in its current form as H.R. 5, then every right that women have fought for will cease to exist,"" Beck told the House Judiciary Committee. ""Every person in this country will lose their right to single-sex sports, grants, shelters, and loans. The law will forbid ever distinguishing between women and men.""

At Thursday's news conference, Republican House members also warned about the ""Equality Act's"" potential effects on unborn life and conscience rights.

""It would require a universal right to abortion, up until birth,"" House Freedom Caucus member Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) warned of the bill.

Lesko has introduced an amendment that seeks to create pro-life protections within the framework of the legislation by stating that nothing in the act ""may be construed to grant or secure any right relating to abortion or the provision or funding thereof.""

Another House Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), warned that the bill's adversarial provisions against religious liberty would have far-reaching and harmful implications for traditional believers all over the country:

Faith-based adoption agencies would have to violate their convictions of finding a mother and a father for a child or shut down. Small business owners of faith would have to violate their convictions on morality and marriage, and sexuality or close the doors. Churches and faith institutions would have to abandon the teachings of their church in order to participate in federally funded programs, so that things like Catholic schools could lose the national school lunch program. Jewish synagogues could lose grants for protection from terrorist threats. Churches could lose FEMA disaster aid. And faith-based colleges and universities could lose federal student aid.

""This is a horrifying bill,"" Hice continued. ""The Democrats are exposing themselves as the party willing to use the strong arm of government to oppress Americans, to demonize religion and religious liberties, and to circumvent our constitution.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-lifelong-democrat-feminist-opposes-transgender-bill,2019-05-16
Man who lost both arms at the age of 12 goes viral for his video chopping wood,"A Czech man with no arms has gone viral for his ability to chop wood using his chin to wield an axe.

What are the details?

Petr Schneider lost his arms when he was just 12 years old after suffering an electric shock.

Now, he's gaining notoriety across the globe for being able to quickly and deftly chop wood using nothing but his chin and a little bit of centrifugal force.

Schneider, who hails from Okrouhla, Czech Republic, said that he made the video as a ""motivator for friends,"" Yahoo! reported.

What else?

According to the Internet Journal of Third World Medicine, surviving such a shock can have devastating effects on the body.

High-tension electrical shocks, the journal notes, can often result in ""injuries which can be severe [and] may lead to limb gangrene and subsequent amputation.""

""Electric current may be retained in the bones, causing heat and leading to necrosis and coagulation of small- to medium-sized vessels within the muscles and other tissues, almost completely sparing the skin,"" the journal noted. ""Blood vessels and muscles of the limb may also be affected leading to limb gangrene which is relatively uncommon. Amputation is usually indicated in these cases.""

The journal pointed to the story of a 12-year-old girl who stepped on a high-tension electrical wire following a heavy rain storm.

""She was electrocuted and fell to the ground, sustaining extensive burns of both upper and lower limbs; and her trunk,"" the journal noted. ""Subsequently, she became unable to bear weight on both lower limbs. The toes of her right foot and the 1st and 2nd toes of her left foot later became dusky in color and then frankly black.""

The 12-year-old was taken to a hospital for treatment and ultimately had all of the toes on her right foot and two toes on her left foot amputated.

In another case, a 48-year-old male electrical worker was electrocuted through his right hand.

""A few days later, the right hand was noticed to have turned black with emission of foul smelling discharge,"" the journal noted.

Ultimately, the male was forced to undergo an amputation right below his elbow.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-man-no-arms-chopping-wood,2021-03-11
Viral Twitter thread by prominent journalist exposes liberal hypocrisy on Iran protests,"Yashar Ali, one of Twitter's most beloved users, called out some of President Donald Trump's opponents in a viral Twitter thread early Sunday.

In a series of tweets that were widely circulated, Ali, who is of Iranian descent, said that some on the left are using the Iranian people ""as a tool to attack President Trump.""

To back his claims, Ali said that many of ""the most active and prominent liberal Twitter accounts"" ignored the latest anti-government protests in Iran orchestrated by citizens angry that the Islamic Republic lied about shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet last week.





The protests, Ali went on to say, were an ""inconvenient"" fact for those who continue to blame Trump for the escalating situation in Iran.

Ali said, ""It seems to me the protests were inconvenient for some of these folks today. They were placing the blame on the Iranian leadership who lied repeatedly about what happened. They weren't blaming President Trump...so it wasn't worth it to bring attention to or support them?""

Earlier in his thread, Ali said that Iran ""is a tinderbox internally"" because Iranians are ""furious"" with Tehran for lying about what brought down Ukraine International Flight PS752, which resulted in the deaths of all 176 people onboard the plane.

Virginia GOP candidate for governor says 'Trump should declare martial law' in election fight,"Virginia gubernatorial candidate and Republican state Sen. Amanda Chase says President Donald Trump ""should declare martial law"" as his challenge continues in the wake of the Electoral College officially voting to affirm Joe Biden as president-elect.

What are the details?

In a Facebook post reacting to the news of Biden's electoral victory, Chase wrote, in part:

""Not my President and never will be. The American people aren't fools. We know you cheated to win and we'll never accept these results. Fair elections we can accept but cheating to win; never. It's not over yet. So thankful President Trump has a backbone and refuses to concede. President Trump should declare martial law as recommended by General Flynn.""

On Dec. 1, former national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn — who was recently pardoned by Trump — tweeted an apparent endorsement of a news release from the We The People Convention, which began:

""Tom Zawistowski, President of the TEA Party affiliated We the People Convention (WTPC) and Executive Director of the Portage County TEA Party, published a full page ad in the Washington Times newspaper demanding that President Trump Invoke limited Martial law in order to allow the U.S. Military to oversee a new free and fair federal election if Legislators, Courts and the Congress do not follow the Constitution.""

The Washington Post reported:

In an interview Tuesday, Chase said she was holding out hope that Trump somehow would be declared the winner when the electoral college ballots are formally counted during a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 — an all-but-impossible outcome, especially as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday publicly acknowledged Biden's victory for the first time since the election. Barring that extremely unlikely turn of events, Chase thinks martial law is in order.



Under martial law, she said, troops would ""go and seize these [voting] machines and voting equipment to find the voter fraud. There needs to be a national audit.""

What else?

Del. Kirk Cox, Chase's GOP primary rival in the governor's race, condemned her message, saying in a written statement, ""Senator Chase's suggestion that martial law be imposed is absurd and dangerous.""

The retired teacher continued, ""I taught government for 30 years and have great respect for our constitutional republic. Per that system and the Electoral College vote yesterday, Joe Biden will be the next President.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-gop-candidate-for-governor-says-trump-should-declare-martial-law-in-election-fight,2020-12-16
Virginia Supreme Court hands Christian PE teacher major victory after being suspended for opposing transgender policy,"Tanner Cross got the last laugh.

The Leesburg Elementary School physical education teacher from northern Virginia was handed a decisive victory on Monday when the Virginia Supreme Court agreed that his suspension for opposing a progressive gender policy was likely unconstitutional.

Who is Cross?

Cross first made headlines in June after he was placed on administrative leave in late May for voicing opposition to a Loudoun County Public Schools policy that requires school faculty to affirm far-left transgender policies, such as using a student's preferred pronouns and allowing ""gender-expansive and transgender students"" to participate in activities consistent with their ""gender identity.""

Cross argued the policy violated his religious beliefs. ""It's lying to a child, it's abuse to a child, and it's sinning against our God,"" he said of the policy.

Suspended Virginia teacher reinstated after comments about transgender students www.youtube.com

In June, Cross filed a lawsuit challenging his suspension. Days later, Loudoun County Circuit Court Judge James E. Plowman Jr. reinstated Cross, calling the Christian teacher's suspension ""unnecessary and vindictive.""



But the Loudoun County Public Schools continued to fight, vowing to take the case to the state Supreme Court. The school district claimed ""the rights of students to be educated in a supportive and nurturing environment"" outweighed Cross' First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion.

What did the Virginia Supreme Court rule?

The commonwealth's highest court explained in a 14-page opinion that the judges did not buy the claim that Cross ""might harm children"" by not affirming far-left gender ideas, but did believe the school district violated Cross' rights.

""Cross was opposing a policy that might burden his freedoms of expression and religion by requiring him to speak and interact with students in a way that affirms gender transition, a concept he rejects for secular and spiritual reasons. Under such circumstances, Cross' interest in making his public comments was compelling,"" the court said.

""Although the Board may have considered Cross' speech to be 'a trifling and annoying instance of individual distasteful abuse of a privilege,' we believe Cross has a strong claim to the view that his public dissent implicates 'fundamental societal values' deeply embedded in our Constitutional Republic,"" the court explained.

The school district had made three arguments in its appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court, all of which were rejected.

What was the reaction?

Loudoun County Public Schools did not comment on the ruling, according WRC-TV, or the unilateral rejection of its claims by the high court.

However, the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Cross, celebrated the ruling.

""Teachers shouldn't be forced to promote ideologies that are harmful to their students and that they believe are false, nor should they be silenced for commenting at a public meeting. The lower court's decision was a well-reasoned application of the facts to clearly established law, as the Virginia Supreme Court found,"" ADF senior counsel Tyson Langhofer said. ""Public employees cannot be forced to contradict their core beliefs just to keep a job.""

Cross will now return to his job as a PE teacher, the Washington Post noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-supreme-court-christian-teacher-victory-transgender-policy,2021-09-01
Federal attorneys charge 24 in voter fraud probe,"Federal attorneys in North Carolina have been investigating allegations of voter-related fraud, and on Friday, announced that 24 additional people have been charged over the last 18 months.

Agents of Homeland Security Investigations under the Document and Benefit Fraud Task Force in the Eastern District of North Carolina launched a probe into voter fraud. On Friday, the U.S. attorney's office for eastern North Carolina released a statement revealing that four defendants were being charged with making false claims of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in the 2016 general election. The two charged with unlawful voting also are accused of false claims of citizenship, according to the Associated Press.

""Gabriela Guzman-Miguel, 26, and Jose Abraham Navarro, 42, both of Mexico, are accused to have voted despite lacking the legal status to do so,"" the Epoch Times reported. ""The list described both as aliens or immigrants.""

The defendants hailed from 15 countries, including Honduras, France, Yemen, Iraq, Nigeria, and Canada. The first charges were filed in September 2019, and arrests have been as recent as this month.

""The charges include making false claims of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote, naturalization fraud, and fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other documents as it relates to the registration to vote, and false statements in immigration proceedings,"" the statement from the U.S. attorney's office for eastern North Carolina reads, adding that there are no charges of conspiracy.



""Those charged face jail time and fines of up to $350,000 if convicted,"" the Epoch Times noted.

In August 2018, charges of voter fraud-related charges were announced against 19 foreign nationals. Robert J. Higdon, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, unveiled charges against foreign nationals from Mexico, Italy, Korea, Haiti, Panama, Korea, El Salvador, Germany, Poland, Guyana, Nigeria, Japan, and the Dominican Republic. The foreign nationals were hit with criminal charges of voting by an alien and false claim of U.S. citizenship.

""The right to vote is a precious privilege available only to citizens of the United States,"" Higdon said in February 2019. ""When a non-citizen votes in a federal election it serves to dilute and devalue the vote of American citizens and places the decision making authority of the American electorate in the hands of those who have no right to make those choices. This case is particularly disturbing as the defendant worked for the Board of Elections. My office will do its part to protect the rights of every American citizen to cast their vote freely and to have it counted fairly.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/voter-fraud-probe-foreign-nationals,2021-03-20
Police in Washington state push back against new gun control measures,"Voters in Washington state overwhelmingly passed a ballot initiative dubbed I-1639 in November, imposing a number of new gun control measures. However, law enforcement officials representing districts opposed to the sweeping regulations say the restrictions are unconstitutional and are therefore refusing to enforce them.

What are the details?

According to the Seattle Times, I-1639 passed with more than 60 percent of the vote — but 27 of the state's 39 counties voted against it. Several sheriffs and police chiefs in those areas are going on the record and pushing back against the regulations that are among the most stringent in the nation.

Klickitat County Sheriff Bob Songer told The Guardian that I-1639 ""is unconstitutional on several grounds,"" and said, ""I've taken the position that as an elected official, I am not going to enforce that law.""

Songer added that if other agencies attempted to take guns from residents of his county under the new laws, he would consider ""standing in their doorway"" to prevent it.

The paper reported that other law enforcement officials have also voiced opposition to the measure, with some saying they will delay enforcement at least until they see the outcomes of lawsuits currently challenging the initiative. There's a further push for allowing cities and counties to opt out and become ""Second Amendment sanctuaries"" exempt from the regulations.

Republic Police Chief Loren Culp in Ferry County told Fox News, ""I cannot and will not enforce this law. It goes against the oath of my office.

""The state constitution is even more explicit than the U.S. Constitution: The right of the individual citizen to bare arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired,"" Culp explained.

He has asked the town council to consider becoming a ""sanctuary city,"" and the vote is expected in March.

What do the new restrictions include?

I-1639 imposes several regulations, including prohibiting the sale of semi-automatic rifles to adults under the age of 21, and requiring handgun purchasers to sign a waiver allowing law enforcement to access their private medical records. It also creates a new crime of ""community endangerment"" making gun owners criminally liable in the instance that someone such as a child or a felon gets their hands on an ""improperly stored"" firearm and displays it publicly or uses it in a crime.

A coalition of opponents, including the National Rifle Association, are fighting I-1639 in court, saying it violates the First, Second, and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, along with the commerce clause and state's own constitution.

Prior to the ballot measure's passage, several law enforcement agencies came out against it, including the Washington Council of Police and Sheriffs and the Washington State Sheriffs Association.

"WaPo fails miserably at fact checking Trump, actually proves his point on Democrats, violent crime","The Washington Post attempted to fact check President Donald Trump last week on his claim that Democrat-run cities have the highest rates of violent crime.

However, the newspaper ended up just proving the president's point.

Last Wednesday, Trump said, ""You hear about certain places like Chicago and you hear about what's going on in Detroit and other — other cities, all Democrat run. Every one of them is Democrat run. Twenty out of twenty. The 20 worst, the 20 most dangerous are Democrat run.""

In response, the Post published an analysis article declaring that Trump was incorrect. ""Trump keeps claiming that the most dangerous cities in America are all run by Democrats. They aren't.""

Using FBI data on violent crime occurrences per city, the Post found that, indeed, Democrats control almost all of the top-20 most violent American cities.

From the Post:

Most of the current mayors of these cities are Democrats. Two of the mayors of cities with the most reported violent crimes overall, though, are independents and one, the mayor of Jacksonville, Fla., is a Republican. Among the 20 cities with the most violent crime per capita, one isn't a Democrat: the independent mayor of Springfield, Mo.

The graph included in the Post article was visually damning.

So, while Trump was incorrect to say that all of the top-20 most violent cities are ran by Democrats, the Washington Post confirmed the sentiment that Trump tried to convey: when Democrats are in charge, crime is more likely to happen with increased prevalence.



But, according to Washington Post writer Philip Bump, that doesn't really matter.

""Trump would no doubt shrug at that detail, decrying as 'fake news' the revelation that his assertion was only slightly wrong. And, in fairness, it actually doesn't matter that four of the 32 cities listed above have non-Democratic mayors — because it doesn't really matter that the other mayors are Democrats,"" Bump, the author behind the analysis, wrote.

Bump justified the correlation between crime and Democrat-controlled cities by showing that Democrats almost always win urban areas, which typically have higher occurrences of crime than suburban and rural areas.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-trump-violent-crime-democrats,2020-06-28
Watch: Black GOP candidate wields AR-15 to defend home from Ku Klux Klan Democrats in viral ad: 'Make Rifles Great Again',"A Republican candidate in Arizona went viral Wednesday with a new campaign ad that shows him defending his home from the Ku Klux Klan.

Arizona Republican Jerone Davison in no uncertain terms tells voters exactly how he feels about the right to own an AR-15 rifle for self-defense in a video showing his home being approached by members of the KKK.



Davison, who is black, narrates the video which shows him at home enjoying coffee and praying as menacing figures dressed in Klan attire approach his residence with weapons.



""Democrats like to say that no one needs an AR-15 for self-defense. That no one could possibly need all 30 rounds,"" Davison says, as the Klan members approach.



The video then shows Davison stepping out of his home armed with a rifle, which scares the intruders away.



""But when this rifle is the only thing standing in between your family and a dozen angry Democrats in Klan hoods, you just might need that semi-automatic. And all 30 rounds,"" he says.

Davison posted the video to Twitter Wednesday morning, writing, ""Make Rifles Great Again.""



The 30-second ad is going viral and has been seen more than 500,000 times at the time of this article's publication.

The ad highlights the controversial history of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist terrorist organization that used violence and intimidation against white and black Republican leaders to disenfranchise black Americans. The Klan sought to reestablish white supremacy in southern states and supported the Democratic Party against Reconstruction-era Republicans in the 1870s.

The KKK reemerged in the 1920s as a racist and nativist hate group that burned crosses and denounced immigrants, Catholics, Jews, African-Americans, and organized labor. It campaigned for pro-segregation Democrats in the South and opposed the Civil Rights Movement through the 1960s.

Prominent Democratic leaders have been affiliated with the Klan, including the late West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, a former organizer and member of the KKK. Byrd later renounced the KKK and said he regretted his membership in the organization. He died in 2010, after serving in Congress for more than 50 years, and was eulogized by then-Vice President Joe Biden.

Davison, a former NFL player, pastor, and speaker, is one of five GOP candidates running in the primary election for Arizona's 4th Congressional District. He was a running back for Arizona State University and later played for the Oakland Raiders from 1996 to 1997.

After leaving the NFL, Davison spent 10 years working in California as a liaison reuniting children with incarcerated parents, according to a profile by the Arizona Republic.

His issue focus is combating big tech, fighting for election integrity — including the ""ability to validate"" results — and embracing free market principles to deal with inflation.

Watch: California physician denounces 'tyrannical' lockdowns in impassioned speech,"A California physician is being hailed as a patriot after delivering an impassioned speech citing the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in a sweeping condemnation of the coronavirus lockdowns imposed across America.

What are the details?

Dr. Jeffrey Barke stepped up to the microphone during a protest rally in Riverside County, addressing the crowd that had gathered to demonstrate against the economic shutdowns in his community and beyond.

Barke, a family physician, began by asking, ""What if wearing a mask in public is not effective?""

His speech, as dictated by the Daily Wire, continued:

My name is Dr. Jeff Barke, and I'm here representing thousands of physicians across the country whose voices are being silenced because we don't agree with the mainstream media and the experts who are telling us what to do.



Never in the history of this great republic have we told churchgoers that it's illegal for you to exercise your First Amendment right of freedom of religion. Yet, at the same time, it's essential to keep pot dispensaries open.



Never in the history of this country have we been told that you can't go to church because it's 'non-essential,' but you can go get an abortion because that's 'essential.'



Never before in our country have we let criminals out of jail but we've told you, you can't exercise your Second Amendment right and protect yourself by purchasing a firearm.



When liquor stores are deemed essential but your businesses are deemed non-essential, there's something wrong going on.

In a powerful moment, Dr. Barke pulled a document from his lab coat, held it up, and said, ""This booklet, the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution, was never designed to restrain the people; it was designed to restrain the government. This is not New York, and—thank God—this is not San Francisco. Governor Newsom has gone too far. Governor Newsom has stepped on our liberties and our freedoms.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-california-physician-denounces-tyrannical-lockdowns-in-impassioned-speech,2020-05-09
Watch: Geraldo Rivera and Charlie Kirk spar over whether Trump's election fight should continue,"Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk argued Monday over whether President Donald Trump should continue his challenges to the presidential election, after the Electoral College officially voted for Democrat Joe Biden as president-elect.

What are the details?

Following the Electoral College vote, Biden called for unity in an address to the nation. Fox News host Martha MacCallum hosted Rivera and Kirk for their reactions, and the two commentators expressed their opposing views on how things look for Trump's prospect at overturning the results.

Rivera delivered what he called a ""superficial"" criticism of Biden's delivery before saying, ""However, he's absolutely right: It is over. I want my friend, the current president, the 45th president to understand it is over. The Electoral College has voted. The longer we drag this out, the more we damage the fabric of our democracy ... and it also damages the legacy of Donald Trump, who should be taking a victory lap right now celebrating the vaccine that he almost single-handedly forced the scientific community to get ready to save millions of lives.""

In response, Kirk argued, ""If we actually want what's best for the country, you're gonna have to answer some of these questions that 55 to 60 million Americans have, and they're very good questions, such as, why were signature processes changed in Georgia? What exactly happened with people being shut out from voting tabulation process?""

Kirk went on to say that ""Joe Biden mentioned in his speech that some of this was discussed in court. Some of these, by the way, are still being played out. There are still plenty of pending legal challenges, there are hundreds...""

""That is so dishonest,"" Rivera said, stepping in, repeating again, ""That is so dishonest,"" as Kirk asked to finish making his point.

Kirk went on to raise further voting regularity concerns that have been flagged by the Trump campaign, before Rivera pushed back: ""For six weeks. We have litigated this for six weeks. Twice the Supreme Court of the United States have rejected it.""

He told Kirk, ""You have to stop this.""

What happened next?

MacCallum then played a montage showing the passion Trump supporters feel in fighting for their voices to be heard.

In reaction, Rivera noted that in the 2000 election, Al Gore conceded with only 500 votes separating him and George Bush during a contested election. He argued that Trump supporters are following Trump's lead in contesting the election against Biden, due to his defiance, saying the president is ""instilling in these people the false sense that they have been gypped.""

Kirk continued to argue, ""I believe, for the future of our country and for the goodness of our republic, these questions must be answered or else you're going to have tens of millions of people that will never trust another election again.""

Teachers' union president suggests criticism against her incites violence: 'It will lead to violence',"Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, suggested on Tuesday that criticism against her is an incitement of violence.

What is the background?

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is testing the waters for a 2024 presidential campaign.

Over the weekend, he said one of the most important issues facing Americans is education, and a central tenant of his campaign will be ""making sure we don’t teach our kids crap in schools.""

He then laid into AFT President Weingarten, who leads the second-largest teachers' union in the U.S.

""I get asked, 'Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping?' The most dangerous person in the world is [ATF president] Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call,"" Pompeo told Semafor.

""If you ask, 'Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?' It would be the teachers' unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing,"" he continued.

""If our kids don’t grow up understanding America is an exceptional nation, we’re done,"" Pompeo declared. ""If they think it’s an oppressor class and an oppressed class, if they think the 1619 Project, and we were founded on a racist idea — if those are the things people entered the seventh grade deeply embedded in their understanding of America, it’s difficult to understand how Xi Jinping’s claim that America is in decline won’t prove true.""

How did Weingarten respond?



Weingarten responded by accusing Pompeo of fomenting ""hate and division,"" rhetoric she claimed will ""lead to violence.""

The teachers' union president, in fact, said that Republican opposition to teachers indoctrinating young children with the progressive LGBT agenda, in general, is dangerous.

""He needs to fund his campaign,"" Weingarten told Semafor of Pompeo's comments. ""He doesn’t have a base so he is trying to get millions from the anti-union, anti-public-education billionaires like Betsy DeVos.""

""Pompeo is desperate to be labeled as the extremist in the Republican presidential primary,"" she added. ""He's using the same strategy, the extremists' strategy that didn't work for them in 2018, 2020, and ’22. And he's flooding the zone with disinformation. And what's dangerous about that is that it will lead to violence. He's decided to use his campaign to foment hate and division.""

Pompeo has not yet announced a presidential campaign.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/weingarten-responds-mike-pompeo,2022-11-23
White House implements travel ban for coronavirus hotspot Brazil,"The White House announced a ban on travel to the U.S. from the coronavirus hotspot of Brazil. The Trump administration now bars entry of non-citizens traveling from Brazil. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the decision was made ""to protect our country.""

The ban applies to foreign nationals who have been in Brazil in the 14 days before they tried to travel to the United States. Officials said the move would not affect commerce between the two countries.

President Donald Trump released a statement: ""I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Federative Republic of Brazil during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.""

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that the Federative Republic of Brazil is ""experiencing widespread, ongoing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2.""

Brazil has experienced a spike in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks. Brazil is currently the country with the second-most confirmed novel coronavirus cases, with over 360,000, trailing the U.S. that has 1.6 million. Brazil has added over 100,000 new COVID-19 cases in the last week and had 21,472 confirmed COVID-19 cases on last Wednesday alone.

Brazil is far and away Latin America's hardest-hit country when it comes to coronavirus. Peru is the next closest in confirmed cases with over 119,000.

Brazil is far behind the U.S in coronavirus testing, administering over 735,000 compared to the U.S. with 14.6 million tests, so the numbers don't reflect the people who are symptomatic and haven't been tested. Brazil has recorded more than 22,000 deaths, the sixth-most in the world.



Trump had already banned travel from China in late January, and most of Europe in March.

Woman awakened in middle of night by two men allegedly trying break into her home. She grabs a gun — and they pay the ultimate price.,"Detectives said a woman was asleep in her Tucson, Arizona, home when she was awakened around 3:45 a.m. Wednesday by a noise at the back of her residence, the Arizona Republic reported.

Boom

""She confronted them, she armed herself with a firearm, and shots were fired, and that info was relayed to us by 911,""

Tucson police spokesman Officer Frank Magos told the Republic.

Police told the paper that two adult men were found with gunshot wounds behind the home.

Corey Teixeira, 18, was pronounced dead at the scene, the Associated Press reported, and Ali Mohamed, 18, was taken to a hospital where he later died.

Woman slashes random vehicle's tire just because she saw a MAGA hat in the car,"An Arizona woman admitted to police that she slashed a man's tire simply because she saw a Make America Great Again hat sitting on his dashboard, according to the Arizona Republic.

The vehicle belongs to Nick Dugas, who works as a security manager at a mall. His job, which gave him access to the parking lot surveillance cameras, helped him piece together what happened.

""No one has a right to destroy property because they don't agree with someone else,"" Dugas told the Republic. ""Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine being the victim of pure hate because of my belief.""

What happened?

Saturday, Dugas's vehicle was parked at Paradise Valley Mall, where he works. That afternoon, a car parked next to his SUV, and four women got out. Two of them spotted the MAGA hat in the car, but they all went into a store, doing nothing.

A few minutes later, they came out from Dutch Bros. Coffee and got back in their car. Then, two of them got back out. The driver knelt down next to Dugas's left front tire while the passenger stood watch. On surveillance video, the left side of the vehicle is seen dropping. Then the women left.

Later that day, Dugas came out and noticed a 3-inch puncture in his tire, a clear sign that someone had cut it. That evidence sent Dugas back into work to review the surveillance footage, discover what happened, and identify the women by talking to employees of Dutch Bros. coffee and browsing the shop's Instagram followers list.

He turned the info over to Phoenix police, who said the woman admitted to cutting the tire ""because she saw a hat with a political message inside the vehicle which she disagreed with."" She was charged with misdemeanor criminal damage, which carries a punishment of up to four months in jail and a $750 fine.

What does Dugas think of all this?

The whole situation caused Dugas significant inconvenience. When he left work and discovered the flat tire, he was heading to take his son to tutoring and make it to a birthday dinner for his visiting mother. That did not happen as planned.

Still, Dugas did not let act of politically-motivated hate cause him to react poorly. Dugas's court statement emphasized that he forgave the woman for what she did, even though she was clearly in the wrong.

He also didn't even consider removing the MAGA hat from his car, and made sure to point that out to his son, a 15-year old who he adopted last year when he found the boy homeless and sleeping behind a store.

""You don't ever let anybody change who you are, or what you believe in,"" Dugas told his son, according to the Arizona Republic.

World Health Organization admits China never reported coronavirus outbreak,"The World Health Organization backtracked on their claim that China alerted the international public health agency about the initial coronavirus outbreak. The WHO now admits that China never notified them about the onset of the deadly disease.

The World Health Organization updated its ""Timeline of WHO's response to COVID-19"" on Tuesday. The initial timeline on WHO's website stated that on Dec. 31 the ""Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China, reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province.""

The timeline has been changed and now reads: ""WHO's Country Office in the People's Republic of China picked up a media statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission from their website on cases of 'viral pneumonia' in Wuhan, People's Republic of China"" on Dec. 31.

Taiwan claims it emailed WHO on Dec. 31 to request information on the outbreak in Wuhan, and asked if the virus could be transmitted between people. Taiwan, which is not a WHO member, alleged that the WHO never replied to their email, which robbed it of valuable time to prepare for the coronavirus outbreak.

In April, the WHO responded to Taiwan's allegations by saying, ""We have asked how they communicated this to us, because we are only aware of that one email that makes no mention of human-to-human transmission, but they haven't replied.""

""The first report came from Wuhan, from China itself, so Taiwan was only asking for clarification, and as some people were claiming, Taiwan didn't report any human-to-human transmission; this has to be clear,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in April. ""So, the report first came from China — that's fact number one — from Wuhan itself.""



On Jan. 12, the WHO tweeted: ""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.""

The update on the WHO website comes weeks after House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans released the ""Interim Report on Origins of COVID-19 Pandemic, Including the Roles of the Chinese Communist Party and the World Health Organization.""

""After months of investigating, it's become crystal clear the Chinese Communist Party's cover-up of the coronavirus, especially in the early days of the outbreak, played a significant role in turning what could have been a local epidemic into a global pandemic,"" Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas), lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of Congress's China Task Force, said last month.

""And, unfortunately, the World Health Organization under the leadership of Director-General Tedros only exacerbated the problem by repeatedly ignoring warnings about the severity of the virus, including from their own health experts, while at the same time parroting the CCP's propaganda without independently confirming their claims,"" McCaul said. ""This was a failure of monumental proportions and it is imperative that we uncover the truth so we can set up future safeguards to prevent this from happening yet again.""

This week, McCaul reacted to the WHO admitting that China never reported the COVID-19 outbreak.

""I'm glad to see the WHO and the Chinese Communist Party have both read my interim report on the origins of the pandemic and are finally admitting to the world the truth — the CCP never reported the virus outbreak to the WHO in violation of WHO regulations,"" McCaul said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. ""The question now is whether the CCP will continue their false propaganda campaign that continues to claim they warned the world or whether they will come clean and begin to work with the world health community to get to the bottom of this deadly pandemic.""

At the end of May, President Donald Trump announced that the United States was formally severing its relationship with the World Health Organization. President Trump said the WHO is heavily influenced by China.

""China has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year,"" Trump said. ""The world needs answers from China on the virus. We must have transparency. Why is it that China shut off infected people from Wuhan to all other parts of China?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/world-health-organization-china-covid-outbreak,2020-07-03
Wuhan Institute of Virology up for 2021 prize for ID'ing COVID-19 pathogen. Award comes from China's communist government.,"The Wuhan Institute of Virology is a candidate for the 2021 Outstanding Science and Technology Achievement Prize after ""identifying the COVID-19 pathogen,"" the Global Times reported.

The Global Times, which is a mouthpiece for the Chinese communist government, said the prize comes from the Chinese Academy of Sciences — which also is under the auspices of the People's Republic of China.

More from the Global Times:

CAS said the WIV quickly carried out pathogen identification after the outbreak of COVID-19, completed the entire virus genome sequencing and virus isolation within a short time, confirmed that the COVID-19 virus shares the same functional receptor as the SARS virus, systematically analyzed the basic biological characteristics of the virus, and revealed that coronavirus carried by bats may be the evolutionary ancestor of the COVID-19 coronavirus.

The paper added that the ""research group has completed the most comprehensive and systematic pathogenic identification research into COVID-19, which laid an important foundation and technology platform for follow-up research into tracing origins, epidemiology and pathogenic mechanism of the coronavirus, as well as the research and development of medicines and vaccines, and provided key scientific and technological support for epidemic prevention and control, CAS noted.""

'Slander from Western politicians and media'

Not surprisingly, the Global Times also wrote that the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its scientists ""have been attacked in a new round of slander from Western politicians and media"" and that China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said they ""should be awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine rather than being blamed for being the first to discover the gene sequence of the novel coronavirus.""

The paper referred to the lab-leak theory that's been gaining momentum among scientists around the world as a United States ""conspiracy"" theory.

Anything else?

Not that China has anything to worry about for the moment, since it was revealed this weekend that President Joe Biden won't pressure China to cooperate with investigations into the origins of COVID-19. Amid China's conspiracy theory retort, it was reported earlier this month that a senior Chinese epidemiologist wants the U.S. investigated as the lab-leak source.

What's more, a Harvard scientist recently admitted that her colleagues denied the possibility of a lab-leak coronavirus origin because they were afraid of being associated with former President Donald Trump and becoming a ""tool for racists.""

Republican Party of Wyoming votes to no longer recognize Rep. Liz Cheney as a Republican,"The Republican Party of Wyoming voted on Saturday to no longer recognize Rep. Liz Cheney as a member of their party.

Cheney has been one of the most outspoken critics of former President Donald Trump. She was among the 10 Republican members of Congress who voted to impeach Trump the second time when Democrats brought up charges of inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6.

The state party central committee voted 31-29 during a meeting in Buffalo, Wyoming, to formally censure Cheney for the second time.

A spokesperson for Cheney responded to the vote in a statement to the Associated Press.

""She is bound by her oath to the Constitution. Sadly a portion of the Wyoming GOP leadership has abandoned that fundamental principle and instead allowed themselves to be held hostage to the lies of a dangerous and irrational man,"" said Jeremy Adler.

He added that it was ""laughable"" for the state party to suggest Cheney was anything other than a ""conservative Republican.""

The vote might have been at least in part a response to a scathing speech Cheney gave on Tuesday excoriating the former president and his claims about fraud in the 2020 election which he lost to President Joe Biden.

""At this moment when it matters most, we are also confronting a domestic threat that we've never faced before: a former president who's attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic, aided by political leaders who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man,"" said Cheney during the speech.

She went on in the speech to rebuke the policies of Biden and the Democratic Party and enumerate the principles of conservatism as she saw them.

Cheney is facing a list of primary challengers for the at-large seat for Wyoming. Trump has endorsed Cheyenne attorney Harriet Hageman.

""Liz Cheney stopped recognizing what Wyomingites care about a long time ago,"" Hageman claimed. ""When she launched her war against President Trump, she completely broke with where we are as a state.""

Cheney responded to the endorsement with a defiant message: ""Bring it.""

PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor lambasted for criticizing Madison Cawthorn for standing during the RNC,"North Carolina Republican congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn delivered a powerful speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night. However, PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asserted that Cawthorn's moving monologue was a ""direct rebuke"" to those protesting social injustice, including NBA players.

Cawthorn is a 25-year-old vying to become the youngest member in Congress, a title currently held by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 30. Cawthorn, who owns a real estate investment company, defeated Lynda Bennett for the Republican nomination for the 11th Congressional District seat, which was vacated by Mark Meadows when he became President Donald Trump's chief of staff.

""This is a time of great adversity for our country, and I know something about adversity,"" Cawthorn began his speech.

Cawthorn is paralyzed from the waist down because he was involved in a car accident when he was 18 years old. Despite his disability, Cawthorn punctuated his speech by rising from his wheelchair to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

""You can kneel before God, but stand for our flag,"" Cawthorn said before standing up.

""The American idea my ancestors fought for during the Revolutionary War, is just as exciting and revolutionary today as it was 250 years ago,"" Cawthorn said. ""I say to Americans who love our country, young and old, be a radical for freedom. Be a radical for liberty. And be a radical for our republic, for which I stand. One nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, and may God bless America.""

""PBS NewsHour"" reporter Yamiche Alcindor criticized Cawthorn's speech on Twitter.



""Madison Cawthorn made it a point to stand, suggesting that all Americans to [sic] should stand during the pledge of allegiance & national anthem,"" Alcindor, who is an NBC News and MSNBC contributor, said. ""It was a direct rebuke of actions by ppl -- including black athletes who are currently sitting out games -- protesting police brutality.""

The tweet, which has more than 5,000 Likes, spurred backlash online. At the time of publication, there were more than 10,000 responses to the polarizing critique, and many of the replies lambasted Alcindor.

""How on earth could you possibly turn the rather moving act of a FREAKIN' PARAPLEGIC rising for the national anthem into some weird BLM trip?"" National Review contributor Jeff Blehar tweeted. ""When someone holds the door open for you, is that a rebuke of BLM too? My patience for takes like this has reached its limit.""

""If you thought, 'certainly nobody could attack this man in a wheelchair for standing up at the end of his speech,' you haven't met our completely insane White House press corps, currently viciously attacking a paralyzed man for not sharing their far-left political views,"" the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway said.

""The activist below found a way to turn a paraplegic standing up in his wheelchair an act of white supremacy,"" Daily Caller reporter Chuck Ross wrote.

""Nowhere did Cawthorn state his standing was a direct rebuke of actions by ppl — including black athletes who are currently sitting out games — protesting police brutality. And Yamiche Alcindor is not a journalist,"" conservative commentator Stephen Miller said.

""Madison Cawthorn may be paralyzed, but @Yamiche is the one who is a completely broken person,"" Sean Davis, co-founder of the Federalist, said. ""Only a deranged lunatic who worships at the altar of politics could get angry at the sight of a paralyzed person standing up. What a sad, pathetic way to go through life.""

Davis also tagged Alcindor with an image of disabled veterans from Soldier Strong, a group that serves injured veterans, standing up for the national anthem during the 2020 RNC.

Cawthorn will face off against Democratic candidate Moe Davis, a retired Air Force colonel and former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay, in the November election. An internal Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee poll conducted in July had Cawthorn leading Davis by five points (46-41).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/yamiche-alcindor-tweet-madison-cawthorn-rnc,2020-08-27
Ukraine says kill squad sent to assassinate president has been 'destroyed',"A Ukrainian defense official announced this week that a kill squad sent to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been ""eliminated"" by the country's armed forces, according to a Telegram post from Ukrainian authorities.

Oleksiy Danilov, chief of the country's National Security and Defense Council, reportedly said during a briefing on Tuesday that Ukrainian officials had recently been made aware of a ""special operation"" that was to be carried out against Zelenskyy by an elite Chechen special forces unit, known as the Kadyrovites.

The Kadyrovites are a highly-skilled paramilitary organization in Chechnya, a semiautonomous republic in Russia, that often carry out violence at Russian President Vladimir Putin's request. According to National Review, they are accused of a number of human rights violations and abuses.

Danilov said Ukrainian leaders were tipped off about the assassination plot by a group of sympathetic Russian agents with the enemy country's Federal Security Service.

""We are well aware of the special operation that was to take place directly by the Kadyrovites to eliminate our president. And I can say that we have received information from the FSB, who today do not want to take part in this bloody war. And thanks to this, I can say that Kadyrov's elite group was destroyed directly, which came here to eliminate our president,"" Danilov said, according to a Google translation of the Telegram.

The Ukrainian leader went on to say that the Kadyrovite group had been divided in two, with one being destroyed in Gostomel, near Kyiv, while the other was ""under fire.""

The Washington Post reported that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed on Monday in a Telegram post that two of his servicemen had died while six others were injured during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, neither the Chechens nor the Kremlin has attributed the losses to a foiled assassination attempt.

Since the launch of the invasion, Zelenskyy has claimed that Russian forces designated him and his family as top targets in the offensive and that Russian kill squads were actively seeking to assassinate him. Nevertheless, he vowed to remain in the capital, Kyiv, and stand alongside his people.

Even when the U.S. government reportedly offered to evacuate Zelenskyy out of harm's way, the president stood by his decision to stay.

""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" an ""upbeat"" Zelenskyy declared in response to the offer, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-kill-squad-destroyed-ukraine-says,2022-03-02
WTF MSM!? Brian Stelter’s attack on Mark Levin’s new book proves Levin’s argument in just one paragraph,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Painfully unaware … On Tuesday, LevinTV host Mark Levin's new book ""Unfreedom of the Press"" will be out. I've read a review copy. As I mention in my review, the book lays bare the true nature of the media: It has become a de facto propaganda arm of the left while telling the American people it is nonpartisan. Apparently, CNN's media cheerleader/critic Brian Stelter has not read the book. Otherwise, he wouldn't have proven that central thesis in one short paragraph.

Here's what Stelter wrote in his newsletter Sunday night:

Mark Levin's hate-the-media book is No. 1



Right-wing commentator Mark Levin's book ""Unfreedom of the Press"" comes out Tuesday. Thanks to his numerous plugs on the radio and on Fox, he's at No. 1 on Amazon's hardcover and paperback book chart right now, ahead of Howard Stern's new book. His overarching message: You can't trust the press ...

Of course, Stelter wasn't attacking Levin's book. He was just saying nonchalantly that it was a ""hate-the-media"" book, rather than a look at the full historical sweep of the media's role in the American republic. He even said so himself.

This is classic Stelter, who often doesn't say things, he just types them and puts them in his newsletter, or claims he's just commenting on things. But what he's really doing every moment of every day is carrying water for his leftist allies, all while claiming he's a neutral, nonpartisan purveyor of truth.

Stelter is perhaps the least self-aware person in media today.

Mark Levin hosts LevinTV on BlazeTV, which is owned by Blaze Media.

But the experts … The media have a habit of portraying scientific experts' opinions as fact. It's something the ""fact-check"" industry does over and over again. There is no greater example of this than the media hysteria over climate change. Last week, the Guardian even changed its guidelines to take a more activist role in the hysteria. That's why this article about how often ""experts"" are wrong on scientific predictions was so shocking to read in The Atlantic.



The article opens with a look at Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich's fantastically wrong claim in the late 1960s about how a population boom would end in massive human misery. Ehrlich has become a serial Chicken Little, but that hasn't stopped the media from hyping his ridiculous claims over and over again.

It then delves into the horrendous track record scientific experts have in predicting the future. These are the same scientific experts, of course, whom the media uses to call anyone who dares question climate orthodoxy ""deniers.""

The full article is well worth the read.

WTF MSM!? Disney won’t stop filming in Georgia and Bob Iger knows it,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



Déjà vu …

Hollywood is gearing up for a fight in the wake of Georgia's new ""hearbeat"" pro-life legislation. Netflix was first out of the gate to say it would reconsider working in Georgia, and Disney CEO Bob Iger followed suit. The threats hinge on whether or not Georgia actually enforces the legislation. Will Disney follow through on its threat, or was it merely virtue-signaling? Based on the other places Disney happily films around the world, it's virtue-signaling.

I was on the Overtime segment for ""The Steve Deace Show"" on Thursday to discuss this. Deace explained how the noncommittal commitment from Iger was really about putting out a fire that nobody will remember months from now. We know this is true because Disney films in multiple locations around the world with more restrictive abortion laws than Georgia's new law. It also has theme parks in these countries.

For example, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was filmed in the Republic of Ireland, where abortion was illegal until a recent referendum, but remains against the law after 12 weeks. Disney has a theme park in France, where abortion remains illegal after the 12th week of pregnancy.

This is a play by Disney to intimidate Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) into not fully enacting this legislation. The company thinks it will work, because it has before. In 2016, the Georgia Legislature passed religious liberty legislation. Business groups, led by Disney among others, bullied then-Gov. Nathan Deal (R) into vetoing the legislation.

Disney already does business in places with much more restrictive policies on abortion and places that treat the gay community much harsher than any law in the United States. Iger answers to shareholders first. If Georgia continues to offer tax breaks to the filming industry, films will continue to be filmed there.

The filming trades union isn't buying the bluster either, saying it ""expects continuing job stability,"" despite the threat of boycotts.

As I said on ""The Steve Deace Show,"" Disney will stop filming in Georgia when all the celebrities who said they were moving to Canada if Trump were elected actually move to Canada. Vancouver is the Hollywood of the North already, so what's stopping them?

The law of supply and demand …

Former New Yorker fact-checker Talia Lavin, who smeared Ben Shapiro after the Notre Dame fire, is finding the marketplace of ideas to be uninterested in her wisdom. Lavin had been scheduled to teach a course called ""Reporting on the Far Right."" Virtually no one signed up for the class, so New York University canceled it.

Lavin resigned from the New Yorker after a false accusation of a Nazi tattoo against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Lavin is a serial fabulist who sees it as her duty to attack conservatives relentlessly. She's a poster child for the sort of activism that masquerades as journalism today.

It's somewhat heartening to see that her message doesn't have appeal, even at a liberal bastion like NYU.

"As Hong Kong fights for civil liberties, leftists in America fight to take ours away","""Our police shot us, government betrayed us, social institutions failed us. Please help us."" — Hong Kong protesters

On Aug. 12, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong waved four American flags and sang the American national anthem in unison on the streets through a megaphone.

They were dressed in all black and their faces were covered with black, thick cotton mouth masks.

They could have easily been mistaken for left-wing militants in the ""anti-fascist"" group, Antifa, based on their clothing, but what these young people are fighting for couldn't be more different.

The young pro-democracy protesters are up against a much greater evil than what Antifa here in America believes they're up against – and that's Marxism.

While the left is busy seeking ways to suppress those who disagree with their rigid ideology and instill the very Marxist ideas that led the young protesters to revolt against the Chinese government's influence over the region, protesters in Hong Kong tussled with police at the Hong Kong International Airport for universal rights incompatible with Marxism.

And while liberal college professors sit in cozy classrooms with air conditioning and soy lattes grooming future leftists to hate America and idolize Karl Marx, protesters 8,000 miles away in Hong Kong are raising the American flag in the streets and writing wills as they prepare to die for democracy.

The left, including Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), are willing to toss out and trample our founding principles, our Constitution, and an economic system that has lifted millions out of poverty while Hong Kong demonstrators are seeking to break the chains of Maoist doctrines that are on the verge of robbing them of the civil liberties they've enjoyed that citizens in mainland China have not.

While executives at Google manipulated search results in the 2016 election to favor Hillary Clinton and sway millions of Americans into voting for a candidate on the left, protesters in Hong Kong are fighting for the very values Americans once agreed upon: free and fair elections.

While multimillionaires like former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick protest the national anthem and shame rapper Jay-Z for not being a social justice warrior for the left, 2 million protesters in Hong Kong organized the largest protest Hong Kong has ever seen.

Just this week, 1,000 Google employees signed a petition requesting that Google not do business with the United States Border Patrol or the Immigration and Customs Enforcement citing the government's ""mistreatment"" of asylum-seekers while protesters in Hong Kong fear ""legalized kidnapping"" by their own government.

Hong Kong is indicative of what the world witnessed 30 years ago at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, when students flooded the streets and demanded freedom and democracy.

Tiananmen is the same square where artist Ge Xiaoguang erected six large portraits of Mao Zedong, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Sun Yat-sen, and Friedrich Engels in 1971.

It resulted in a bloodbath the Chinese government refuses to acknowledge to this day.

Yet today, once again, the Chinese authoritarian regime is slowly chipping away at the freedoms the semi-autonomous southeast region has enjoyed under the ""one country, two systems"" model established in the 1980s by Deng Xiaoping.

Through this framework, Hong Kong has been able to freely govern itself thanks to a local constitution that is guaranteed until 2047 called the Basic Law.

But protesters fear that what little freedoms they have are quickly being eroded by the Communist Party of China and pro-Beijing sympathizers in Hong Kong.

According to a Freedom in the World 2019 report, Hong Kong is ""partly free"" based on a 59/100 score.

China received a ""not free"" grading based on a pathetic 11/100 score while the United States maintains an 86/100 score and is classified as ""free.""

China also has a low rating when it comes to press freedoms. They're currently ranked 177th out of 180 countries on the 2019 World Press Freedom Index while Hong Kong is ranked 73rd and the United States is ranked 48th.

Due to Chinese interference, Hong Kong was downgraded on the press freedom index in 2018 because of an incident with Victor Mallet and Andy Chan, which had major implications for freedom of speech.

Mallet, who is a British journalist for the Financial Times in Asia, was denied a visa by the Hong Kong government for what many believe was his participation in a Foreign Correspondents Club discussion in which Mallet was the vice chairman.

The topic of discussion was Hong Kong's independence.

The talk that never took place was to be hosted by pro-independence activist Andy Chan who founded the Hong Kong National Party that advocates for Hong Kong's independence from China.

The event was canceled after Hong Kong authorities received pressure from the Chinese government that cited concerns over the nation's sovereignty.

Mallet was detained and interrogated by immigration authorities and no formal explanation was ever given for the cancellation of his work visa months later. After the ordeal, he was forced to leave Hong Kong and said the situation had produced ""an impossible working environment for the media.""

This is one of the many reasons Hong Kong's proposed extradition law, which set off the wave of protests two weeks ago, is so unpopular. Much like no explanation was given to Mallet for the cancellation of his visa, no explanation will likely be given to those facing extradition to the mainland.

The proposed law would allow the Chinese government to extradite local and foreign criminals and try them under Chinese laws that are notoriously murky and unjust.

The protesters fear that this Beijing-backed amendment to their constitution will only serve to the benefit of the Chinese autocratic regime that they fear will use the law to target political dissenters, activists, and entrepreneurs.

As the protesters look to Western ideas of dignity and liberty, Ocasio-Cortez says we must do away with the genius design of our Constitution and the Electoral College that afforded us the very rights people across the world are willing to die for.

While AOC and radical Democrats seek to abolish the very ideals that made our republic the envy of the world, protesters in Hong Kong cry for an electoral system that represents them.

If the Communist Lites here in America want to continue down a path that abandons liberty, they should consider a lesson from an ex-Black Panther who wanted to kill Ronald Reagan in the 1960s.

Eldridge Cleaver's motto was ""total liberty for black people or total destruction for America."" He hated everything about America including baseball and hot dogs and mused about it all in a book he wrote titled, ""Soul on Ice,"" in 1968 following a prison stint.

In the 1960s, Cleaver and his comrades cozied up to Maoist politics, which ultimately led to violence including a shootout with the Oakland police.

To avoid jail time for his involvement, Cleaver fled to Cuba and spent seven years living under communist rule in several countries including China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union. Soon enough, he was discontent with life behind the iron curtain.

In 1975, he came home, converted to Christianity, and denounced his former life. He was now an anti-communist and the Black Panthers saw him as a traitor.

What Cleaver's realization tells us about life under communism is something Marxists, socialists, and communists in America should consider.

Upon his return to America, Cleaver said in an interview with ""Firing Line"" in 1977 that ""I would rather be in jail in America than free anywhere else.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/as-hong-kong-fights-for-civil-liberties-leftists-in-america-fight-to-take-ours-away,2019-08-21
"OpEd: More Than Dystopian Lockdowns, A Weak Party Means a Dangerous China","China, which for the lion's share of the COVID-19 pandemic was heralded as the model in dealing with the disease, is currently experiencing its harshest wave yet with a 7-day rolling average of just over 27,000 cases per day. A bulk of these cases are emanating from Shanghai which is under uber-strict lockdowns. Now, it would be foolish to trust any data coming out of the People's Republic given the government's propensity to embellish statistics , but given the trove of evidence currently pouring in via social media, whatever the actual number of infections is, it's clear what's happening now is the most serious event since the outbreak originated in Wuhan.

Throughout the pandemic, China has not been shy about proclaiming how successful its model has been, especially in comparison to the United States. Recall the video produced by Xinhua from the early days of the pandemic mercilessly mocking America's 'failed' response to the outbreak. Communist Party officials like Hua Chunying, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, have also been in on the act of patting themselves on the back. Hua, who pushes insane amounts of English language propaganda on Twitter, crafted a Tweet last week claiming China has one of the best records for handling COVID.

If the nice spokesperson would take a trip to Shanghai, she may find that things aren't running as smoothly as her profile indicates. Distressing videos from the locked-down city seem to be popping up on US social networks every minute. They show scenes of apartment dwellers screaming in despair out of their high-rise buildings, citizens fighting for food, health workers beating individuals who aren't complying with orders, and government officials executing pets, just to name a few.

Shanghai is showing that even as the Party in Beijing, led by Xi Jinping, is trying desperately to maintain its Zero-COVID policy, its ability to govern effectively has been massively over-hyped, especially to the domestic populace. Even the most conditioned population will start to lose faith when there's nothing to eat, and right now in Shanghai, there's nothing to eat .

MORE THAN PANDEMIC PROBLEMS

It's not just the backlash to the dystopian lockdowns that Beijing has to worry about, either. Party governance as a whole is in serious trouble of losing control on two other key issues. The first is the massive real estate bubble that has been created via debt-driven growth by developers and speculative buying by individuals. Essentially, property developers like Evergrande, China's second-largest developer, took out massive debt to build large projects. They then passed the debt off to the customers by selling apartments that don't exist yet. As much as 80% of Chinese household assets are tied up in real estate, so a crash in the market would have devastating effects. The aforementioned Evergrande, which is over $300B in debt, defaulted on its payments in December of last year, and last Monday, China's fourth-largest developer, Sunac, missed its first bond payment.

The other concern that must be at the forefront of Xi Jinping's mind is China's demographic timebomb. From 1980 to 2016 China implemented the One Child Policy, which was designed to curb population growth and spur economic growth under Deng Xiaoping's planned economy. Unfortunately, what resulted were many unintended consequences that are currently threatening China's future development.

The current fertility rate in China is 1.3 percent, well below the replacement rate. It is expected to continue falling, and according to state media outlet The Global Times , the number of women aged 22-35 (childbearing age) will decline by 30 percent in the next 10 years. With China's population aging fast, it's leaving fewer taxpayers to contribute to pension funds. In 2020, there were five taxpayers per pensioner, and by 2050, it's expected to be a 2-to-1 ratio. This also means no replacement workforce will be coming in to take over for retirees, and this is especially hurtful given China's reliance on domestic manufacturing.

To combat these negative demographic trends, China has implemented major policy changes, including moving to a "" Three Child Policy ."" However, societal constraints like education costs, lack of maternity support, and the financial burden of having to care for older relatives mean that young Chinese aren't enthusiastic about the idea of having more children. In a now-deleted Xinhua poll, 29,000 out of 31,000 respondents said they would never think of having more children. China also plans to gradually increase the retirement age, but this, too, has faced major backlash online.

A CORNERED PARTY

From the perspective of China's rivals, like the US, Japan, and Taiwan, watching this meltdown of CCP governance might seem like cause for celebration. After all, each of these countries considers China its biggest security threat, so if Beijing is too wrapped up in trying to fix domestic turmoil, then it will have to temper ambition when it comes to foreign policy, right?

Remember that Xi's and the CCP's mandate to govern is not derived from the vote of the population, no matter how many times Hua Chunying Tweets about ""Chinese Democracy"" . To maintain legitimacy amongst the population and the Party, Xi is dependent upon sustained economic growth. For the last 30 years, this growth has allowed the leadership in Beijing to rule without substantial pushback from its citizenry. Though not ideal, it's much easier for people to shelve concerns about human rights and autonomy when their standard of living is consistently increasing.

It's no coincidence then that in 2018, when Xi Jinping removed presidential term limits, setting himself up for lifetime rule, China's GDP growth sat at an impressive 6.75 percent. Even as authoritarian policies increased dramatically under Xi, Chinese people were still getting richer, so there was no immediate motivation from the wider populace to oppose his agenda. As long as bank accounts are growing, it is palatable for Xi to amass more and more power.

However, given what we know about China's domestic instability, this gravy train of massive economic growth looks like it's getting closer and closer to running out of steam, or in China's case, coal-fired electricity. Between the Zero-COVID failure, a massive housing bubble, and a looming demographic crisis, it's hard to imagine things are going to get easier for the CCP. And when the domestic population does start turning on Party leadership, China's rivals would be wise not to get complacent.

It has become clear by now that Xi fancies himself a modern-day emperor, the leader of the CCP dynasty if you will. Like most emperors, his ego is not exactly small. When his legitimacy starts to be questioned as domestic conditions deteriorate, the US and its allies should not expect him to accept responsibility and work with the people to fix the problems. They should expect him to do what the CCP does so well: blame the failings of the Party on outside forces.

In order to deflect blame from himself for his and the Party's failings, Xi Jinping will need a target he can funnel domestic anger towards. This has been the playbook for power-hungry leaders for as long as they have existed. Examples of this diversionary foreign policy include Tsar Nicholas II using Japan as an outlet for Russia's revolutionary sentiment and Otto von Bismarck utilizing the Franco-Prussian war as a means to unify Germany.

It's not a stretch to imagine Xi using similar tactics to pacify his own population. The most likely target of his ire will be the United States and, by proxy, its Northeast Asian allies, as well as Taiwan. A likely scenario would see Xi blaming domestic failures on the unrealized unification of Taiwan and the ""American Imperialists"" who have propped up the ""illegitimate"" regime in Taipei. In order for China to realize its full potential, it must exorcise all of its enemies from the region and all remnants of American influence in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

Increased aggression then should be expected not only in the Taiwan Strait but around disputed territories like the Senkaku Islands. By stirring up conflict with China's enemies, Xi will hope to move domestic anger away from the Party and onto the Americans, Taiwanese, and Japanese. The ability to offload blame for economic pain onto foreign governments not only offers the potential of relief for the Party but the potential for a motivated populace unified in accomplishing Xi Jinping's Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.

This isn't a proclamation that China will move on Taiwan in the immediate future, although in today's geopolitical climate that's certainly not out of the question. It is, however, a warning to China's enemies to not get fat and cocky as China's struggles become more apparent. Rather than restricting China's foreign policy ambitions, domestic turmoil will increase and accelerate them. It would be wise for the United States and its allies to keep that understanding at the forefront of their own foreign policy.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/china-lockdowns-party-dangerous,2022-04-26
Commentary: America will be memory-holed if we do not act,"I've been telling you for months that Sweden is the way. It has been the control case for the efficacy of lockdowns and masks, and with each passing day it serves as a light in the darkness defining the path to true science, public health and precious freedom.

But in a world of petty tyrants and jesters, Sweden may as well be the lost city of Atlantis. It has been memory holed by no less than much of the scientific community itself in too many Western countries (including our own), as well as progressive dreamers who just a year ago would have celebrated Sweden's secular accoutrements.

Because this was never about science. It was about power and control.

Which brings us to our next control case that is being flushed into oblivion because it doesn't serve the interests of dystopian wanderlust. That would be our very country. The United States, the only country ever founded on a creed, has been striving in various forms since the 18th century to prove that the better angels of our nature could win out so that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""

But if I may be so bold as to go further than President Lincoln, the national dream has always gone well beyond simply not perishing while holding its place as just one option among equals. No, flourishing, and fantastically so as a shining city on a hill calling out to all mankind, has always been our land's God-breathed rendezvous with destiny.

That's why, like with Sweden, it must be memory holed by its domestic enemies, the rot within us that is on a relentlessly suicidal journey. There simply can't be road maps left lying around that point people the way to true north when the transgendered, upside down world of their warped minds are now so close at hand. Thus, it shouldn't surprise us that one of the primary ways of burning those road maps is by following the devil's lead.

In other words, they lie like their spiritual father — the father of lies.

Namely, if they are guilty of something, they will try to hang you with it. Joe Biden and his son in bed with Ukraine and China becomes President Trump's colluding with Russians. Journalism as persistent left-wing propaganda and group think becomes Twitter and Facebook claiming conservatives are the real source of bias. To the point of censoring the spokesperson for the President of the United States and one of the oldest newspapers in the nation, the New York Post. Amy Coney Barrett claiming she loves the Constitution and that she will interpret it as it is written becomes ""The Handmaid's Tale"" come to life. Webster's Dictionary even rallied to the cause of chaos last week and changed the definition of the word ""preference"" overnight, in order to keep the crazy train running on time.

It is a “Did God really say?"" memory hole of unknowing and unreality that we are currently choking on just as we did all the way back at the beginning of creation. The dishonesty is so thick that, as with some pilots who become disoriented because they don't trust their instruments, regularly people passively taking it all in are literally spiraling to their death while thinking all along they are on the straight and narrow. We have been given paradise, yet we think it chains.

America used to fight against that tide with extreme prejudice, and its citizens' First Amendment rights were its primary weapons. Where there was a loud voice of decay and decadence ringing out, eventually there would be a counter and more often than not, the good would win out in the end. It's how slavery, American's original sin, was defeated. If America could prove true to its founding word against that scourge, its status as a control group for self-government could survive anything, couldn't it?

Not if we sit passively by and no longer care to take our turn as a people to stand a post for liberty. If we act, we will win and prove once again that this “Republic, if we can keep it"" is a far greater calling in our hearts than “trust the experts while we Netflix and chill.""

But we must act. Because it isn't the Constitution itself and its implied civic machinery, as vital as it is, that is the control group. That is merely the weapon, and it doesn't come with an autopilot. We, the people, are the control group. And as with guns, the weapons of government can be wielded by either righteous or wicked men.

So which are we? And what are you prepared to do?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-america-will-be-memory-holed,2020-10-16
Commentary: We've witnessed the death of our Constitution because we couldn't be bothered to stand up for it,"The Constitution, for now, is pretty much dead.

Swish that around in your mouth a little bit. Taste it before you simply spit it out as too bitter to be possible. Because if we're being honest, our governing document simply doesn't govern anymore. It is ignored. It is manipulated. It is mocked.

Yeah, it's more than possible. In fact, it simply is what it is. And like Dr. Strange once said, “I'm here to protect your reality, d-bag.""

When Ben Franklin warned he and the rest of those hetero-normative fascists once known as the Founding Fathers were giving us a ""republic if we can keep it"" they weren't kidding. It turns out, we couldn't keep it.

We grew complacent, and just a little cowardly if we're being honest. Content to think that just voting for a bunch of Republicans who hate us at least as much as the Democrats do (albeit for different reasons) was the stuff of Lexington and Concord. As a result, our civic bedrock has been blown asunder.

Sure, we could blame other things for our looming dystopia — where now not even Kenosha, Wisconsin, is safe from the Hunger Games -- and keep proudly whistling the National Anthem. The courts. The crooked politicians. The anarchists. The virus. All played a role in pointing us toward the ash heap of history, for sure. But they also had a formidable ally.

Us.

See, we couldn't be bothered to get our hands dirty, think outside the box, and challenge a paradigm purposefully created to stifle us. In other words, we cucked ourselves.

However, nature still abhors a vacuum. So if we won't do what must be done legitimately, illegitimate means of doing so will emerge. Like a cherub-faced 17-year-old, who is now charged with first-degree murder for allegedly killing two BLM insurgents in Kenosha.

When you create a vacuum of justice and leadership month after month, year after year, you don't get to complain when somebody else steps in and plays wannabe cowboy. Someone else could have been the man who did so, and more prudently. Instead, we chose to be the cuck who watched. Hate the player, not the game.

The Constitution is dead in the streets and the wild west is here, live and in color, because we let it happen. Not the kid from Illinois. It was us, Mr. and Mrs. “severely conservative,"" “compassionately conservative"" and “big tent conservative."" We were great at conferences and conventions, but we plain sucked on main street and in the trenches. We chanted ""MAGA"" but really meant ""AWOL.""

Sure, I too would prefer someone a bit more polished and thoughtful and less trigger happy to tend to the refreshing of the tree of liberty, than the young gun hopped up on Mountain Dew, but here we are. To quote President Trump's favorite song: ""You can't always get what you want.""

Don't think for a second all of this couldn't have been otherwise. You know, if any number of people on the “Right"" actually believed what they claimed to stand for and were willing to sacrifice even a fraction of the lives, fortunes and sacred honors that their forefathers did to bring this once great country to life. Instead, more than 100 of that swampy sort gathered during the week of the Republican National Convention to endorse Joe Biden's progressive-fueled and ethically bankrupt dementia in loving memory of their time working for George W Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.

So with the Constitution currently dead, America is now left to the feral mobs running both pseudo-science and the streets. And instead of the Dark Knight, our vigilante is the dude wearing hockey pants.

Thankfully, the God from whom our rights come from has a thing for resurrections. Here's hoping there's some wiser grown men willing to answer His call with a ""here I am Lord, send me."" It's too late to answer the call to save the Constitution we ignored before, but we're right on time to answer this one now.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-death-of-constitution,2020-08-28
Commentary: Tyrants are using the coronavirus to bully the American people. It's time to put a stop to it.,"You may have thought after watching patriots in Michigan, Kentucky, and North Carolina defiantly protest their lockdown status, as well as sheriffs in Michigan telling their governor in writing that they refused to comply with her tyrannical nonsense, that the old saying “desperate times call for desperate measures"" was in full effect.

But you would be wrong.

These are indeed desperate times, but what they call for is the sort of action that true citizens should have been engaged in on a regular basis before it ever got to this point. Protest and self-government isn't remotely close to a desperate measure. It's your danged birthright as an American.

I think that's what President Trump really means when he repeatedly says America wasn't built to be shut down. The context he's addressing usually relates to the economy, to be sure, but it is a transcendent notion above and beyond even that one monumental issue.

We have allowed ourselves to be bullied as citizens of a constitutional republic for far too long. This country belongs first and foremost to “We the people,"" but the so-called “experts"" have seduced us into believing we could somehow put this entire experiment in liberty on cruise control while pursuing our various Epicurean delights and leaving the heavy lifting to others. Expert-in-Chief Anthony Fauci embodies this spirit of the age, as he simultaneously doubts we'll ever be able to shake hands again while signing off on strangers using Tinder to hook up and swap bodily fluids.

Give those others an inch, though, and they'll take a hellish mile. They did it on taxes and debt. On religious liberty. On gender. On life. And each time, instead of rubbing their nose in it like a dog who made a mess on the carpet inside, we shrugged and often re-elected them. We inverted the master/servant relationship.

What we should have been doing all along is treating these usurpers on both the political left and right as Trump treated the press pool earlier this week, with his fantastic video montage of their bias and hypocrisy. Absolutely no quarter. One reporter seemed to actually be begging for mercy when he whined, “Why would you do that?"" Because you deserve it, that's why. And the tarring and feathering will continue until morale improves.

You deserved it for betraying your nation and choosing fiction over truth, just as every bureaucrat and civil servant does when they forget who they work for and what God they serve. Our rights come from Him and Him alone, and they can't be suspended or forfeited by force for any reason — including a virus that has been twisted out of all proportion to be used as a political weapon.

First China did it, and then all the power hungry little Barney Fifes and Karens in our country dialed their lust for controlling other people's lives up to 11 as well. Why wouldn't they? We've been giving up ground to them for so long that they've forgotten what a good tarring and feathering feels like. They believe us to be beneath them, and by our lack of action we have actually shown them to be effectively correct on that front.

This is a Republic, said Benjamin Franklin, if only we can keep it. That means we need to draw lines in the sand always and everywhere to protect the true nature of our relationship with government — government by the consent of the governed.

We are the rulers. We call the shots. And to that end, we are grateful the president seems ready, willing and able to return this great nation to its rightful owners. However, if you truly want to see him deliver on that instinct, don't just assume he will, or even can, do it without you. In politics, you should always hold your allies to a higher standard than your adversaries. Why expect more from those who hate you than you do those who claim otherwise? Trump is not our mosaic deliverer — we are. He is to carry out our deliverance, not initiate it.

Let us never again forget who we were destined to be as Americans and children of God. We weren't built to be shut down. We were built to rise up, and prove ourselves worthy of the lives, fortunes, and sacred honors sacrificed on our behalf, long before any of us knew what a coronavirus was.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-tyrants-are-using-the-coronavirus-to-bully-the-american-people-its-time-to-put-a-stop-to-it,2020-04-16
Commentary: Rep. Dan Crenshaw is right: Religion is the bedrock of a moral society,"Last Sunday, Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R) tweeted that religion is the ""bedrock for a moral society, because it shows us that morality is absolute, not relative or subject to popular cultural whims.""

And he's right.

The laws of a country that are founded on the Law of Moses and the teachings of Jesus are unshakable, but laws rooted in secularism are like quicksand and subject to fail or slip into chaos and oppression.

During its formative years, America became known for its virtue, republicanism, and unrelenting support for individual liberty, which were all based on the Laws of Moses and the teachings of Jesus beginning on Mount Sinai.

These moral laws brought down from the mountain by Moses firmly established God's expectations for humanity.

The Bible (Good News Translation) says in Proverbs 29:18 that, ""A nation without God's guidance is a nation without order.""

When Israel honored God, he blessed them. When they disobeyed Him, they were lost in the wilderness for 40 years. This punishment was a harsh lesson for the Israelites.

God gave us these commandments to serve as a moral framework so that his children could discern what's right and wrong.

In Romans, we are taught that not only are God's laws ""holy and righteous and good,"" they're ""spiritual.""

A moral society should then aspire to follow this moral framework set forth by God because it provides us with instructions on how to exist with each other and with God.

And to deviate from them only leads to emptiness, isolation, and purposelessness.

Of course, not all the American Founding Fathers practiced a religion, some of them were deists, but they all agreed that the foundation of morality was rooted in the belief in God.

In fact, many of their early writings were brimming with spiritual overtones, i.e., The Declaration of Independence.

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...""

The most famous phrase being ""unalienable Rights"" was derived from Judeo-Christian teachings which recognizes that everyone is created equal before God.

Whether secularists choose to believe this or not, we are all created in God's image.

Religion forged Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and it was revolutionary at the time. It was also a dramatic shift for a president who historians say flirted with atheism.

The obvious contradiction when speaking of individual liberty is that this wasn't afforded to slaves or indentured servants at the time of America's founding. However, the founders knew that in order to establish the Constitution, they had to make concessions to this necessary evil or they risked losing the Constitution entirely.

We learned a harsh lesson about what happens when we defy God's laws. Slavery almost tore this country apart and we fought the bloodiest war ever wrought on American soil to end it.

The church

If you compare the American Revolution to the French Revolution, it's worth noting that Europeans, unlike the early Americans, believed that liberty was the enemy of religion.

In fact, they were astonished when they observed that one of the most enlightened societies of the 19th century was openly religious, as observed by author W. Cleon Skousen in the ""Five Thousand Year Leap.""

During French diplomat Alexis de Tocqueville's stay in America in 1831, he noticed that freedom and religion — even amongst the differing sects — were ""intimately united,"" which was unheard of at the time.

De Tocqueville found this marriage between the new republic and religion indispensable and so should we.

As de Tocqueville put it:

""Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great because America is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best security of law as well as the surest pledge of freedom.""

Former U.S. President John Adams said it best when he said, ""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.""

Sadly, Americans have lost faith in important institutions, churches being chief among them.

According to a Gallup poll, confidence in the church sank to an all-time low of 38 percent in 2018.

Revolution and violence

A violent period during the French Revolution (1789) serves as a grim reminder of what happens when morality is defined by man instead of God.



During the ""Reign of Terror"" in 1793, the French expelled thousands of priests and turned to the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being and the atheistic Cult of Reason put forth by Maximilien Robespierre.

When man defined morality according to their terms as witnessed in France's reign of terror, heads literally rolled.

Irish statesman Edmund Burke, who was critical of the French Revolution, believed that God is necessary for the social fabric of a society.

In his most notable work, ""Reflections on the Revolution in France,"" Burke asserted that the French Revolution was doomed because of its outright rejection of religion arguing that they were ""against, not only our reason but our instincts.""

To Burke, Christianity led society to progress and without God, it was bound to unravel.

He also foretold of the wars that would wreak havoc on Europe thanks in part to the radical changes to institutions that spawned from the French Revolution, and he was right.

The French Revolution led directly to the dictatorship of Napoleon and the Napoleonic wars that ravaged Europe, and which led (directly or indirectly) to conflict between the French and Prussians/Germans that would break out into war in 1870, World War I, and World War II.

The effects of the Chinese Communist Revolution, which required its members to pledge an oath to Marxist atheism, had negative and lasting effect on the Chinese people.

During the Great Leap Forward under former Chairman Mao Zedong, an estimated 20 to 48 million Chinese citizens were killed— more than twice as many as were killed in the Holocaust.

But unlike the Chinese Communist Revolution, what made the American Revolution different and its legacy lasting was its regard for morality derived from God and not man.

The Chinese Communist Revolution and the French Revolution was a far cry from what America witnessed because of this.

This isn't to say that if we believe in God alone, He will solve all our problems because He won't, especially if we are a society that rejects His son and His commandments.

The morality of the creator becomes embedded in its creation

God makes it very clear in the Bible that nations who turn from Him will perish.

Proverbs 14:34 (New International Version) reminds us that ""Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin condemns any people.""

America is currently lost in the wilderness because we've rejected the idea that morality is derived from God's supreme laws (just check the comments under Crenshaw's tweet).

Instead, we've relied on our own intellect or even a political party's because it feels good and because they told us everything we want to hear. President Donald Trump isn't going to solve this nation's problems and neither is New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D).

The government cannot solve your problems, only faith in God can help you.

That wilderness is the cultural whims Crenshaw referenced in his tweet last Sunday.

The belief that God is no longer needed, and that man's explanation is supreme isn't going to cut it.

The suicide rate is at its highest in half a century according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Planned Parenthood is killing up to 332,757 babies a year; the divorce rate is over 50 percent, and the only thing Americans can agree on is that we're divided on virtually every issue.

We can't agree on the economy, on racial issues, climate change, abortion, and even gender.

The idea that you can murder a baby inside a mother's womb, the distorted idea that you can choose your gender, or that you can covet your neighbor's lot, is not rooted in what made this country great, it's rooted in a hollow intellect set forth and reliant upon man's meek intellect.

America can only be saved from itself by grace alone.

Founding Father Thomas Jefferson suggested that when dealing with religious problems among the various states, religious institutions of all kinds should use their influence to provide the stability needed for the benefit of the government as documented by Skousen.

Until we acknowledge that morality is objective and rooted in God, we'll continue operating on the whims of a culture that perpetuates the reductions in freedom and the inability to exist peacefully with one another.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/dan-crenshaw-is-right-religion-is-the-bedrock-of-a-moral-society,2019-03-21
Deace: Making John Brown great again,"""I hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' round the bend …"" —Johnny Cash

It was almost a decade ago that I had dinner at a suburban Des Moines sports bar with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was running for president at the time. He wanted my lay of the land in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, but I couldn't resist widening the conversation beyond that with one of the few politicians whose intellect I actually respect.

So we expanded our horizons to perhaps the only subject Gingrich loves more than politics — history.

""This is the most divided this country has been culturally since the 1850s,"" I remember Gingrich saying, ""And you know what that set the stage for.""

Gingrich went on to say he thought the only way out of such a zero-sum game was for power to be taken out of Washington, D.C., and given back to the people. I shared with him that I thought it was ""(spiritual) revival or bust"" for the West in general, not just America, and that has become a consistent mantra on my show these past few years.

That dinner was a decade ago. Before we knew what Covidstan was. Before we left Americans behind in Afghanistan. Before we debated whether to let our children mutilate themselves and call mental illness like gender dysphoria public policy. Before drag queen story time for the kiddos became a ""blessing of liberty."" Before we paid people more money not to work. Before ""defund the police"" but let domestic terrorists declare whole blocks of a major U.S. city as now ""Chaz.""

The birth pangs are coming faster now and more severe. The stuff the Tea Party rallied against a decade ago almost seems trite now, and needless to say, that is not good.

A decade later, we are on the brink as a people. We are desperate to create a two-tiered society, with those who are comrades in good standing with the Spirit of the Age pitted against those who still desire on some level to think for themselves. Mark my words: If permitted, that fault line will make even the most bitterly partisan Republican-Democrat tribalisms look like a pillow fight.

The instruments of that division may be called critical racist theory (my name for it), masked or unmasked, or vaccinated or unvaccinated, etc. — but the end result is the same, for they're all driven by the same zealotry: the compulsion, based on self-righteous superiority, to use the coercive force of government to impose upon (if not outright trample) the God-given rights of others. The pursuit of happiness has become passé, while the pursuit of power and control is what all the cool kids are doing these days.

In the meantime, while the Spirit of the Age metastasizes like the malignant tumor it is to corrupt every last cell of American exceptionalism, what's left of traditional America is growing increasingly desperate. Whether it's the proliferation of COVID rules for thee but not for me; teachers' unions openly showing they hate the children they're trusted to educate; an unprecedented border crisis; a return to pre-Reagan-era soft-on-crime sophistry; mounting skepticism regarding the integrity of elections; skyrocketing debt and inflation; or now demands to use us as lab rats for the injection of experimental tech over a virus slightly more deadly than diabetes, traditional America is facing unsustainable taxation (both monetarily and morally) without representation.

With tragically few exceptions we can count before exhausting our fingers and toes, the Republican Party either isn't interested in or is incapable of being an effective, peaceable weapon to be wielded on behalf of what's left of America. Whether it's Lindsey Graham types pimping Forever War or Kristi Noems who are down with the tyranny provided it's a ""private business"" doing the state's dirty work for it, a growing multitude of Americans are coming to a painful realization.

We are on our own. The cavalry isn't coming.

Republicans will likely do very well next year in the midterms, but mostly because people have nowhere else to go in response to another reminder that Democrats, well, suck. It's not that Republicans have collectively earned such confidence, let alone inspired it. Let's face it, too often you vote Republican in a last-ditch attempt to slow down Democratic decay just enough to catch your breath. Not because you believe Republicans will collectively go on offense on your behalf.

This is not a sustainable paradigm for any civilization. Eventually the center cannot hold. Eventually the levee breaks. Eventually, once the system makes it clear it has no plans to seriously confront injustice regardless of how you vote or who wins, the stage will be set for unconventional means of social change to emerge.

Which brings us back to Gingrich's comparisons to the 1850s.

Slavery was an injustice that threatened the cohesion of the Union from the beginning. The original draft of the Declaration of Independence was going to confront the evils of slavery head-on, until two Southern colonies threatened to reject it if the language wasn't removed. However, the constitutional republic those 13 colonies forged would eventually set the stage for slavery's undoing.

As America began its ascent in the mid-19th century in search of manifest destiny, politicians attempted to stave off the existential debate over slavery by enacting a series of ""compromises."" These weren't compromises so much as compartmentalizations; after all, how can you compromise on whether a human being is actually a human being? That's a yes or no, with no nuance. But there was lots of money to be made in this booming country, so the contentious slavery debate was compartmentalized in a such a way as to avoid getting in the way of the pursuit of wealth.

Until gold was discovered in California.

The California gold rush provided motivation for importing hundreds of slaves into the new economy out West, despite the fact that California was supposedly admitted to the Union as a free state. This ambiguity, which went unconfronted by the elites who were enriching themselves and couldn't be bothered, set the stage for an even bigger betrayal to come — Bleeding Kansas.

After the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed states to vote by ""popular sovereignty"" as to whether they would treat people with a different skin color as subhuman, the territory descended into chaotic violence as rival guerrilla groups — both pro-slavery and pro-abolition forces — quite literally went to war. One of the leading figures to emerge from this period was a man named John Brown.

A devoutly religious man, Brown vowed that ""here before God I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery."" And much like Dietrich Bonhoeffer in the 20th century, a minister who saw no other way out of the evils of Nazism except to take part in the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler, once Brown saw pro-slavery forces deploy a violent attack that became known as the ""Sack of Lawrence,"" he also decided to literally fight fire with fire.

Nature abhors a vacuum. And with the system either incapable of or uninterested in finally confronting the stain on our civilization that was slavery, it was just a matter of time before someone like John Brown stepped in to fill the void. At first, Brown was seen as a potentially righteous instrument. He befriended Harriet Tubman and was acquainted with Frederick Douglass. Brown was leading raids to free slaves. He was considered a bit of an avenging angel, or even a dark knight.

Then came his infamous raid on Harper's Ferry. The first casualty was ironically a free black man who refused Brown's orders, the very kind of person Brown was supposedly fighting for, and for it he was shot in the back. By the time the attempted raid was foiled by then-Col. Robert E. Lee and the Marines on orders directly from the president of the United States, there were numerous casualties, including Brown's youngest son.

Brown was eventually tried and convicted of treason, for which he was hanged.

His grave in New York State is a National Historic Landmark, despite his treason conviction. His final speech went viral at the time and was said to have galvanized northern abolitionists. In it, Brown cited the Bible's call to defend the downtrodden as justification for his mission, scolded the assembly that if he had done these things on behalf of the ""rich, powerful ... the so-called Great"" society would have praised him for it, and even said, ""I desired to have done the same thing again on a much larger scale"" in order to free slaves.

It is important to relive this history, not to re-litigate Brown's methods, especially in light of the fact that 750,000 Americans lost their lives on the battlefield during the Civil War settling this matter, but to understand how the stage is set in a free and prosperous society for such reckless vigilantism to find an audience.

Decade after decade, the political process could have righted the wrong of slavery peaceably, but it chose expedience and instant gratification instead. And then when the system no longer would live up to even its immoral compromises, it became clear to those Americans then that they were on their own, too. The cavalry wasn't coming, unless it was coming for them.

In the history of this fallen world, there has never been a peaceful transfer of property and liberty on a mass scale within a culture, and there never will be. There won't be one on this North American land mass, either, if it sadly comes to that, as it has before. I pray it doesn't again, because I happen to enjoy living here. I happen to enjoy the mindless and shallow fun, entertainment, and convenience we're afforded here. I'd really like to pass on that whole American dream thing to my children. I'm very blessed to be a spoiled American. I doubt I'm alone.

However, the ballad of John Brown is a cautionary tale that reminds that us our sins have a way of finding us out. That we can only kick the can down the road for so long until we come to a dead end. And that when the powers that be go from powerless to stop injustice to actively promoting it, sooner or later a presence will arise from elsewhere to take that power back.

Our Founders gave us a political process to avoid John Brown moments. That we would fight it out at the ballot box instead of in the streets. But for that process to sustain us, the growing number of betrayed Americans need representation within that process that actually and actively fights for them when empowered for a change.

Absent that for too long, and John Browns are eventually born.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-making-john-brown-great-again,2021-08-25
Deace: No more ‘nicer than God’ politicians,"No more “nicer than God” types like Mike Pence. Their weakness is both destructive and, quite frankly, disgusting. Our nation simply can’t survive much longer with them at the helm.



I have long warned against limp, emasculated, nicer-than-God pietistic pansies like him that have for too long poisoned what should be our cultural strongholds – our patriarchy, our pulpits, and our political offices. And now here we are, in free fall into the dark pit at the bottom of the slippery slope of the near total failure of American manhood.

Pence has no chance as a presidential contender, but here he is yet again, entering the political fray recently with thoughts about what the conservative movement should look like, Trump’s place in it, etc. But that fraud had his chance. Then the COVID cult came, and not only was he overwhelmed by it, he then adopted it as his plumb line for what a good Christian should bow down to. Pence didn’t protect us from the spirit of the age, but instead used his “task force” to protect the spirit of Jezebel herself – Supreme Karen Debbie Birx.

Get the shot. Wear the mask. Close the business. And of course he wasn’t alone. He isn’t leading this American army of weak men who confuse comfort with control to the point of idolatry, because, obviously, true leadership is simply impossible for his kind. They are all followers, because they relentless seek out the path of least resistance at every turn, leaving increasingly demonic darkness to enter the void left behind.

Without the weakness of the Pence doppelgangers, Woke Karen would not now be the primary enemy of the republic. She is either committing or enabling all our worst disgraces. She is a public menace. A human plague. She is the spirit of Jezebel incarnate, endorsing transgender madness upon innocent children, if those children are allowed to be born at all, because killing them is apparently a tidy answer to curing inflation, according to the likes of witches like Stacey Abrams.

All the fundamental definitions of the good, the true, and the beautiful are under relentless, existential assault by her. No matter how diabolical any particular woman, though, behind her, in theory or in practice, is the man who first threw things out of balance with his equivocations or rationalizations about who and what he is called to be.

He just wants to be left alone. He just wants to get along. He just wants to fit in. He just wants to relax. He just wants to be nicer than Jesus. And all in a world that day by day tells him that the only way that can happen is if he makes perpetual offerings into a volcano that would make the Aztecs blush.

Impossible. In fact, you are every bit as much transgendered as the misfit with pink hair and fake breasts who wants to teach your third-grader about pronouns if you think such things are the true destiny of manhood.

“Increase and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it,” we are commanded by no less than God in Genesis. Subdue. But the Pence-man has it exactly backward. He is subdued at every turn and calls it virtue. He is sterile and calls it strength.



That is the true death cult that makes all the other death cults possible. Men like Pence either laid down their arms or pointed them at their own heads and called it the Gospel.

No wonder the devil rushed in. No wonder he destroys us now while we applaud. C.S. Lewis called this problem “men without chests.” I call it cowardice. And a nation is both worthy of being destroyed and inevitably will be if these are allowed to claim the high places of our culture.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-no-more-nicer-than-god-politicians,2022-10-21
Deace: The masks have come off the leftist cult that intends to make believers of us all,"""I am the Senate."" — Palpatine

The alter ego of Darth Sidious famously said that at the point his long con was nearly complete. He had marched his way through the institutions of the Galactic Republic and manufactured the series of crisis necessary to make his final play in the name of converting democracy into the tyranny of his Sith dreams.

But as evil as he was, he was never completely open about his motivations or intentions to the people at large. The masses needed to be tricked, lest they turn into a mob he couldn't control before a Super Weapon was at his disposal to blast them into oblivion.

That's just Hollywood, though, where the public at-large is assumed to have some fundamental principles they will fight for. Wouldn't that be nice. Because in real life, you actually get to preach a cultish religion of power and conquest straight to the faces of a people born in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, and too many of them will gladly accept your terms.

How else can I possibly interpret the fact Andrew Cuomo's replacement governor, Kathy ""are you sure it isn't Karen?"" Hochul, hasn't already been tarred and feathered by her fellow New Yorkers for treating them like a bunch of simps with zero memory of their recent past?

""I prayed a lot to God during this time and you know what, God did answer our prayers,"" Hochul said while standing behind a church pulpit. ""He made the smartest men and women, the scientists, the doctors, the researchers — he made them come up with a vaccine. That is from God to us and we must say, 'Thank you, God. Thank you.'""

And then the kicker: ""I need you to be my apostles.""

Now that seems to be the exact kind of talk that convinced 20, er, we will call them ""pilots in training"" to move to America and subsequently fly planes loaded with innocent Americans into the Twin Towers right there in New York. Heck, we even just got done celebrating the 20th anniversary of that horrible day. And yet your governor gets to say that to you without even a hint of déjà vu?

Wow. I'm old enough to remember when the mere image of President Trump standing in front of a vandalized Washington, D.C., church while holding a Bible sent ""separation of church and state"" types into an Antifa-induced frenzy. Perhaps it never was about keeping religion out of politics, but only waiting until politics could become the religion itself?

To complete that act requires a level of existential surrender by ""We the people"" Hochul has clearly come to rely upon from New Yorkers, every bit as much as the sun rising in the east. For example, she's ""Catholic"" and bragged as much during her inauguration yet Planned Parenthood baby butchers love her. Not shocking, I know, but that really is the entire point.

People will say and do increasingly bizarre and crazy things in the name of self-fulfillment and power if reality never comes around to set things right. And if true religion doesn't do that time and time and time again, even when the murder of innocents and denying the existence of two genders becomes common place, well then you can expect the cult to get real and spectacular really damn fast. Romans 1, anyone?

So here we are. Holy Communion has become the jab in the very place brought violently to its knees by a different sort of Jihad, and with far fewer masks and manipulations than Palpatine used. They aren't peeing in your face and telling you it's raining. No, they are peeing in your face and taunting you with, ""You like it, don't you?""

Total depravity like that doesn't work in the movies. No one would ever believe it as a plot device. But here in America, the cult knows different. And it has plans to make believers of us all.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-the-masks-have-come-off-the-leftist-cult-that-intends-to-make-believers-of-us-all,2021-10-01
Deace: Tim Scott would make a better snitch than senator,"

I got some attention this week for kneecapping South Carolina Senator Tim Scott in my response after he sheepishly – and I’m being kind there – responded to the raid of former President Donald Trump’s home with a plea for letting the system do its work before jumping to conclusions.

Oh, you mean the system that brought us locking you down while they went on vacation. That made you wear masks when they didn't. That shut down your churches but kept the rainbow orgies going. That jabbed you with side effects and canceled you on social media for complaining about it. That take private planes while making your gas unaffordable. That is actively attempting to erase our own southern border while obsessing about Ukraine’s. That anointed Russian collusion as a certainty but couldn’t be bothered to know what a Hunter Biden is. That assassinated Brett Kavanaugh’s character while letting Merrick Garland go wild labeling concerned parents as domestic terrorists. That U.S. citizens who protested their government on January 6 are now rotting in prison without due process while groomers run wild in our government schools.

You want me to put my faith in THAT system, Sen. Scott?

Because I’ve got other plans, and quite frankly, they aren’t negotiable with the likes of appeasers like you. For example, if the GOP wins Congress in November, it should do nothing less than shut down the entire federal government until the persecutions and banana republic nonsense I laid out above stops. Because if Senator Scott's flaccid fraternity continues to fund this fascist monster after all this, we all might as well move to Ukraine.

Here is the fundamental question on the table for the Republican Party: Do you finally hate what Democrats are determined to do to the country more than you hate your own base?

Still need help working through that pickle? Well, as always, I’m here to help.

Consider for a second that when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stepped up to keep sexual deviance out of the curriculum of elementary school students, it was labeled by the Democrats/groomers as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill and they subsequently began shouting the word ""gay"" like feral children throughout the halls of their statehouse.

Yet now, when monkeypox is running amok within the gay community, the very same people who shouted ""gay, gay, gay"" are suddenly a tramp stamp of those three ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" monkeys. How dare you say gay and monkeypox in the same sentence, and who cares if the CDC is doing it even though we loved its COVID propaganda?

Can you see it now, Senator Scott? The lie is the point. The undoing of reality is the goal. There is no system to trust.



We are meant as citizens to simply accept that the power belongs to somebody else, and the longer we complain about that, the more painful the hurt will be. That why Donald Trump is about to be frog-marched. Not because the system is working, but because the system has been utterly destroyed.

At this point, Senator Scott, I'd have more respect for your limp-wristed pleas to ""let this play out"" if you were actually in on the plot. Because you'd make a far better snitch than senator, if this is what you really think.

Repeat after me, Senator Scott: Hail Hydra.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-tim-scott-better-snitch-than-senator,2022-08-11
Deace: True Americans make leftist tyrants extremely nervous,"The New York Times' Mara Gay has one thing right about the people she finds ""disturbing"" because that star-spangled banner yet waves somewhere nearby.

The United States is, in fact, their country. Far more than it is hers.

""It's a Republic, if you can keep it,"" said Benjamin Franklin upon the completion of the U.S. Constitution. More than two centuries later, the Steve Deace Show's paraphrase of that calling is our 2021 motto, ""The answer is us.""

Either way you frame it, this nation clearly belongs to those who not only honor the work of those done before them to liberate mankind from tyranny, but then also stand a post when their turn comes to make sure the lights don't get turned out on freedom during their watch.

With extreme prejudice, just like Captain America said, ""Whatever it takes.""

When that is the game, the pickup truck with the American flag defeats Maya Gay in a route as a de-facto citizenship test.

Just as it does the media that continually provides a platform for the likes of Gay in order to turn her emotionally and historically unstable rantings into run-of-the-mill propaganda. Take NBC and MSNBC, the news outlets that uncritically send out a woke SOS for seeing too much red, white and blue. Those networks also played host to contributor Frank Figliuzzi this week, a former assistant director of the FBI who said this about the kind of politician a flag-waving pickup truck driver might vote for:

""Arresting low-level operatives is merely a speed bump not a road block,"" Figliuzzi said. ""In order to really tackle terrorism ... you've got to attack and dismantle the command and control element … That may mean people sitting in Congress right now.""

All of this on the heels of several years of watching the same sort of people redefine gender, manipulate the existence of a virus for political gain and authoritative ends, shut down schools and mask children in defiance of all science, and promote mob violence in the streets and critical racist theory in the classroom to grow racial tension.

If standing up to that makes me a terrorist, sign me up and give me a cool ""command and control"" T-shirt to signal my virtue. Then come and get me. Please try, I dare you. I'm bored and have oodles of pent-up angst just looking for an outlet. Because there is absolutely no ambiguity now for those even remotely paying attention. Gay and Company hate us. And they mean to punish those who won't either endorse their revolution or at least passively accept it.

With every word and deed we are promised by such enemies that this isn't their country because they scream it with pornographic intent. They are ashamed of the formerly shining city on a hill and fundamentally loathe its founding principles.

Gay isn't really even posing as a victim in this case, although she wouldn't hesitate to do so if it helped her cause. What she is behaving like is a front-line general in a war of conquest. She is defining clear lines of battle.

Either we get that or America becomes a thing of the past. Guaranteed. How else do you think a nation ends up whose citizens are advertising in one state that adults will be able to claim a free marijuana joint when they receive a COVID-19 vaccine? Sheep say ""bah.""

True Americans, on the other hand, make tyrants like Gay nervous. They are unafraid to do what must be done. They will not relent. They are proud to be called to defend something greater than themselves. They will not be fooled again.

They are nothing like Gay. This is indeed their country far more than a usurper like her. And according to such terms, she is free to surrender any time now and we'll be happy to let her enjoy the true blessings of liberty – instead of conjuring forfeits that are born of hell itself.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-true-americans-make-leftist-tyrants-extremely-nervous,2021-06-11
"Deace: If we think it can't happen to us, we're dead wrong","Mike Lindell, aka the My Pillow Guy, aka MAGA threat to the republic, had his car surrounded at a fast food drive-through and is now being investigated by Biden’s totes legit (we promise!)

The only difference between the two parties isn’t the mission but the motivation. Democrats are agents of chaos and carnage; Republicans just want in on the grift.

Iran may have its Rosa Parks, a woman murdered while in police custody for not wearing her hijab. The Iranians have their mad King George, the ailing Ayatollah Khamenei. They have their ruthless redcoats, the Revolutionary Guard. And as we speak, they may be having their Boston Tea Party/civil rights movement, as people take to the streets to take back the self-evident: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

So once were we, before we traded conviction for comfort and reason for madness. Before we managed to convince ourselves that if they can do this to Lindell, non-violent January 6 protesters, and sexually confused kids, we can trust they’ll totally pump the brakes before their appetite for destruction welcomes us to the jungle.

Donald Trump keeps proving that he is impervious to the normal forces of politics,"Perhaps never in the history of this great republic has a president's standing with his voters been more immune to news — whether good or bad — than Donald J. Trump.

We knew this instinctively about Trump when he managed to win the election a few short weeks after the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tapes were released. Who else in history could have won such a hotly contested election so soon after the ""grab them by the p***y"" comments dominated the news cycle?

But since Trump's election, the point has been even more amazingly driven home. Let's look at it graphically, courtesy of the RealClearPolitics average of Trump's approval ratings in the polls.

Here's what the chart looks like for all of Trump's presidency:

Image source: RealClearPolitics screenshot

That LOOKS like a pretty decent amount of movement, until you actually look at the Y-axis of the graph and realize that the whole chart only covers the range from 38-58.

Let's compare, for example, the chart for Obama's approval rating:

Image source: RealClearPolitics screenshot

And George W. Bush's:

Image source: RealClearPolitics screenshot

Trump's approval rating looks, visually, much flatter and less dynamic than Obama's and Bush's, and that's before you even take into account that the Y-axis for Obama's approval rating covers a range that more than twice that of Trump's, and Bush's covers a range that is almost three times that of Trump's. In other words, if you plotted Trump's approval ratings alongside either Obama or Bush, it would look even more like two almost completely straight lines than it does right now.

But if you want to be even more amazed, look at Trump's approval since the end of March 2018. That's roughly 18 months of polling data.

Image source: RealClearPolitics screenshot

This is a truly astounding chart. For over 500 consecutive days, Trump's approval rating has been between 41-45 points, and his disapproval rating has been between 51-55 points.

This is not a thing that happens during dull news times; and the last 18 months have been anything but dull. Let's review what all has happened in the last 18 months:

The stock market hit record highs on multiple occasions, and also had several single day crashes;

The Robert Mueller investigation dragged on, dominating the news for months, and concluded;

Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, was convicted of multiple counts of fraud;

Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to federal charges, and in his allocution said that he used Trump campaign funds to pay off a porn star with whom Trump had an affair;

Multiple mass murders (and Trump's response to them) dominated news cycles for days;

Job reports showed, at varying times, record low unemployment and also weaker-than-expected job growth;

Trump engaged in a public trade war with China and other countries;

Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was approved in one of the most contentious confirmation battles in history;

Republicans lost 41 seats in the House and gained 2 in the Senate in the 2018 midterm elections;

The United States appeared to approach the brink of war with Iran, then stepped back;

The immigration crisis reached fever pitch in 2019, with competing images of communities ravaged by the effects of the massive wave of Central American migrants, and the media-fed images of ""children in cages""; and

Democrats started an impeachment inquiry.

And the list could go on. In fact, I'm sure I'm omitting dozens of major stories. The point is, this hasn't been a dull 18 months. It feels like more has happened in the last 18 months than happened during the entirety of George W. Bush's second term. There are stories in here that, for any other president would have represented fairly predictable changes (both positive and negative) in their approval ratings. But Trump's has remained almost stunningly consistent.

What little changes there have been are almost certainly statistical noise and not reflective of any real change in sentiment about Trump whatsoever — no matter what the news of the day has been.

This is where it gets interesting for Democrats. For better or worse, I have many friends who are left-leaning pundits or Democratic political consultants. To a person, they are all convinced that Trump is doomed. They uniformly believe that the next Democratic nominee is the real contest for who will be the next president.

The reason for this is pretty simple: Within the bubble of people they spend most of their time in and around, hatred for Trump grows stronger every day. This allows them to deceive themselves into believing that the whole country has turned on Trump and that America would vote for a literal turd sandwich over him in the general election.

Meanwhile, the numbers seem to suggest that he is neither less well liked nor more disliked than he was pretty much on his inauguration day. Which, given the way the election shook out in 2016, would seem to suggest that no, the Democrats cannot run literally anyone and expect to beat Trump handily.

And they would further suggest that almost no matter what happens between now and next November, the collection of people who hate Trump and love Trump will be roughly the same. Trump, quite simply, is immune to their attacks. He is also, apparently, immune to receiving bumps from good news, but since he already won with his current level of support, that is much less distressing to Team Trump than the converse should be to Team Democrats.



The American public, for better or worse, appears to have already made up their minds about Trump, whether good or bad. Nothing that is likely to happen in the next year will change that. If Democrats want to win, they have to nominate someone who the American people believe will present a realistic, better alternative — if one in their field even exists.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/donald-trump-impervious-politics,2019-10-07
Horowitz: 12 things red-state legislatures must do tomorrow to reset COVID policy,"They've been completely missing in action for 18 months. Ever since our federal government and state governors reset our health care, culture, society, economy, and relationship with government with their ""15 days to flatten the curve"" plan last March, state legislatures — the unit of government closest to the people — have been in the witness protection program. A year and a half later, our government has flattened our liberty and economy, yet the virus is worse than ever because not a penny of the trillions of dollars spent have gone to early and preventive treatment. In other words, rather than keeping people out of the hospital, our policy response was designed to ensure that as many people as possible wind up in the hospital.

With state legislatures reconvening in special sessions to redraw our election maps, they have much more important things to deal with than redistricting. Before drawing the maps, they have a responsibility to hold hearings and pass legislation dealing with the problems with the leaky vaccine, vaccine and mask mandates, the censorship of heroic doctors treating COVID, the war on cheap, effective therapeutics, and prioritizing the billions of dollars in COVID funding for what actually saves lives rather than what controls lives. To that end, state legislatures and governors should promote the following ideas:



What works and should be done to treat COVID :

1. Right to try: We have all witnessed the gut-wrenching stories of people being refused effective treatments in hospitals, even when the hospital doctors are advising families to take patients off life support. States must pass a law requiring hospitals to give patients the right to try any FDA-approved drug prescribed by a licensed physician, at least if the patient's family is willing to pay for it and accept all liability.

2. Right to prescribe and practice medicine: Physicians may not be penalized with medical licensure because they share documented medical information or their own professional experience and observations. Those who speak up against public officials, if done in the public interest, may not suffer undue retaliation in the form of loss of board certification, licensure, or loss of privileges. They must also not be penalized for prescribing any off-label (but FDA-approved) drug to treat COVID, as on paper, there is not a single on-label approved drug for COVID, which is the main policy responsible for 90% of the COVID deaths and the run on the hospitals.

3. Right to fill prescription: All pharmacists must fill FDA-approved prescriptions for medications for off-label use so long as they are prescribed by a licensed practitioner. Failure to fill a prescription would result in a $100,000 fine. Anywhere from 10% to 20% of all prescriptions are off-label, and pharmacists never interfere with them. An uncontrolled pandemic with no other ways of alleviating the hospitals is an even more important time to not interfere with such prescriptions.

4. Right to coverage: Medical insurance companies must cover prescriptions for COVID the same way they would other respiratory viruses, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. If we are going to live under Obamacare, where one cannot go into the insurance business without actuarily insolvent coverage mandates, then you better believe we are not going to make a carve-out for COVID fascism.

5. Right to independent practice: States should encourage independent physicians, including all the talented physicians chased out of the hospitals for not getting the shots, to start COVID treatment clinics where they prioritize the patient and real science over Big Pharma. But any health care provider who wants to innovate with specialty ideas or establish new hospitals is automatically confronted with the near-insurmountable ""certificate of need"" (CON), which requires them to undergo a cumbersome process of licensing. CON requirements exist on top of the regular licensing requirements and FDA regulations. Like most regulations and barriers to innovation in health care, they were created by the existing health care establishment and are a way to box out competition and new ideas. The CONs and other red tape need to go.

6. Test and treat: It's time to move away from the failed ""test and trace"" model and move towards a ""test and treat"" system. As soon as people test positive, they should be given prescriptions immediately rather than be sent home empty-handed with fear and no hope. With a fraction of the billions in COVID funding each state spent on failed policies, they could easily fund physicians to man the testing centers and treat people on the spot, as well as a surge in the production of cheap, off-patent drugs that have shown to work against the virus.

7. Family treatment packets: States have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on endless welfare programs and social engineering. Yet they have failed to spend a penny on getting people prepared for the virus. The one thing that would have quelled the pandemic, and indeed obviated the need for all the other spending, was shunned. States must right that ship by promoting family treatment packages that any family can pick up and use for preparation. The kit should include multiple home COVID tests, a pulse oximeter, a nebulizer, aspirin, vitamins and supplements, and a guide to treating COVID along with information on where to get treatment.

What does not work and must be stopped:

8. Stop the blank check for remdesivir: The only treatment approved for COVID is remdesivir, and state and federal subsidy programs are paying $3,000 a treatment for something that has shown zero efficacy. Studies have found a statistically significant correlation of remdesivir use with kidney failure, which is partly why even the WHO recommends against using it. The universal use of remdesivir is one of the greatest scandals of COVID, especially when juxtaposed to the excuses given to reject much safer and more effective longstanding drugs.

9. Ban all discrimination against any hospital patient based on their medical history: Existing law applies this to HIV, and no physician would discriminate on account of the patient being a smoker or a drug consumer. Someone who chose not to get the vaccine should be no different.

10. Investigate the vaccines: Hold hearings with true experts about the waning efficacy, the risk of leaky vaccine syndrome, and the scope of the unreported short-term and long-term side effects. Before states continue to pump millions of dollars into a failing vaccine, shouldn't we get the facts straight?

11. Abolish all mandates: Every red state needs to ban all public and private vaccine and mask mandates, which violate human rights and have clearly shown not to work over 18 months. They should criminalize the enforcement of any federal mandate.

12. Make non-compete or non-contact clauses in physicians' or pharmacists' contracts illegal: At present, the reason most doctors won't treat COVID and many pharmacists won't fill prescriptions is because they will be fired, and then, pursuant to their non-compete clauses, they cannot practice anywhere in the region. These clauses threaten and sever the doctor-patient relationship, eroding its trust, and are used to financially threaten providers and pharmacists into compliance, as these providers cannot disagree with the contracting entities (usually health networks) that the federal government has control over. If such an organization threatened to fire such a provider, the provider could open shop across the street and the patients could follow them, free of control by outside forces.

From day one, our government's response has been focused on controlling people rather than controlling the pandemic. It's time to replace control with care and mandates with compassion. This is what it truly means to all be in this together.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-12-things-red-state-legislatures-must-do-tomorrow-to-reset-covid-policy,2021-09-15
Horowitz: 6 times the media credited masks with stopping a pandemic that then spread even more,"Mask-wearing was likely the greatest failed social experiment of our lifetime. Yet its own failure means it continues to be forced down our throats … or noses.

While it was always illogical that a cheap mask could stop a virus that is much smaller than the mask's pores, we embarked on a grand national experiment with a greater degree of compliance and shame than anyone could have imagined. On June 9, 2020, Reuters ran a headline, ""Widespread mask-wearing could prevent COVID-19 second waves."" The outlet suggested, based on a mathematical equation presupposing that masks work, that ""even homemade masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public.""

Well, the media got their wish more than they could ever have imagined, yet nowhere in the world did it stop the next wave or the one after that. That should have been the end of masks, but instead, we have allowed the global governments to continue lying to us when our own eyes can see masks failing to work in the real world. They are still trotting out theoretical studies or lab simulations of particles to hypothesize that masks might work, over a year after they failed to work on us humans when it mattered.

As the CDC attempts to resurrect universal masking in America, it's important to remember all the times the media suggested masks were the cause of the sudden drop in cases, when in fact cases increased with greater intensity later on – months into universal masking. In their minds, masks are immaculate and can never be proven ineffective.



In reality, as we've come to learn over the past 17 months, the virus saturates a given area for 6-8 weeks and then moves on, until the next wave a few months later. Nothing we do can prevent either the up-slope or down-slope of the curve.

Given the acuteness of the political amnesia, here is a reminder of just a few times the media credited masks for a decline in cases, only to have it blow up in their faces. This is built on the incredible research of the indispensable Ian Miller:

1) India

Perhaps the greatest illustration of the insanity of responding to the Delta mutation with masks is that the entire mutation emanated from India, 100% after the media had praised the country for ending its first wave in the fall with masks. ""The country has managed to encourage and enforce almost universal acceptance of masks without much debate,"" wrote the Wall Street Journal on December 30 in an article titled, ""Covid-19 Was Consuming India, Until Nearly Everyone Started Wearing Masks.""

""Until you have a vaccine, you have a social vaccine, and the social vaccine is the mask,"" Health Minister Harsh Vardhan repeated in speeches. Well, the cruel irony is that the mask-wearing failed to stem India's very sharp incline in March, and it wasn't the vaccine that precipitated the sharp decline in cases two months later. India barely had anyone vaccinated at the time.



2) Czech Republic

Well, certainly the Czechs did it right by instituting a mask mandate early on. That is most certainly why they barely had a problem until the fall of 2020, right? Wrong! Masks ""worked"" until they didn't work. On October 19, CNN published a bizarre article titled, ""Masks made Czech Republic the envy of Europe. Now they've blown it."" Except, they never worked; it's just that it wasn't their turn for the spread until the fall. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis boasted that his country was among the ""best in Covid,"" in part because of masks. In July, USA Today wrote that the Czechs taught us a ""lifesaving lesson"" about mask-wearing. But then in October, they experienced one of the sharpest inclines in all of Europe. They experienced two more waves thereafter, with at least the same degree of mask compliance, and now have the fourth-highest death rate in the world.

The highest death rate in the world, of course, is Peru, with one of the longest and strictest lockdowns and earliest mask mandates.

3) Japan



No country has taught the world more about mask-wearing than Japan, and no country now faces the shame and embarrassment of its failures. It's sure great we chose Japan as the host of this year's Olympics, so we don't have to worry about COVID because of their mask-wearing. After all, more than a year ago, Forbes reported, in an article titled, ""The Japanese perfect the mask,"" that Japan's ""high rate of mask-wearing,"" reported at 96%, was ""responsible for preventing the spread of COVID."" Well, the Japanese are now on their third large wave, which spread so much that all spectators were barred from the Olympics. For the first time ever, athletes are playing in front of empty stadiums because masks worked so well until they didn't.

It should by noted that, like most Asian countries, Japan's death rate will likely remain low. But it's clear that this has a lot more to do with the health of its population and possible inherent partial immunity, and not masks, because the virus is spreading uninhibited.



4) Israel

Historically, Israel has done things smartly, so everyone credited the Israelis' disciplined mask-wearing with their mild waves for the first few months of the pandemic. In fact, despite having a mild wave in the early summer and a substantial wave in the fall of 2020 after the masks and strict enforcement thereof were in place, the WSJ cited ""experts"" on November 1, basically saying that lockdowns didn't work but the masks did. ""Infections are dropping sharply despite less stringent rules and more defiance of them, likely because of more widespread use of masks,"" wrote the Journal. Well, after ""working"" for a few weeks (after ""not having worked"" in the prior waves), they went back to not working, as Israel experienced its worst wave yet in December and January. Eventually, cases ground to a halt, as they did in most places after the winter spread, and Israel finally relaxed the mandate. Another wave came back, and the country reinstated the mask mandate on June 24. Yet despite the mandate and one of the highest vaccination rates, cases have increased tenfold since June 24 and are higher than they were at this time last year with zero vaccination.

5) San Francisco



California at large, and San Francisco in particular, did everything ""right"" and did so from early March 2020. Last August, CNBC hailed San Fran as being ""better off than most U.S. cities,"" in part because of its culture of masks. Dr. Bob Wachter, chairman of the department of medicine at UC San Francisco, was quoted as crediting the ""social pressure"" in the city. ""In San Francisco, if you go to a gathering with one person having a mask off, it's likely that person would be looked at funny and their friends might even say something,"" he said.

While they did finally relinquish the mandate about a month ago, the city still has a much greater residual culture of mask-wearing than almost anywhere in the country. Yet despite being above the 35th parallel, San Franciscans are experiencing their sharpest increase ever, whereas most of those experiencing increases now are in the South, as we witnessed last year. Moreover, like most places with a strong culture of masking, they have a strong culture of vaccination, with 85% of seniors fully vaccinated and 77% of those over 12.

6) Germany

A USA Today fact-check cited a CDC report crediting masks for the rapid decline in cases in Jena, Germany. ""And in the German city of Jena, first in the country to implement public mask wearing last April, masks led to a 75% decrease in new COVID-19 cases in little under three weeks, one December study found,"" wrote the fact-checker on March 12, 2021, in claiming it's ""false"" to assert that the CDC's evidence found a ""negligible"" effect of masking. What is shocking about the timing of this ""fact-check"" is that the checker had the luxury of experiencing an entire year of the curve and could easily have seen that after cases went down, they went up over the winter by nearly 1,000% in the state of Thuringia (of which Jena is the largest city) after the mask mandate was in place so early! Yet they can publish information that was disproven by reality.

In general, Germany is quite instructive, because Bavaria and Berlin are one of the only known places to mandate the use of N95 masks, yet they failed to stop the subsequent wave.



There are many more examples, but we need not belabor the point that after 17 months, it is impossible for any rational person to think masks factor in at all in changing the spread of a virus.

Horowitz: 7 ways conservatives can fight back at the state and local levels,"Everyone is hoping and assuming 2021 will be a better year than 2020. But it will not happen on its own. We must get on the playing field and make it happen.

Assuming Joe Biden is sitting in the White House on January 20, there is little we can do to influence the direction of federal policy in the coming years. And given that too few Republicans in the Senate plan to stand against Biden's fraudulent election victory this week, we are out of options at the federal level to fight back against voter fraud. Many parts of the country are irrevocably lost, and certain federal policies, particularly foreign policy, are headed down a dark path. But does that mean that in conservative parts of the country, we must submit to unconstitutional tyranny, especially from an illegitimately elected president? Only if we allow it. Now is both the time and the opportunity to fight back.

Republicans control state legislatures in 31 states. They control the trifecta in 24 states plus Kentucky, where there is a Democrat governor but veto-proof GOP majorities in the legislature. Additionally, Trump won the vote in 83% of the counties, and a large portion of them have GOP elected officials or officials who can certainly be influenced and pressured into going along with local popular sentiment. With legislative bodies going back into session this January, now is the time for us to make a stand for freedom throughout the country.



Did New York and California ever cooperate with Trump? Not a chance. They became even more liberal under his tenure and even resisted federal enforcement of the law against foreign criminals who violated federal sovereignty. Why can't we do the same in the states and counties we supposedly control to at least return to constitutional governance?

To that end, here is a list of seven immediate agenda items for conservatives to focus on at the local and state levels to ensure that at least pockets of this country remain a sanctuary for ordered liberty and constitutional governance.

1) Constitutional sanctuaries against COVID fascism: Conservatives must immediately organize and push for the adoption of a declaration of rights and principles in the county and state legislative bodies over which they wield the most influence to make those jurisdiction sanctuaries against mask mandates, forced business closures, and draconian treatment of children in school. These declarations will affirm our rights to life, liberty, and property, terminate all emergency delegated authority to governors, and use the doctrine of lesser magistrates to fight unconstitutional suspensions of liberties from higher-ups in government.

2)Focus on local offices: Groups of patriots in each county need to assess, communicate with, pressure, and, if need be, recruit against the existing school board members, sheriffs, county judges, county prosecutors, county executives and commissioners. This is where all the power lies. There is no reason why in the 2,000+ counties Trump carried by easy margins that all of the aforementioned officials should not be on the same page to resist state or federal enforcement of unconstitutional lockdowns, mask tyranny, and abuse of our children at school. If not, we should immediately be working on candidates for those offices who share the values that reflect the presidential voting patterns of the county.

3) Immediately primary every lockdown governor: How is someone like Mike DeWine even able to stand for re-election this cycle, given that he has instituted the same lockdown policies as Andrew Cuomo in conservative Ohio? The answer is because we are not doing our job. Governors like DeWine in Ohio, Bill Lee in Tennessee, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Kay Ivey in Alabama, Brad Little in Idaho, Chris Sununu in New Hampshire, Greg Abbott in Texas, and Mark Gordon in Wyoming should easily attract a primary challenge. Trump should be recruited to support and rally for challengers. Why should we only have two anti-lockdown governors (DeSantis and Noem) of the 27 alleged Republican state executives in the country?

4) Vote on anti-crime/anti-riot and pro-self-defense legislation: While our governments took away our liberty with coronafascism in 2020, they also took away our safety by publicly blessing, rather than deterring, BLM and Antifa rioting. Additionally, they have released thousands of criminals, which has, in part, led to the sharpest increase in crime in a generation. Every Republican-controlled state legislature should immediately push legislation toughening sentencing on repeat violent offenders, clamping down on mob violence, and expanding self-defense laws. Ron DeSantis' anti-rioting bill he plans to propose to the Florida legislature should be a model for two dozen other states.

5) Strengthen election integrity: The first order of business in states Republicans control should be to ban mail-in voting and ballot harvesting. They must make sure all elections are secure. I've detailed a list of nine ideas that should be pursued at a minimum. What about the federal courts inevitably inserting themselves into these laws? That leads me to #6.

6) Tell the federal courts to pound sand: If states had the ""right"" to thwart federal immigration law under Trump, according to these courts, and if they had the right to ignore their own election laws in a presidential election that affects the entire country, then it's time for states to control areas of law that legitimately fall under their jurisdiction without judicial intervention. After turning down Trump's lawsuits, the federal courts have forfeited any ability to get involved in election law. Red states need to stand up to them once and for all and teach them that federalism is a two-way street.

7) Block refugee resettlement: If Joe Biden becomes president, he will immediately increase the number of refugees we admit and force them upon the states. Additionally, he will try to resettle more Central American teens who crash our border as refugees. Although states don't control the visa admission process, refugee resettlement requires state cooperation to place large numbers of refugees in local communities. While Americans are locked down, it makes no sense to admit more people from around the world. If states can welcome illegal aliens, then states can close their doors to the antiquated institution of refugee resettlement.

Notice a pattern? Most of the power on the relevant issues resides in the states where Republicans control a significant amount of power. They make it seem as if the world hinges on a razor-thin RINO majority in the Senate in Washington, yet they refuse to use the power in meaningful ways even when they control all of state government with supermajorities. The same legislatures that declined to challenge the election results refuse to fight on any other issue as well. That can all change if conservatives train their fire on local officials and candidates and fight national issues at the local level.

So, the next time Republicans give the excuse of ""but Biden"" and ""but Pelosi"" to justify their inaction on an issue, remember there are two dozen states that should look like a conservative version of California. They have their sanctuary states for tyranny and criminals. We should have ours for ordered liberty and the Constitution.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-7-ways-conservatives-can-fight-back-at-the-state-and-local-levels,2021-01-04
Horowitz: A ‘never again’ law to prevent future public health fascism,"With the momentum on our side, now is not the time to breathe a sigh of relief. It's the time to go on offense against COVID fascism. Yes, we appear to be healing from the ailment of COVID fascism, but now is the time to inoculate ourselves against future usurpations while we still have the chance.

Unlike with the virus, there is no natural immunity against government tyranny under the guise of public health. This is the essence of what Ronald Reagan meant when he warned, ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction."" We can always lose our freedom, and once it is given up, we seldom reclaim it. Part of the reason why is because every time we beat back an assault on our freedoms, we just move on to the next issue and fail to vaccinate ourselves against future usurpations. This time must be different. It's time for every state and county to pass a resolution prohibiting any of these actions from ever being taken again. Preferably, they should be codified into state constitutions.

It's not like the various federal and state agencies have admitted that lockdowns and masking are ineffective and harmful. They are just finally conceding that the measures are no longer necessary this round. Thus, we might have temporarily gotten our breathing back, but we did not reclaim our freedom, because it is always subject to infringement at the flick of the pen of a governor or mayor. In fact, Fauci has already hinted at masking becoming the new baseline for the flu season, and we all know that at the first sign of another virus (or a different emergency), these same actors will pull out this yet-to-be-repudiated playbook. Which is why we must repudiate it, burn the blueprint, and break the mold, so that it can never be used again.



The following is my proposal for a ""never again"" resolution that will permanently reclaim these lost rights from the clutches of public health tyrants.

Declaration of American rights and principles for an American sanctuary

Whereas what distinguishes this country from other supposed democracies is that our rights come from God, not from government, those rights are fully sustained in times of war as well as peace, times of sickness as well as wellness, times of scarcity as well as prosperity.

Whereas Justice Robert Jackson observed the same thing about the provisions of the federal Constitution and that the Founders deliberately omitted emergency exceptions to fundamental rights because they ""knew the pressures they engender for authoritative action, knew, too, how they afford a ready pretext for usurpation.""

Whereas the state power to quarantine is only on the sick, not on the healthy, and that the Supreme Court has ruled that no effort to quarantine may be done in an ""arbitrary, unreasonable manner, or might go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public.""

Whereas all the measures taken to stop the spread of a recent virus have proven ineffective in their stated goal yet devastating in their collateral damage to society as a whole.

Whereas federal law prohibits anyone from using ""law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom"" to deprive any person of ""any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution"" (U.S. Code Title 18, Sec 242).

Whereas shutting down businesses without offering full and complete compensation violates the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause.

Whereas Sam Adams said the American Revolution was a contest over ""not only whether we ourselves shall be free, but whether there shall be left to mankind an asylum on earth, for civil and religious liberty.""

Whereas even during the Articles of Confederation government, states lacked the authority to block citizens from traveling freely across state lines.

Whereas the Supreme Court has held, ""No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law"" (Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford (1891)). And that the right of a human being to breathe freely through his or her nose and mouth is the clearest manifestation of that right to bodily integrity:

Be it Resolved, that this legislative body recognizes the state/county of _____to be an American sanctuary, an asylum on earth for the following liberties during any declared public health emergency:

The right of every citizen to move freely without being restrained or forcibly masked in violation of his bodily integrity.

The right of every citizen to responsibly open their businesses without government deciding which ones are essential.

The right of every citizen to worship freely during a declared emergency.

The right of every American child to attend school without physical and psychological abuse.

The right of every citizen to be shielded from government monitoring of his privacy.

The right of citizens to have their state governments shield them from any federal usurpations of inalienable rights.

The right of every citizen of this republic to travel freely across state lines.

Therefore, as the duly elected legislative body of this state, we commit to the principle that during a declared emergency – for health or other reasons – individuals absolutely retain the right to be free and independent and maintain their inalienable and fundamental right of self-determination to make their own health and personal safety decisions including, but not limited to, the right to refuse any of the following health-related countermeasures:

The wearing of masks or other medical devices.

Vaccination.

Testing or any physical examination.

Participation in contact tracing.

The involuntary sharing of personal data or medical information.

Forced quarantine of any individual who has not been infected with an actual disease that has been proven deadly and has not already proliferated through large portions of the population. The case fatality rate must exceed 1.5% in order to trigger any forced isolation of individuals.

Even in the case of a legitimate quarantine, it shall be implemented in the least restrictive means possible to prevent the spread of the toxic agent or disease; shall include reasonable notice and due process; shall protect the right of the individual to remain in his or her home and live with family members, friends, and significant others at all times. An individual's quarantine or isolation shall not remove or alter the individual's legal or medical custody of another individual. A minor child shall not be forcibly removed from his or her parent or legal guardian or home in order to enforce an individual's quarantine or isolation.

In addition to respecting individual rights to bodily integrity and personal autonomy, during any declared emergency by the governor or any public health order issued by a government entity, a government entity shall not infringe upon the rights of business owners. No government official may revoke a business license, occupational or professional license, or liquor license because such business remains open. No government entity may fine, sanction, or seize funds or assets of a business because such business remains open. No government entity may force a business to close, to reduce its hours, to alter its manner of business operations, or to otherwise restrict such business in its manner of operation, including with respect to access by employees, customers, suppliers, consultants, or contractors.

Any violation of personal or business rights during a declared emergency will result in the immediate termination of the declared emergency or public health order and create an immediate cause of action against said government officials by any citizen. Any violator is guilty

of a misdemeanor and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not to exceed $10,000,

or by imprisonment for not more than 180 days.

Further, any executive order issued by an executive agency, department, or head of agency or department is to be treated as advisory for private citizens. Only with a two-thirds vote from the governing legislative body can public health orders affect the conduct of private citizens and must still be in accordance with the aforementioned limitations. An exception to those limitations can only become effective following a public hearing on the matter and a three-fourths vote to suspend the standing rules of declared public health emergencies. Such suspensions cannot last for more than 30 days.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-a-conservative-blueprint-for-creating-an-american-sanctuary-through-localism,2021-05-19
Horowitz: Arkansas supermajority Republicans end session without any protection for workers,"The Arkansas state motto, ""Regnat populus,"" means that the people rule. But in this special legislative session for COVID-related matters, it was the special interests that ruled. Who needs blue states when even in red states, we no longer enjoy even the post-constitutional liberties we had in February 2020, before we lost the autonomy over our own bodies?

Thus far, there is only one state that has a categorical ban on the mandates of these failed COVID shots. Montana passed a bill (HB 702) earlier this year that would do just that, although even there they exempted certain health care settings, which is actually the most illogical place to mandate even a working and safe shot because most of the workers already had the virus. Yet in other states, we can't even pass protections in a compromise form of that bill, despite Republicans controlling 23 trifectas.

As I reported last week, the legislative leaders, working at the behest of Governor Asa Hutchinson and the big business lobbyists in the state, blocked most of the legislation that would ensure workers are not forced to get a dangerous and ineffective shot. The only bill that they allowed to pass to partially protect some workers would only go into effect in 90 days, when it will be too late for most workers who must decide now between taking the shot or losing their jobs.

Well, the House of Representatives ended this special session with a bang by voting down SB731, a bill that would create a right to privacy of medical status to ensure employers cannot ask about vaccination status. We have such protections under current law for other forms of medical privacy, and to exempt vaccine mandates from medical privacy is particularly absurd because in no way does an unvaccinated person affect someone else's health. If the shots work, then the people who want them are protected. Given that, of course, they don't work, and in fact, the vaccinated are now spreading the virus more and with at least the same viral load, there is no rational basis to allow this form of discrimination.

SB 731 would have further provided a cause of action for workers to sue any employer who violates that right to privacy. If businesses, at the behest of government, believe these shots are safe, then let them place their money where their mouths are. Republicans have a 78-22 majority in the House, yet they could only muster 41 votes in support of the bill! It previously passed the Senate 22-11.

Thus, all these governors who said ""not in my state"" to Biden's mandate are paper tigers, because with the exception of official state employees, most red-state workers are now under the gun of some form of vaccine mandate. It is shocking how, as most states convene special sessions for redistricting, they are not even considering the more urgent issue of mandates over our bodies for an increasingly problematic shot. How is it that most red states aren't even considering a version of Montana's bill?

Moreover, states have gotten billions of dollars in COVID funding, yet state legislatures have barely engaged in oversight over that funding. Instead, it's all been controlled by the health department bureaucrats in each state. Shouldn't those funds be spent on helping people with early treatment rather than pumping them into promotion of a failed shot and dangerous hospital treatments?

At the end of the month, Tennessee lawmakers will finally convene a special session on COVID fascism. This is the perfect opportunity for people to have their voices heard and ensure that one of the most trending red states actually lives up to its reputation. How is it that even in a state like Wyoming, months after mask-wearing has been completely discredited, a student was arrested for not wearing a Chinese face burka?

If you can acquiesce to the notion that someone else can control what you put in your body – whether government or an employer – then you don't own your body. If we acquiesce to the notion that large businesses acting in concert with government actors to promote authoritarianism are somehow governed by the rules of the ""private sector,"" then we have no liberty left in this country.



On October 18, 2019, bizarrely nearly two months before the virus was officially discovered, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation held a pandemic simulation , known as Event 201. The top proposal from that event, according to Hopkins, was that ""governments, international organizations, and businesses should plan now for how essential corporate capabilities will be utilized during a large-scale pandemic."" This is straight from the horse's mouth that corporations are an essential tool of the government's planned coercion in a pandemic. Any red-state politician who claims he is protecting liberty by allowing those government-sponsored ""private"" entities to violate human rights will be complicit in this unprecedented assault on human rights, human dignity, and public safety.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-a-never-again-law-to-prevent-future-public-health-fascism,2021-10-11
Horowitz: Biden calls for mask mandates in response to increased cases in states … that already have strict mandates,"As thoroughly as the lie of mask efficacy has been debunked is exactly how strongly it will continue to be forced upon the citizenry.

""I need the American people to do their part as well. Mask up. Mask up. It's a patriotic duty,"" Joe Biden said during a rare speech yesterday in which he implored mayors and governors to reinstate mask mandates.

It's almost as if these people are living in a time warp and it is still March 30, 2020, when mask-wearing was first introduced as a desperate measure to possibly slow the spread of a virus … that we now see 12 months later it failed to stop one iota. The mask mandate has been implemented against all ADA and OSHA standards — beyond our wildest dreams — yet it failed to stop two subsequent waves of spread. However, Biden is still saying, ""It's the only way we ever get back to normal,"" as if nobody has ever worn a mask.

Just how insane was Biden's call to reinstate mask mandates in reaction to some data showing cases increasing in some states? Every state with an increase in cases has had an ironclad mandate for almost a year, while all the states that got rid of the mandate at the beginning of the month are either flat or going down.

Once again, we can count on Rational Ground's Ian Miller, the master of the mask charts, to expose the truth.

As it turns out, the three lead states in the resurgence of cases are none other than New York, New Jersey, and Michigan. It is truly hard to find a place in these states where one can go indoors without a mask. Tether that to the federal mandate that began in early February, several weeks after cases were already going down, and you are left with the mystery of how cases went back up again long after the mandates were in place. Well, it's the same way they spiked in the fall long after those same state mandates were fully complied with.



Texas and Mississippi are the only states to have had mandates, but then, in early March, categorically removed them, even locally. The morgues are filling up, right?

Nope. Here is Texas compared to New Jersey:

Cases are down 41% since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott lifted the mandates:

So, what is the truth of the matter? As we've observed for a full year, it's all geographical and seasonal. Every climate region seems to have the exact same curve. Take Mississippi and Alabama, for example. Cases are going down in both states, and they have identical curves. But if anything, Mississippi, which terminated its mandate, is experiencing a sharper decline than Alabama, which still has a statewide mandate.

Now compare that to Michigan in the northern part of the country:

Clearly, some areas still have not reached herd immunity. In some of the northern states, they will still get a natural seasonal spread in the cold weeks of the early spring.



The greatest example, of course, is the Czech Republic. In the summer, the country was touted as the global success story presumed to be the direct result of strict adherence to the mask cult. Well, that was until God had a different plan. Now, the Czechs are worse off than almost every other Western country, including the United States:

Then, of course, there is Florida, which has counties that are masked and counties without mandates. There is almost a perfect reverse correlation between cases per 100,000 and mask mandate counties:

The Philippines has the highest level of mask compliance in the world (the president threatened to shoot violators of quarantine), yet it certainly has failed to stop the spread there.

None of this should surprise people who have studied this issue. Every randomized clinical trial that has studied mask-wearing as source control for respiratory viruses demonstrated the masks' lack of efficacy, a fact OSHA promoted for years.

Yet masks are so magical that they can ""work"" in the states that don't have the mandates while failing in the states where they are actually implemented.



Last week, I exposed the fact that the FDA only approved mask-wearing as an emergency medical device under the experimental Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). One of the conditions for such use, besides being optional and not mandatory, is that the ""the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product"" (21 U.S.C. §360bbb–3(c)(2)(B)). Also, they are only approved if ""there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating such disease or condition"" (ibid. – 3(c)(3)).

Well, 12 months later, we now know that there are zero benefits to wearing the masks and there are numerous early and prophylactic therapeutics that can easily treat the virus. Furthermore, the World Health Organization wrote a list of potential harms from mask-wearing in its June 2020 guidance that clearly outweigh the nonexistent benefits.

The mask experiment is over, and it has failed. Now it's time to follow the science — and human rights.

Horowitz: Breaking the uniparty: It’s time to run fresh independent candidates in general elections,"There’s been a lot of discussion and debate over election fraud in Pennsylvania. But there is an undeniable form of election fraud nobody discusses, and that is the existence of the Republican Party, which runs conservative in the primaries but then governs like Democrats – just like a potential fraudulent voting machine that swaps out a Republican vote for a Democrat one. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Pennsylvania race for U.S. Senate, where on the issues of our time, Mehmet Oz is indistinguishable from Democrat John Fetterman. Moreover, he is unelectable anyway and will lose to Fetterman. Isn’t it time we break the uniparty oligarchy and start recruiting impressive independent candidates in general elections?

Late in the senatorial primary, conservatives around the country were inspired by Kathy Barnette’s shoe-string campaign against two elitist opponents who spent millions of dollars. She was one of the few candidates this cycle to actually inveigh against the premise of COVID fascism and the Pfizer bio-medical state. She looked like she might pull off an impressive win based on some of the final polls, but the establishment and Trump effectively dissuaded some voters from casting their ballots for her because they suggested she couldn’t win the general election.

It is an old tactic of the GOP establishment, and unfortunately, it works. They know that our voters are most concerned about the Democrats winning, so they convince them – without providing any evidence – that the only way to beat the Democrats is to elect Republicans who will essentially codify the Democrat agenda but with slightly less enthusiasm. Thus, in this case, we were stuck with Dr. Oz, a candidate who supports the grooming agenda, “bail reform,” the vaccine biomedical state, gun control, and the World Economic Forum and who suggested that “America needs to learn from Wuhan’s quarantine lessons.""

Then, the minute Oz won the primary, he wasted no time scrubbing from his website all references to Trump, who stupidly helped him win the primary, along with Fox News. Most others at least wait a few months before migrating back to their true political leanings, but Oz is getting a head start on demonstrating how he would govern. Except he will never get that chance.

Any thinking conservative should understand by now that someone like this is actually counterproductive to advancing our agenda – much like the negative efficacy of the Pfizer shot – and yes, is worse than a Democrat because he will work to subvert our agenda from within to create consensus for the globalists. But either way, this is a moot point, because two recent polls show that it is actually the liberal Republican who can’t win the general election. Even in the worst year in memory for Democrats, Fetterman is leading Oz by nine in the USAToday/Suffolk University poll and by six in an AARP poll.

Now, all things equal, this deficit is not insurmountable for Oz. However, all the polls so far show him starting out extremely unpopular, particularly among independents. He has a -26 approval among critical independent voters, according to the AARP poll, and in general is starting the race with a -33-point approval among all likely voters. That is simply toxic. It is also astounding, given how bad a year it is for Democrats and how much voters want to send a message to Joe Biden. Republicans, for the first time, actually cast more ballots in the primary than Democrats did, despite Democrats having a 554,000-person registration edge.

Imagine if these voters had a fresh face, a complete outsider with an impressive background and even more impressive agenda that drew a bold contrast to both major candidates, who essentially agree on the issue of our time – bio-medical tyranny and the World Economic Forum agenda.

The bitter truth conservative voters (and disenchanted independents and Democrats) must confront is that so long as those who badly want to see change are terrified of rising Democrat wins if they don’t support duplicitous Republicans in the general election, we have no chance of ever changing the system or leverage to make Republicans more attuned to ordinary voters. Just watch Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn betray us in broad daylight. Can you blame them? They know that it’s impossible to win against incumbents in primaries – challengers fail more than 99% of the time – and they know we will always be on the plantation for them in the general election no matter how much they stab us in the back.

This point was perfectly expressed by one liberal Florida GOP official to the New Yorker in the now infamous expose on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. “There was always an element of the Republican Party that was batshit crazy,” said Mac Stipanovich, the chief of staff to former Florida Governor Bob Martinez. “They had lots of different names — they were John Birchers, they were ‘movement conservatives,’ they were the religious right. And we did what every other Republican candidate did: We exploited them. We got them to the polls. We talked about abortion. We promised — and we did nothing. They could grumble, but their choices were limited.”

This is why we only have one Ron DeSantis. Every other governor is horrible on every issue that matters. Ditto for nearly every GOP senator. They know we will always support them in the general elections, and primary challenges simply do not work. Thus, why should they antagonize the masters of the universe on behalf of the poor slobs? Until we make it clear that we are off the plantation, we will continue to suffer interminable and immutable decline with Republicans in charge.

I know I’m in the minority among conservatives in believing that it is actually worse to continue electing perfidious Republicans than Democrats and that we need to rethink our political strategy and focus altogether. It’s not to say I think we should just vote Democrat to make things more obviously worse or not vote at all. It’s that we should unite and work to recruit impressive candidates who understand the spirit of the age but have a slightly broader appeal than just a traditional conservative Republican and run that individual in the general election.

It’s nearly impossible to start a third party and consistently get on the ballot in each state, but in most states it’s fairly easy to get on the ballot as an independent. Independent candidates never win because they are usually throwaway campaigns; after all, the most viable contenders will run as Republicans or Democrats. But what if we changed that game? What if we found individuals somewhat well known, with a fresh message and agenda, no pre-existing labels as a partisan, but someone who is currently in the trenches on the issues that matter and would fight the oligarchs of both parties and appeal to the fastest-growing base of voters – the unaffiliated?

Just to throw out a random example to paint a caricature for you, think of someone like Dr. Robert Malone, one of the leading opponents of the mass vaccination and the mushrooming bio-medical state. He actually voted for Democrats in the past and was never a right-winger. But he more effectively articulates the concerns of our voters, plus so many Democrats and independents, than any Republican running for office. He is more known as a scientist than as a politician, much less a conservative Republican politician, but his impressive background would actually allow his candidacy to gain traction and raise money. There is no question in my mind that someone with this background, in this environment, could have a shot of winning a three-person race in the right state.

We only need one example of a successful independent bid to break the monopoly of the “uniparty” and actually bring change to the American people. One of two things would then occur. Either it would spawn a revolution of better-organized independent candidacies, or it would force the Republican Party to be more responsive to the people than the other half of the elite oligarchy they share with the Democrats.

This is different from simply “allowing the Democrats to win.” Yes, we won’t always succeed in winning or even recruiting such candidates, but can we at least try. Do we have to throw ourselves at the GOP oligarchs who hate us immediately in every general election, no matter how much they betray us? Can we at least make them sweat and work for our vote?

Again, I know those conservatives who watch Fox News all day will have a hard time seeing the light in cases where the RINO is a shoo-in to defeat the Democrat in a two-person race. But we should at least try a test run to break away from the duopoly in a race like the PA Senate contest, where the fake Republican is almost assured to lose anyway.

Now, obviously, Robert Malone doesn’t live in Pennsylvania, nor have I seen evidence that he is planning to venture into politics. But it is someone who fits that persona, particularly from the growing medical freedom movement, who would have to run if there’s any hope of us disarming the GOP’s blackmail of conservative voters while also having at least a chance of denying the Democrats an automatic win. I’m sure such a person exists in this large state who would not needlessly turn off non-traditional conservatives but at the same time would speak to the important issues of the day – medical freedom being the top priority. The deadline to file and gather signatures is August 1.



For over three decades, we’ve been forced to vote for the “lesser of two evils” in nearly every election – always with the promise that somehow that would lead to incremental improvements. Yet we’ve consistently suffered plain evil, not a lesser version of it, even when Republicans win, culminating with the GOP support of COVID fascism with control of two of the federal branches and half the states. If we are ever to change any aspect of our government for the good, we will have to break the duopoly at some point. In the case of the Pennsylvania Senate race, there’s no time like the present.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-biden-calls-for-mask-mandates-in-response-to-increased-cases-in-states--that-already-have-strict-mandates,2022-06-24

As the federal government and many state governments violate the Constitution with COVID fascism and, likely soon, by clamping down on protected political speech, local law enforcement and elected officials will have to step up to the plate and defend our constitutional rights.

Trump won 83% of the counties, in addition to roughly half the states. There is no reason why each one should not become a constitutional sanctuary. If the local sheriff, county commissioners, county executive, school board officials, and prosecutor are all in favor of declaring the county a sanctuary from civil liberties violations, then ""there shall be left to mankind an asylum on earth, for civil and religious liberty,"" as Sam Adams predicted when embarking in the struggle for independence.

The constitutional sanctuary movement that started with the Second Amendment is gradually moving into COVID fascism and hopefully will be used to push back against any tyranny at the federal level in the coming months.

On Monday night, the Monument Board of Trustees declared Monument, Colorado, to be a sanctuary from restrictions on businesses. This small town in El Paso County voted 7-0 on ""A resolution reasserting the rights of the Town of Monument and its residents and condemning the unconstitutional limitations imposed upon their freedoms by the governor of Colorado.""

Specifically, the resolution announced the town will ""not abide by any executive orders limiting attendance of and free speech at public meetings within the town."" The trustees called upon each individual business owner to assess his own risk level and willingness to butt heads with the state government.

This is a good start, but county and town governments need to make it clear that they will unite and resist unconstitutional orders against state authorities. We must stop saying things are unconstitutional and then treat them as if they are constitutional. Either ""life, liberty, and property"" have meaning or not.

To that end, all of the officials in Bargara County, Michigan, a rural area in the Upper Peninsula, united in a letter declaring Governor Whitmer's orders unconstitutional. The letter, which was posted on County Sheriff Joe Brogan's Facebook page, noted how the people have not endured such tyranny since the settlement of this continent. ""Our citizens' rights to assemble, to freely practice their religion, to travel, to keep their property, businesses, and jobs, even to dress as they please have all been swept aside, and to what end?"" declared the letter, which was signed by the county commissioners, prosecutor, clerk, and treasurer.

The sheriff notes that every state and local official swears an oath to the Constitution. If these measures are not unconstitutional, especially after 10 months of utter failure to even move the needle on taming the spread of the virus, then that document quite clearly has no meaning. ""We hereby put the state of Michigan on NOTICE that we have no intention of participating in the unconstitutional destruction of our citizens' economic security and Liberty,"" continued the letter. ""We further declare our intention to take no action whatsoever in furtherance of this terribly misguided agenda.""

Another Upper Peninsula county, Delta, passed a resolution supporting the right of businesses to open their establishments. There are a number of cities and counties across the country now considering these resolutions in addition to the nearly one-third of counties that have already declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries. SanctuaryCounties.com is keeping track of these developments.



What ultimately needs to happen is that, pursuant to the doctrine of lesser magistrates, communities work together with all their local officials to actively defend – both legally and morally – business owners who are attacked by state or potentially federal officials. Republicans control 31 state legislatures. They have an obligation to pass sanctuary resolutions statewide. In many of those states they have supermajorities to override the veto of a Democrat or RINO governor.

Every county, state, and federal official swears an oath to uphold the Constitution — the same oath taken by federal judges — no more, no less. In justifying why federal courts should have concurrent (not exclusive, as some erroneously think) jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation instead of upholding even unconstitutional laws passed by the legislature, Justice John Marshall pointed to this very oath. ""How immoral to impose it on them if they were to be used as the instruments, and the knowing instruments, for violating what they swear to support!"" declared an indignant Marshall in his famous Marbury opinion.

In defense of judicial review, Marshall rhetorically asked, ""Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the Constitution of the United States if that Constitution forms no rule for his government? If it is closed upon him and cannot be inspected by him?""

Well, as state officials swear the same oath and wield even more robust power directly affecting the lives of citizens than judges do, don't they have the same obligation to use their powers to counter illegal executive edicts that impose the most unconstitutional social changes imaginable? Changes to our law and society that violate the foundation of natural law and nature's God, to whom that oath is directed?

If California and New York were able to offer sanctuary to the most vile criminal aliens – and even criminalize the enforcement of duly passed immigration law – then most certainly red counties and states can and must be sanctuaries for American businessmen, schoolchildren, and the Bill of Rights from the clutches of evil and illegal executive power.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-break-the-uniparty-independent,2021-01-14
Horowitz: Courts are unilaterally redefining sexuality against legitimate rights,"The government can deny you entry into every public university in New York state for not injecting a private novel product into your body or covering your breathing holes all day with a dirty mask. And now, the government can force a private Jewish college to not only accept you but accept a union dedicated to promoting homosexuality and every other sexual behavior codified by the ever-evolving alphabet soup of Sodom and Gomorrah.



Last week, the Supreme Court rejected a request for stay of a New York court ruling which forced the nation’s oldest Jewish university to allow a “gay pride” group to operate within the campus. The court declined to rule on the merits of the request and legality of the issue, and instead punted based on the premise that the institution has other avenues to pursue appeals in the lower courts. It is very telling how it would hesitate for one minute to rule on an unambiguous and dangerous violation of the First Amendment.

“Does the First Amendment permit a State to force a Jewish school to instruct its students in accordance with an interpretation of Torah that the school, after careful study, has concluded is incorrect? The answer to that question is surely ‘no,’” wrote Justice Alito in his dissent, in which he was joined by Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, and Barrett. “The First Amendment guarantees the right to the free exercise of religion, and if that provision means anything, it prohibits a State from enforcing its own preferred interpretation of Holy Scripture. Yet that is exactly what New York has done in this case, and it is disappointing that a majority of this Court refuses to provide relief.”

Earlier this year, a New York trial court ordered the Manhattan-based college to recognize the LGBT student group’s right to promote anti-Jewish values and to “immediately” grant it “the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges afforded to all other student groups.” Thus far, the other appellate courts have failed to grant an expedited relief. In response, Yeshiva University has firmly put a halt to its sponsorship all student groups until the matter can be resolved.

The necessity of this action means that Justice Kavanaugh declining to involve the Supreme Court essentially green-lit one of the most egregious violations of First Amendment rights in American history. The four judges made it clear in the dissent that the university would win the case if it were judged on the merits.

Broadly speaking, the Supreme Court has allowed lower state and federal courts to trample on religious rights and create novel rights for their favorite sexual “identities” that demand states and religious institutions affirmatively accommodate their bizarre and often dangerous behavior — such as castration operations. It’s not like you could evacuate from blue states like New York and escape this insanity. The courts are pushing it on red states everywhere.









In May, a federal judge in Indiana denied a motion from the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville to allow separate bathrooms for those who are biologically male and female. At the time, the court ruled that keeping separate bathrooms violates Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution written in 1867. Similarly, the Supreme Court has refused to overturn a decision made by the Ninth Circuit, which forced Idaho to treat a male prisoners like females and fund castration surgery.

Last month, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that transgenderism is a right enshrined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, thereby forcing states to house male prisoners who think they are women in female prisons, endangering the safety of the other inmates. The more conservative Eighth Circuit ruled that Arkansas must allow doctors to perform castration on minors.

Thus, it’s become self-evident that the federal courts are going to force every aspect of the transgender/transhumanist agenda upon the states, and the Supreme Court will not be there to defend history and tradition, as well as sanity and religious liberty. The left fears the coming era of a permanent conservative Supreme Court, and too many conservatives are anticipating with glee such an outcome. In reality, we will likely pay for the impending Dobbs ruling on abortion with the non-Thomas/Alito justices taking turns betraying us on other issues in order to “preserve the integrity of the court.” Nowhere is this more evident that with the transgender issue. Based on recent decisions, even the standard “deeply rooted in history and tradition” created by Dobbs to define an unenumerated right should easily contradict all of these rulings.

So, what is the answer? We must remember Abraham Lincoln’s admonition that “we the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.” If a court can redefine humanity and block a state from common sense recognition of gender (while green-lighting states to force masks and shots), then there is nothing a court cannot do, and we have ceased being a constitutional republic. At some point, states must begin saying “no thank you” to the courts, and Montana might be in the process of doing just that.

Last week, a Montana judge – in this case, a state judge – ruled that the Department of Public Health and Human Services must allow people to change their birth certificate to reflect their perceived gender, in contravention to SB280, a law that was recently signed which prohibits the department from making such changes. The department issued a regulation to change the word “gender” on the birth certificate to “sex,” which it noted is obviously “immutable.” It appears that for now, the executive branch is asserting its authority over issuing birth certificates, something not in the purview of the courts.

“The Department thoroughly evaluated the judge’s vague April 2022 decision and crafted our final rule to be consistent with the decision. It’s unfortunate that the judge’s ruling today does not square with his vague April decision. The 2022 final rule that the Department issued on September 9 remains in effect, and we are carefully considering next steps,” said Charlie Brereton, director of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.

We are going to need more of this throughout the red states. When Alexander Hamilton promised that the courts would wield “neither force nor will,” he certainly never imagined the will to redefine human sexuality, much less the ability to enforce such an absurdity.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-constitutional-sanctuary-movement-begins-to-grow,2022-09-19
"Horowitz: Courts: No right to property, but yes, right to welfare","Two of the more indelible ways that the government has used COVID to create Venezuela-style Marxism are the CDC mandate prohibiting landlords from evicting residents and the massive unemployment welfare scheme that paid some people more to be unemployed than to work. Two court decisions governing the outcomes of each of these policies, when juxtaposed to one another, create a new paradigm in America: You have the right to welfare or to other people's property, but not a right to your own.

Last Tuesday, Justice Kavanaugh shockingly joined the four liberals on the Supreme Court in refusing to stay the CDC's moratorium on evictions. Kavanaugh indicated that the eviction moratorium is likely unlawful absent congressional approval, but noted that because it is set to expire on July 31, it wasn't worth placing an injunction on it, even though it's still in place and violating property rights.

The eviction moratorium was one of the most radical things done under the Trump administration, and it of course was continued by the Biden administration. And while this version of the order is set to expire next month, there is no guarantee they won't issue a new modified order.

Last September, the CDC decided that if it can control our breathing, it can control property rights as well and proceeded to bar landlords from evicting any family earning under $200,000 who didn't pay rent. So, despite handing out free money to everyone, including $600-$1,000 in unemployment benefits per week in some states, the government still put the onus on private landowners to eat the cost and retroactively shred their private contracts.

Thus, we have four or five justices who now believe that COVID allows the government to take away your property when the entire purpose of government is to protect private property from anarchy. You have no right to your property or to open a business, but someone else has a right to live on your property without paying.

Hold that thought for a moment, and now try to understand an order from an Indiana county judge attempting to force states to pay the exorbitantly high federal unemployment benefits, even though it's making it impossible for businesses to find workers willing to work. You see, while you don't have a right to own your rental, open a business, breathe freely, or decline an experimental injection, people have the right to unemployment welfare that stimulates unemployment.

Over the past few months, 26 states have ended one or all of the four federal pandemic unemployment programs established in the CARES Act. The programs add to the time and scope of who is eligible for the program, as well as adding an additional $300 a week to the base rate. On June 25, Marion County Superior Court Judge John Hanley placed a temporary injunction on Governor Eric Holcomb's order to pull out of the plan. Hanley states that the extra UI benefits were ""instrumental in allowing Hoosiers to regain financial stability at an individual level while the state continues to face challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic during its return to normalcy.""

How about the right to breathe normally? Isn't it interesting that the only injunctions the judges seem to issue are on policies that are well within the state's power, yet they are nowhere to be seen when plaintiffs need relief from the state assault on real inalienable rights.

Courts were supposed to serve as a shield for individual rights against actions taken against them by government, not as swords to secure entitlements from governments or even other individual landowners. ""Mi casa es su casa"" has now been enshrined as a legal theory!

What is truly astounding is that at a time when the courts are saying that a landlord with a single apartment doesn't have the freedom to deny service to someone who doesn't pay, a Florida judge ruled that the state can't punish monopolistic big tech companies that collude with government to deplatform anyone they disagree with. These companies have essentially taken over the equivalent of public roads for speech, yet they can, at the behest of government, deny anyone a platform who disagrees with the government line on masks and vaccines.



Also, last week, a federal judge in Indiana, appointed by Trump no less, placed a temporary injunction on Indiana's new law requiring abortion doctors to tell patients seeking an abortion about a new abortion reversal drug. Somehow it's not in state interest or power to disseminate information to save the unborn, but a state can not only spend taxpayer funding lying about the efficacy of masks and the safety of experimental vaccines, but downright mandating them on human bodies. And, of course, a mom-and-pop bakery or florist must serve an event that violates the owner's religious beliefs, and the state is somehow well within its powers to force that upon small business owners.

Taken as a whole, the courts have flipped fundamental rights and governmental powers upside down, inside out. As we celebrate the Declaration of Independence in this month of American pride and reflect upon the founding of this country, rooted in self-evident truths of inalienable rights, we must confront the jarring fact that we have competing views in this country that are irreconcilable with those self-evident truths. For how long can a house divided against itself stand?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-courts-are-unilaterally-redefining-sexuality-against-legitimate-rights,2021-07-06
Horowitz: Czech mega-surge of cases shows dramatic failure of mask mandates,"Everywhere the magic masks were forced upon the people, they failed to stop the surge of cases, and in fact, those countries have seen dramatic increases in cases. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Czech Republic.

All those European countries that thought they beat the virus with a lockdown were in for a rude awakening. Now they have nothing to show from the destruction wrought by lockdowns but a massive surge in coronavirus cases. However, we were told that mask-wearing is the most effective tool to save lives — to the point that social media now censors anyone who opposes these mandates.

So, let's take a look at the results. The Czech Republic has endured the sharpest surge in cases of any European country. It's worse than at any point in the U.S.

According to the European Centre for Disease Control, Czech has the highest attack rate over the past 14 days in the entire continent. The country has 905 cases per 100,000, which is more than twice the rate of France and triple the rate of Spain.



Less than two months ago, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis boasted that his country was among the ""best in Covid."" They credited their strict mandate to wear masks inside and outside the home. I asked my friend Ian Miller of RationalGround.com to add the Czech Republic to his list of mask charts showing the timing of mask mandates compared to the rise in cases. The results are stunning:

In many places, liberals are contending that the situation would have been worse without a mask mandate even though cases eventually spiked. That is obviously a ridiculously unverifiable and speculative claim, but the experience of the Czech Republic exposes the fallacy of this claim. They had near zero cases and hospitalizations for months and now have the worst spike in Europe with a nearly eightfold increase in cases in just one month – long after the mandate had been restored. There is no middle ground. It's quite evident that they didn't have a spread initially and when it was destined to come, it came on strong. Masks played no role.



In fact, one has to wonder if masks are contributing to the spread. So many government agencies warned initially that misuse and reuse of masks could lead to cross-contamination. Well, a recent analysis of the timing of mask mandates in a number of countries has shown that ""for every increased percentage point of mask use in a country, there were an average of 37.536 additional positive PCR tests per one million population.""

Here is a graphical presentation of the positive correlation between increased mask use and growth in cases:





That study published by three doctors was initially posted at Research Gate, but like so many informative articles presenting the other side of the mask issue, it has been taken down. Part one, which was published earlier, can still be viewed here.

Last month, I reported on an analysis from Tennessee showing that counties without mask mandates had fewer cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per capita than those with the mask mandates.

I'm not going to make the same mistake as the other side and claim that this proves that masks downright spread the virus. Obviously, there are numerous natural factors that could be driving the increased spread, so correlation doesn't necessarily equal causation, but it's certainly ludicrous to suggest that masks help stop the spread at this point.

The Czech government is in such as state of panic at this point that Prime Minister Andrej Babis is building emergency field hospitals. With hospitalizations six times higher than the initial peak in the spring (before universal mask-wearing), Babis warned, ""We don't have time—numbers are catastrophic."" They can't have it both ways: Either masks are the single greatest tool in stopping the virus or there is panic. They can't panic over a spread that happened with universal masking while extolling the virtues of masks!



Contrast the results of the Czech Republic to those of Sweden, and you will see that lockdowns and masks are clearly not the path to a flatter curve. Sweden has barely had excess deaths over a typical year:

Moreover, mask supporters often point to the fact that other Scandinavian countries initially had better results than Sweden as a refutation to Sweden's strategy. However, what they forget to divulge is that the other Scandinavian countries have the same or lower rates of mask-wearing. In July, the Council of Foreign Relations conducted a survey of 25 countries, asking respondents, ""Have you always worn a face mask outside the home in the last seven days?"" Guess which countries reported the lowest rate of mask use? The four Scandinavian countries:



Norway: 3%

Sweden: 3%

Denmark: 1%

Finland: 1%

Thus, the success of those other countries actually goes into the bucket of the non-mask list, not the other way around.

It's no wonder that the response from the media and the politicians is to squelch debate and censor dissent rather than producing evidence that such a draconian and dehumanizing edict is effective. They have no evidence and cannot debate their position.

In the summer, Denmark conducted a much-hyped randomized clinical trial of mask effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and were slated to publish it in August. Many of us were wondering why it was never published. Former New York Times reporter and noted lockdown critic Alex Berenson discovered the answer for us. On Sunday, he posted a screenshot of an email correspondence he had with Thomas Lars Benfield, the lead investigator on the Danish mask study. The 12-word response to the question of when the study would be published is worth a thousand words.

""As soon as a journal is brave enough to accept the paper,"" replied Benfield, a clinical professor at University of Copenhagen.



There very well might not be a single publication that is brave enough to publicize the truth about masks. The question is whether we are all brave enough to push back against the hoax of using a cheap cloth to stop a micro-biological juggernaut of a respiratory virus.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-courts-no-right-to-property-but-yes-right-to-welfare,2020-10-21
Horowitz: How is this DOJ witch hunt against congressional conservatives not unconstitutional?,"The seizure of Rep. Scott Perry’s personal cell phone by the FBI is likely unconstitutional. Now that I just gave a constitutional opinion contrary to the view of the government, does that make me a criminal, and will they come to arrest me? Welcome to the Fourth Reich.



On Tuesday, Rep. Perry announced that three FBI agents had seized his cell phone. While information concerning their warrant is unknown at this point, the media is speculating that it has to do with accusations of the January 6 Committee that Perry was involved in the so-called conspiracy to overturn the election results and advocate for an alternate slate of electors from Pennsylvania.

But where is the commission of a crime? The question of whether state legislators or governors are the final say in selecting state electors or whether the vice president is just a ceremonial proceeding officer over the congressional counting of those electors or whether he has the final say is a political/constitutional question. It’s not a criminal act to advocate on behalf of one side, even if another individual believes those are reprehensible views to hold.

The fact that violence resulted from a protest of one side of this debate doesn’t implicate the members of Congress who took the losing side of the argument. It’s like saying the Democrat members of Congress who not only advocated for de-incarceration and defunding of the police, but downright encouraged violent protests, can be criminally charged for the deaths, injuries, and billions in damage caused by BLM and Antifa. Can a Republican president have his DOJ seize the phones of the members who marched at BLM riots where real violent criminal acts were committed?

Now the opposition party in the executive branch has the cell phone of the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, who undoubtedly kept a lot of political strategy and communication on that phone. This is exactly what our Founders sought to protect in the Speech and Debate Clause of Art. I, § 6, which provides that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, they [Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other Place.""

For the same reason, in that same section, the Constitution states, “No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States.” Just like the Founders didn’t want collaboration between the legislative and executive branches, they didn’t want the executive branch to be able to prosecute the legislators for speaking their minds. No collaboration with or conspiring against the separation of powers. Yes, that would necessarily foreclose prosecution of sleazy politics (not stand-alone criminal activity), but the definition of sleazy and even immoral politics is in the eye of the beholder, or shall we say the political opponent.

In 1964, Maryland Democrat Rep. Thomas Francis Johnson was convicted in federal court on seven counts of violating the federal conflict-of-interest statute (18 U.S.C. 281) and on one count of conspiring to defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. 371). The main case against him brought by the Justice Department was an accusation that he took money from banking interests in exchange for delivering a favorable speech on the floor of the House. However, the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court categorically overturned those convictions based on a violation of the Speech and Debate Clause.

In U.S. v. Johnson (1966), the Supreme Court concluded, “However reprehensible such conduct may be, we believe the Speech or Debate Clause extends at least so far as to prevent it from being made the basis of a criminal charge against a member of Congress of conspiracy to defraud the United States by impeding the due discharge of government functions.” In other words, as much as we would like to root out political corruption through criminal charges against this practice, the Founders understood that the collateral damage of affording the executive branch powers to criminalize legislative activity, political opinions, and speeches would be too chilling for a free republic.



Which is why they noted that Johnson’s speech was “precisely what the Speech or Debate Clause generally forecloses from executive and judicial inquiry.” The court made clear that the Clause must be “read broadly to effectuate its purposes,” ultimately concluding that the Clause forecloses prosecution based on evidence relying upon “the legislative acts” of a legislator or “his motives for performing them.”

Keep in mind that Perry is the member of Congress who last year filed articles of impeachment against Attorney General Merrick Garland, the ultimate boss of the FBI, who signed the warrant for the Trump raid. This is exactly the sort of conflict of interest in law enforcement that our Founders wanted to avoid. They particularly feared the collusion between the law enforcement officials of the executive branch and the magistrates, a fear that we are witnessing in real life with magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, a former Jeffrey Epstein lawyer who hated Trump and approved the warrant against Trump. The Supreme Court explains this exact problem in the 1966 Johnson case as follows:

It was not only fear of the executive that caused concern in Parliament, but of the judiciary as well, for the judges were often lackeys of the Stuart monarchs, levying punishment more ""to the wishes of the crown than to the gravity of the offence."" There is little doubt that the instigation of criminal charges against critical or disfavored legislators by the executive in a judicial forum was the chief fear prompting the long struggle for parliamentary privilege in England and, in the context of the American system of separation of powers, is the predominate thrust of the Speech or Debate Clause. In scrutinizing this criminal prosecution, then, we look particularly to the prophylactic purposes of the clause.

Obviously, if someone commits fraud or another criminal act as a member of Congress, he can be prosecuted. If a member of Congress acted violently on January 6, he can be prosecuted. But legislators can’t be prosecuted for offering legal, constitutional, and political opinions or advice for a president of their party to fire people who are fully within his right to fire.

Most people find politics reprehensible and even, in a colloquial way, downright criminal. But what’s worse is to allow one side of politics to criminalize the other side’s politics. Historically, it is the Left that has spawned exponentially more political violence, including in many state capitals, during debates over a political matters, and they didn’t need help from FBI agents provocateur to actually make the violence go kinetic. Are we now to say that any Democrat who took the political side of the protesters is completely subject to questioning, seizure, subpoena, and potential arrest based on the political statements they made in the lead-up to the vote or legislative proceedings?

This is all occurring in the shadow of two years of government officials treating political opponents and their political views as domestic terrorism on par with Islamic jihad. This didn’t begin with Trump. They have been doing this to ordinary Americans who can’t afford high-priced lawyers. Hopefully, the GOP politicians, now seeing they are not immune from the suspension of due process and legal norms, will finally do what it takes to neutralize the tyranny rather than fundraise off it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-czech-surge-coronavirus-cases,2022-08-12
Horowitz: Even Arkansas Republicans refuse to protect bare-bones individual liberty in the face of shot mandates,"Who would have thought that nearly a month after Joe Biden declared martial law and forced a vaccine mandate upon many workers in all 50 states, not a single red state has effectively combated it yet? To this day, thousands of people have been forced to either get the experimental shots against their will or lose their livelihoods, despite the failing efficacy of the shots accelerating every day. A perfect example of this dynamic is playing out in the state of Arkansas.

Arkansas Republicans cannot even support a degree of a compromise on the totalitarian vaccine mandate that would limit the mandate to the degree that New York was pushing just a few weeks ago! One would think opposing any vaccine mandate in a state like Arkansas with a supermajority trifecta would be a slam dunk. Any ""private"" business mandate is being done at the behest and cajoling of government and cannot be chalked up to free market activity. Yet the same RINO governor who had no problem placing mandates on ""the private sector"" to shut down businesses and fine them last year is suddenly concerned about their ""right"" to force employees to violate their bodies.

""Employers have the freedom to protect the health of their workplace, and government should not interfere with the employee/employer relationship,"" Asa Hutchinson said in a statement released by his office after supporting fines on businesses all last year for NOT engaging in COVID fascism. Freedom is a one-way street in his book.

Because of Hutchinson's unflinching grip on many RINOs in the legislature, full opposition to workplace jab mandates was out of the question for conservatives in the legislature. As such, they opted for a watered-down bill (SB 739) allowing for an exemption for those with antibodies and an opt-out to get PCR-tested once a week. This bill would essentially bring Arkansas back to where New York was just a few weeks ago, yet still a number of Hutchinson allies in the Senate opposed it.

On Tuesday, the House voted 68-23 to pass the bill. But even though it also passed the Senate on Monday, it failed to achieve the two-thirds support it needs to be implemented immediately. Pursuant to Arkansas law, for a bill to be implemented right away without the 90-day layover period, it must pass as an emergency declaration, which requires 24 votes in the Senate. Yet even though Republicans have 27 senators, four of them defected and declined to declare it an emergency: Cecile Bledsoe, Lance Eads, Jonathan Dismang, and none other than Senate president pro tempore Jimmy Hickey.

Now, why would the GOP Senate president vote against immediately implementing a watered-down bill to allow a testing exemption that even New York was allowing until recently? People are being forced to make life-altering decisions right now and cannot afford to wait 90 days. Many have already been forced to get the shot or lose their jobs without any relief from the legislature.

Many of these Republicans hide behind concerns about ""regulating"" businesses, but they never seemed to be concerned when the businesses were regulated into bankruptcy during the shutdown.

Ultimately, SB 739 will become law in Arkansas, after it's already too late for many workers, but it's a shame they couldn't pass a clear restriction on vaccine mandates. S. 732 would have done just that, but failed to get two-thirds' support in the Senate and was blocked by the House committee on public health. SB 730, which would have authorized unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs due to mandates, passed the Senate but was thrown out on procedural grounds by House speaker Matthew Shepherd. It's amazing how GOP leaders in red-state legislatures tend to elevate alleged concerns over procedure over basic human rights during an unprecedented time of suspension of civil liberties.

Throughout this entire ordeal, presumptive front-runner for governor next year Sarah Huckabee Sanders has been awfully quiet. Conservatives who want a change from Asa Hutchinson could sure use a voice who is not bought out by Walmart and Tysons.

When looking for gubernatorial candidates, conservatives need to take their cues from Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, who is not only promising to ban all COVID mandates outright in her challenge to Governor Brad Little, but for the second time, she used Little's absence to temporarily bar mandates while serving as acting governor. On Tuesday, McGeachin barred all businesses from requiring vaccine passports and also called up the Idaho National Guard to potentially deploy to the southern border. The last time Little was out of state, McGeachin used her power as acting governor to bar mask mandates. While Little will countermand this order as he did her last one, McGeachin is demonstrating what red-state leadership looks like. Where are the other leaders?

Throughout the next few weeks, a number of states will be meeting to redraw the election maps. This is a perfect time to address the coercive mandates and other emergent issues that are of even greater urgency than reapportionment. Alabama conservatives, for example, have introduced a very important bill that can be used as a model in other states. HB 31 would subject employers to liability for injury if they require their workers to get the shots. This was the original position of OSHA and is in line with current law regarding workplace injury.

On Aug. 1, 1776, just a few weeks after signing the Declaration of Independence, Sam Adams spoke before a large audience at the State House in Philadelphia, beseeching them to fight for their independence. During the speech, he warned the public that ""our contest is not only whether we ourselves shall be free, but whether there shall be left to mankind an asylum on earth for civil and religious liberty.""



Two hundred forty-five years later, the COVID great reset has essentially ensured that there is no asylum left for civil and religious liberty anywhere in the world, including the United States. Our contest today is whether there will remain a few states in this country where we can exercise those liberties that Adams and his fellow patriots once secured for all of these United States.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-doj-wtich-hunt-conservatives,2021-10-06
Horowitz: Exposing the maskerade: The questions every American should be asking about indefinite mask mandates,"The trope of ""just shut up and wear a mask"" is not science, ordered liberty, or constitutional governance. It's what they do in North Korea. We need real debate on the effectiveness of masks, the type of masks, the situations in which they are worn, the duration of time, the benchmarks that need to be met to measure effectiveness, and the process for promulgating these rules. We are no longer 24 hours into an emergency. We are four months into this virus, and it's time to function like the representative republic that we are.

There are numerous political and scientific questions any thinking person should be asking at this point:

Why did the CDC, World Health Organization, and such luminaries as Fauci and Surgeon General Jerome Adams so emphatically dismiss the effectiveness of masks, then flip 180 degrees to the point where they shame people who don't wear them, without ever explaining what changed? While we learn more about the virus every day, the micro-biology of the particles hasn't changed, and the premise that non-professional masks worn by non-trained professionals run the risk of counterproductive cross-contamination did not change.

The suggestion that this is needed to protect others raises the obvious question: If me not wearing a mask transmits the virus to others who are wearing a mask, then is that not an admission that masks do not work to stop a respiratory virus that is microscopic and gets through the mask? Garbage in, garbage out. It makes no sense to suggest it doesn't penetrate the transmitter's mask from inside-out, especially with the air pressure of a cough or sneeze, but can penetrate the mask of the receiver through suspended molecules that are stagnant without pressure pushing those molecules outside-in to the receiver. If anything, the opposite should be true – it should be more effective for protection of yourself.

How can mask-wearing work when everyone just stores them in their pockets to collect bacteria, as our government officials predicted from day one?

How could kids ever keep it clean and not collect more bacteria, and where is the evidence that children are even a vector for viral transmission? My home county is mandating that even two-year-olds wear masks. How can anyone suggest that children can keep them clean, and where is the evidence that young children are a vector for transmitting the virus, when numerous studies from other countries have shown the opposite?

Mask-wearing in all of the major cities – from Los Angeles to Miami – has been in place and followed by pressure and community shaming for months. Compliance in most of these places has been off the charts, according to the NYT. Yet the virus is still spreading more than before the mandate. The virus is now spreading in Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, which have near universal mask-wearing. At what point does the mask cult have to provide evidence of the effectiveness of these unconstitutional mandates, and at what point do benchmarks have to be met to maintain such a draconian and life-altering requirement?

Do masks that are continuously reused, cross-contaminated, and not properly disposed of become a trap to further transmit the virus or become retainers for other pathogens – or at the very least for bacteria, which are larger than viruses – that can harm the mask-wearer and others alike?

What are the known side effects to one's health after wearing these masks for hours on end in the heat, especially for children in school? Does long-term mask-wearing lower oxygen levels and compromise our immune systems?

Do masks cause people to touch their faces more often, the exact opposite of what was originally the desired result?

To suggest that individuals be forced into something so personal as covering their own faces indefinitely under the guise of protecting other people is a huge, dramatic change in the relationship between the government and the citizen. We should at minimum get clarity on these questions before allowing any executive authority to unilaterally decree it. Doesn't the near-universal opposition to widespread mask-wearing from these very same ""experts"" before the issue became political hold any weight? Doesn't their reversal demand explanation?



To this day, there has never been a clinical study with randomized controlled trials in non-health-care settings that vouch for the effectiveness of universal mask-wearing in public. All we have so far are anecdotes and laboratory filtration studies, not real human-to-human studies. When asked about conducting one, Dr. Fauci said there is no intention to do so. In fact, he went from resolutely dismissing the idea of wearing masks in March to now telling a group of Georgetown University students that he couldn't even conduct a study because he was so scared of having even a study group go without masks!

Thus, we are told we are not allowed to breathe free air without a mask – no studies allowed. Fauci's view? No votes, no hearings, no debate, no studies, no time limits, no performance benchmarks. Shut up and cover your mouth indefinitely and don't you dare express the view he used to espouse … or else.

Until now, the only time mask use has ever been a studied in a non-health-care setting showed the opposite of what the political class is saying. As Dr. Andrew Bostom of Brown University wrote earlier this month:

Moreover, a subsequent pooled (so-called ""meta-"") analysis of ten controlled trials assessing extended, real-world, non-health-care-setting mask usage revealed that masking did not reduce the rate of laboratory-proven infections with the respiratory virus influenza. The findings from this unique report — published May 2020 by the CDC's own ""house journal"" ""Emerging Infectious Diseases"" — are directly germane to the question of masking to prevent COVID-19 infection and merit some elaboration.



One study evaluated mask usage by Hajj pilgrims to Mecca, two university-setting studies assessed the efficacy of face masks for prevention of confirmed influenza among student campus residents over five months of surveillance, and seven household studies examined the impact of masking infected persons only (one), household contacts of infected persons only (one), or both groups (five). None of these studies, individually, or their aggregated, pooled analysis, which enhanced the overall ""statistical power"" to detect smaller effects, demonstrated a significant benefit of masking for the reduction of confirmed influenza infection (also see tabulation). The authors further concluded with a caution that using face masks improperly might ""increase the risk for (viral) transmission.""



As doctors from the Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, Australia, concluded in arguing against even health care workers wearing surgical masks when treating low‐risk patients, ""There is no good evidence that facemasks protect the public against infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID‐19.""

They explain how the way most people use masks could actually become counterproductive:

One danger of doing this is the illusion of protection. Surgical facemasks are designed to be discarded after single use. As they become moist they become porous and no longer protect. Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others.



They cite a ""desperate situation"" in the U.S. as the impetus for the CDC's reversal on masks and note that it is based on ""scant"" evidence. Which is why, ""In contrast, the World Health Organization currently recommends against the public routinely wearing facemasks.""

Even N95s, which certainly cause people to get headaches by stifling fresh air, don't necessarily show conclusively positive outcomes. A 2019 study of 2,862 randomized participants (Radonovich, L.J. et al. (2019)) published in JAMA found, ""Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.""

There's a reason why as late as May, the CDC was citing the 10 randomized controlled trials that showed ""no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks."" Containing the virions that are emitted from the aerosols in a mask, much less a cloth that so many wear, is like locking up a bee in a jail cell. As the CDC notes, masks were not designed to protect against microbiological particles 0.1 micron in size — or one hundred-thousandth of a centimeter — but from visible contamination.

Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids (36). There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.



How does such a grounded observation built on 10 unrefuted clinical studies change in just a matter of weeks if not for politics? If anything, COVID-19 is more of a dry cough than the flu, which would likely produce more atomized particles that are certainly not larger than the wetter flu emissions. Yet the CDC has gone from vehemently opposing masks to promoting even cloth coverings, which everyone agrees do not filter out most particles.

And these people have the nerve to call conservatives anti-science?

The question we must ask ourselves is this: if our government can now mandate such a personal and disruptive lifestyle change to our bodies with assertions that contradict their own long-standing evidence from just weeks ago and with so many unanswered questions, what else can they do to us without presenting evidence or a transparent and democratic debate? It appears that ""my body, my choice"" only applies to murdering babies.

We deserve hearings and we deserve answers. We are citizens, not subjects. Just because this virus came from China doesn't mean the politicians can use it as a pretext to turn us into China.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-even-arkansas-republicans-refuse-to-protect-bare-bones-individual-liberty-in-the-face-of-shot-mandates,2020-07-24
Horowitz: Florida Gov. DeSantis leads as other Republican governors drag their feet,"Why do we only have one governor who is consistently fighting for individual liberty on the issues of our time?

Given that the 100 days of mask-wearing Biden prescribed turned into a joke – with cases rising in states with mandates and falling in those without them – one would think every red state governor would commit to permanently blocking COVID fascism. While many Republican governors have loosened restrictions, most have not committed to ending them permanently and ensuring that nothing like this can happen again. Moreover, few of them are truly fighting the growing trend of colleges and businesses illegally requiring vaccines.

Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill (S.B. 2006) that will dramatically alter how pandemic orders are promulgated in the state going forward. Unlike other governors who fought the legislatures on limiting executive authority, DeSantis embraced the opportunity to promote liberty at the expense of his own power. He also went a step further. To bridge the gap between now and when the bill takes effect on July 1, he signed a companion executive order today that will suspend all remaining COVID-19 orders from local jurisdictions throughout the state. This includes all remaining mask mandates.

Most importantly, stripping localities of the ability to apply emergency orders will likely block school districts from requiring students to wear masks, effectively immediately. Last month, the Department of Education already announced guidelines to end the school mask mandate for the next academic year.



The governor also announced that there will be a complete clemency for any individual or business cited by a locality for violating COVID restrictions last year.

The long-term reforms included in the bill DeSantis signed today include the following:

Will continue to allow a governor to declare an emergency up to 60 days at a time, but not longer without affirmative support from the legislature.

Allows House and Senate to override any emergency by joint resolution even before 60 days.

Allows local subdivisions to create emergency orders for only up to seven days at a time.

Any extension of local orders must be approved by the local governing body and can only be done for seven days at a time for a maximum of 42 days. This would prevent health departments from running counties administratively or even local bodies from having mask mandates for a year, as was done in Miami.

Allows governor to override any local order if deemed too restrictive to liberties.

Assumes all schools and businesses should remain open during an emergency if they can maintain safety protocols, and governor must provide explanation why it is necessary to close them if not.

Bans vaccine passports by government, businesses, and schools as a condition of entry or enrollment. The governor already banned them in his executive order on April 2, but this bill would make his order permanent. Under the bill, those officials who require vaccination could face a $5,000 penalty.

Very few states have passed laws this aggressive. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the Chamber of Commerce watered down a bill blocking businesses and schools from requiring a vaccine in order to obtain service. The final bill was limited just to government actors. However, the bill barring all state and local mask mandates forever in future pandemics did become law. Under Florida's law, a locality can still impose a mask mandate during a future pandemic for up to seven days unless the governor nullifies it. North Dakota passed a bill denying only state officials the power to impose mask mandates. Otherwise, very few red states have limited the ability of this illogical and inhumane practice to rear its ugly head again next flu season.

Republicans control 23 state governments the way they control Florida. Why are these victories so few and far between?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-exposing-the-maskerade-the-questions-every-american-should-be-asking-about-indefinite-mask-mandates,2021-05-04
Horowitz: 'Good judges'? Think again: Trump appointee blocks key Trump immigration policy,"The same Trump-appointed judge who gave Jim Acosta a right to demand access to the White House in 2018 has now given 7.8 billion people the potential ""right"" to sue for entry into the country as for asylum, even when they purposefully pass over numerous other countries first. What's next? Can I get standing in court to demand that Trump meet with me every Sunday morning to discuss my ideas? Why is it too much to ask that Republican-appointed judges understand the role of the judiciary, standing, fundamental rights, and sovereignty?

In another failure of the faux conservative legal establishment, Trump appointee Timothy Kelly ruled on Tuesday that Trump could not enforce his policy from last July requiring asylum-seekers to first apply in the first country they pass through before being eligible for asylum status in America. Shockingly, he did so even after the Supreme Court already stayed an injunction by a California judge against this rule.

It's truly hard to overstate how radical this decision is. The entire definition of asylum is that you are seeking safety somewhere else because you are in danger in your own country. The fact that these people are cherry-picking the United States for their destination demonstrates that their claims are bogus.

Plus, the courts have ruled for hundreds of years that foreign nationals have no standing to sue for the right to come into this country. How then could there even be standing to hear such a case? Also, third-party advocacy groups, such as the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition of Washington, the Texas-based Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), and Human Rights First were named as plaintiffs. So, could conservative NGOs now become plaintiffs to sue on behalf of foreign nationals to block foreign policy? Can I sue the Pentagon for using our soldiers and taxpayer funding for Kabul urban renewal projects?

For most of our history, the courts were clear that private parties can't bring lawsuits to protect imputed rights of parties not before the court. Even if we are going to countenance the recent deviation from that principle, the third-party standing should not be expanded to foreign nationals. In Warth v. Seldin (1975), the Supreme Court explained, ""Without such limitations — closely related to Art. III concerns but essentially matters of judicial self-governance — the courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions."" Nowhere is this more evident than in questions pertaining to international migration and border security during times of peril.

This is the first time I can remember a court messing with a foreign policy of the president. These agreements were hashed out in high-level diplomatic negotiations with Central American countries. This is exactly why the Supreme Court said long ago that the ""exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty"" and that ""the right to do so stems not alone from legislative power but is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation"" [Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 1950]. It's not just that the president has 1182(f) delegated authority to shut off all immigration, even asylum requests. It's inherent in his Article II powers to govern foreign affairs and foreign commerce.

The court further punctuated this point in Kleindienst v. Mandel, (1972): ""In accord with ancient principles of the international law of nation-states … the power to exclude aliens is inherent in sovereignty, necessary for maintaining normal international relations and defending the country against foreign encroachments and dangers — a power to be exercised exclusively by the political branches of government.""

This is why, even if the president didn't fully abide by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in the way he promulgated this new policy, as Judge Kelly suggests, there is no way there can be valid standing or judicial jurisdiction to adjudicate the consequences of that policy in this context.

Moreover, 5 U.S.C. §553(a)(1) explicitly exempts a ""foreign affairs function"" from the APA. And for good reason. A president doesn't have time to play games while national security is at stake. Border security and immigration policy sit at the nexus of foreign policy and national security. This is exactly why the Supreme Court said in Mathews v. Diaz (1976) that ""decisions in these matters [immigration] may implicate our relations with foreign powers"" and therefore, these ""decisions are frequently of a character more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary."" In this case, these very policies were born out of bilateral and multilateral agreements with at least four countries.

Ironically, one of the problems we faced from the flood at our border in 2018-2019 was a health crisis overwhelming our hospitals with people coming here for care. Why is it that the courts believe elected officials can violate the Bill of Rights under the guise of combatting a public health crisis, but somehow foreign nationals can assert a right to enter even in the face of a health crisis?

The answer is that we have become strangers in our own land, and even Republican-appointed judges have bought into this inverted thinking that flips the Declaration of Independence and consent-based governance upside down. The lower courts, thanks to tacit greenlighting from the Supreme Court, have been creating rights for illegal aliens at breakneck speed. They have essentially abolished ICE.

Just this month, a federal judge vacated the deportation of an illegal alien with prior battery convictions who was arrested for rioting at a BLM event simply because he had DACA status! An illegal alien has no right to remain in the country even without a criminal conviction, but now that the courts have mandated Obama's amnesty, at least temporarily, they are now staying deportations even of those with criminal records who are ineligible for the status under Obama's system. The illegal alien has now violated the terms of his release and faces yet another court appearance next week.

Once again, we have Trump-appointed judges who not only decline to roll back existing bad decisions but will even add new insane principles to our body of case law that downright conflict with past Supreme Court precedent. Guess what: Judge Kelly is the same man who ruled in 2018 that political activist Jim Acosta had a right to a press badge to access the White House. This judge seems to be confused about fundamental rights, standing in court, and what exactly defines a judicial case or controversy.

Until we declare these court opinions null and void for violating separation of powers, we will never have a sovereign republic. But in order to do that, we need elected officials in the other branches of government who believe in the rule of law and the Constitution. That will not happen under this Republican Party and certainly not under its judicial appointments.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-florida-gov-desantis-leads-as-other-republican-governors-drag-their-feet,2020-07-01
Horowitz: GOP wins big. Now what?,"The political pendulum will continue swinging back and forth every 4-6 years, but the policies will inexorably march leftward if we continue doing nothing to convert election victories into enduring policy outcomes.

Anyone asking how Tuesday night's stunning election results will affect the race for control of Congress in a year from now is pondering the wrong question. The more salient question is how the GOP gubernatorial and state legislative victories will bear on other GOP governors and legislatures in states where they already command strong majorities right now.

We can't wait until January 2023 or January 2025 for relief from COVID fascism, genocidal COVID treatment policies, denial of health care freedom, open borders, irresponsible refugee resettlement, rampant crime, and a return to gender sanity and traditional American values in our society and schools. The lesson from this week is that if Republicans can win in Virginia and New Jersey because of some of the aforementioned issues, that means they have no excuse not to immediately act upon all of these issues without any diffidence, equivocation, or compromise in all of the states where they already enjoy long-term control.

Although the issue of education, particularly school board decisions on transgenderism in Loudoun County and critical race theory across the state, loomed large in Virginia, it wasn't any single issue that drove what was clearly a national wave. Republicans won races in places like Seattle and Long Island, and a truck driver who spent less than $200 on his campaign defeated the most powerful man in the New Jersey legislature, while a little-known candidate came within inches of unseating Governor Phil Murphy. Republicans flipped a Biden+14 legislative seat in Texas, a number of Soros prosecutor candidates were defeated throughout the country, and five anti-police incumbents were swept out of the Minneapolis city council. This was a clear rebellion by the voters against all of the chaos and tyranny created by the confluence of numerous odious policies foisted upon us by the elites.

But the question is what Republicans should do with the mandate clearly handed to them by the voters. The definition of insanity is repeating the same cycle of failed policies and strategies over and over again and expecting a different result. We were in this very position in November 2009 when Republicans won big against Obama's radicalism in what became a harbinger for the Tea Party wave a year later. Then, we were told the House was not enough because they needed the Senate. Then they needed the White House. Then, in 2016, they won the federal trifecta. Not only did they do nothing with the power, but COVID fascism, which essentially remade our Constitution and way of life, began on their watch. Today's level of tyranny, spending, dependency, inflation, crime, illegal immigration, and social rotgut makes 2009 look like the Reagan era.

As such, anyone who thinks Republicans winning a narrow RINO majority in Washington next year is going to make a difference was born yesterday or somehow doesn't feel the pain of the average American. Besides, we can't wait another day, much less until January 2023, to save our children from an imminent injection into their bodies, to save jobs and careers from being destroyed, and to save lives from a virus likely created by the very entities blocking lifesaving treatment against it. We need action NOW.

Despite losing the 2020 elections, Republicans already dominate in many state governments over and beyond their historical baseline, and this is even before what will likely be a wave election a year from now. Republicans will now control 28 governorships, 31 states with both chambers, 23 trifectas, and 19 trifectas with supermajorities in both houses. COVID fascism, in particular, began with states governments. It can and must end with those same state governments. We don't need control of the federal government to change these policies in the states, nor can we afford to wait (and nor will it help anyway).

Yet even in most deep red states, we have Republican governors and legislative leaders who either support the dangerous vaccines and other aspects of the ""COVID religion"" or are somehow too scared to finally take a stand against the bio-medical security establishment and the powerful special interests representing this leviathan. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has wavered over signing a compromise bill against vaccine mandates overwhelmingly passed out of the legislatures, and Tennessee is the only state that even passed such a bill out of all the trifectas! We can't get governors in states like Idaho and Alabama to combat the mandates, and even in Iowa, where Gov. Kim Reynolds has generally been more level-headed on this issue, she continues to push the already debunked premise that the shots are safe and ""the best defense"" against the virus.

Ironically, with some of the cultural issues that Glenn Youngkin successfully leaned heavily into while campaigning in a blue state, too many Republicans in deep red states are downright on the other side! For example, we couldn't even get governors like Asa Hutchinson in much more socially conservative Arkansas to ban chemical castration of minors. While Youngkin ran hard against the Soros de-incarceration agenda and parole boards releasing criminals, many southern governors continue to push that agenda and somehow use a perverted view of the Bible to justify it.

Thus, we must finally realize this election cycle that we have won nothing with an election. We have merely secured possession of the ball with zero points on our side of the scoreboard after the other side already ran up the score to near-insurmountable margins. Now is the time to make the plays – big plays.

On Tuesday night, Republicans demonstrated that with the right message, they can make inroads even into blue-leaning areas on the East Coast. But what was also clear is that the ""country class"" voters are even more frantically anti-globalist and elitist than ever before. Youngkin blew out even Trump's historically strong showing in rural southwest Virginia while picking up lost suburban voters in Loudoun County, the Richmond suburbs, and the Tidewater area.

You know what looks a lot like southwest Virginia? Places like Idaho, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Tennessee. The question all voters fed up with the unprecedented tyranny from the federal government should be asking is: If Youngkin can win in Virginia, why are deep red state governors and legislatures not immediately convening to counter every one of these policies emanating from the Biden administration? As I speak with legislators in supermajority GOP states, all I hear is a defeatist attitude of, ""This is the best we can do with the leadership we have."" But why? If our message now resonates even in New Jersey, then most certainly we can push a no-holds-barred agenda against this administration and nullify every one of the unlawful policies without any need to work with Democrats.



As always, the GOP candidate victory speeches were full of optimism and broad platitudes on apple pie, American dream bromides, and general tropes about freedom and liberty. But when it comes to the specific policy outcomes that actually matter, the Democrats continue to succeed, largely because Republicans agree with the foundational premise of most of those policies, while opposing a few of the most extreme manifestations of it. It's time for voters to demand immediate policy changes in any state where Republicans control government, including, but not limited to, the following:

A complete cessation of all ""criminal justice reform,"" the de-incarceration agenda that most GOP governors have bought into. It's time to get tough on crime again by increasing sentences for violent offenders and limiting bail.

A big theme of the Virginia campaigns was safe and secure communities. Republicans must promise to block refugee resettlement in their respective states, as thousands of unvetted Afghans are being dumped into our communities with no regard for the safety and culture of those areas.

An immediate special session on COVID, in which all the funding and policies of COVID are shifted away from the failed vaccines and social control and toward early treatment, along with a complete ban on all mandates – no exceptions.

An immediate prohibition on castration of minors, men in female sports, and men in female bathrooms, as well as a clear protection against any institution from having to perform unethical and medically damaging transgender ""surgeries.""

A categorical ban on all critical race theory in all states and replacing it with a curriculum built upon the 1776 Curriculum.

Every GOP state should, within the same week, pass an interposition bill, which empowers the legislature to ban the enforcement of any federal policies that violates the Constitution, the same way New York Democrats made it a felony to enforce immigration law or work with ICE during the Trump administration.

During the 1993 Super Bowl, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett famously celebrated before he got the ball in the end zone, only to have the ball stripped from him by Buffalo Bills wide receiver Don Beebe. In that case, the Cowboys already had a massive lead, so the Leon Lett blunder was merely symbolic. But in our case, we are the ones losing big-time and cannot afford to showboat before we get the ball in the end zone.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-good-judges-think-again-trump-appointee-blocks-key-trump-immigration-policy,2021-11-04
Horowitz: Governors and legislatures must declare war on the CDC,"All Republican governors claim they support limited government and will stand up to the tyrannical feds. Well, now is their time to shine.

The CDC announced a return to the failed masking recommendations after the shots it continues to push apparently didn't do the job. Most shockingly, it announced a recommendation that all children – whether they got the shots or not – should wear a mask indefinitely all day in school.

This is a watershed moment in American history. The CDC is now recommending an illogical, inhumane, immoral, and illegal policy that in any other era would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and would be considered child abuse. The response of the states should be an emphatic ""Hell no!""

The CDC is using the ""scariant"" Delta as an excuse to give people the impression that suddenly children are at risk for the virus. Well, the U.K. has just gotten over the curve of the Delta wave, so its data is likely to be very instructive as to what we should expect in the next few weeks. As U.K. Dr. Alasdair Munro, a pediatric infectious disease researcher, observed, children 2-11 actually experienced the lowest case rate during the Delta wave as compared to young adults who were eligible for the vaccine. Obviously, almost all those remaining cases were very mild.

Perhaps most ironic is that the U.K.'s case count peaked on July 19, ""Freedom Day,"" when all restrictions and mask mandates ended. Cases have dropped precipitously every day since then and are now down 50% in one week. As we have witnessed in every corner of the world since the beginning of the pandemic — Delta being no different — nothing has worked to stop the inexorable six- to eight-week waves, and nothing works to restart the spread when its seasonal spread is done in a given area. It's 100% natural. But now, even the establishment can no longer deny it. As professor Oliver Johnson of Bristol University observed in the U.K. Spectator, ""For the first time in 18 months, there's been a fall in cases that can't be easily explained by a national lockdown.""

Of course, here in the United States we have seen this trend for months, especially this past spring, when cases in the South plummeted for weeks after they ditched the mask mandates but rose quickly in the Northeast and Michigan with impervious mask mandates.

As much as masks don't work to stop the spread of COVID (especially an even more transmissible form), to force children to bear the brunt of the mandate by wearing the sacred cloth all day in school is unconscionable. Just how big a waste were the quarantines of children last year? According to a recent Oxford study, out of the millions of children who were forced to isolate because a child tested positive for a virus milder to them than the flu, 98.4% of U.K. children never went on to develop COVID. All of that child abuse was for nothing.



Now the CDC is seeking to reinstate its child abuse without performing any randomized controlled trials on the efficacy or safety of masks, after it rejected the findings of the only studies that actually looked at those questions and raised serious concerns.

Will red states allow the CDC to continue this child abuse for another year? Well, it's in their power to say no. Several governors, including from Florida, Texas, South Dakota, South Carolina, Nebraska, and Iowa, have already said this mandate is a non-starter in their states, but given the prominence of the CDC, I fear more emphatic and broader actions are required. State legislatures should immediately convene and pass the following:



A law barring the implementation of the CDC's mask mandate in any public or private setting. Private institutions are forced to abide by OSHA, ADA, and anti-discrimination, as well as health privacy laws in every other context. Why should they be exempt the one time such mandates are clearly being driven by the government and not the free market?

A law designating forced masking of children as reckless child endangerment, subject to any civil or criminal penalties pursuant to their respective state statutes.

Guidance for their respective departments of health to reject every policy of HHS that is built upon the faulty science of masking, the existing shots, test and trace, and the use of ineffective treatments such as remdesivir. All state COVID funding should be eliminated from enforcing, marketing, or advertising any policy the legislature deems unlawful or unscientific.

Guidance to administer ivermectin to those in need or to make it available over the counter.

It's for this very moment that our founders believed our federalist system would help deter a national tyranny. In Federalist 46, Madison envisioned state interposition against federal tyranny:

The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.

Even Hamilton, a strong proponent of a strong federal government, wrote in Federalist 26 that the state legislatures will lead the charge against federal tyranny:

The State legislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to sound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if necessary, the ARM of their discontent.

Now is the time for all these red-state Republicans to stand up and be counted. Will they stand for human life, the Constitution, and the health and dignity of our children? Or will they stand for a double-speaking, power-hungry, attention-seeking fool who has articulated less scientific acumen than a toddler?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-gop-wins-big-now-what,2021-07-28
Horowitz: Governors have an obligation to rescind deployment of National Guard,"When our border was under assault by the drug cartels and human smugglers, the entire political class, media, and governors opposed the deployment of the National Guard to defend the sovereignty of the union. When cities were burning out of control night after night, they opposed using the military to stanch the bleeding in the streets. Now, these same people seem OK with 25,000 troops being paraded around in D.C. and in some state capitals with no end in sight. Worse, the military is being purged of ""far-right extremists,"" and it wouldn't be surprising to learn that that encompasses all Trump supporters.

Where is this coming from, and where is this headed? That is the question all GOP governors should be asking – a question that should prompt them to immediately rescind the deployment order.

Why are we suddenly ""vetting"" our own soldiers in order to perform a ""mission"" in a way that appears to be an ideological litmus test? How long will these soldiers remain? These are the questions governors must ask before they sign off on indefinite deployment of their state's Guard.

""These are vetting efforts that identify any questionable behavior in the past, or any potential link to questionable behavior, not just related to extremism ... we're not asking questions right now,"" said Jonathan Hoffman, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. He noted that they are not even asking questions, but ""out of abundance of caution taking action and immediately removing them from the line,"" in describing the purging of people while looking at their history and social media.

And as has been the case throughout the COVID restrictions, they are encouraging fellow Guard members to report one another.



Objectively speaking, what does this look like to you? Where have we seen this throughout history?

Put another way, can you imagine if these comments were made and these actions taken in support of Trump's inauguration four years ago?

What is going on today is as shocking as it is chilling. What is even more shocking is the silence from most GOP governors who sent national guardsman to D.C. Texas Governor Greg Abbott expressed concern about the ideological litmus test, but only threatened to cut off cooperation in the future. He needs to go a step farther and commit to cutting off soldiers now until the purge stops and until there is a timeline and a justification given for keeping the soldiers there.

The thousands of people pouring over our border in 2019 were unmistakable. Plus, protecting our border is what our Founders had in mind as the purview of the military. Yet, the New Mexico governor pulled the National Guard from her own border with Mexico while facing a crisis of human and drug smuggling and is now sending them to D.C. for Biden's military junta.

Keeping soldiers in our cities with no prima facie violence occurring anywhere is a recipe for a military junta-style government, absent the feds sharing legitimate intelligence with these governors justifying these unprecedented moves.

The purging is not just about taking these soldiers off this particular mission. It's inconceivable that once they are flagged for concern and disqualified from duty at the inauguration (and beyond?), this will not be a black mark on their careers forever. Governors need to stand up for their guardsmen.

Two weeks after the Capitol attack with zero evidence of any residual violence on the streets, why is D.C. a military zone and why are some state capitals following suit? Just this Monday, 11 NYPD officers were injured in a Black Lives Matter riot, yet the American people haven't even heard about it. When BLM was burning D.C. night after night, and after 60 Secret Service agents were injured at an attack near the White House, Pelosi lambasted Trump for using the military, even though he only used it when the violence was out of control.

""We are concerned about the increased militarization and lack of clarity that may increase chaos. I am writing to request a full list of the agencies involved and clarifications of the roles and responsibilities of the troops and federal law enforcement resources operating in the city,"" Pelosi wrote in a letter to President Trump on June 4, 2020. ""Congress and the American people need to know who is in charge, what is the chain of command, what is the mission, and by what authority is the National Guard from other states operating in the capital.""

Joe Biden accused Trump of ""preening and sweeping away all the guardrails that have long protected our democracy.""

Which guardrails? Military loyalty to one party? Full censorship of any opposition? Banning protests and access to elected officials? Muzzling us with masks and lockdowns?

Now that the military is being used in greater numbers without clarity of a time limit for a speculative threat that is not evident on the streets – and they are engaging in the most comprehensive vetting of soldiers ever – why aren't Republican governors raising similar concerns? Mitt Romney criticized Trump for using the military when D.C. was on fire. Where is he now?

Ultimately, it is up to the governors to put an end to this charade. Every one of them needs to ask what they would do if Trump had surrounded himself with 25,000 troops and destroyed the military careers of anyone who supported Hillary Clinton.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-governors-and-legislatures-must-declare-war-on-the-cdc,2021-01-20
Horowitz: House Republicans should all resign their committee assignments and create their own,"Congress doesn't govern any more. The executive and judicial branches control every aspect of our lives, and Congress only exists to virtue-signal and sign off on the president's insane budget without holding him accounting for power-grabs. This is true of both parties when they have control of either Congress or the White House. Yet with Democrats violating basic constitutional and even human rights of the GOP minority, why not actually break off and form a much more powerful messaging operation, given that the existing Congress is all about talk?

While Congress gets to determine the rules and proceedings of its body with majority support, Democrats have now run the chamber in such a way that it violates at least the spirit of democratic representation of individual members of Congress. Representatives cannot speak without muzzles on their mouths; they are prevented from uttering a number of things thanks to new rules; and they are now frisked on their way into the chamber, which are all in violation of the prohibition in Article I Section 6 against detaining a congressman on the way to work.

Representatives have the right to talk, debate freely, and offer amendments. Article I Sec. 6 not only prevents them from being detained on the way to and from work, it also guarantees them the right to speak and debate freely. Some might find their speech repugnant, but that is what elections are for.

This principle has been completely abrogated by the new rules of this Congress. Now, they are picking members they don't like and throwing them off committees, even though they were duly elected by the people. Well, committees don't do any work anyway. Nor can they offer amendments on the floor. All the important legislation that actually affects our future is crafted behind closed doors by lobbyists and executive branch officials and is either ensconced in a budget bill or an emergency bill, which is then voted on within hours of being introduced.

So, what is the point of the GOP members remaining in the House as a minority only to suffer abuse and humiliation without even being able to investigate, propose amendments, and use their voices?

There is nothing in the Constitution prohibiting them from simply breaking off and refusing to show up, opting instead to form their own shadow Congress. No, they will not conduct votes, and obviously will wield no constitutional authority, but as mentioned, this is essentially what the real Congress does anyway. It's all about social media virtue-signaling. Their voices matter so much more than their votes, given our broken structure of government. So why not use their voices when and where they can actually talk freely?

They should divide members into shadow committees and hold fact-finding field hearings with guests to educate the public on the threat to civil liberties posed by COVID fascism, the two-tiered justice system, illegal immigration, and rampant crime, just to name a few issues. Rather than the same boring C-SPAN video, people would be able to view on a platform like Rumble an array of exciting guests and witnesses. Again, it would have no legal grounding, but everything that goes on in Congress anyway is nothing but showboating. So why not do a better job of it?

Nothing is stopping Republicans from putting out reports, broadcasting hearings, posting speeches, and giving voice to the concerns of their constituents. Democrats, with their majority, will do what they want anyway and always have the votes to pass anything. If they want to run the House like a dictatorship, why not let them have their fiefdom and show the American people their unvarnished radicalism without the Republicans as a distraction?

This is not cutting and running. Democrats have declared war on Republicans by kicking Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off committees, a precedent that will not end with her. They are openly discussing banning members outright. So why play in their rigged system and get humiliated? Republican members should use their voices as private citizens, with the notoriety of elected officials, to augment the voices of their constituents more effectively.

A sane Republican Party would resign all committee posts in protest, regardless of what they think of Taylor Greene personally. This is a body that hosts members with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is a body that hosts Rep. Alcee Hastings, who was one of the only federal judges in history to be removed through impeachment. In 1989, he was removed for a charge of taking a bribe in exchange for a lenient sentence. He was originally impeached by the House, which was then controlled by Democrats, by 413-3. Why isn't he thrown off committees?



Ilhan Omar made anti-Semitic insinuations and downplayed 9/11 — the exact same conspiracy theories Green is accused of parroting. Where is the censure vote or effort to strip her committee assignments? And speaking of committee assignments, Rep. Eric Swalwell is accused of being in bed – literally – with a Chinese spy, yet he not only sits on the Homeland Security and Intel committees, but is one of the Democrat impeachment managers!

Jerry Nadler, the current Judiciary Committee chair, secured a clemency for Susan Rosenberg, the woman who planted a bomb in this very Capitol in 1983. He is in charge of the law-and-order committee of this chamber that was bombed.

Some might suggest that in the case of Hastings, his Florida constituents knew about his history and still voted to elect him to Congress years later, and he therefore has a right to serve. I actually agree with that sentiment. But that should apply to Taylor Greene, too. We are not talking about new behavior in office. These comments she has made about conspiracy theories were well known. Either her constituents don't care, or they are so sick of fake Republicans going along with much more harmful conspiracy theories being peddled by clowns like Dr. Fauci that they would rather elect someone who believes in bizarre conspiracy theories but gives voice to them on the core issue than members who don't believe in those theories but give voice to bizarre conspiracy theories like lockdowns and masks stopping a virus. Either way, that is their constitutional right to vote for her as it is for Alcee Hasting, Ilhan Omar, and a number of other repugnant Democrats who are either corrupt, anti-Semitic, or racist.

Black Lives Matter and Antifa are rioting and promoting insurrection to this very day. They have destroyed more public and private property in one hour of rioting than right-wing criminals on January 6 and have killed many more people. Should every Democrat (and RINO) who has promoted BLM and Antifa be removed from Congress?

Either two must play the same game, or it's time to play our own game, and for once, make the Left react and play follow the leader. The sadistic double standard and two-tiered system is unsustainable.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-governors-have-an-obligation-to-rescind-deployment-of-national-guard,2021-02-05
Horowitz: How magical masks can achieve more than 100% efficacy,"Masks are so effective that they work even when they don't. You see, most non-pharmaceutical interventions are either effective or ineffective against this virus and can be judged based on the results. But when it comes to the unassailable majestic masks, they work so well that even when they don't work, they create more need to wear them, precisely because they don't work and there is still more work to be done. Confused?

In nearly every state and certainly every major city, we have seen the most dramatic social change of our lifetime with people walking around like mummies and bandits. It's unmistakable. Even violent criminals are complying with the mask mandate while committing crimes. I have not seen a single human being indoors in any store or institution in my state of Maryland without a mask since April. According to Carnegie Mellon's survey, there is 97% compliance statewide, yet it has not slowed the fall wave of coronavirus spread one iota.

This is true of most places, according to surveys done on mask compliance. On June 24, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said, ""When at least 80% of a population adopts universal masking, it results in a substantial reduction of infection."" What are the results with 93% compliance statewide and 95% in Las Vegas?

During the Sept. 29 presidential debate, Joe Biden said, ""If we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask."" To that end, he plans to implement a 100-day mask mandate. But, this has already been going on for longer than 100 days, and cases exploded rather than dropping by half.



One would expect that seven months later, we would no longer need to speculate about efficacy, calculate intangible projection models, or blow particles through a simulator or mannequins in a lab. We could just look at the actual real-life results we are supposedly trying to affect.

The problem with such an overview is that it would reveal that masks have failed to stop the spread one iota. By the very admission of those most fervently supporting lockdown policies, this fall has brought about the most widespread transmission of the virus to date. In fact, they are so frantic that in places like California, they are pushing new ideas … such as lockdowns and masks.

Well, actually, they are not such new ideas. Indeed, they have been wearing masks for over 150 days and have never fully come out of the original lockdown. Yet after cases have been relatively low there for months, they are now skyrocketing. The masks have been caught red-handed, just like in the Czech Republic and every other place that had a good result until they didn't!



The spread is so strong in Los Angeles County that it now has nearly twice as many cases per capita as Florida.





Florida already had a stronger wave in the summer, so there was more immune resistance among the population to the heavy fall wave of the virus. Whereas precisely because California had relatively few cases until recently, it is getting hit with a rapid transmission. But that is the broader point. This is all about regional seasonality and built-up immunity – 100% natural phenomena. The ""virus is gonna virus"" regardless of what we do. We can throw cloths on our faces as medieval superstitious sacraments to the gods of the masks, but that won't change the fact that the virus has its own natural trajectory.



The sophomoric and ephemeral COVID observations contrasting different states and countries are getting old. The media jumps on a specific area for having a lot of cases … until that area no longer does. The media lauds an area for having few cases … until that area gets slammed. Numerous states and countries went months without problems, despite limited non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing. Yet nobody used that fact against the mask cult. Then when it finally spread, the transmission is blamed on not wearing masks. Conversely, all the places that were wearing masks and did well initially were touted as displays of mask magic. Then, when the cases began to soar and they clamored for lockdowns and mask mandates, they suddenly forget those places already had mandates in place.

It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to realize that masks and lockdowns are not driving this ship. The areas that do worse later on are precisely the ones that fared better before. For reasons that are still unknown in some cases, it is simply their time to spread, but once their turns came, the fact that they had less built-up immunity made the subsequent spread even worse.



Population density also plays a big role in the timing, because the states out west with lower density got hit long after the denser eastern areas, so naturally the western states will get hit the hardest after the eastern states built up resistance for seven months while the western ones initially dodged the bullet.

One of my friends at RationalGround.com gave an eye-opening analysis on Twitter showing the near-perfect mechanical seasonal and geographic spread patterns of the virus since the spring, which demonstrates that time and place are the active ingredients even when individual states within the same region employed very divergent policies.





Rather than having the humility to acknowledge their fallibility in the face of this virus, California officials are doubling down on blaming people for not being compliant. But have you ever seen anyone in L.A. without a mask? According to Carnegie Mellon's daily tracking surveys through social media, 95% of people in California report wearing masks. That average includes the rural areas, so it's likely that in places like L.A. the compliance is closer to 100%. For people who would be most responsible for spread — those working indoors for hours at a time — there is almost no establishment that would allow the individual to work without a mask. It simply doesn't exist.



The simple fact is that the virus is spreading in California exponentially more than it did in March when nobody was wearing a mask. Does this mean masks are responsible for the spread? Not necessarily. It likely means now is a time for the virus to spread. It's all natural. But masks are not helping. However, they continue to accept the advice of Dr. Fauci to double down on a policy that has already failed to stop the sharpest spread.

The compliance for something this draconian is actually astounding. The mask cultists have gotten everything they wanted. And like everything made in China, the masks are not working. Now it's time for them to own the results.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-house-republicans-should-all-resign-their-committee-assignments-and-create-their-own,2020-12-09
Horowitz: How OSHA magically ‘evolved’ from years of its own research stating masks are not valid protection,"""Asbestos particles are on average 5 microns, which are much larger than SARS-CoV-2, yet nobody in my field – industrial hygiene – would recommend that we could protect workers from asbestos exposure using a mask,"" said Stephen Petty, a certified industrial hygienist and hazardous exposure expert, on my podcast last week. ""In fact, I would argue that you'd lose your credentials for saying such a thing.""

The notion that cheap cloth and surgical masks are considered proper protection, much less bona fide PPE, for a virus that is 0.1 microns – 1/50th the size of average asbestos fiber – was always absurd. And the fact that this virus spread for two entire subsequent waves after masks became universal, with zero evidence they played any role in altering the natural course of the virus – is proof of this universal fact that OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and other agencies that dealt with hazardous exposure always understood.



For respiratory protection, OSHA has the Respiratory Protection Standard — RPS (29 CFR 1910.134), which has strict prescriptive requirements for use of respirators. Masks are not part of the RPS because they cannot be fit-tested – and OSHA knows this. Only fitted respirators can help protect against particles anywhere near the size of viruses. A surgical mask is absolutely not considered PPE, and even if it were, it would work as well as a chain-link fence in front of swarming gnats.

Mask-wearing has become such a religious sacrament that people will place them on their toddlers for hours, they will exercise in them, and they will engage in all sorts of contradictory and absurd behavior that implicitly ascribes super-magical powers to cheap Chinese cloths. Yet few people remember what OSHA has said for years about the issue of masks and protection against viruses.

In order to remind a nation under an unfathomable psychosis of ""toxic maskulinity,"" here is your handy timeline of statements OSHA made about masks when the agency was actually trying to follow science and properly protect people, not engage in politics and virtue-signaling. As you read through it, you will understand why Ian Miller's more than 100 mask charts demonstrate that masks have never worked anywhere against this virus.

May 2009: OSHA Fact Sheet : Respiratory Infection Control: Respirators Versus Surgical Masks

While explaining that surgical masks only work for splashes or large droplets, OSHA made it clear: ""Surgical masks are not designed or certified to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants."" OSHA goes on to say: ""Their ability to filter small particles varies significantly based upon the type of material used to make the surgical mask, so they cannot be relied upon to protect workers against airborne infectious agents.""



December 16, 2009: Video : The Difference Between Respirators and Surgical Masks

In this video, the narrator says very emphatically, ""A surgical mask is not a respirator, and that's an important distinction for you and your employer to understand."" The video is targeted mainly at health care workers. ""Face masks are not designed or certified to seal tightly against your face or to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants."" The video also says: ""Remember, face masks are not considered respirators and they do not provide respiratory protection.""

January 2011: Respiratory Protection for Health Care Workers Training Video

OSHA again reiterates that while face masks, including surgical and medical procedure masks, protect against splashes, they ""are not designed or certified to seal tightly against your face or to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants"" (at 9:20). As the video shows arrows of contaminants getting around and through the mask, the narrator declares, ""During inhalation, small airborne contaminants pass through gaps between the face and the face mask and the material of the mask."" The narrator emphasizes again, ""Remember, face masks are not considered respirators and do not provide respiratory protection.""

May 2015: Hospital Respiratory Protection Program Toolkit

Per this 96-page resource for respirator program administrators, on the very first page, it states that it contains recommendations as well as descriptions of mandatory safety and health standards. These are intended to assist employers in providing a safe and healthful workplace. In this resource, OSHA indicates: ""Facemasks are not considered respiratory protection.""

December 20, 2017: OSHA letter from worker requesting clarification of OSHA's Respiratory Protection Standard

In response to a question by the writer as to whether surgical masks should be permitted on a voluntary basis when respiratory protection is not required, OSHA states: ""Surgical masks do not seal tightly to the wearer's face, nor do they provide a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles.""

April 2020: Ten Steps All Workplaces Can Take to Reduce Risk of Exposure to Coronavirus (a poster)

This was OSHA's initial guidance to employers on how to deal with the virus in the workplace. The agency recommend disinfecting the room and limiting the number of people, which is in line with long-standing protocol, but did not mention a word about masking , presumably because the idea of a mask blocking a virus would be absurd.

However, at some unknown point, OSHA placed a disclaimer on the top of this poster stating the following: ""Given the evolving nature of the pandemic, OSHA is in the process of reviewing and updating this document. These materials may no longer represent current OSHA recommendations and guidance. For the most up-to-date information, consult Protecting Workers Guidance.""

Clearly, those promulgating this material didn't want to show their work and accentuate the point that they never believed masks worked, but still had to broadly notify people that the science is ""evolving.""

January 29, 2021: Protecting Workers: Guidance on Mitigating and Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in the Workplace

Now, roughly eight months after mask-wearing became a national religion, they suddenly change their tune with this ""guidance,"" which appears to be updated periodically. Under the section ""What Workers Need to Know about COVID-19 Protections in the Workplace,"" this document states:

Face coverings are simple barriers to help prevent your respiratory droplets or aerosols from reaching others. Not all face coverings are the same; the CDC recommends that face coverings be made of at least two layers of a tightly woven breathable fabric, such as cotton, and should not have exhalation valves or vents.

The main function of a face covering is to protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms. Studies show that face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.

Although not their primary value, studies also show that face coverings can reduce wearers' risk of infection in certain circumstances, depending upon the face covering.

You should wear a face covering even if you do not feel sick. This is because people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people.

Notice carefully how they slipped in the word ""or aerosols"" in expressing the disproven assumption of mask efficacy, which stands in opposition to years of their own research, but then when they speak about the actual ""studies"" on efficacy, they only identify ""spray of droplets"" as the extent of effective protection from masks. Note also the ""emotional persuasion"" argument to falsely suggest you help others by wearing a mask, not yourself.

As anyone with a scintilla of logic recognizes, very few people, especially with everyone keeping so far away from each other, are spitting into each other's mouths with visible droplets that would be large enough for masks to block. In no way could such a rare occurrence account for the rapid spread of tens of millions of cases long after people wore the masks as regularly as pant and shirts.

Recently, Biden's former top epidemiologist, Michael Osterholm, joined a group of scientists criticizing the CDC for continuing to downplay aerosol transmission and not updating its indoor guidance based on this fact. But it was OSHA that said for years that masks absolutely do not work for aerosols.

As the FDA says on its website until this very day, masks do not work for airborne-transmitted viruses, only to ""block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter,"" which is not the primary transmission method of the virus. The FDA also says, ""Surgical masks are not intended to be used more than once,"" guidance rarely abided by as a result of the mask mandate.

Absurdly, on OSHA's ""evolving"" web page on ""Control and Prevention,"" the agency plainly recommends that workers ""wear cloth face coverings."" Buried deep down in the document, though, is a memorial to the pre-political scientific view: ""Surgical masks are not respirators and do not provide the same level of protection to workers as properly-fitted respirators. Cloth face coverings are also not acceptable substitutes for respirators.""

So they openly admit cloth masks are worthless, and then toss out an unverifiable throwaway line that surgical masks ""do not provide the same level of protection,"" when they know all too well that they provide no level of protection for the small aerosols, which are what really gets into people's lungs.

The fact that everyone universally understood this until last April, and the fact that every place that had an ironclad mask mandate in place for months with low cases, such as Los Angeles and the Czech Republic, yet still suffered from the most prolific spread in the world in later months, should make it clear that the long-standing guidance predating COVID politics is the authentic science.

Last June, after mask-wearing had already morphed into a budding religious cult, Cambridge and Greenwich Universities published a study predicting that universal mask-wearing would prevent a second wave. As Reuters explained their findings, ""Even homemade masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public.""



Well, it wasn't just ""enough"" people who wore them, but it became universal with the sternness of nothing we've ever seen before in society. Yet there were two more waves of the virus subsequently that were greater than the first wave, especially in the areas with strict lockdowns and mask-wearing. But to this day, they will look us in the face and say we need masks to prevent the fourth wave, as if the world began yesterday.

It's not merely a problem of collateral damage – in which government is forcing children to suffer long-term mental and physical health problems from prolonged mask-wearing in return for zero protection from the virus. It's that they are offering people who are legitimately vulnerable to the virus a false sense of security that masking will protect them indoors when they know quite well that anyone advocating this for other hazards as small in size as this virus would lose their job over such a recommendation.



As Stephen Petty said on my podcast, the way his profession always deals with exposure risks is to employ engineering controls, which include destruction, dilution, or containment. For a fraction of the cost we've spent on destroying and then subsidizing the entire economy, we could have focused on filtration systems or self-cleaning systems that would actually have protected people. Just as on the pharmaceutical side, our government focused on expensive and ineffective treatments rather than cheap established drugs and supplements that could have fortified most people against the virus, it likewise focused on lockdowns and masks as an illusory means of exposure protection rather than actually killing the virus.

How much science are our government officials willing to distort, and how many lives are they willing to sacrifice for an article of faith that has already been disproven by two uncontrolled waves after universal mask-wearing became a fundamentalist religion? Exactly as long as we allow it to continue.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-how-magical-masks-can-achieve-more-than-100-efficacy,2021-03-12
Horowitz: How Republicans can get rid of Trump for good,"It's become obvious over the past week that Republicans are uncontrollably desperate to rid themselves of Trump and disentangle their voters from his unflinching grip. They have been trying to do this for five years, but now they are willing to try anything and everything to accomplish their long-held goal. Unfortunately for them, they are ignoring the one way to actually get rid of Trump, opting instead for a tactic that will destroy themselves more directly than anything they have done until now.

The reason why voters are attached to Trump has nothing to do with Trump per se. It is rooted in what predated Trump. In fact, the very people who hate Trump the most today are the ones responsible for his rise.

The GOP has gone for three decades without representing any of the values or concerns of half the country. The more Republicans conspired with the left to destroy this country, the more radical the left became. The left has won so many fiscal and social fights without firing a shot that naturally it is proceeding immediately to the next step. In turn, the base voters became increasingly desperate for some sort of check and balance on the left's increasingly successful transformation of this country. Trump co-opted the sentiment of the time in 2015, and GOP voters jumped aboard. If you throw Ted Cruz into the mix, over 70% of primary voters chose two candidates abhorred by the entire party ruling class.

The mistake all these Republicans made is that rather than putting Trump out of business by offering voters a better and more effective version of that alternative vision they were looking for, they opted to make Trump a martyr. Rather than attacking the left even more skillfully than Trump, they reminded the voters that they couldn't care less for their concerns and only attacked the one man they perceived as at least speaking to their concerns.

Which brings us to this pivotal week. Republicans think they can get rid of Trump by impeaching and convicting him with a stipulation barring him from running for office again. But what that will do is terminate their own time in office, because they will lose 90% of their voters. They don't realize that, ironically, Trump served as a cover for them. You read that right. Trump's presence kept the base happier and at bay and, much to the chagrin of people like me, actually kept conservatives from primarying Republicans. In fact, Trump actually endorsed so many RINOs against conservative challengers that without his presence in the arena, base voters would have taken out their frustrations on those congressional Republicans. Now, Republicans are redirecting all the anger among the base that is represented by Trump and detonating it on themselves.

You know how they can get rid of Trump without committing suicide? They can ride out the next 10 days in silence and then use every lever of power to filibuster every legislation and every budget bill under the Biden administration.

They can pass election reform in all the states they control.

They can combat the sexual licentiousness movement at every turn.

They can declare the red states sanctuaries from COVID fascism, First Amendment violations, and federal overreach.

They can terminate all lockdowns and mask mandates in red states.

They can take all the states where they have supermajority control and turn those states into conservative versions of California.

They can tell the federal courts to butt out of state affairs now that they have shown themselves to be frauds by allowing blue states to violate the Constitution and election law.

They can immediately pass self-defense legislation, toughen sentences on violent criminals, and decriminalize over-zealous laws against peaceful citizens.

They can serve as beacons of freedom and asylum for patriots disenchanted with the debased culture and an irremediably broken federal government.

Were they to do these things — were they to unite all of their state and federal leaders behind fighting for such an agenda in word and deed — Trump would not only be outshined by other candidates, he would lose his non-electoral appeal and sway over the base. Indeed, Trump would lose more clout than he would were he to be removed by the Senate, without becoming a martyr to his voters.



So why wouldn't Republicans pursue this more auspicious path? Because the one thing they hate more than Trump is conservative values. They hate his voters more than the man himself. They would rather go to political hell while martyring Trump in the eyes of his voters than ascend to political heaven along with his voters while eliminating their supposed nemesis.

Unfortunately for them, there already is one Democrat Party, and there is no market for a second one. They will be the ones on the outside looking in.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-how-osha-magically-evolved-from-years-of-its-own-research-stating-masks-are-not-valid-protection,2021-01-13
Horowitz: How to break Pfizer’s pfascist grip on our country and our bodies,"We are no longer a democratic republic. Legislative bodies are missing in action. Nameless and faceless bureaucrats at the behest of Pfizer and similar companies now control our life, liberty, and property. The Pfizerocracy poses the greatest threat to our health, well-being, and liberty of any domestic threat in our history that came directly from government. With the federal government completely bought out by Pfizer and company, it's time for states to fill the vacuum.

There is quite literally nothing Pfizer can demand that our government will not indulge and, even worse, it will use the boot of government to endorse, promote, cajole, and now coerce the use of that product. Earlier this week, Pfizer put in its demand for ""booster"" authorization for all adults, a clear admission that its shots have failed, yet the approval is an outcome that will never be contested for a minute. And with that approval will come … you guessed it … a mandate for everyone with two Pfizer shots to get a third lest they be considered ""unvaccinated,"" just like in Israel, which has become Pfizer's private playground.

What's next? Can Pfizer take away our right to free speech? Speaking with a Washington D.C.-based think tank on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that those who spread ""misinformation"" about his product are ""criminals"" and ""have literally cost millions of lives.""

That's rich coming from the man who heads the company that had to pay out the largest criminal fine for health care fraud in history. Then again, the name of the game with the ""Great Reset"" and COVID fascism has been projection and blood libels whereby everything the other side does, they project upon their opponents.

One might laugh off comments from a man simply trying to protect billions in profit he made off this product, which is quite natural for any CEO engaging in a war of words against his opponents. But this is different. This is a man with the ability not only to get the government to endorse his product, but to get the government to inject it in your bodies and remove all existing safety protocols and guard rails. Later in the interview, Borula offered this bizarre and disquieting observation: ""The only thing that stands between the new way of life and the current way of life is, frankly, hesitancy to vaccinations.""



What exactly does ""new way of life"" mean? Again, we can dismiss his comments as being in line with a greedy CEO who thinks he runs the world. But the past 19 months demonstrate that he actually does run the world, so we need to pay attention when he suggests that anyone opposing his product is a criminal and is standing between humanity and a ""new way of life.""

Remember, not only can Pfizer get approved and mandated any unsafe vaccine it markets, the company is exempt from all liability. Just how deep does this exemption run? On February 4, 2020, the HHS secretary invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) to shield all manufactures of any diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19 from any degree of liability. What this means, according to the Congressional Research Service, is that not only are they immune to claims of negligence but even to claims of willful misconduct. There are numerous insurmountable hoops one has to jump through in order to sue for willful misconduct, and it can only occur if the DOJ or HHS, which are promoting the vaccine, first commits a legal action against them. So, asking the government to go after Pfizer is like asking the government to go after itself.

Consequently, even if, for example, the accusations of the whistleblower that Pfizer fabricated some of the trial data turned out to be true, we would have zero recourse against Pfizer. Thus, there is no market or legal force to ever make this vaccine safer and more effective, because the government has allowed Pfizer to play both provider and regulator all in one. This is a worse form of fascism than even traditional government totalitarianism.

It's time for conservatives to stand up to Pfizer's pfascism and demolish the channel between our government and this criminal enterprise. If the federal government is going to turn the keys of our republic over to Pfizer, then GOP-controlled states have an obligation to protect the American people by filling the regulatory and oversight void. Unfortunately, Pfizer donates millions a year to candidates, historically even more to Republicans. Pfizer donated more money last cycle than any other pharma company. Its total PAC and corporate donations at the federal and state levels totaled just shy of $9 million. In addition to donating over $1.5 million to congressional candidates, Pfizer also wrote checks to 1,048 individual candidates in state legislative races. That might explain why so many GOP-controlled states have been reluctant to push back against an assault on liberty that is worse than anything we've seen from traditional sources of government mandates in our lifetime.

This is Pfi$er PAC's end-of-year message for 2020:

It has been a year like no other, and we are proud of the all the hard work and long hours our colleagues dedicated and continue to dedicate to develop and deliver the first COVID-19 vaccine. As if COVID wasn't enough, 2020 was also a big election year and Pfizer and the Pfizer PAC continued to support candidates of both political parties who support policies that impact our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients' lives. We do not contribute to Presidential candidates or super PACs. In the 2020 cycle, Pfizer PAC and Pfizer Inc. supported 1,842 candidates and multiple political committees at all levels of the government. Forty-nine percent of the Pfizer PAC disbursements in the 2019-2020 cycle went to Republicans and 46% went to Democrats. We continue to advance our purpose to discover and deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives, thanks to our PAC members and our Pfizer U.S. Government Relations team, who are on the ground educating and engaging elected officials about Pfizer's purpose.

Yes, it certainly was a ""year like no other,"" where Pfizer worked our government like no other entity in an effort to ""change patients' lives.""

There is nothing more toxic than the contraindication between big pharma and big government. You can have each one separately, but having them together is like taking the Pfizer shot when you have blood clotting issues. If Republicans have truly reformed themselves and are ready to govern properly, they would pledge to the American people the following:

Every candidate and incumbent would swear off all funding from Pfizer, return any cashed checks, and pledge not to meet with any lobbyists working for the criminal enterprise.

All candidates would pledge to support legislation requiring two important conditions on any medical product authorized by government when those same agencies are simultaneously endorsing, funding, or actively promoting the product. 1) There must be a direct cause of action for consumers to sue for liability (with no caps) paid for by the government. 2) Authorization must be approved by a third-party entity that is devoid of any ties to either the manufacturer or the government agency. That is the only way to restore the Nuremberg principle of informed consent.

States must establish their own vaccine injury adverse reporting systems.

States must place liability on anyone mandating an FDA-approved medical device, even when the feds exempt the manufacturer itself from liability for injury

GOP federal candidates must agree to pass a bill to remove at least the full immunity from vaccine producers

Republicans won back Congress last decade on the promise to repeal Obamacare ""root and branch,"" a promise they broke. We must find a way to ensure that the child of Obamacare – corporate-government health care fascism – is torn out from our body politic, root and branch. That begins by attacking the source of the problem.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-how-republicans-can-get-rid-of-trump-for-good,2021-11-11
Horowitz: Idaho Gov. Brad Little thinks 60 days of dictatorial power are not enough for him,"Californians are flocking to Idaho to escape the collapse of their culture and freedoms and in search of liberty. There is even an entire movement to create ""Greater Idaho,"" which would encompass eastern portions of Washington and Oregon as well as northern California. Yet many of them will be disappointed to know that, thanks to leftist Republicans like Gov. Brad Little and some legislators, they as may as well stay put and suffer under Gavin Newsom with the warmer weather.

A year ago, I wrote an article titled, ""Governors, not gods: State executives cannot simply do whatever they want indefinitely,"" observing the shocking tyranny committed by governors who, as of April 20, 2020, had unilaterally vitiated our most basic human rights without legislative input for a full month. Little did I know that a year later, most of these governors, including Republicans like Brad Little, would continue exercising the power of a king indefinitely. Now Brad Little has successfully killed a bill that would ever place any meaningful limitations on his dictatorial powers. Who needs Gavin Newsom when you have Brad Little?

With today's transportation and communication, a governor should not be able to rule by emergency in a way that really alters people's lives for more than a day or two. We have legislatures for a reason. Yet SB 1136, which passed both chambers with overwhelming support, actually gives the governor 60 days to continue a declared emergency before requiring affirmative support from the legislature. The bill also states that the governor cannot unilaterally change state laws during the declared emergency. Sounds pretty generous, right? Sixty days of emergency declaration, and if it is really that compelling, the legislature would continue it. Yet Brad Little vetoed the bill because he believes in the rule of one man. He claimed that the bill would add ""more red tape and government bureaucracy."" Self-awareness is dead to these tyrants.

SB 1136 originally passed the House by 54-16, with four Republicans opposing it, and the Senate by 28-7, with all Republicans in support of the measure. That should have been enough to sustain a two-thirds majority veto override; however, the governor successfully flipped five Republicans in the Senate, netting just enough votes to sustain his veto. The Republicans who voted to make Little king were Jim Guthrie, Patti Anne Lodge, Fred Martin, Jim Patrick, and Jim Woodward. When it comes to this broken Republican Party, there is no majority large enough to uphold basic civil liberties as they existed before the pandemic.

The governor held a press conference last Friday with four former governors as well as Sen. Jim Risch to explain his veto. This demonstrates that the Republican Party in Idaho has been rotten to the core for years as conservatives have been complacent, not selecting authentic Republicans in the primaries.

The governor also vetoed HB 135, which, among other things, would bar the governor from quarantining the healthy, shutting down businesses and churches, and banning assembly. Idaho Gov. Little illegally barred assembly of more than 10 people for months, even longer than some blue states did. The House already voted to override Little's veto, but as of this writing, it's unclear whether the same senators who sided with the governor on SB 1136 will stay the course on HB 135.

It is truly shocking how a simple proposition banning the shutdown of businesses and churches and the quarantining of healthy people is now controversial in a red state. It is unfathomable that 60 days of unilateral emergency powers are not enough.

The governor had the nerve to suggest that the legislature acted out of ""an emotional knee-jerk reaction"" in standing for the Constitution, when it was he and his ilk who acted impetuously out of emotion to the virus. Thirteen months later, he has refused to look at the science. Little said he believes the legislature limiting his powers violates the state's constitution. That is really rich. This man violates every clause of the Bill of Rights, yet suddenly when the legislature tries to check that power, it is they who are violating the constitution!

Perhaps he should study Art. I Sec. II of the state's constitution:

All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit, and they have the right to alter, reform or abolish the same whenever they may deem it necessary; and no special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted that may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the legislature.

There are a number of other good bills that passed the House but are being blocked in the Senate by Little's phony Republican allies. Evidently, a 28-7 majority is not enough. Some of the bills that will likely die in the Senate are:

HB 339 – Bars all state and local officials from ever instituting a mask mandate.

HB 140 – Bars all companies from discriminating against people who don't get the experimental COVID vaccines and prohibits state officials from entering into public contracts with companies that do so.

HB 291 – A business bill of rights that precludes any layer of government from ever shutting businesses or revoking licenses for staying open.

HB 249 – Would require parents to have to opt in before the public school can teach any sex education.

Wouldn't one expect these bills to easily pass in a state like Idaho? Well, governors like Brad Little make states like Idaho blue without Democrats ever assuming power.

Brad Little is up for re-nomination next year as a Republican running for governor in a state Trump carried by 31 points. Local media reports that Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin might challenge Little for the GOP nomination. McGeachin has been openly campaigning against lockdowns since the beginning and seems to represent the values people expect from a state like Idaho.

Trump recently suggested that the key to winning for Republicans is to adopt his America-first agenda. Well, nothing more important was hatched in China to destroy America than the concept of lockdowns. Brad Little is antithetical to Trump's base and why people voted for him. McGeachin, on the other hand, was the first Republican in the state to support Trump and nominated him at the RNC convention for the state of Idaho. Thus, if she runs, Trump will have a bold choice to make in Idaho. Does he stand with the Fauci governors, or does he stand with MAGA governors like Ron DeSantis?



The difference between Republicans like Ron DeSantis who reject ""Fauciism"" and Republicans like Little who embrace it is greater than the difference between a Republican and a Democrat. If Trump really wants to make an impact on changing the Republican Party from Fauci to DeSantis, he will endorse against lockdown governors in every red state primary. Otherwise, his most ardent supporters will quite literally have nowhere to live as free Americans.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-how-to-break-pfizers-pfascist-grip-on-our-country-and-our-bodies,2021-04-23
Horowitz: Idaho conservatives poised to remake legislature like never before,"Idaho has long suffered a paradox, in that it is so dominated by Republicans that it is not so Republican at all. Because it is a de facto one-party state, many liberals who are well connected to the woke industries and lobbyists choose to run as Republicans and use their superior campaign cash to campaign as conservatives, the exact opposite of what they plan to do in office. This is why, despite a 58-12 majority in the House and a 28-7 majority in the Senate, conservatives rarely enjoy legislative wins that other red states are able to easily secure. Last night’s elections might have changed that in a big way.

Establishment Republican elites are crowing about their apparent victories in both the Pennsylvania Senate race and the Idaho gubernatorial race on Tuesday. Idaho Gov. Brad Little warded off a challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. However, when you get past the statewide elections, which require tremendous money and organization to make competitive – money true conservatives don’t have – we find a different story.

A total of 20 incumbent Republicans – 11 running for the Senate and nine running for the House – were defeated or poised to lose as of Tuesday night. A big part of these results is thanks to the work of the Idaho Freedom PAC, which actively recruited candidates against incumbents.

It’s truly hard to overstate the significance of this development. Thirteen of the 28 Republican senators didn’t stand for re-election. Out of the 15 remaining, nine were defeated, and several RINO House members seeking a Senate seat lost to conservatives. There is almost no parallel to that in recent history. While some of the races involved other quirks or were due to redistricting, and a few others were conservatives who were defeated by more ideologically ambiguous candidates, for the most part, conservatives downed many liberal Republicans and made gains in open seats.

Among the highlights were conservative Rep. Codi Galloway beating Sen. Fred Martin, the five-term Senate Health and Welfare Committee chair from Boise. Sen. Jim Patrick, who served five terms in the Senate and three in the House, was defeated by a conservative as well. He was chairman of the Senate Commerce & Human Resources Committee. Also, Rep. Greg Chaney, the outgoing chair of Judiciary, Rules & Administration in the House, lost his bid for a Senate seat, and Sen. Carl Crabtree, vice chair of the Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee, lost his seat.

Additionally, two conservatives who moved from California to seek freedom in the Gem State defeated prominent incumbents. Retired California firefighter Carl Bjerke took out Senate Health and Welfare Committee vice chair Sen. Peter Riggs. Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee co-chair Sen. Jeff Agenbroad was defeated by Brian Lenney, who moved his family from California to Nampa in 2010.

Even in a number of instances where the incumbent survived, the challengers came much closer than we usually see in statewide elections. Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Winder only won his race by about 640 votes. Now he will face a brand-new caucus that can possibly vote him out of leadership. Conservatives would have enjoyed an even better night if not for the fact that leadership drew several of them into the same district and forced them to compete with each other. This dynamic made the House results more of a wash, but the House was already fairly conservative. So, the fact that the Senate has caught up to it will give the legislature a lot of clout over Gov. Brad Little.

What this success at the legislative level demonstrates is that for lower offices, where the bar to entry is much lower in terms of financial needs, conservatives are on a much more level playing field.

Even in the statewide elections, there are signs that in the future, conservatives can sweep the state. Former Congressman Raul Labrador defeated a 22-year incumbent for attorney general. Conservatives also came within a hair of winning the office of secretary of state and only lost because of vote-splitting. Even for governor, Brad Little only secured 53% of the total vote. Had there been a runoff option, the race might have picked up more momentum and could have become contested. With less vote-splitting and slightly stronger candidates, conservatives can truly take over the state next time.

In other states, mainly in the South, where there are runoffs, conservatives have a stronger chance to compete statewide. Next week, conservatives have an opportunity to draw Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey into a runoff. One recent poll showed Ivey only garnering 40% of the vote, with socially conservative businessman Tim James in second place for a potential runoff. Vote-splitting has plagued conservatives for decades, and the institution of runoffs in more states would allow them to compete against the establishment without fear of dividing the vote of thinking voters.

The Idaho media cheer for liberal Republicans because they don’t really have Democrat horses to ride, but even they recognize the significance of the Idaho Freedom PAC’s work in changing the state’s politics. A bigger focus on state legislatures will pay great dividends in the future, and other states can mimic the work of the Idaho Freedom PAC.

Indeed, the trend of RINO chairmen losing their seats played out in other states on Tuesday night. Three RINO Kentucky House chairs lost their seats in northern Kentucky. Eight-term incumbent Adam Koenig, chairman of the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, was defeated by Steven Doan, a liberty candidate supported by Congressman Thomas Massie and state Rep. Savannah Maddox, a rising conservative star who might run for governor next year. Rep. Ed Massey, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from Hebron, and Rep. Sal Santoro, an eight-term incumbent and chairman of the Transportation Budget Committee, were also defeated.

In Pennsylvania, Rep. Stan Saylor of York County and Sen. Pat Browne of Lehigh County, both the House and Senate appropriations committee chairs respectively, were defeated by conservative challengers. Saylor had been in the House for 30 years. Republicans already have strong majorities in both houses, and if they can pick up the governorship with Doug Mastriano, a more conservative legislature can dramatically alter the political trajectory of the state.

So, what gives when it comes to 63% of the Pennsylvania Republicans voting for Mehmet Oz or Dave McCormick over the conservative favorite, Kathy Barnette? Very simple. They each raised close to $16 million and ran as solid conservatives, so the other challengers, including Kathy Barnette, were outgunned. On the other hand, Doug Mastriano, likely the most conservative in the gubernatorial field, won his primary in a landslide. In that case, there was no unified establishment candidate with endless sums of money to fool the voters.



Overall, conservatives would be wise to focus more on state and local races rather than federal races. Making red states red again and state legislatures great again will go a long way in divorcing ourselves from the morass of Washington. The RINOs can have the irremediably broken federal system, while we focus on rebuilding liberty in some of the states.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-idaho-gov-brad-little-thinks-60-days-of-dictatorial-power-is-not-enough-for-him,2022-05-19
Horowitz: Iowa conservatives introduce gold standard bill to fight the dangerous COVID mandate,"There is nothing free-market about ""private"" businesses joining in the violation of the Nuremberg Code. In fact, the entire concept of a rushed therapeutic that wanes quickly and causes a shocking number of known and unknown injuries never would have gotten off the ground under the free market. Socialism, subsidization, monopolization, government using taxpayer funding to create, market, coerce, censor, and reshape society with the shot — all the while being exempt from legal liability — are the only reasons why any business even under 100 employees, much less a larger business, would be mandating it at this point. The only effective, prudent, fair, and free-market position is to use equal and opposing force to restore the balance of the free market. It's show time for the state legislatures.

Legislative bodies throughout the country are meeting over the next few weeks to debate measures that would counter the mandates being illegally promulgated by the Biden administration. Most GOP-controlled states are going to take some form of action, but the question is whether they will take the right action or be intimidated by the visceral response of the big business and health care cartel that has become a giant arm of government tyranny. Several Iowa lawmakers have put together a bill that is the gold standard of what other red states should adopt this coming week.

The crux of the bill, Iowa SF 193, sponsored by Sens. Guth, Johnson, Schultz, Whiting, and Carlin, categorically bans all human rights violations in relation to ""Pfizer"" government mandates. It prohibits an employer from failing or refusing to hire, discharge, penalize, or otherwise discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment based on the employee's vaccination history or the refusal of the employee to receive a vaccine or provide proof of immunity. It provides a cause of action in court to anyone discriminated against, along with a prescribed remedy of back pay plus 10% from the employer.

This is what we do in the context of every other form of discrimination, including when employers legitimately terminate problematic workers. So, until we get rid of all those laws and the EEOC at the federal level, we don't need to hear about ""the free market.""

Next, rather than providing an exception to this rule for hospitals and health care settings, this bill specifically bans any discrimination against health care workers or discrimination on the treatment side for patients in a health care setting. It spells out every form of medical professional, including medical students and residents. Importantly, this bill bars any health care provider licensing authority from denying or revoking a license to any applicant because they decline the shot.

At this point, it is abundantly clear that the shots provide no more protection against transmission than not having the shots, which makes any form of any mandate unjustified, even if we are to believe one can govern another's body. For example, in health care settings, where health organizations are arguing that they must protect cancer patients who didn't get the shot, those patients are at least as likely to get the virus from a supposed vaccinated person as from an unvaccinated person, especially if the latter individual already had the virus. Moreover, research has consistently shown that people within 14 days of the first or second shot are the most vulnerable to catching COVID because of the suboptimal levels of antibodies. Having thousands of health care workers suddenly get the shots within a period of a few weeks would expose those patients to the most risk in health care settings.

Another important provision of the Iowa bill is that it bars all insurance companies from discriminating against those who don't get the shot. This means they cannot reject; deny; limit; cancel; refuse to renew; increase the premiums for; limit the amount, extent, or kind of coverage available to; or otherwise adversely affect eligibility or coverage for the group health policy, contract, or plan for health insurance.

We'd all love to live with a market in which any providers can offer any insurance plan they wish. But that ship sailed with Obamacare. The only things worse than full socialist mandates are half-manipulated mandates, which induce totalitarianism in addition to socialism. Thanks to Obamacare, we cannot start our own insurance companies because of the actuarily insolvent mandates. Yet the same government that pushed universal coverage now gets to manipulate the government-sponsored ""private"" monopoly companies to bar coverage for large groups of people based on zero scientific evidence. Repeal Obamacare, and then we will remove this provision. Until then, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

Next, the bill bars any owner or manager of a public accommodation from discriminating in services against someone who has not taken the shot. Again, this virus has been used as an excuse to prohibit all landowners from evicting anyone, including those who are disruptive, destructive, and late on rent. We will not allow the socialists to use their control over the ""private"" sector to suddenly encourage them to discriminate against people with no cause. I'm fine with ending most discrimination laws. But if we are going to have them, the worst outcome is for government to manipulate a perfectly perverse standard of who is subject to them and who is exempt from them. When businesses can deny services or employment to those with HIV or with certain sexual behaviors, or thwart Obamacare, Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank, OSHA, and ADA regulations, then come back to me about ""the private sector can do what they want.""

More provisions of SF 193 include the following:

A prohibition on including someone's immunization status on their driver's license.

Expansion of the exemption process for vaccine requirements in schools related to existing vaccines.

Anyone administering the vaccine must obtain written consent from the patient prior to reporting the administration of the vaccine or immunization to the statewide immunization registry.

At present, all private businesses over 100 employees are on the hook for a looming federal mandate to require a shot that the government has essentially created and manipulated with taxpayer funding that the free market never would have sustained. Both government and the pharmaceutical companies are exempt from liability. This is not free market; this is fascism. As such, for any state to merely pass a neutral law without providing equal and opposing force to prohibit (rather than exempt from) the federal mandate is not an exercise in free market ethos but in submission to totalitarianism.

How come none of these business and health organizations cried bloody murder about ""rights of the private sector"" when governors placed the ultimate regulation on them – a crippling shutdown or cumbersome capacity mandates? In this case, they are not regulating affirmative expensive compliance measures – just simply a dictate to apply existing discrimination and health privacy law to where it's needed most in order to counter Nuremberg violations by the federal government. Private business owners don't need to lift a finger and spend any time or money on this. Just don't harass your workers. ""Well, we're scared of COVID,"" they are saying. In that case, you have the shot, so what do you care about someone else not getting it?

The private sector or free market did not conjure up the riskiest and leakiest shot in history or mask-wearing; it was all induced by the federal government through fear, intimidation, misinformation, threats, and censorship. In the case of big business and health care, there has been downright collaboration with the federal government at every stage – a violation of the ultimate antitrust principles.



Therefore, every state has an obligation to interpose between the federal coercion and the safety of the people. Allowing every business in every state to remain a conduit for that federal tyranny is not respect for private rights. It's collaboration with a very dark tunnel of tyranny. We don't want to discover what's on the other side.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-idaho-legislature-conservatives,2021-10-15
Horowitz: Iowa passes the mask bill that every red state needs,"""Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body, and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages."" ~Supreme Court, Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health (1990)

""Breathing freely doesn't seem like something we should have to ask any other people permission for,"" said 10-year-old John in a now-viral video in front of the Martin County, Florida, school board. Well, Iowa has taken up that call and has now banned all school districts and local officials from ever instituting a mask mandate again. This should be a model in every red state.

Earlier this week, I called for all red states to pass ""never again"" legislation, ensuring that public health tyranny will never be attempted ever again by governors and mayors. The Iowa legislature has offered a model for doing so, at least for the masking issue. As part of a broader education tax credit package, the Iowa legislature passed HF 847 on Wednesday. It contains a provision barring all ""authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school"" from imposing a mask mandate on students and faculty. In addition, all cities and counties are precluded from forcing businesses to adopt a masking policy. The bill was signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds early Thursday morning.

""The state of Iowa is putting parents back in control of their child's education and taking greater steps to protect the rights of all Iowans to make their own health care decisions,"" said Gov. Reynolds. ""I am proud to be a governor of a state that values personal responsibility and individual liberties. I want to thank the Iowa Legislature for their quick work in bringing this bill to my desk so that it can be signed into law.""

It is shocking that not every red state has yet come to the realization that masking is immoral, especially for schoolchildren, and resolved to end the practice. Arkansas is the only other state to pass a statute forbidding future state and local mask mandates. Several governors have used executive orders to temporarily stop localities and school districts from requiring masks. North Dakota passed a bill (over Gov. Burgum's veto) blocking any statewide mask mandate in the future, but left local governments and school boards out of the ban. No other state appears to have taken precautions for the future.



Those precautions are absolutely necessary, because the mask cult is not over. Just yesterday, the CDC tweeted out a study warning about asymptomatic flu cases. Just a few days ago, Fauci suggested that mask-wearing could become the norm for flu season. Despite Fauci now admitting that asymptomatic transmission is ""very, very low,"" they continue to use it as an excuse to mask everyone. The CDC's latest trial balloon tweet should serve as a warning to all of us.

The notion of masking being effective against a virus is so absurd that cases plummeted over 90% after Iowa terminated masking in early February, even as cases rose in neighboring masked states in the Midwest like Minnesota.

Indeed, with zero evidence masks have ever worked and with Fauci now admitting that in a post-vaccination world, masking is all ""theater,"" to force someone to wear one is a violation of the First Amendment (in addition to the 14th Amendment) because it is compelling political speech. In Janice v. AFSCME, the Supreme Court observed, ""Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned.""



There is no greater example of compelling adherence to a cause than forcing someone to reduce their oxygen intake through the symbol of that cause. The fact that they place it over your mouth and shout, ""Virus!"" certainly makes it no better than forcing someone to wear a burka, a yarmulke, or a cross. If anything, the fact that it also covers one's breathing likely constitutes an illegal seizure, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Such a requirement must be subject to strict scrutiny, which would force the government to produce evidence that its religious symbol achieves any vital state interest and is the least restrictive manner of doing so.

It's not too late to permanently ban masks even in the states where the legislatures have already adjourned. Every state will convene a special session at the end of the summer to redraw the election maps based on the new census. That will be our last chance this year to permanently codify into law that breathing is a human right and must never be infringed upon ever again. The best time to kick the mask cult is while it is still down.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-iowa-conservatives-introduce-gold-standard-bill-to-fight-the-dangerous-covid-mandate,2021-05-21
Horowitz: Is Europe getting crushed by variant completely immune to COVID shots?,"With a 62.7% vaccination rate, Austria not only has a higher rate than the U.S., but most of the population has been vaccinated relatively recently, which should give those people better protection. Yet the country is experiencing its most prolific outbreak ever, as we are seeing across the globe, with a near-perfect inverse relationship between vaccination rates and COVID case rates. Now, Austria and other European countries are staring down the barrel of a completely new mutation, which German researchers believe might be completely immune to the vaccine-mediated antibodies.

According to Our World in Data, the Central European countries and the Baltic states currently have the highest case rates per capita in the world.

Most of them have higher case rates per million people than the U.S. ever had, but nearly all of them have recently been vaccinated. Slovenia now has over 1,300 cases per million, more than six times the rate in the U.S. Its vaccination rate is comparable to ours, except that most people were more recently vaccinated, which, if anything, should give them more immunity. Other Central and Eastern European states getting hammered have lower vaccination rates, but the Baltic states have higher rates. Then, of course, there is Ireland, with the highest vaccination rate in the EU, yet cases are surging, particularly in the parts of the country that have near 100% vaccination among adults.

We already know from the U.K. data, the most granular and continuous of all world data, that the vaccine has negative efficacy against cases and increasingly low efficacy against critical illness, as over 82% of all deaths are among the vaccinated, according to the most recent weekly report from the U.K. Health Security Agency data. Now, according to a new study, Europe is likely experiencing a wave of a new variant that is completely immune to all the shots, a wave that will make anyone in the U.S. who has not experienced prior infection and does not have a plan for early treatment susceptible to serious illness.

Trial Site News is reporting on a study from German and Czech researchers who conducted genomic analysis from samples in the border region between Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. They found that the predominant strain is no longer Delta. It is, in fact, a sublineage of the U.K.'s Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant, known as B.1.1.7, and is likely responsible for the rapid surge throughout Europe. They believe it is the predominant strain in the Czech Republic, Austria, and Slovakiaand that this mutant is ""3.2 fold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies as compared to other B.1.1.7 variants tested, indicating potential for immune evasion.""

The research was funded by the German Ministry of Health, and the lead researcher was Buqing Yi, Ph.D., of the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Virology, Carl Gustav Carus Hospital.

Ironically, Austria's Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg threatened the unvaccinated with a lockdown if cases continue to rise, even though they are likely rising because the vaccine created viral immune escape. Like the prophets of Baal in the Bible, the more these countries vaccinate and face an even more virulent virus, the more they cry out to the same failed gods and blame everyone else for their failures. In reality, as top vaccinologists like Geert Vanden Bossche and Luc Montagnier warned, mass vaccination with a narrow-spectrum vaccine that produces suboptimal antibodies is an obvious candidate for vaccine-mediated viral immune escape.

Denmark, with nearly all adults vaccinated, many of them more recently, is experiencing a surge and is now seeking to reinstate vaccine passports. When will these people ever take responsibility for their own failures rather than instigating a blood libel against those who clearly have nothing to do with the spread?

Just consider the fact that the case rates are much higher in every age group over 30 in the U.K. among the vaccinated. In the case of 40- to 49-year-olds, the case rate is 2.3 times higher among the vaccinated!

In Singapore, they are now saying that the government will not cover the cost of medical care for those without the shots, even though nearly all adults in the country are vaccinated. Yet despite that fact, they now have the worst surge ever, averaging what would be the equivalent of 800 deaths a day in the U.S. And that is high for Singapore, given the population's excellent health status and low obesity rates. The fact that this is much worse than ever before – following universal vaccination – is a clear indictment of the vaccine, yet that is what happens in a global blood libel.

The scary implication of this reality of record cases post-vaccination and new mutants completely immune to vaccine antibodies is that we are now forcing a dangerous vaccine that only has risk and almost zero benefit. Take Austria, for example, where the vaccines clearly are not working. According to Fact Sheet Austria, which downloaded excess death data straight from the government's sources, there has been a 33% increase in excess deaths through week 40 of this year for 15- to 24-year-old males and a 21% increase in deaths for 25- to 34-year-olds. It makes no sense to blame those deaths on the virus, because the number of COVID deaths in those age cohorts accounted for just a handful of people. Also, excess deaths among females in that age cohort were down.



Clearly this is another disturbing signal about possible cardiovascular issues among younger males who get the shots. Which would also explain why so many young male athletes are suddenly dropping like flies.

If we continue to follow the path of a failed vaccine-only strategy to this pandemic, we will wind up with a ton of excess deaths and no treatment for COVID when the shots fail. The question now is which will be the first state to change course from Pfi$er's greedy and selfish strategy that succeeds in nothing but lining its own pockets.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-iowa-passes-the-mask-bill-that-every-red-state-needs,2021-11-10
Horowitz: Marco Rubio made the best point about this week’s chaos. Now he should look in the mirror.,"Seldom has a politician diagnosed a problem more accurately and even clairvoyantly than Marco Rubio did on the Senate floor Wednesday night when he summed up the state of affairs in this country.

""Everybody in this country has lost their minds on politics,"" declared the senior senator from Florida. ""And we have forgotten that America is not a government. America's not a president. America's not a Congress.""

Listening to this, I was shouting amen!

""Let me tell you what America is,"" continued Rubio. ""America is your family. America's your faith. America's your community. That's America. That's what our adversaries don't understand, and that's what we need to remember. That is how we're going to rebuild this country and turn the page and have a future even brighter than our past.""

After that, I was so red-pilled, I felt like saying awoman!

Rubio is exactly right. In a constitutional republic, elections aren't even supposed to be the most important thing. Yes, if the leader from the other faction wins, he might conduct foreign policy in a way that you find repugnant or he might not share your values. Perhaps he might collect the garbage and build roads or spend money in a way you find to be imprudent or profligate. But in the American Republic we used to live in, he didn't rule over your lives, your business, your property, your family, your church, and your own bodily integrity.

That has all changed … thanks to politicians like Marco Rubio. There was a revolution, but it didn't occur on January 6, 2021; it occurred on March 16, 2020. That was the day we adopted ""15 days to flatten the curve,"" which has turned into 15 centuries to flatten our lives, families, and communities. There has never been anything in the history of this country that has affected our family, faith, and communities more than the COVID fascism promoted by Rubio and all of his acolytes in the unibrow political class.

Thanks to Rubio and phony Republicans being complacent and downright complicit in the sacking of our Bill of Rights, we no longer have the most basic rights we took for granted. Indeed, thanks to Marco, America IS INDEED government. There is no way to escape it. We can't even have our kids in private schools, and in some places where we can, they must be abused by wearing a subjugation cloth on their own bodies for seven hours a day. We can't smile at each other. We can't be together with community. We can't even be together with family. There is no end in sight for these autocratic edicts, even after the forced vaccination passports.

One's house was once regarded as an American castle, where we can escape from national turmoil and be with family and do what we want. Rubio believes the Constitution is suspended because he can shout COVID in a crowded theater. Now we can be arrested for having family over for Thanksgiving or, thanks to the sadistic hatred of fellow mankind imbued in us by the government, a neighbor will snitch on us.



Rubio could not have been more precise when he suggested America is not government. But he should have used the past tense. America was not government. Now, there is not a single thing government cannot do to us under the guise of COVID, and they are just getting warmed up. Business owners are crushed to the benefit of the large corporations, people can't earn a living, the suicide crisis is so bad that it is now claiming preteen children. God save us.

The mere existence of our being is now criminalized. They have criminalized breathing free air, earning a living, schooling our children, playing together with friends and community (that Rubio referred to as defining America). They have criminalized happiness and life itself so that we not only can no longer live as Americans, we can't live with basic human rights. Studies have shown that even rats become severely depressed when socially isolated. What is being done to our seniors in nursing homes with solitary confinement is a crime against humanity.

The mask cult, despite the utter fecklessness of its Chinese cloth idol, is so strong that its leaders have shredded all ADA and OSHA considerations of safety and disabilities. They are shoving them on the faces of crying two-year-old children on airplanes, even though children are not in danger nor are they vectors of spread – even assuming these things would magically work after failing for nine months. A German study of 25,000 mask-wearing children found that 68% of the parents reported impairments in their children: irritability, 60%; headache, 53%; difficulty concentrating, 50%; less happiness, 49%; malaise, 42%; impaired learning, 38%; fatigue, 37%.

The lockdowns and forced muzzling of Americans is both the greatest strategic mistake of a civilization and the gravest crime against humanity perpetrated by government.

Indeed, America has not only become government; humanity itself has become government. Not only hasn't Rubio fought this, he declared, ""Everyone should just wear a damn mask.""

Now, let's put aside the fact that everyone has been wearing ""a damn mask"" for nine months in most places, except for his home state, which is doing better than most states with masks. More broadly, how can Rubio look us in the eye and tell us America is not government, when he is using government to control our own breathing in the most literal and personal sense?

The answer is as clear as it disquieting and downright chilling. As C.S. Lewis warned, ""Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."" In his perverted elitist mind, everything the political class demands is exempted from constitutional constraints and doesn't count as control over our lives. In his mind, so long as we throw endless ""stimulus"" at people, they can live ""freely.""

After all, under Rubio's definition of faith, family, and community, America is not really about government, because our very essence is already controlled by it. Which is why were he to look in the mirror to examine the source of the acrimony in America today, he would only see his own mask.

Sen. Rubio, take a listen to what your own governor had to say about lockdowns:

THAT is what it looks like to decouple government from American life, faith, family, and community. THAT is what it looks like to have a Republican Party that provides an alternative to the Left that doesn't even involve Trump. Sadly, thanks to people like you, Ron DeSantis is just one in a hundred within the party. And that is exactly why we are at this precipice today.

Horowitz: Missouri county authorizes arrest of feds who violate Second Amendment,"What is our recourse when our own government criminalizes our most basic rights while it allows Black Lives Matter and Antifa to rampage through our streets with impunity? Is there no Plan B when the federal or state governments treat all conservatives like terrorists, business owners like pariahs, and those who yearn to breathe unmasked air like murderers? Well, one Missouri county is demonstrating the importance of sheriffs and county officials returning to self-government and interposing between the governmental usurpers and the most sacred rights of the people.

On Feb. 3, the Newton County, Missouri, Commission passed a bill that will not only block federal enforcement of unconstitutional gun policies, but criminalize their implantation thereof within the jurisdiction of the county. The ""Second Amendment Preservation Act of Newton County Missouri"" declares that ""all federal acts, laws, orders, rules, and regulations passed by the federal government and specifically any Presidential Administration whether past, present, or future, which infringe on the people's right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 23 of the Missouri Constitution shall be invalid in the county.""

That section of the Missouri constitution reads as follows:

That the right of every citizen to keep and bear arms, ammunition, and accessories typical to the normal function of such arms, in defense of his home, person, family and property, or when lawfully summoned in aid of the civil power, shall not be questioned. The rights guaranteed by this section shall be unalienable. Any restriction on these rights shall be subject to strict scrutiny and the state of Missouri shall be obligated to uphold these rights and shall under no circumstances decline to protect against their infringement.

Specifically, the ordinance targets federal policies that order the tracking or registering of firearms of ammunition, an idea that Democrats have been floating recently. It also bars the enforcement of any effort to confiscate guns except from those who are ""suspected criminals.""

The Second Amendment sanctuary movement has been growing throughout the country, with hundreds of counties passing some form of a declaration protecting gun rights from encroachments perpetrated by higher levels of government. The sanctuary movement has only recently come to the state of Missouri, with several counties recently declaring themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries and the state legislature pushing similar bills. But Newton County might have adopted the strongest language in the entire country – going so far as to criminalize enforcement or cooperation with federal law enforcement who seek to enforce such policies.

This is a takeoff of what states like New York did when they criminalized the cooperation between state and county government officials and Immigration and Customs Enforcement with regard to enforcement of federal immigration laws, even against illegal aliens with criminal records. The difference, of course, is that the Second Amendment sanctuary movement seeks to protect legitimate constitutional rights for Americans and, unlike the illegal alien sanctuary movement, does not harbor suspected criminals.

Specifically, section 4a of the Newton County ordinance grants the sheriff's department ""full authority to make an arrest of any and all federal agents that violate state laws and enforce regulations"" that violate the Second Amendment. Finally, the ordinance bars anyone ""who enforces or attempts to enforce any of the infringements identified in this ordinance"" from ""being hired as a law enforcement officer or to supervise law enforcement officers in the county.""



It is to be hoped that this will spawn a debate in the country over what citizens should do when the higher levels of government violate the very essence of the social compact by wielding one executive power after another to confiscate the most foundational of natural rights, including self-defense, free speech, property rights, and the right to breathe free air unrestrained, which absolutely is a natural right that predated any government.

The Newton ordinance was signed by commissioners Bill Reiboldt, Alan Cook, and David Osborn on Feb. 3 and is effective immediately.

While most sanctuary ordinances have thus far targeted Second Amendment violations, some counties have begun to pass sanctuary resolutions protecting local business owners and citizens from COVID restrictions that violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. SanctuaryCounties.com is a website that tracks the growing list of these sanctuary counties. Also, a group of listeners of my podcast have organized a network (Constitution Action Network) for people of the same state and county to meet, collaborate, and raise awareness of the power of state and local government to interpose against the growing list of blatant constitutional violations and extra-lawful lawmaking at the stroke of Biden's executive pen.

The left-wing sanctuary city politicians, while wrong on the policy and legal merits of their arguments, will likely rue the day they created this monster that will now serve as the only remaining beacon for patriots to protect legitimate rights of American citizens.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-marco-rubio-made-the-best-point-about-this-weeks-chaos-now-he-should-look-in-the-mirror,2021-02-08
Horowitz: Most important outcome of Dobbs decision? Making state legislatures great again,"It’s the body of government closest to the people, yet it’s the most forgotten, overshadowed, and weakened body in recent years. However, with the Dobbs opinion returning the power to regulate abortions to state legislatures, we now have the opportunity to focus our attention on legislative elections, sessions, and policies and settle our acerbic cultural and legal differences in the most prudent and democratic process.

We are an irrevocably divided nation, and it will only get worse over time. We can’t agree on the definition of a marriage, a woman, a citizen, a criminal, a fundamental right, or the purpose of our existence, much less the purpose of our government. We can either continue forging ahead with a winner-take-all approach to politics and have the federal executive bureaucracy – the least accountable and transparent branch of government and most distant from the people – decide every important political question. Or we settle those debates in state legislatures – the branch closest to the people where most members are elected every two years.

Whether you abhor abortion as murder or think it’s the greatest sacrament of virtue, the reality is that red states are going to ban abortions (many already have) and the blue states are going to obsessively expand access to them. Unlike the seven justices who initially banned all regulation of abortion in 1973, all those legislators in each state will be subject to removal every two or four years. For the most part, the legislators will vote in a way that reflects the values of the majority in their areas. This is the self-sorting process we’ve always needed. This dynamic needs to expand to every other important issue of our time. It’s not a perfect process, but it’s much better than where we are today, and it will allow us to live side by side harmoniously in a de facto amicable separation, albeit with shared custody over certain issues that are national in scope.

In the coming months, conservatives will be trained by their favorite Fox News media figures to obsess about the potential of a RINO takeover of Congress and the coming presidential election, even though the latter won’t even be relevant, policy-wise, until 2025. But the reality is that Republicans control trifecta supermajorities in a number of states today and will only expand that dominance next year. Come January, they have the ability to make those states de facto sanctuaries for our rights and values – if only we focus our pressure on elected state Republicans and educate them concerning the enormity of their power. It’s time to use it.

In his national design for governance, Madison explained the state vs. federal arrangement in Federalist #45 as follows: “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.”

Think about issues like COVID fascism and transgenderism. Internal order, liberties, and property, etc. – this can all be rectified at a state level. Anything outside war and foreign commerce is fair game. This is where conservatives failed to act during the lockdowns and COVID fascism. They should have activated the legislatures immediately and forced debate for the states to immediately reject the federal policies. It’s still not too late to change course.

In responding to the Biden administration’s immoral and illegal policies and edicts over the next two and a half years, conservatives should have a one-track mind and be singularly focused on how they can pressure their legislatures to interpose against the federal tyranny. Conservatives have long been distracted away from a state legislative focus, but perhaps the Democrats will teach them how it’s done. Believe me, the blue states will immediately take action and juice up funding for abortion while expanding its legal scope – perhaps even to after the birth of the baby.

Likewise, most GOP legislatures and attorneys general seem to have acted swiftly to immediately ban abortion at the first opportunity. But we now need to see this swiftness on other issues as well. For example, Biden’s Department of Education just promulgated a rule putting any school or university on the hook for sexual harassment if they don’t call men who think they are women by female pronouns. This is the sort of illegal federal regulation that states must immediately stop. Legislatures should instantly convene and block its implementation within their states.

The big problem we have in legislatures, though, is that so many of them are only in session for a few months a year. In states like Texas, they are only in session every other year. This means that, for example with COVID, when you have federal and state executive branches suspending the republic, we often have to wait months or years for legislatures to act. It was OK to have a part-time legislature when we had a part-time executive branch and the legislature was the only organ of government that legislated. However, now that the federal and state departments of health and education legislate 365 days a year without any checks or balances, the concept of a part-time legislature actually harms us.

As such, conservatives must begin pushing reforms to make it easier to call legislatures back into session, and it should not be tied to the whims of the governors. We don’t need state legislatures voting on bills all year, but we must reserve the prerogative to get them back into session at a moment’s notice to interpose against tyranny.



For years, Republicans have accumulated a ton of power in many states, have done nothing with it, and have failed to clean up their own cultural Marxist swamps within state-run agencies. Abortion was the only red line conservative voters established and held their elected representatives to. It succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. Now it’s time we harness that energy for issues like medical freedom, Pfizer liability, transgenderism, illegal immigration, crime, First Amendment protections, and interposition against the tyrannical Biden administration. What the Dobbs victory has clearly shown is that we will only enjoy the rights and policies commensurate with our desire to fight for them.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-missouri-county-authorizes-arrest-of-feds-who-violate-second-amendment,2022-06-27
"Horowitz: Murderer released on $15,000 bond as Jan. 6 protesters held indefinitely without bail","Behold the breadth of brazenness in our two-tiered justice system. In one America, we have career violent criminals released on low bail after murder and attempted murder, when the victim is terrified the criminal will attack again if not jailed. In the other America, we have Trump supporters arrested for nonviolent acts of ""trespassing"" upon public property when Capitol Police held the doors to the building open — yet they are kept in jail for months without bail, despite no criminal record.

Earlier this week, WMC-TV news in Memphis reported on Lachrisa Oliver, a Memphis woman who survived a shooting in March who must now deal with the release of the alleged perpetrators into her neighborhood headed into the trial. Tajuana and Teuana Ayers, along with an unnamed juvenile suspect, were arrested for a March 3 shooting that left Lachrisa in critical condition and her nephew dead on her doorstep. Shockingly, Tajuana and Teuana, despite the murder and attempted murder charges, were released on just $15,000 and $25,000 bonds respectively.

What's even more shocking is that Tajuana, 42, had a history of over a dozen arrests dating back to 2001, which included theft, aggravated assault, and attempted murder. During the alleged March murder, the suspect was actually out on bond for an attempted murder case when she was charged with shooting at a motorist after being involved in a car crash outside a Memphis high school in 2019.

It is the career violent criminals who face serious charges but are released on bail who are committing most of the murders in this country. Yet even after the murder, she was released on just $15,000 bond!

What's worse is that this is the ultimate case where the suspect needs to be taken off the street. Given that there is a surviving victim who will also be the main witness in the trial to identify the suspect in the murder case, this is a textbook case for holding the suspect without bail.

Oliver fears for her life and wants to move because the suspects live in the neighborhood. ""I do not sleep. I don't sleep. I don't eat. I don't do anything. I'm tired of being locked up here. It's not fair,"" said Oliver.

Now, with this case fresh in your mind, let's travel back to Jan. 6. Tim Hale is a Navy Reservist who attended the Stop the Steal rally at the Capitol dressed in a suit and without a weapon. The court opinion denying his appeal to be released admits that he never engaged in violence. They have nothing but a statement from a ""confidential human source"" stating he admitted to having merely been in the Capitol building and left after the shooting of Ashli Babbitt.

Unlike in the case of Tajuana Ayers and thousands of career violent murder suspects, Hale is in the military with a security clearance, is employed with no criminal record, poses no general threat or threat to an individual victim, and is not accused of anything more than being in the Capitol. Yet his motion for release was denied this week, meaning he will remain imprisoned indefinitely without the chance of posting bail.



The court admitted that it is unprecedented to hold Hale, but cited his ""history of racist and violent language and the fact that he is been generally engaged in hateful conduct"" as pretext for violating the principle, ""We don't normally penalize people for what they say.""

In other words, if you say the election was stolen, you are held without bail, but if you actually are accused of murder after racking up a 20-year criminal history and having no stable job keeping you in place for trial, you are let go on low bail.

In Hale's case, the D.C. appeals court cited his use of Thomas Jefferson's quotes about watering the tree of liberty with revolution from time to time as proof he was a danger to the community, despite his record, his military service, and his job as a contractor at Naval Weapons Station Earle. Prior aggravated assaults and shootings, though, do not count as evidence of a pretrial threat, of course, if the accused is of the right ilk.

We no longer live in a republic with equal justice under the law. Under our long-standing English common law tradition, setting various levels of bail was the best way to balance the freedom of those presumed innocent unless proven guilty with the concern of public safety. While suspects have the opportunity to remain out of jail pending trial, they also have a strong incentive to show up for trial or risk loss of property. Moreover, the commercial bondsmen have an extra incentive to help ensure a flight risk is apprehended and brought to trial. Donald Verrilli, Obama's solicitor general, said it well in 1982: ""Bail acts as a reconciling mechanism to accommodate both the defendant's interest in pretrial liberty and society's interest in assuring the defendant's presence at trial.""



But we now live with a justice system that places society at risk by releasing the most violent criminals accused of heinous crimes with robust records of recidivism and absconding from trial while crushing pretrial liberty for those who hold the wrong viewpoints. Lady Justice is no longer blind; she has 20/20 vision and is staring at people like you and me with tunnel vision.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-most-important-outcome-of-dobbs,2021-07-09
Horowitz: New data show hospital levels not much worse than flu season,"""The surgeon explained to my husband he will have to wait at least three months for his surgery ... the hospitals need to keep beds open for Covid.""

Those are the words of a Maryland woman sent to author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson. They are the desperate pleas for sanity by voiceless citizens amid a panic by a health care system that is erring on the side of obliteration rather than caution.

From watching the news, one would come away with the impression that there has never been such a run on hospital bed space in the history of our country. The data, in fact, show that the general level of hospitalization is not that much higher than a flu season, even in hard-hit areas, and likely lower in other areas. Given that this virus has already boxed out the flu for this season and that its peak virulence is only six to eight weeks in a given area, the panic is not only unjustified, but harmful to patients with other ailments.

Justin Hart, co-founder of COVID data website RationalGround.com, posted a fascinating analysis showing that the burden on hospitals is likely not much more than a typical flu season. Using data from the American Hospital Association data hub and the HHS Protect Public Data Hub, he was able to compare the current hospitalization level (Nov. 1-Nov. 9) to the average level over the three-year period from 2016 through 2018.

The result is that nationwide there is only a 4.7% increase above the three-year average level. Thus, we have destroyed our economy, mental health, other health care, and the future of our children for a level of hospitalization that is within the historic norms. And that is assuming that these draconian restrictions have any effect on reducing hospitalizations, which they clearly don't.



Now consider the fact that the 477,000-average number of hospital beds in use is taken from a three-year average of all 365 days in the year, which includes the non-flu season. I couldn't find data on the flu season hospital levels by day, but it's safe to say that if current levels are only 4.7% higher than the normal average, they can't be too much higher (or higher at all) than the peak of a typical flu season.

It is true that in some states, there has been a double-digit increase in the percentage of beds in use over the average, but those are states that have never gotten hit badly until now. In fact, in most of the states in the Great Plains and mountain West, they experienced lower-than-average hospitalizations throughout the pandemic. So, for them to experience 15%-30% increases at the worst six- to eight-week peak as they get their first major wave (as everyone will experience, regardless of their policies) is not exactly reflective of the pandemic of a millennium. During the peak weeks of the 2018 flu season, we clearly experienced those periods in some states, yet nobody even knew about it.

Also, given the fact that hospitals have surge capacity (plus $200 billion from the feds), even the increased numbers themselves are not a good measure of strain on hospitals. One has to look at the total percentage of beds in use as compared to the percentage during average times. Justin Hart calculated the percentage increase in bed capacity in use compared to the three-year average and found the numbers even lower:

Whereas the increase in raw number of beds in use is 4.7% over the three-year average, the increase in percentage of bed capacity in use is only 3.1%. Thus, as you can see, for all the panic in Utah and New Mexico, the percentage of bed space in use is actually lower than normal! And that is lower than the average period, not just the peak of a flu season.



These numbers might increase in the worst areas, but this is nothing like what is being sold to the public. So in Maryland, where we have a woman stating that her husband is being denied timely cancer surgery to free up bed space, the state is experiencing a 2.9% increase above average utilization, which likely means it's at least on par with the levels of the flu season. I've never heard of delaying cancer surgeries during the flu season, even though hospitals aren't given billions of dollars every flu season like they are today.

Finally, it's important to remember that this analysis is all predicated on a very liberal definition of a COVID hospitalization. During the flu season, we don't test every person who walks through the hospital — whether for a heart attack or trauma — for the flu. Plus, there is no incentive in medical billing reimbursements to code a patient as a flu patient as there is with coronavirus. Thus, the COVID-19 bed numbers are inflated relative to average flu numbers. By how much? Only two states — Iowa and North Dakota — publish data distinguishing those hospitalized because of COVID-19 from those hospitalized with the virus. Iowa's dashboard shows a 27% differential between those who come in because of the virus versus those who are added as a secondary diagnosis. If other states have even a 10% differential, then we'd actually be below average levels in most states when isolating just those who are experiencing complications from the virus itself.



Perforce, if we are going to shut down our democratic republic and destroy a generation of life over hospitalization numbers, can we at least get an accurate picture of the situation on the ground – along with some evidence that these ""emergency measures"" actually work? Then again, while we have our life, liberty, and property destroyed under the guise of saving hospitals, somehow there is no problem bringing in Mexicans for the express purpose of occupying American hospital beds in El Paso. It's all in the science.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-murderer-released-on-15000-bond-as-jan-6-protesters-held-indefinitely-without-bail,2020-11-17
Horowitz: New Hampshire legislature as a shining star for medical freedom,"Two years into the travesty of COVID fascism, vaccine injury, and denial of appropriate treatment, what have the GOP-controlled legislative bodies done to protect our freedoms? Sadly, in most states they have done very little. But just as the Florida governor stands out as the only state executive willing to fully combat medical tyranny, the New Hampshire legislature appears to be the only body willing to fight for medical freedom without the support of the governor. “Live free or Die” appears to be more than an empty slogan in the Granite State.

With people still dying of COVID without effective treatment, the New Hampshire House became the first legislative body to pass a bill essentially allowing citizens to access ivermectin over the counter at a pharmacy. On Wednesday, by a vote of 183-159, the House approved HB 1022, legislation allowing pharmacists to make ivermectin available via standing order from a physician or nurse practitioner that allows a pharmacist to dispense a medication without an individual prescription. Most Republican states have failed to even pass a bill ensuring doctors don’t get punished for prescribing this safe, FDA-approved drug, yet New Hampshire Republicans managed to pass a bill enabling patients to ask for it over the counter.

All but two Republicans voted for HB 1022, and all but two Democrats opposed it. New Hampshire Republicans accomplished this with a simple majority, while most super-majority Republican states can’t seem to pass a medical freedom bill worthy of support. Legislatures I’ve spoken to in New Hampshire credit Dr. Paul Marik, a prominent ICU doctor, who gave an impassioned testimony on how this drug has helped him save so many patients sick with COVID.

The ivermectin bill wasn’t the only success this week for advocates of medical freedom. The New Hampshire House successfully passed the following bills seeking to redress the civil liberties issues from the past two years:

HB 1268: A ban on localities implementing mask mandates.

HB 1379: Repealing the health commissioner’s authority to add a vaccine to the school schedule of required shots.

HB 1439: Requiring hospitals to allow patients to have visitors in hospitals.

HB 1455: Prohibiting state enforcement of vaccine mandates and data collection.

HB 1495: Prohibiting the state and its political subdivisions from requiring a private business to have a vaccine mandate.

HB 1044: Allowing the creation of new health care facilities that only take direct payment, thereby bypassing the medical cartel, federal COVID restrictions, and other onerous federal regulations.

HB 1280: Prohibiting judges from using a parent’s refusal to vaccinate their child as basis for abridging parental rights.

HB 1606: To become the first state to require a patient to opt in to the vaccine registry in order for his or her vaccination status to be recorded.

HB 1131: Prohibits public schools from requiring masks to attend.

In other words, the New Hampshire House vaccinated the state against most future strains of the medical tyranny virus. When will other GOP legislatures get vaccinated? The Democrats have nearly been wiped off the map in states like Wyoming and South Dakota, yet the legislatures have failed to pass a single meaningful bill on medical freedom.

Three freshmen female representatives, Leah Cushman, Erica Layon, and Melissa Blasek, were instrumental in the push for medical freedom bills this session. After experiencing one disappointment after another in other states, I asked Blasek why she felt there was more success in New Hampshire than in other states with far superior GOP majorities. The young mother, who works as a music teacher and ran for office exclusively on fighting for medical freedom, told me that there were numerous factors at play.

“New Hampshire has a strong tradition of freedom, and the voters on both sides of the aisle tend to be wary of government intervention,” said Blasek. “It may have taken two years, but they’ve had it with the authoritarian response, and I think the politicians feel that.”

Blasek notes that usually the grassroots fail at first and then get discouraged, but in New Hampshire they came back the second session to retry bills that failed last year. “Activists have worked hard since the beginning of the pandemic to move the Overton window. Last year we did make a lot of progress ending the lockdown restrictions and reforming our state of emergency laws, but we failed at all attempts to block medical tyranny and the birth of the biomedical surveillance state. The activists persevered, did what they do best, and have continuously made their voices heard.”

She also credits the newly formed House Freedom Caucus, which was buttressed by representatives endorsed by Rebuild NH, an activist group she co-founded to fight the COVID response, for “making a lot of noise in the House and pushing the rest of the Republican caucus in this direction.” Blasek also notes that, unlike in other GOP-controlled bodies, “our leadership is liberty-minded and likely the best leadership anywhere in the country.”

From speaking with other legislators across the country, it is clear that most GOP leaders and committee chairs believe in our prevailing COVID policies just as fervently as the Democrats do.



Whether the New Hampshire Senate will pass the bills with as much support as the House is yet to be determined. Gov. Chris Sununu has also been surprisingly quiet about all of these bills and has a history of supporting heavy-handed COVID policies and has even criticized Sen. Ron Johnson for supporting science-based early treatment. However, the strong show of force from New Hampshire House members and the grassroots involved demonstrates that the Granite State might serve as the cold-weather alternative to Florida for those seeking to preserve our most important liberties.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-new-data-show-hospital-levels-not-much-worse-than-flu-season,2022-03-18
Horowitz: NM sheriff issues cease-and-desist order to governor who is trying to close businesses,"Every one of the more than 3,000 sheriffs in this country swears an oath to the federal Constitution in addition to the state constitution. One sheriff, Michael Wood of Lincoln County, New Mexico, appears to take that oath very seriously and is therefore willing to directly challenge the governor's unconstitutional COVID orders. In doing so, he has provided a blueprint for the constitutional sanctuary movement across the country.

American business owners have been receiving cease-and-desist orders across the country. Their crime? Trying to earn a living. Throughout the past nine months, Americans have been made out to be criminals by lawless tyrants in executive offices across cities and states. Some have even gone to jail. Now, Sheriff Michael Wood is turning the tables and putting the governor on notice for the criminal act of violating the most sacred provisions of the supreme law of the land.

Last Wednesday, Sheriff Wood posted a letter on the department's Facebook page ordering New Mexico Gov. Michele Lujan-Grisham to cease and desist from harassing businesses in Lincoln County. It's truly shocking how county governments that are in deep red territory have tolerated this fascism for months on end. Well, at just 13 days in office, Wood sent out a letter inquiring about the governor's orders.

""It has been brought to my attention that under your authority, government officials have been acting under color of law within the confines of Lincoln County, N.M., pursuant to a public health order,"" wrote the sheriff. ""It has been reported to me that local businesses have been interrupted and business owners have been threatened with unreasonable fines and threats of imprisonment, without having committed any criminal offense.""

He then ordered her to stop these activities until he is consulted and then requested a meeting with her.

Plain and simple. He didn't get into the specifics, the math, the science. Governors have no power to suspend democracy and shred the Bill of Rights. This should be the message of every sheriff, prosecutor, and county commissioner in the 83% of counties Trump carried and really in all the Republican state legislatures.

It's time to stop groveling, begging, complaining, or debating. The plain meaning of the Bill of Rights is not up for discussion. Half the states and the overwhelming majority of counties in this country, just based on the voting patterns, should easily serve as sanctuaries for business owners, schoolchildren, and for First Amendment rights now under assault by the federal government and certain governors.

Trump carried Lincoln County by a 36-point margin in November. There are hundreds of counties that are this red or redder, and sheriffs like Wood can serve as beacons of constitutional freedom during this dark time. James Madison, when explaining his theory on a large multi-layered republic in Federalist #10, predicted that having multiple layers of government would ensure that no single faction could spread tyranny everywhere and that inevitably some officials would push back and represent the persecuted minority.



""To refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations,"" wrote Madison of the divided power structure in a large country.

Madison continued:

The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.

This literally speaks to the time we live in. As the left wants to use COVID and the claim of right-wing terrorism to suspend the entire Bill of Rights, all is not lost just because the left controls the federal government. If conservatives actually pressured and reformed the GOP or created an alternative, they should be able to thwart this tyranny through state legislatures, governors, county executives, sheriffs, local prosecutors, and school boards across a large swath of the land. If tyranny is able to take root in red counties and red states, we have nobody to blame but ourselves.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-new-hampshire-legislature-as-a-shining-star-for-medical-freedom,2021-01-20
Horowitz: North Dakota House votes to block all existing and future unconstitutional federal policies,"On Wednesday, North Dakota took another step toward becoming a constitutional sanctuary to protect individual rights from federal encroachments. The question now is whether Governor Doug Burgum will put the bill over the top.

By a vote of 51-43, the North Dakota House passed HB 1282, which would create a joint committee on nullification to review all federal laws or executive orders that are suspected of violating the Constitution. The committee, which is to be composed of the House and Senate leadership and six members from each body who would serve for two years, would recommend to the legislative body whether to nullify the federal policies based on constitutional violations. Upon the committee's recommendation, the legislative assembly, by concurrent resolution, shall consider whether to nullify the federal action.

The consequence of this bill is that if the legislative assembly approves the concurrent resolution by a simple majority, all state agencies or political subdivisions of the state and all individuals employed by a state agency or political subdivision of the state are prohibited from enforcing the said federal law, regulation, or executive order.

Under the proposed legislation, the committee may review all existing federal statutes, regulations, and executive orders enacted before the effective date of this proposed law for the purpose of determining constitutionality and shall recommend whether to nullify in its entirety a specific federal statute, regulation, or executive order.

As I mentioned last week, this bill is probably the most important piece of legislation a state can pass given today's political climate. It's exactly what our Founders had in mind in the nightmare scenario where the federal government becomes tyrannical and inexorably hostile to the Bill of Rights. For example, if this bill passes, it would likely force a vote in the legislature on the implementation of the CDC's unconstitutional and inhumane mask mandate on travelers.

You might notice that this bill only passed 51-43, despite Republicans enjoying an 80-14 majority in the House. More than a third of the Republicans voted against it. These were the 43 no votes: Adams; Anderson, B.; Anderson, D.; Anderson, P.; Beltz; Boe; Boschee; Brandenburg; Buffalo; Devlin; Dobervich; Guggisberg; Hager; Hanson; Hatlestad; Ista; Johnson, D.; Karls; Keiser; Klemin; Longmuir; Martinson; Mitskog; Mock; Nathe; Nelson, J.; Nelson, M.; O'Brien; Ostlie; Owens; Pollert; Porter; Richter; Roers Jones; Sanford; Schneider; Schreiber-Beck; Strinden; Thomas; Trottier; Vigesaa; Westlind; and Zubke.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Republicans enjoy a 40-7 majority. However, there are many liberal Republicans in the Senate, and the governor has yet to endorse the bill. A number of liberal Republicans have bought into the erroneous notion that only courts can decide the constitutionality of issues. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Larry Klemin opposed the bill on the floor, claiming that it isn't the legislature's job to determine the constitutionality of a law.

As chairman, Klemin already watered down another similar bill, HB 1164, which I referred to last week. On Thursday, the new ""modified"" version of HB 1164 passed 79-13 – with all the fake Republicans pretending to support the Constitution. That bill, as modified, would only allow courts to determine the constitutionality of a presidential executive order, rather than the attorney general, as originally drafted.

Here's the subterfuge we need to watch out for in other states only pretending to pass constitutional sanctuary legislation. What this effectively does is make the bill do the exact same thing as current practice, effectively gutting the entire effort. Thus, the chairman of the committee gets to brag about fighting for the 10th Amendment and standing up to tyranny, while doing absolutely nothing.



Worse, this bill continues to legitimize the myth that, somehow, only the judicial branch can interpret the Constitution. Indeed, each branch of government – both at the state and federal levels – has an obligation to use its respective powers to protect constitutional rights. For example, with Biden's illegal and unscientific COVID mandates, it is the executive branch of the state that must defend the Constitution and refuse to implement them and the legislative branch that must prohibit and defund them from being implemented.

The judicial branch of government, with very few exceptions, has ignored flagrant violations of the Bill of Rights for 10 months. Fighting Washington at the local level will become a popular campaign issue for state and local politicians in the coming months and years. Perfidious Republicans understand this and plan to misdirect the grassroots energy away from bills that actually have teeth in them and send that force into a black hole.

If states are going to finally fight back against tyranny, it needs to come from the legislature. It's time for legislators to stop running away from their constitutional obligations to represent the people and to protect their rights.

In a 2017 report, the Congressional Research Service observed that ""early history of the United States is replete with examples of all three branches of the federal government playing a role in constitutional interpretation."" Members of Congress weren't so complacent in their duties and, as the CRS observed, never sat idly allowing the courts to wield ""a final or even exclusive role in defining the basic powers and limits of the federal government."" They subscribed to Madison's view in Federalist #49 that ""the several departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common commission, neither of them, it is evident, can pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their respective powers."" He emphatically believed that ""each [department] must in the exercise of its functions be guided by the text of the Constitution according to its own interpretation of it.""



Thankfully, the stronger bill, HB 1282, wound up passing over Chairman Klemin's objections, but this demonstrates the struggle conservatives have even in red states in getting GOP supermajorities in both houses, not to mention the Republican governors, to work for the constitutional sanctuary movement.

As the legislative sessions reach their peak work weeks, conservatives should make HB 1282 the model bill. Rather than empowering the judiciary or even the executive to have exclusive authority over nullifying unconstitutional federal powers, it places the authority in the hands of the democratically elected legislature. This will force red-state Republicans to either finally stand up and fulfill their campaign promises or reveal to their voters that they are a false opposition to the Left, as over 25 Republicans in North Dakota did this week.

In order to make red states red again, we will have to make state legislatures great again.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-nm-sheriff-issues-cease-and-desist-order-to-governor-who-is-trying-to-close-businesses,2021-02-12
Horowitz: North Dakota legislators introduce bill to block Biden’s illegal executive edicts,"""All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for the protection, security and benefit of the people, and they have a right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require."" ~Sec. 2, North Dakota Declaration of Rights

A group of North Dakota legislators have taken up the call for states to reassert control over the Constitution, as the Biden regime continues to rule by executive fiat, often promulgating unconstitutional orders infringing upon civil rights. This is the key to thwarting a wholesale slide into national despotism and ensuring that there are some places for Americans to go and enjoy the blessings of liberty. The question is whether leaders in those legislative chambers as well as Gov. Doug Burgum will pick up the mantle, not to mention Republicans in other states.

Recently, Rep. Tom Kading and eight other Republicans in the North Dakota House introduced HB 1164, which would task the attorney general with reviewing the constitutionality of the president's executive orders. If any of his orders are deemed to be unlawful, this bill would prohibit any state or county agency or publicly funded organization from enforcing the edict.

The list of issues covered under the bill are:

Pandemics or other health emergencies. The regulation of natural resources, including coal and oil. The regulation of the agriculture industry. The use of land. The regulation of the financial sector as it relates to environmental, social, or governance standards. The regulation of the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

Thus, an easy first candidate for such legislation is Biden's recent mask mandate, which unconstitutionally prohibits humans breathing without cloths on their mouths and noses inside any public transportation, including in-state ride-shares and taxis. The CDC created an entire criminal offense for something that never passed Congress.

What if Congress decides to pass a bill that is unconstitutional? HB 1282, introduced by Rep. Sebastian Ertelt, would take this a step farther by proposing a ""Committee on Neutralization of Federal Laws"" to recommend whether a given law or regulation is unconstitutional. Upon the recommendation of this committee, consisting of state legislative leadership and their appointees, the legislature would pass a concurrent resolution on whether to nullify the law or edict. Until the resolution is passed, state and county agencies would be prohibited from enforcing the law or regulation at issue.

These bills should serve as a model for all 31 GOP-controlled legislatures, especially in the 23 states where there are also Republican governors. I hear so many conservatives acting despondent and either resigned to tyranny or calling for secession or even a civil war. But the solution implied in these bills would keep the union loosely intact while peacefully maintaining a constitutional sanctuary for those who still value constitutional freedoms. This is the best way to peacefully and gradually separate blue and red America into their respective cultural, economic, and governing choices so we can live together more agreeably as a federal union.

North Dakota Republicans control the Senate 40-7 and the House 80-14. If this were a Democrat state passing a sanctuary bill for illegal aliens, the bill would pass in a day. Given that the rights of American citizens are on the line, Senate leaders Randy Burckhard and Rich Wardner should bring this bill to the Senate floor, and Speaker Kim Koppelman should bring the bill to the House floor immediately. North Dakota has an opportunity to lead the nation in liberty, if only all the Republicans in the state would govern the way they campaign.

Madison predicted in Federalist #46 that a federal encroachment would easily be mitigated by state action, because ""the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand."" What is the winning formula?

The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.

In other words, public outrage, state and local officials refusing to enforce it, and correspondence with counterparts in other states together in unison would prevail over federal tyranny.

South Dakota already has a similar bill to HB 1164 targeting Biden's executive lawmaking. Rep. Aaron Aylward of Harrisburg, South Dakota, introduced HB 1194, which would set up an executive board to review the constitutionality of executive orders pertaining to the six issues laid out in the North Dakota legislation. With a 32-3 majority in the Senate and a 62-8 majority in the House, South Dakota Republicans have the strongest majorities since the Eisenhower era. The Dakotas, as well as many other parts of the country, can easily become constitutional sanctuaries.

Additionally, county commissions, prosecutors, and sheriffs should also seek to criminalize enforcement of unconstitutional edicts at the county level.



Let's be very clear: The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution subordinates states to follow only laws that are pursuant to the Constitution on issues that were given over to the federal government to determine. However, if the federal government blatantly violates the Constitution, especially in a way that harms individual liberty, even Alexander Hamilton, the great supporter of a powerful national government, said that states should ignore it. ""It will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are NOT PURSUANT to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land,"" wrote Hamilton in Federalist #33. ""These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such.""

Well, if it was good enough for Hamilton, it should be good enough for states with strong Republican majorities in the legislature.

There is no doubt that Biden's presidency will take a bite out of our economy, especially with his cancelation of the international pipeline going through North Dakota. But if tyranny itself takes root and grows within the boundaries of these solid red states, then we as conservatives have nobody to blame but ourselves and our own complacency.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-north-dakota-house-votes-to-block-all-existing-and-future-unconstitutional-federal-policies,2021-02-03
Horowitz: Not so fast: 10 COVID biomedical fights that are still not over,"Many commentators have noted that the Biden administration and the media are using Ukraine as the seamless off-ramp from COVID fascism. However, it is quite evident that they are not exiting the road to bio-medical tyranny but are merely driving in a tunnel – out of sight from the majority of people but still inexorably headed toward tyranny.

Republicans are just as eager as Democrats to let this issue go. However, it is far from over. And I’m not just talking about seeking revenge, justice, and a Nuremberg 2.0-style event to punish those who are responsible for the deaths of countless people and for suspending democracy. Here are 10 ramifications of our government’s response to COVID that are STILL with us today. Democrats artfully got rid of the broad mandates that affect families every day, such as school masking. They can’t afford to head into the election alienating everyone with children in school. But individuals still suffering in smaller numbers? There are no signs of relief.

1. Military Mandate

To this day, soldiers are being kicked out of the military for a shot that is expired, causes a shocking amount of injury and death, and never stopped transmission even when it worked a little. There have been some court injunctions for part of the military mandate, but the requirement is largely intact. Moreover, if the mandate is not removed, it will likely affect an entire generation of children who rightfully chose not to get the shots. None of them will be eligible for military service. Given all the shocking information that has come out about the safety and efficacy of the shots in recent days, it is appalling that Republicans wouldn’t engage in a budget fight ahead of the March 11 deadline and demand a termination of the military mandate.

2. Health care worker mandate

Even the U.K. got rid of its health care mandate. Yet American health care workers are still being fired for not getting this dangerous shot for a virus most of them already got and for a variant that seems to have more of an affinity to infect those with the shot! Even those already forced into getting the shots are now being asked to get boosters! This is coming at a time of a severe shortage of health care workers. Medscape, the leading medical profession media, has finally admitted, “Antibodies derived from natural COVID infection are more abundant and at least 10x more potent than immunity generated by vaccination alone.” Yet those with natural immunity are being fired and those with the shots are told to come to work with COVID! Again, how can Republicans let this continue for even a day? Florida and Tennessee are the only states to have passed laws fining health care agencies for not accepting religious or medical exemptions.

3. Pushing the shots on babies and toddlers

Children under 5 are the final frontier of Americans untainted by this bioweapon. We already know from a New York State study that there is no possible benefit because the authors admit the shots have negative efficacy after six weeks for 5- to 11-year-olds. They cause a tremendous amount of injury and there is zero benefit. How can Pfizer be allowed to seek authorization for the shots? States must promise to block any distribution of these shots.

4. Masks on planes and in doctor’s offices

Even though masks have been thoroughly debunked as a tool for viral source control, the criminalization of human breathing on airplanes continues. Moreover, every hospital in every state is still requiring it on patients in duress from injury, physical illness, or even Alzheimer’s patients. The inhumane treatment is still in full force.

5. Genocidal blocking of treatment

Ironically, COVID is not over and we don’t know what is coming next. There are actually more recorded deaths today than there were when the mandates began. The same people who destroyed our lives for COVID now want to walk away from it while still leaving people without proper treatment options. Very few states have passed bills protecting doctors prescribing off-label drugs, and not a single state has passed a bill requiring hospitals to allow right to try or to ensure that pharmacies stop blocking prescriptions. In other words, we still don’t have medical freedom in this country.

6. Remdesivir must be pulled

It is appalling that remdesivir is still the standard of care in hospitals. States must move to immediately pull this toxic drug.

7. Patient Bill of Rights

Patients are being denied visitation from family members. Dr. Molly James, an ICU doctor who treated COVID from day one, reports that she has patients who are being denied visitation by their spouses because the hospital believes they are slipping them ivermectin. Yes, they are actually upset the patient is getting better! Every state legislature must pass an emergency bill requiring hospitals to allow visitors, allow patients to decline treatment, the right to access treatment, prevent hospitals from confiscating existing prescriptions and vitamins, and criminalize “medical kidnapping,” whereby they prevent a patient from being released or transferred.

8. Denial of organ transplants

People in need of organ transplants might not constitute a massive share of the electorate, but their lives still matter. To this day, they are being denied transplants on account of not getting a dangerous shot that fails to stimulate immunity for their health status, even if they already have natural immunity. How a single Republican-controlled state can allow this to continue for another day is barbaric.

9. Treatment for vaccine injury

Even if we look at the most conservative estimates of vaccine injury, given the fact that most adults in the entire country were given at least one dose, that means there are a ton of people in need of help. Pfizer’s court-released documents now reveal the company knew about thousands of categories of adverse events. Yet, because of the censorship, scientists can’t even publish papers on how to identify, diagnose, and treat injury. These people are in need of help, and it is disgusting to walk away from this travesty as if nothing happened. The government owes reparations to those people for the violation of the principles of informed consent. Moreover, states must establish injury-reporting centers, encourage doctors to treat patients, and welcome medical academics to promote their research diagnosing vaccine injury. And yes, the people behind the vaccine corruption need to be held accountable.

10. A complete audit of the injections

At this point, given everything we know (and still don’t know), it’s no longer OK to just oppose mandates. We need a full audit in every state of everything that is wrong with the vaccines. Unless there is something we are all missing, they need to be immediately pulled from the market. Absent such a movement, they will quietly be pushed by the government and medical establishment for months to come. Moreover, they are working on dozens of new mRNA vaccines that need an entire new sphere of oversight at the state level now that the FDA is compromised. Even for coronavirus, Biden is promising to deploy a new vaccine within 100 days. This model of “emergency” cutting corners on research, development, and trials is the “new normal” if we don’t stop it.

The March 11 deadline for Congress to pass the final omnibus bill funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year is the last point of leverage to force resolution of these issues. Madison referred to the power of the purse as “the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance.” We already know that the number one issue on the minds of perfidious Republicans is endless funding for Ukraine. Is it possible that they can muster up the same level of passion to redress a single one of these civilization-changing grievances from their own citizens?

Horowitz: Oklahoma House votes to enable legislature to block Biden’s executive orders,"James Madison once asserted that ""in a republican government, the legislative authority necessarilypredominates."" Well, today, only executive power predominates, because federal and state executive agencies seem to be the only ones doing the legislating. As Joe Biden continues to pass sweeping ""laws"" unilaterally with no authority from Congress, the red states are the only even potential check on his abuse of power. It appears that the state of Oklahoma has now taken up the mantle as the second state to move to block these executive orders.

On Thursday, the Oklahoma House overwhelmingly passed a bill, HB 1236, that would grant the state's attorney general and state legislature the authority to review the president's executive orders to determine constitutionality. Specifically, the bill would authorize the legislature to recommend that the attorney general review any executive order, federal agency rule, or federal congressional action to determine whether the state should seek an exemption or declare it unconstitutional. If either the attorney general or the legislature, by concurrent resolution, declares the act unconstitutional, then all state and local officials and any publicly funded organization are prohibited from enforcing it.

The federal actions covered under this bill include any orders pertaining to health emergencies; the regulation of natural resources, agriculture, and land use; infringements upon the Second Amendment; the regulation of the financial sector as it relates to environmental, social, or governance standards, the regulation of education; the regulation of college or school sports; or any other powers reserved by the State of Oklahoma or the people of Oklahoma.

This bill is probably the single most direct and effective way of countering federal power-grabs. As written, it would potentially pave the way for the legislature to block Biden's mask mandate, transgender agenda in school sports, and racially biased orders in finance and commerce, just to name a few.

Oklahoma's House is now the second chamber to pass a state sovereignty bill against federal overreach. The North Dakota House passed a similar bill, HB 1282, earlier this month. However, that bill passed by a narrow margin, 51-43, with nearly 30 Republicans voting against it. The Oklahoma bill, on the other hand, was introduced by the speaker himself, Rep. Charles McCall, and passed 79-18 along party lines, which means it has a good chance of going to the governor's desk.

A few minutes after passage of HB 1236, Rep. Jay Steagall introduced HR 1005, a resolution expressing the right of a state to defend the Constitution and intervene on behalf of the liberties of its citizens.

""Oklahoma hereby asserts sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers,"" states the text of the resolution, which passed 80-14. ""THAT this resolution shall serve notice to the federal government of our intent to maintain the balance of powers where the Constitution of the United States established it. THAT we intend to ensure that all federal government agencies and their agents and employees operating within the geographic boundaries of Oklahoma, or whose actions have an effect on the inhabitants, lands or waters of Oklahoma, shall operate within the confines of the original intent of the Constitution of the United States.""



In introducing the bill, Rep. Steagall, who is the chairman of the States Rights Committee, stated plainly the intent of the legislative effort this week. ""I submit to you that it is the duty of the state to interpose between the central government's abuse of power and the people in order to secure the authorities, rights, and liberties of the people, and that duty falls squarely on the shoulders of the state legislature.""

While so many conservatives are focused on Congress, many fail to see that the states are where the power resides. Republicans control both houses in 31 state legislatures, the majority of them with supermajorities. If every chamber were to mimic this legislation, there would be large swaths of the country free from the totalitarian edicts of the left, regardless of what happens in Washington.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-not-so-fast-10-covid-biomedical-fights-that-are-still-not-over,2021-02-26
Horowitz: Parler lawsuit: The courts discover free enterprise at the exact wrong moment,"Imagine if every venue providing wedding services — from rental places and caterers to bakers and florists — were controlled by Christian conservatives. They worked together with all their distributors to ensure that nobody could perform a gay wedding anywhere in the country. Well, that is exactly what is occurring today in reverse on free speech. But there is no constitutional right to a gay marriage, while there is a right to free speech.

Last Thursday, Judge Barbara J. Rothstein of the Western District of Washington denied Parler's motion to force Amazon to restore Parler's social media platform on Amazon's server. Suddenly, the liberal legal community believes in the right of a private company to serve whomever they choose. The double standard is unmistakable.

I'd love to go back to 1789 when private businesses could do whatever they wanted. And indeed, had that been the prevailing law of the land over the past few generations, conservatives would have a lot more power and leverage in the economy and culture than they do today. But that is far from the case. In fact, the legal system has essentially controlled every aspect of what private businesses can do – up to and including the current lockdown policies that downright deny businesses the ability to serve anyone.

Just consider the case of a baker being forced to personally make a cake for a ceremony that violates his religious beliefs. Although the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Masterpiece Cakeshop when Colorado fined the shop for declining to bake a cake for a gay couple, the majority opinion hinted at the fact that, generally speaking, cake shops cannot decline to bake cakes. It's just in that particular case, the court held that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission did not enforce its mandate in a ""neutral"" manner.

Pursuant to this implied ruling, several courts have ruled that private business owners cannot decline to contract for gay events that violate their conscience. In 2018, the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled that, pursuant to a Phoenix municipal ordinance, a Christian boutique artwork shop could not decline to contract for gay weddings. Brush & Nib Studio had a sign outside its shop stating that it would not create any artwork that violates the artists' beliefs, which includes ""artwork that demeans others, endorses racism, incites violence, contradicts our Christian faith, or promotes any marriage except marriage between one man and one woman."" Although there were numerous other places for gay couples to patronize, Brush & Nib was forced to engage in involuntary servitude for something the proprietors believe to be sinful.

Now, keep in mind that we are discussing tiny single proprietorships where the owners personally create with their hands sentimental products. Also, there are endless venues for individuals who want to make a gay ceremony to patronize. In fact, I'm sure they can actually find greater bargains and better service for their championed endeavors than the rest of us. Yet, somehow, Big Tech can collude to box out any conservative from accessing any way of effectively communicating, obtaining e-commerce, or even getting a job in the economy, in contravention to foundational antitrust laws and principles. So, if three companies buy up all the roads, they could block conservatives from traveling anywhere, but mom-and-pop shops must personally make products for events and speech that they find offensive!

Not only have the courts applied anti-discrimination law to denial of service, but in a case originating in this same federal district in Washington as the Amazon lawsuit, the courts established a rule that a pharmacy must actively stock products that it disapproves. In 2015, in the Stormans case, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a Washington state pharmacy must provide essentially every type of contraception under the sun, even though 30 other vendors sold all the products within five miles. SCOTUS refused to grant an appeal to the owners of the pharmacy, over a sharp dissent from Justice Alito.



Additionally, numerous courts have ruled that the Trump administration must continue enforcing the Obama-era contraception mandate, forcing employers to directly or indirectly provide contraception as part of their mandated insurance benefits for their employees.

Thus, when conservatives are the consumer, they can be denied service through monopolistic collusion to the point that it boxes out their existence from the public market, but when they are the provider, they must actively provide everything that violates their conscience, even when they are the only ones declining to contract and the product or service is widely available.

Moreover, in the religious liberty cases, unlike with Big Tech discrimination, the store owners or companies are explicitly protected by the First Amendment.

In 2016, Christian Mingle, a Christian dating website, was forced to offer gay dating options thanks to a California lawsuit. Worse, just last year, St. Joseph's Hospital in Baltimore was sued for not performing a hysterectomy on a woman's totally healthy uterus because she believes she really is a man. Most legal observers think the plaintiff will likely win thanks to Justice Gorsuch's ruling in Bostock codifying transgenderism into anti-discrimination law.

In other words, a single Catholic hospital is now forced to offer a ""service"" that is tantamount to mutilation of the body and violates the Hippocratic oath under the color of anti-discrimination and never denying service, but the entire Big Tech and corporate world can collude to deny all conservatives all forms of communication and commerce.

We no longer live in a constitutional republic. We live in a sadistic two-tiered justice system wherein conservatives are subject to hedonistic communism, but leftists can live in accordance with 1789 laissez-faire regulations built on a monopoly handed to them by government so that they can collude and banish conservatives from society.

Horowitz: Red states must nullify Biden’s nullification of the Constitution,"""That in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them."" ~Virginia Resolution, 1798, against the Sedition Act

What happens when the federal government and some state governments turn against every provision of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence? James Madison foresaw such a day, which is why he designed a multilayered republic with numerous states and counties all under a federal union. Tyranny and lawlessness can persist in some places, but under his design, it shouldn't persist fully in every part of the country. When the federal government chooses to nullify the Constitution, it's time for the remaining lawful states to nullify the nullification.

As we watch the Biden administration, with the help of the media and blue state governors, impose COVID fascism, criminalize free speech and assembly, and misuse and abuse our military for what appears to be a fascist junta in D.C. — all the while rolling out the welcome mat for foreign invaders at our border and Antifa rioters in our streets — we should all be asking what red states and counties can be doing to push back.

No president has ever come close to the number of illegal executive actions the Biden regime has taken in less than two weeks. These unprecedented actions deserve an equally intrepid and determined reaction from the 31 GOP legislatures. The following are a mix of actions conservatives should push for in any unit of government controlled by those who can be pressured into adopting a constitutional sanctuary.

Block Biden's mask mandate : Conservatives should push an immediate end to all state mask mandates in the 31 states where Republicans control the legislature. Next, in the states with Republican governors and attorneys general, they should take a chapter out of New York's playbook by criminalizing the enforcement of Biden's mask mandate on public transportation. Biden's order makes it a federal crime to breathe freely even in a ride-share that doesn't go across state lines. This is unconstitutional on so many levels. It's time to criminalize the enforcement of this in the states. New York criminalized the enforcement of immigration law, which is emphatically the job of the federal government. There's no reason why such action can't be taken by the states when the federal government violates the civil rights of American citizens.

End all emergency orders: Every state with a GOP legislature should immediately terminate all emergency orders and pass restrictions on the ability of governors to abuse emergency powers in the future.

Call back the National Guard: The deployment of our National Guard to Washington was a disgrace from day one and was done under false pretenses. The fact that Biden is keeping them there indefinitely is indefensible. It is shocking that only eight Republican governors have called back their National Guardsmen, despite them being abused. Pressure needs to be brought to bear on the remainder of those governors to follow suit.

State governors and attorneys general need to criminalize the entry of men into female private spaces and women's sports so that Biden's unconstitutional order cannot take root in the majority of states. Fight discrimination against Trump supporters: The federal government has now harnessed the full force of law enforcement and the national intelligence apparatus against Trump supporters. States must commit to blocking federal law enforcement from arresting people merely for assembling or expressing their opinions. They should also file 14th Amendment lawsuits against federal agencies that clearly single out Trump supporters for questioning and investigations.

The Biden regime and Nancy Pelosi have stopped construction of the border wall designed to protect the American people and have instead constructed a wall around the Capitol to keep the people away from the politicians. If they want to cut off the Capitol from the rest of the country with a fence, that is fine. It's time for states to reciprocate by cutting Washington off from their lives and interposing between the people and federal tyranny.

There can be no denying that our government has lost all legitimacy as it declines to even pretend to follow the Constitution. When the federal government violated the Constitution with just one law in 1798 – the Sedition Act – Thomas Jefferson and James Madison went to the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures to interpose against the act. Madison explained the rationale for the Virginia resolution as follows:



The states, then, being the parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal, above their authority, to decide, in the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated; and consequently, that, as the parties to it, they must decide, in the last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.

Even Hamilton, a strong proponent of a strong federal government, wrote in Federalist 26 that the state legislatures will lead the charge against federal tyranny:

The State legislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to sound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if necessary, the ARM of their discontent.

This begins by states and counties passing Constitutional Sanctuary resolutions, committing to not only ignoring constitutionally flawed edicts but criminalizing their enforcement. As Daniel Webster said in protesting the federal military conscription in the War of 1812:

The operation of measures thus unconstitutional and illegal ought to be prevented by a resort to other measures which are both constitutional and legal. It will be the solemn duty of the State governments to protect their own authority over their own militia, and to interpose between their citizens and arbitrary power. These are among the objects for which the State governments exist; and their highest obligations bind them to the preservation of their own rights and the liberties of their people.

A military draft was actually something quite sensible to most of our Founders, yet Webster still called for interposition against it. What do you think he would have said if a new fourth branch of government called ""the CDC"" came and criminalized the breathing of a human being without a cloth? Would he or our Founders have remained silent?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-parler-lawsuit-the-courts-discover-free-enterprise-at-the-exact-wrong-moment,2021-02-01
Horowitz: Red states should ban abortions even before official SCOTUS opinion,"The weakest position in battle is to come out from behind defensive lines without cover but fail to advance toward the objective. Political combat is no different, and that is why the left leaked the rough draft of the Dobbs opinion reversing Roe. They hoped to pre-emptively expose the assault on Roe and elicit robust attacks before the red states get a chance to actualize its benefits. Red-state legislatures and governors need to do one better and pre-empt any blue state action by banning abortions immediately.

Roughly half the states, including most deep red states, are already out of session until 2023, and most will be done by the end of the month. The worst thing they can do is to allow this issue to fester – as if it’s still in contention – and allow the left and its machine of boycotting, censorship, and astroturfing to work its magic. Republican governors should immediately convene legislative sessions, ban abortions even before 15 weeks, and make the repeal of Roe a reality.

Such a move would have several benefits:

1) In politics, the more you debate an issue, the more it sows doubt, especially when you are trying to implement something new. When you just rip off the scab and implement it quickly, it demoralizes opponents and proves the veracity of the issue in the eyes of the voters by evincing an image of confidence and moral clarity. Just look at how the left successfully implemented COVID restrictions by seizing the moment without any debate. Had they left these issues to a protracted debate, they would never have been implemented in most states.

2) States issuing bans on abortion will make it that much harder for Roberts or external forces to pressure Barrett or Kavanaugh into watering down Alito’s draft majority opinion.

3) It will have the broader effect and ancillary benefit of delegitimizing judicial supremacy. It will show that when we are prepared to do something constitutional, moral, and just, we will do so regardless of the courts. The courts don’t have exclusive and final jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, and Roe was legal fiction. Really, this should always be the attitude of the states, but now that there is at least an authentic draft of an opinion repudiating Roe, they should set the precedent of delegitimizing judicial supremacism, a principle they will need in the future on other issues. Red states will need to enforce immigration law and directly challenge the court’s ruling in Arizona v. United States (2012).

Senate establishment Republican types like Mitch McConnell who fervently believe in judicial supremacism are feigning outrage over the leak and focusing all their attention on that issue rather than on the banning of abortion itself. That is because they believe that we can only accomplish good policy with the courts and nothing else.

McConnell lambasted the leak as “an attack on the independence of the Supreme Court.” While the leak was certainly a reprehensible act, I disagree with this bromide of “the independent judiciary.” The judiciary is no more or less independent than the legislature and executive – both in the states and at the federal level. They are all independent of each other, each with their own powers. Every branch must use its powers in concert with the Constitution, not just the courts.

This is the core of what Lincoln did as president to thwart Dred Scott and even issue citizenship and passports to freed black slaves in direct opposition to the 1858 decision. During the sixth debate with Stephen Douglas during the 1858 race for Senate in Illinois, Lincoln asserted: “Judge Douglas understands the Constitution according to the Dred Scott decision, and he is bound to support it as he understands it. I understand it another way, and therefore I am bound to support it in the way in which I understand it.”



Lincoln observed that courts can adjudicate individual cases, but if they seek to use those rulings as a way of setting political policy across the nation, it should never be regarded as a “political rule” to be “binding on the members of Congress or the President to favor no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision.”

During Lincoln’s inauguration on March 4, 1864, Chief Justice Roger Taney, the author of Dred Scott, was forced to administer the oath of office to the man who reminded him of his own impotence to give will or force to his bad opinion. After taking the oath, Lincoln delivered his inauguration address, in which he promised to treat black people as humans, not as property built upon another human being’s “substantive due process rights” to own them. He rejected the notion that “the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions.”

What Lincoln meant is that court opinions in a case or controversy – real or politicized – are not self-executing on the other branches of government and automatically universally binding on all the people. So how does the court succeed in making a ruling in a case the de facto “law of the land?” As Eleventh Circuit Judge William Pryor once wrote, it’s all on the power of persuasion:

Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 78 that judges exercise “neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment.” Hamilton’s point was that we must depend upon the persuasiveness of our written opinions to command the respect of our fellow citizens.

It flows from here that if a court delivers a horrendous opinion that is clearly divorced from the history and tradition of our laws and Constitution, then the other branches and the states will not be convinced. This is why, unlike McConnell, conservatives should not be quite as concerned with the prospect of Barrett or Kavanaugh being convinced to change their opinions. This is not an official vote like that of a legislature. Courts don’t pass laws like a legislature, nor do they “strike down” or veto laws like a presidential veto. They offer an opinion in a case and, occasionally, can offer an opinion on a constitutional question to resolve that case. Remember, in the early days of the republic, there was an even number of justices on the court, a clear indication that it wasn’t designed to conduct votes on the most fundamental constitutional and political questions and have those outcomes enshrined with finality.

Now that we already know how the majority of the justices feel – that Roe is a legal fiction – there is nothing stopping the states from following the true Constitution and acting upon the Constitution as written the way we understood it before this leaked opinion. Any change in opinion henceforth, to paraphrase Judge Pryor, will indeed not be very persuasive and will not command the respect of our fellow citizens.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-red-states-must-nullify-bidens-nullification-of-the-constitution,2022-05-04
Horowitz: Remdesivir is the greatest scandal of the pandemic,"Is there anything produced or approved by our government for COVID that isn't ineffective, doesn't have terrible side effects, and doesn't actually make the virus worse? The lockdowns, masks, and shots not only failed to work, but caused terrible collateral damage, failed to stop the virus, and, in fact, likely made the virus become more virulent. Now there are reports that remdesivir, which we already know doesn't work and causes renal and liver failure, might also be making the virus itself worse.

Antiviral agents, whether vaccine or therapeutic, must be perfect. If they fail to fully work, they can create viral immune escape, whereby the virus learns how to mutate around them. It's sort of like the principle of shooting at the king and missing, a principle we are often concerned with regarding the overuse or misuse of antibiotics.

Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine posted a preprint study in which they discovered a mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 that appears to have redeveloped in a previously infected immunocompromised woman who was treated with remdesivir. Researchers were able to sequence the genome in a way that made it clear it was related to the remdesivir use in the patient. The patient was later cured by monoclonal antibodies. ""This case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" the study's authors wrote.

Obviously, this mutation appears to be a rare find, but why would we run the risk of spending $3,000 a person on a therapeutic that doesn't work anyway if it may create immune escape?

Which raises the question: Why are we not treating everyone early with therapeutics like Regeneron, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, and other proven safe, cheap, and effective drugs that don't case renal failure like remdesivir and don't run the risk of inducing mutations? This is particularly important for those who are immunocompromised. The last thing people who already have fragile organs should be taking is remdesivir.

In many respects the fact that remdesivir was ever approved and is still the only standard of care, as it kills patients and lines the pockets of both hospitals and the maker, Gilead, is possibly the worst scandal of this entire ordeal. On Feb. 5, Reuters reported that none other than the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the China Academy of Sciences sought a patent on Gilead's remdesivir, a failed drug repurposed from treatment of Ebola, based on the alleged improvement of a single individual COVID patient reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. Incidentally, the only drug ever approved for COVID was developed by Dr. Ralph Baric's lab at UNC Chapel Hill, the same lab that applied for the coronavirus spike protein gain-of-function research and is suspected by many to be behind the creation of this virus.

Gee, is it surprising that the drug developed and pushed early by the same two labs likely behind the virus is not only a dud but dangerous?

But it gets worse. On Dec. 12, 2019, less than five months before Fauci and the FDA pushed approval of remdesivir without consulting with an outside panel of experts, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study on remdesivir use in Ebola that should have gotten the drug permanently banned for any use. Over the preceding year, the researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial of four therapeutics for use against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo: remdesivir and three types of monoclonal antibodies, including Regeneron. What were the results in Table 2 of the study?

Of the four drugs, remdesivir had the worst outcome with a 53.1% death rate, which is higher than the death rate from the virus. In fact, both remdesivir and ZMapp (death rate of 49.7%) were deemed to be so dangerous that they were pulled from the study on Aug. 9, 2019. Incidentally, Regeneron, which had the lowest death rate, is the monoclonal antibody therapy that seems to work well for COVID. Why would Fauci first pick remdesivir over Regeneron?

On April 29, Fauci announced that remdesivir would become the standard of care, and another study he cited was Gilead's own March 2020 study (eventually published in the NEJM in June) of 53 coronavirus patients in the U.S. Canada, Europe, and Japan who used remdesivir for 10 days. Sixty percent reported adverse events and 23% reported serious adverse events, the most common being ""multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and hypotension."" Furthermore, ""Four patients (8%) discontinued remdesivir treatment prematurely: one because of worsening of preexisting renal failure, one because of multiple organ failure, and two because of elevated aminotransferases, including one patient with a maculopapular rash.""

This is why the NIH to this day warns about renal failure and liver toxicity from the use of this drug that is bankrupting us and killing people in the hospitals. The WHO recommends against using it. The WHO's Solidarity trial, which was conducted on 2,750 patients in 405 hospitals across 30 countries, found ""little or no effect of remdesivir on mortality,"" even though ""the proportion of lower-risk patients happened to be appreciably greater in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group.""

Last year, in France's Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, researchers studied outcomes in the first five COVID ICU patients who were administered remdesivir. Researchers observed, ""Remdesivir was interrupted before the initially planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement."" Elevated alanine aminotransferase is usually an indication of liver toxicity, one of the warnings the NIH has given about the use of remdesivir.

To control for the confounding factor that perhaps the kidney failure associated with remdesivir is in fact a symptom of the virus, researchers at the Department of Nephrology-Dialysis-Transplantation at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice, France, compared the reported incidence of renal failure in COVID patients using remdesivir to those using other drugs. A search of the international pharmacovigilance postmarketing databases (VigiBase) of the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the reporting odds ratio of acute renal failure for COVID patients on remdesivir ""was 20-fold"" that of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and lopinavir/ritonavir.



Well over a year after it has become abundantly clear that this drug only causes harm and does not save a single life, not a single hospital has stopped using it. These same hospitals are firing talented doctors either for not getting the failed shots or for using ivermectin. They will even go to court to prevent a dying patient with no other options from being administered ivermectin by an outside doctor. Yet they will use remdesivir to the gates of hell.

For those who simply cannot believe all of the safety concerns and signals about the vaccines, just remember that what we already know from existing data and see right in front of our eyes with remdesivir is perhaps even more scandalous that what is being alleged about the vaccines.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-red-states-should-ban-abortions-even-before-official-scotus-opinion,2021-11-15
Horowitz: Replacing Liz Cheney with Elise Stefanik is the whole problem with the GOP,"Liz Cheney is not a bug, but a feature of the GOP. She is not an exception, but the rule. The exceptions are those few members who actually fight for the major tenets of the party's platform in a meaningful way. Unfortunately, Cheney is well within the mainstream of the party on so many issues except for her open defiance of Trump. As such, when left to their own devices, the GOP will replace her with someone like Elise Stefanik … who is even more liberal.

The beauty of the Democratic Party is that Democrats appoint leaders and committee chairs and nominate people to high offices who not only believe in their party's agenda to the core, but are their most vociferous fighters. Republicans, on the other hand, have their most liberal members in leadership and as committee chairs at the federal and state levels. Their health care chair will be someone who champions government-run health care. Their judiciary chair in a given state legislature will often be someone who supports open borders and is pro-criminal. Thus, the problem with Liz Cheney as House conference chair is not an aberration, but the general rule.

The good news is that conservatives are finally willing to eject Republicans from leadership positions who are out of step with our values. Certainly, for Cheney to support impeaching Trump under the notion that he is criminally responsible for what happened on January 6 should make her unfit to lead the conference. But what about a Republican who believes we need to be in Afghanistan forever? What about supporting COVID fascism, open borders, and the transgender agenda? Or, in the case of Cheney, let's not forget that she supported candidates against conservative members like Thomas Massie. In fact, Cheney's tweet praising Fauci at a time when he destroyed our civilization is more offensive to me than even her vote for impeachment:

In other words, we should not only focus on who kisses up to Trump as a person but who reflects the agenda for which the Republican voters sent Trump himself to the presidency. If we internalize that message, we'd understand that Elise Stefanik is not who we want to replace Cheney. Why should we have to settle on one of two bad choices?



Elise Stefanik, who now has the backing of Trump to replace Cheney as conference chair, is so liberal she even voted against the Trump tax cuts that were supported by even the typical liberal Republicans. Unlike Cheney, she has cozied up to Trump as a person, but that should not be our priority headed forward. She has co-sponsored ""Dream"" amnesty and voted for Big Agriculture amnesty. She was even one of 14 Republicans who voted to terminate Trump's emergency declaration at the border and was one of 11 Republicans who voted to override his funding of the border wall!

Stefanik is terrible on social issues. She was one of just eight Republicans who voted for the original ""Equality Act"" codifying transgenderism into civil rights, now promoted by Biden and Pelosi. Stefanik has been a consistent supporter of the transgender agenda. She also supported a local D.C. bill that would have forced pro-life groups to pay for abortions. In 2015, Congress had an opportunity to nullify the D.C. municipal law when Republicans were in the majority, but she voted against it.

Even on some of the energy issues that tend to unite both wings of the party, Stefanik joined with Democrats. She joined just two other Republicans in voting for the Climate Action Now Act, which would have forced Trump to stay in the Paris climate accord, and voted to block Trump's plan to drill for oil in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Indeed, the Liz Cheney problem extends to many Republicans, but even more so to Elise Stefanik. Why is it that you can be a liberal on immigration, social issues, taxes, and energy, yet as long as you praise Trump, you are fit to lead the party that is supposed to fight against those ideals?

This is the broader problem within the party. Republicans control 31 state legislatures, 19 of them with supermajorities. Yet it's so hard to pass conservative legislation because almost all the leaders and committee chairs are liberal on the issues that matter. Ditto for most Republican governors.



The dirty little secret is that there are Liz Cheneys in the majority of leadership positions in the GOP across the country. The only difference is that, in some way, Cheney is at least principled enough to stand by her views publicly, whereas the others remain undocumented Democrats and escape the ire of the base voters.

In reality, the fight over Liz Cheney should be a wake-up call to conservatives to make the upcoming primaries truly the most important election of our lifetime, especially at the state level where these issues matter most. Our republic will not rise or fall based on who is the third-ranking member of the GOP conference in an irremediably broken Congress. However, our future will depend on creating constitutional sanctuaries in red states, with leaders who actually represent our values. That begins with understanding where we went wrong. We didn't just appoint GOP leaders who opposed us on style and personality, but on the core values that matter at any given time.

In other words, many more Republicans in every red state need to be given the Liz Cheney treatment.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-remdesivir-is-the-greatest-scandal-of-the-pandemic,2021-05-06
Horowitz: Reversal of Roe will make state courts great again,"Leftists do not like legislative bodies and believe they should wield the least power precisely for the very reason Madison said: “In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates.” Legislators are elected by the people, constantly stand for re-election (most state legislators are in cycle every two years), all the proceedings are publicized, there are several layers of public votes, and the process in every state (except Nebraska) is bicameral. This is why leftists instead love the courts and bureaucracies, because they can achieve their goals without the disinfecting power of public scrutiny and without the deterrent of public reprisal.

Anyone who supports democratic values should embrace the opportunity to steer contentious issues away from the courts and toward legislative bodies. Obviously, state legislatures are the best suited to deal with contentious issues – not only because they are the closest to the people but also because there are 50 states. We have a divided country and can easily sort out our divisions through a degree of political and even physical self-separating. The reality is that not a single Democrat-controlled state will vote to curtail abortions, because the Supreme Court did nothing but reverse the judicial interference in the issue to ensure that legislatures are free to deal with it.

In light of the fallout from the impending reversal of Roe, there is an uncanny and somewhat perverse political dichotomy unfolding between the two parties. Republicans seem to be defending the “independence” of the court and exalting it to this supreme status above the other branches. Democrats, on the other hand, are trying to delegitimize judicial power because of the perception that they will face a long-term conservative majority on the court. However, if both sides really placed democratic values over politics, they would agree to a grand bargain to devolve power on every contentious issue to the states. This would mean that all cases adjudicating novel rights that only leftists believe in would be dealt with in the respective states. But it would also mean that cases dealing with gun rights would be up to the states.

Don’t get me wrong, I fully believe that there is a difference between bogus rights and foundational rights spelled out in the federal Constitution, such as self-defense, and that should be binding on the states. Ideally, we have the right to petition a federal court for redress if our gun rights are infringed upon. But if that is going to allow courts to perpetuate judicial supremacy and use it as a cudgel over red states, I’m more than glad to devolve all these issues to the states.

Such an arrangement would unfortunately cement the status of blue states as incorrigible Marxist dictatorships, but they are already there anyway. The courts – including the so-called conservative Supreme Court – have barely laid a glove on the COVID fascist regime in blue states. And many courts have prevented red states from blocking these tyrannical laws, such as federal courts requiring red states and counties to have mask mandates.

Conservatives would be naive not to push for a grand bargain ending judicial supremacy. We would benefit so much more than we lose. At present, we rarely benefit from judicial oversight when blue states violate foundational rights, yet we get crushed in red states by the courts vitiating every commonsense policy by creating phantom rights. As of now, we have a “conservative” Supreme Court that has prevented red states from cleaning up homeless encampments, from defining marriage, from keeping the sexes separate in private bathrooms and dressing rooms, from keeping sports sperate, from enforcing immigration law, and from many aspects of fighting crime.

However, let us not forget that for those who still like judicial oversight over broadly political issues, it’s not like the state legislatures won’t have competition. Overshadowed in the politics of the U.S. Supreme Court is the fact that all 50 states have their own constitutions and state judiciaries, including courts of last resort. Let’s not forget, it wasn’t until 1875, in the twilight of the Reconstruction era, that Congress transferred authority over most constitutional questions from state courts to lower federal courts, and it wasn’t until 1914 that Congress granted the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over all cases heard by state supreme courts.

Thus, all these decisions we see from the federal courts creating phantom rights can still be done on the state level with regard to the state constitutions – for better or worse. If Democrats so fervently want to enshrine their morals and political aspirations into constitutions, they can do so in the states they control.

Except there is one difference. State judiciaries, for the most part, are elected either initially or through retention ballot. There are only seven states where the voters never get a crack at judicial selection: Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Most of them are solid blue states, and Rhode Island is the only state that mirrors the federal system, in which the judges are never subject to review by the voters and serve a lifetime tenure. In four of those states, the judges are subject to a specific term and must at least stand for re-nomination before the legislature, and New Hampshire and Massachusetts have an age tenure limit of 70.

Inevitably, given the polarization of our society, we disagree not only on policy but on the Constitution itself. This is why any case implicating a constitutional right will invariably be political. Thus, if we are going to place politics in the courts, it’s better to do it in the bodies that are elected and closer to the people.

Collectively, this will make state judicial elections great again and will make state legislatures more consequential and powerful. If we are going to have the courts decide every political and social issue, let’s at least have this debate at the local level. Yes, there will be times when the labyrinth of state laws and constitutionally protected rights might get confusing and even clash, but I’d rather a patchwork of law than uniformity of tyranny.



This is also a wake-up call to conservatives in red states. Many conservatives focus solely on congressional elections, but they need to pay attention to state judicial races. A lot of red states have non-partisan elections, which allows stealth leftists to glide into office. It might be a good idea to make these elections partisan. Let’s face it: There is nothing in politics that is not partisan, especially as it relates to the most consequential legal questions. Let’s be open about it and sort out our disagreements through the diversity of the 50 states. That is the only way to agree to disagree in an agreeable fashion.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-replacing-liz-cheney-with-elise-stefanik-is-the-whole-problem-with-the-gop,2022-05-06
Horowitz: Ruling class openly saying fascism and masks will NEVER end. Will we FINALLY wake up?,"You can't blame people for not believing last March that ""15 days to flatten the curve"" would transmogrify into ""restrict your breathing with a mask and lock you down until there is a vaccine."" Nobody could have imagined such an absurd conspiracy theory, especially after months of those measures failing to achieve the goal.

Yet now that the vaccine is being administered swiftly and the fascists are doubling down on the masking – literally – if you still think this will end on its own, you are willfully blind. Either we make it end, or we will be masking our humanity for the rest of our lives.



Consider the following:

Despite the fact that we appear close to hitting the de facto herd immunity threshold with so many people already having had the virus, the government now has the perfect pretext to continue the fascism and move the goal posts. Dr. Fauci recently said that we are all at a very high risk of getting the new strains of the virus, particularly the South African variant, even if we already had the virus. Never mind the fact that cases dropped nearly 88% in South Africa over the past three weeks.

OK, so this is what the vaccine is for, right? Well, indeed, this is why Fauci is telling us to get the vaccine even if we had the virus. But have you ever heard of a virus whose slight mutation is somehow not covered by natural immunity but is covered by the vaccine?

Which brings us to the next step. Yes, they absolutely are pushing the vaccine because the cronies must get rich off it. But will they let you out of mask jail after receiving a dose? Not a chance. They are all openly saying you will need to keep the sacred rituals alive even after having gotten the vaccine and natural immunity.

Thus, we have lockdowns and masks, which are so effective … that they can't work and require a vaccine to do their jobs, but even with a vaccine and natural immunity, they still don't work, so this charade of mask-wearing must go on! Also, they are so effective that if you don't wear one, you are almost murdering someone. Never mind the fact that the curve rises and falls at the same time by region, regardless of non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Not only haven't they eased off on the mask religion, even as so many people have gotten the virus and have gotten the vaccine, they are doubling down and tripling down, which in itself is a tacit concession that one mask has failed miserably, as they themselves predicted before the issue became political. What started out as an insane conspiracy theory is now mainstream, with Fauci now floating the idea of the CDC recommending the absurdity of double and triple masking. Never mind that Biden's own adviser, Dr. Michael Osterholm, explained the obvious fact that this will further weaken the already improperly worn seal on the first mask and further push the aerosols out the sides – all the while magnifying all the physical problems caused by long-term masking.

Then again, is wearing two masks outside a clinical setting any more absurd than wearing one? Osterholm himself ridiculed the idea – not in March, but as late as June, after it had already become a religion. He has consistently described in great detail how the cloth and surgical masks are nowhere near effective in blocking an aerosol of microscopic viral particles. So why are we supposed to believe him now that he became Biden's adviser when he says they do work? And why should we believe Fauci, who says that two masks work when one didn't work, if Osterholm is saying that two don't work just like he used to say one doesn't work, before he became a politician? Are you confused yet?

Here is a transcript of what Osterholm said on June 12 in a video interview with the Midway Chamber of Commerce (beginning at the 39:23 mark):

So all the data we would have say at this point that just masking of itself with a cloth mask, or a surgical mask, surely may reduce the number of particles you put out, big particles, or the big particles you get in, but it's the little particles that are coming along the sides that are the real problem. And so I'm telling you, I would throw the kitchen sink at this thing if I thought that it would make a difference. Masks are not a major issue, and by the way, in 1918, there were actually some very exhaustive studies done on masks after that, and John Barry, the historian who we work with closely, will tell you not one of them found that they made any difference.



Number two is, just think about this, common sense, this is a group of commonsense people here. The area of the world where geographically we had the most, the highest frequency of mask-wearing as just a social/cultural event was in China, Hubei Province, China, in November and December of last year. Did that mask-wearing have any impact on that emergence of that horrible, horrible city-on-fire situation? I mean, that was one where we had virtually everyone wearing a mask publicly. It didn't make a difference, and so I only say this because if you want to wear masks, go ahead, feel free. I worry, though, that people who are at risk of having severe disease will take that mask and have now assumed a level of protection that they don't really have and then put themselves in harm's way, in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise. And so there's a downside to that. Finally, I just find the social/political pressure, you know, today, if you don't wear a mask, oh my God what a bad person you are, so you know, and unfortunately we've now come to make judgments, not on science, but on basically emotions, and I worry about that, because this one's not kind of a big one. But what if we start saying, okay, all heavy people, we're going to do this to you because you're at risk of getting this disease more, or all people who are of this age, we're going to do this to you because you're at higher risk? And they can say well, you know, I'm using the same basis for making those recommendations that I made for the masks; maybe it will help. And at some point you just, I'm just a scientist, a poor lowly scientist, I'm just sitting here telling you, you know, the data, you make a decision, how you decide, and I'm telling you right now that I, the masking is not an issue.

Look at those profound concerns he expressed! Every one of them has been proven right today, as the virus spread out of control months after the mandates were in place with a more religious degree of adherence and public shaming than anyone ever thought possible. Why are we to trust him now, when the science behind what he said has actually been proven by every epidemiological curve? How can he go from ridiculing mask-wearing to making it so sacred that we should violate every law of human rights and dignity, including for children, the elderly, and disabled, in order to enforce it?

The more information that comes out showing children are in less danger of getting sick from or spreading COVID than the flu, the more they double down on masking children, even during recess and sports. A survey of over 2,000 high school athletes in Minnesota who had to play with masks showed that 80% had a hard time breathing, 52% experienced excessive fatigue, and 48 players report going to an urgent care. Thus, no amount of science or evidence is able to stop this sadistic obsession with masks.

Some of you might be wondering what happened to OSHA? Don't they have standards on PPE wearing in the workplace and safety guidelines dictating the parameters, types, and exemptions of those wearing masks? Well, they have changed their standards. It has long been the policy of OSHA that respirators, such as an N-95s, are the minimum standard for personal protective equipment, as Dr. Osterholm said in June. Now OSHA is requiring employers to force upon their workers unsafe practices that just a year ago would have gotten those employers prosecuted, with OSHA leading the charge.

Where does this leave us? The more the science shows the endless hypocrisy and absurdity of mask-wearing to stop a virus, the more the ruling elites violate the science and their own prior standards and warnings with even greater absurdities. Miraculously, a new pretext always materializes just at the moment they have milked dry the original excuse for mask-wearing. Those goal posts will never remain in place.

The time to stand up and say NO is now. The time to fight back in state legislatures and with ADA lawsuits is now. The time to pull out of public and private schools that engage in this abuse is now. The time to support those businesses that stand up to this evil and boycott Karen businesses is now.

"Horowitz: Shocking report: 55% of Brits have antibodies, despite 12 months of restrictions","You mean we did all that for nothing?

Originally, we were told that governments can assume unprecedented control over our lives, businesses, and even our own faces for the goal of not overrunning hospitals. A year later, as we come increasingly close to herd immunity, not only are hospitals in no danger of being overrun, but it turns out that people have likely contracted the virus at a rate that would have occurred without any of these restrictions – and their calamitous damage to society. Twelve months later, it's all pain and no gain.

We've always known that the number of confirmed COVID cases in a given region is only a fraction of the likely infection rate. Now, according to Great Britain's Office for National Statistics (ONS), 54.7% of people in England in a random sample of 30,000 have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which includes people who have had been infected or have been vaccinated. Those are the sort of numbers we were promised would happen only if we just ""let the virus rip"" without any non-pharmaceutical interventions, aka lockdowns and mask-wearing. But it turns out that the virus was always gonna virus, regardless of what hocus-pocus was thrown in front of it.

The survey, conducted from December 7 to March 14, also revealed the antibody levels in the other areas of Great Britain: 50.5% in Wales, 49.3% in Northern Ireland, and 42.6% in Scotland. As the Daily Mail observes, ""The figure is likely to be even higher now because millions more have been vaccinated since the blood tests were conducted a fortnight ago, and it takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in.""

Also, many people don't produce antibodies or their antibodies wane quickly because the T cells warded off the virus without major symptoms. It is therefore likely that if 55% of Brits have antibodies, a supermajority of citizens are already immune.

We have no way of knowing how much of the seroprevelance is from the vaccinations and how much is from infection, but many other countries have had aggressive vaccination programs and still do not have as few cases as Great Britain currently has. That tells you there is a lot of built-up immunity from the earlier waves of infection.

Here are the latest death numbers from Worldometer.

This data demonstrates that the entire 12-month premise of lockdowns and masks to slow the spread was a lie (after the original lie of flatten the curve), and even more so, any continuation of these policies after most people have immunity is built upon a dastardly lie. Even if the new goal has changed illogically from decreasing the burden on the hospitals to slowing the growth of cases, it's quite evident that these measures don't work. We have now achieved well over 50% immunity between infection and vaccines in most Western countries, built on 12 months of masochist public policy designed to preclude that immunity.



Despite cases slowing to a trickle for the past two months, Britain is still under a strict lockdown. Restaurants, hotels, stadiums, and even indoor mixing in groups of six or more are still being regulated until May 17, as well as all international travel. Even nonessential retail and gyms are closed for another week.

Ironically, this news comes at a time of global panic over the ""Kent"" British variant of the virus, which was supposedly super deadly and contagious, yet Britain itself barely had any cases since the variant was discovered. Which demonstrates that this is all about natural geographical and seasonal patters of spread that will continue everywhere until herd immunity is built up, not about specific variants or non-pharmaceutical interventions.



What this likely shows is that immunity from both infection and the vaccines works against different variants of the virus, as one would expect, but only those who had a high degree of natural immunity are close to herd immunity. Serbia, which also has high vaccination rates like Great Britain, is still going through its latest wave of deaths.

The difference between Serbia and Great Britain is obvious because Serbia, like most Eastern European countries, didn't experience much of a wave earlier last year. Consequentially, the country has less built up natural immunity on top of the vaccinations.



Texas, like Great Britain, has probably come close to herd immunity, which is why three weeks after getting rid of the mask mandate, and with the Kent variant as the dominant strain throughout Texas, the virus is at its lowest level since it started.

The Czech Republic, on the other hand, was touted as the world champion masking country, yet it failed to protect this nation from experiencing the worst surge in Europe.

By hook or by crook, we will reach herd immunity. The question is whether we will to continue to needlessly destroy humanity in the process.

Horowitz: How Republican-controlled state legislatures can rectify election fraud committed by courts and governors,"Who determines the outcome of the presidential election in a given state? Governors? Secretaries of state or boards of election superintendents? The courts? Fox News' decision desk? Nope. The president wins a state when electors selected by state legislatures conduct a vote in their respective states on Dec. 14. Thus, ultimately, according to the Constitution, the state legislators wind up serving as the kingmakers in a disputed election.



Endless pots of unverified mail-in ballots that often fail to meet state election law standards weren't created overnight at 3 a.m. on Nov. 4. They were created by a mix of illegal administrative actions taken by Democrat administrations in the key states and state and lower federal courts overriding long-standing state election laws. This has been going on for years, but accelerated to a fever pitch over the past few months.

The Constitution, in Art. I, §4, cl. 1, gives state legislatures the power over the times, methods, and procedures of elections and provides no ""public health emergency"" exception that enables governors or judges to override them and create a new system for elections. At its core, this is why we have such post-election chaos, and it was by design – set in motion for years by the courts and crystalized over the past few months by using COVID-19 to remake the in-person voting electorate into a postal ballot free-for-all, in what Justice Gorsuch described as the greatest judicial intervention in elections in 230 years.

Well, now state legislatures can have their revenge and have the final say, as intended by the Constitution. Mark Levin reminded his audience today that state legislatures are the ones who choose the electors who directly vote for president in each state.

In case you think this is some desperate tactic Levin has concocted because he doesn't like the impending results of the state ballot tallies, he has been warning about this for months. While everyone slept as the courts rewrote election law, Levin, a constitutional lawyer, warned on Sept. 18, ""As in Pennsylvania, the Michigan legislature is controlled by the Republicans. They must meet in emergency session and exercise their Article II power under the federal Constitution and seize back control over the election system.""

In the run-up to the election, courts have allowed ""late voting, namely submission of ballots after Election Day so long as they are postmarked before. In addition, a Michigan court allowed ballot-harvesting under certain circumstances, which appears to have occurred late at night in Wayne County. There has been a series of rulings or administrative decisions in numerous states, which are contrary to state law and in some cases federal election law, that enabled Democrats to upend the electoral process – putting aside questions of additional fraud in the early morning of Nov. 4.

Liberals say they want every vote to count, but having votes submitted by insidious special-interest groups that violate the terms and conditions of absentee balloting ensures that the lawfully cast votes of individuals indeed do not count. We can debate the policy merits of some of these anomalous voting procedures, but everyone agrees that state legislatures control the process. In many blue states, they have already codified Democrat priorities on ballot-harvesting, registration deadlines (or lack thereof), and weak voter verification systems. But in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, there were laws on the books that were illegally ignored by the Democrat governors and the courts.

In his 2005 book ""Men in Black,"" Levin noted that the reason the Supreme Court ruling on the Florida recount in 2000 was final was not because the courts are supreme over the electoral process. Quite the contrary, the Supreme Court was merely rectifying a mistake the state court made, because Democrats were the ones who involved the courts in the election process to begin with. But why did Al Gore ultimately accept the decision in Bush v. Gore?

""The Florida legislature could have (and, in fact, was preparing) to intervene and name a slate of electors if the Florida Supreme Court continued to interfere with the election,"" wrote Levin on page 170. ""The legislature, which was controlled by the Republican Party in 2000, had absolute authority under the Constitution to choose Florida's members of the electoral college.""

Art. II, Sec. 1, §2 of the Constitution stipulates that ""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct"" the electors to vote for president. The Constitution gives Congress the authority to set the date of that vote, which, pursuant to 3 U.S.C. §7, is the Monday after the second Wednesday in December of presidential election years. This year it is Dec. 14.

Notice how the Constitution specifically gives the job of choosing electors to the legislature, and unlike with standard legislation, there is no shared jurisdiction or responsibility with the governor, much less some random state or federal judge. Charles Pinckney, one of the signers of the Constitution from South Carolina, reiterated on the Senate floor on Jan. 23, 1800, how careful the framers were to cut Congress out of the process.

""The Electors are to be appointed by each State, and the whole direction as to the manner of their appointment is given to the State Legislatures,"" said Pinckney during a Senate debate. ""Nothing was more clear … that Congress had no right to meddle with it at all; as the whole was entrusted to the State Legislatures, they must make provision for all questions arising on the occasion.""



Technically, this means that state legislatures could even appoint electors and completely avoid or cancel out popular election ballots we have today, at least for the president and vice president. This was the practice in some states in the early days of the republic. As Justice Joseph Story wrote in his 1833 ""Commentaries on the Constitution,"" state legislatures choosing the electors themselves ""has been firmly established in practice, ever since the adoption of the constitution, and does not now seem to admit of controversy, even if a suitable tribunal existed to adjudicate upon it.""

Indeed, in 1892 (McPherson v. Blacker), in upholding Michigan's practice of dividing the state's electors by congressional district (as done today in Maine and Nebraska), the Supreme Court wrote, ""The legislature possesses plenary authority to direct the manner of appointment, and might itself exercise the appointing power by joint ballot or concurrence of the two houses, or according to such mode as it designated."" In Bush v. Gore, the high court reiterated that any state legislature ""may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself.""

Obviously, none of us wants to abolish popular elections, but why would the Constitution even grant state legislatures such power? Well, the framers understood that, unlike Congress, these are the bodies that are closest and most accountable to the people, and unlike judges or executives (state or federal), they are numerous in a deliberative body and won't wield unilateral authority without some degree of consensus.

By overriding the legislatures in how to properly conduct the popular elections that choose these presidential electors, the courts and governors have disenfranchised their voters. A Michigan court extended Election Day for two weeks. A Pennsylvania court, along with the Democrat secretary of state, essentially nullified signature verification for mail-in ballots.

Thus, if there is ample evidence of voter fraud that would be sufficient to alter the will of the people through this popular election, it is incumbent upon the state legislatures in those states to reclaim their authority over the Electoral College and rectify the fraud that has upended our election process.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-shocking-report-55-of-brits-have-antibodies-despite-12-months-of-restrictions,2020-11-05
Horowitz: The need for states to thwart federal persecution of political opponents,"If COVID was the pretext to criminalize our bodies, then January 6 was the ploy to criminalize our social and political views. The regime is now arresting people for merely protesting regime policies without committing an actionable crime simply because they are political opponents. Meanwhile, regime supporters can directly call for violence, have their supporters follow up and attempt to assassinate a Supreme Court justice, and the regime will continue to praise the protesters and even insinuate the coming of a “mini-revolution.” The past week’s events have made it clear we need a national divorce and cannot live harmoniously with these people. As such, it’s time for red-state governors to protect the civil rights of political dissidents with as much vigor as the regime has for violating them.



On Thursday, a team of FBI stormtroopers raided the Michigan home of Ryan Kelley, one of the leading GOP candidates for governor. His crime? Being at the protest outside the Capitol. The Feds accused him of “gesturing” to protesters to storm the Capitol and used some comments he made during the heat of the protest to incriminate him; however, the proof being in the pudding, Kelly never entered the Capitol at all. Using this as the threshold for arrest, millions of BLM protesters should be sitting in jail, when in fact even those who burned, beat, looted, and vandalized were never cited, much less punished. Oh, and he was arrested by the same Michigan FBI office that was engaged in entrapment and basically concocted the kidnapping plot against Governor Whitmer. As Julie Kelly reported, “More than a dozen FBI undercover agents and informants were involved in the kidnapping caper; Dan Chappel, the lead informant, was compensated at least $60,000 by the FBI for six months’ work, paid in cash for services rendered, and reimbursement for expenses.”

Obviously, the arrest of Ryan Kelley coincides with the Hollywood documentary-style January 6 committee hearings and is a day after Biden promised Jimmy Kimmel he would send his political opponents to jail for not playing by the rules. In a sadistic twist of irony, in that same interview, he “predicted’ a “mini-revolution” if Roe is overturned, even though the day before, a young man was arrested for an attempted assassination of Justice Kavanaugh for potentially overturning Roe.

So here are the rules of the game. Democrats can directly call for violence, have their supporters take up the call, and they are not held politically accountable and even double down on their comments. Yet for any individual involved in a protest or – in the case of Peter Navarro and law professor John Eastman – merely giving a legal opinion on something that was associated with violent acts of a selected few individuals (encouraged by FBI agents like Ray Epps) – their legal and political opinions or forms of protest are now deemed criminal acts.

Remember Chuck Schumer’s comments about releasing a “whirlwind” against Gorsuch and Kavanaugh?

""I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price,"" Schumer, who was then minority leader, said at the time. ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

Keep in mind, there are no elections for Supreme Court, so there is no way he could have meant these words figuratively, about an election, in the heat of political debate. There is only one thing he could have meant, and now we have ubiquitous protests outside their homes and one individual as an alleged assassin. I’m not suggesting we head down the slippery slope of criminalizing Schumer’s words, but the government is criminalizing any opinion even if there is no violence inherent in the words.

We constantly hear the left wax poetic about the degree of violence on January 6, the damage, and the threat to slaughter thousands of people, even though, interestingly enough, all of the videos only seem to show violence outside, but those in the Capitol either did nothing or goofed off. Some even exchanged friendly words with officers in the Senate chamber.

Yet these same people seem to forget that dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in a BLM riot at the White House in May 2020. What about the broader scope of the BLM riots?

According to a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA):

There were 574 riots in the U.S. and Canada between May 25 and July 31, 2020, stemming from about 8,700 protest events.

More than 2,000 officers were injured in those riots.

72% of major city law enforcement agencies had officers harmed during the protests.

More than half of major city law enforcement agencies (56%) experienced arson incidents.

In Minneapolis alone, rioters burned down more than 1,500 businesses, as well as police stations and schools, and caused over $500 million in damages. Nationwide, there was between $1 and $2 billion in insurance claims for damages from the riots. Yet not only did no Democrat condemn the violence, as every conservative condemned the violence on January 6, Democrats praised it, encouraged it, joined it, declared it a new civil rights movement, and dedicated memorials and ostensibly a new national holiday to it. Across the nation, even those who committed the worst forms of arson got off with a slap on the wrist, and most of the extremely violent rioters in Portland had their charges dropped. Oh, and unlike January 6, they didn’t need FBI agent provocateurs to get violent, they did it on their own.

According to the Oregonian, out of 974 criminal cases stemming from the Portland riots over the past several months, 666 were dropped by Multnomah District Attorney Mike Schmidt. Moreover, only seven out of the 39 arrests for assaulting police officers resulted in charges being filed. The outlet even found 18 individuals who were arrested three or more times throughout the rioting since May. Nearly all the charges have been dropped.

The Oregonian further found that even some of the cases that were initially listed as having criminal charges lodged against the defendant were later dropped. ""But court records show prosecutors have subsequently decided to drop all charges in at least 22 of these cases, some that have included allegations of riot, burglary and unlawful use of a weapon.""

This is not a mere double standard; this is a systematic persecution in the most grotesque form of anarcho-tyranny. It’s quite evident that Democrats will work assiduously to protect their political supporters, even those who commit the most heinous acts. Isn’t it time for Republican governors to protect our political supporters, especially those who never committed a violent act or any criminal act?

Many red states are contemplating a “Second Amendment sanctuary,” but there is an even more urgent need to establish a First Amendment sanctuary. All GOP governors, backed by their respective legislatures, should announce in press conferences that state troopers will prohibit the entry of federal agents to arrest any political opponent where there is no evidence the target has committed an act of violence. They should also refuse to work with the FBI on any other issue until this crisis is resolved.



One such bill has been introduced in Oklahoma by state Senator Nathan Dahm. SB 1166, the “Prohibition on Political Prisoners in Oklahoma Act,” would prohibit the federal government from transporting any January 6 prisoner through the state if they are not being charged with a felony.

If Democrat states can become sanctuaries to protect illegal alien sex offenders from ICE, then you better believe red states should become sanctuaries for Americans targeted by the regime simply because of their political opposition.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-state-legislatures-rectify-election-fraud,2022-06-13
Horowitz: Tennessee lawmakers introduce bill to prevent businesses from discriminating against customers without masks,"In our society, businesses are sued for not looking at customers the right way or for not taking expensive actions to accommodate the needs of employees and customers through OSHA, ADA regulations, and anti-discrimination laws. Since when did it become OK, then, for businesses to force customers and employees to take very definite actions against their bodily integrity, such as wearing face masks, no matter their personal conditions? A group of conservatives are pushing a bill in the Tennessee legislature to address this problem, and it just might become a model for other states.

Tennessee is one of 12 states that currently does not criminalize breathing without a Chinese face burka, but the damage done by the local and federal mandates has made businesses feel as if they need to enforce it to cover their backs. Despite no statewide mask mandate and overall fewer restrictions than other states, RINO Gov. Bill Lee he has still declared going to church in person dangerous and tried to dictate to Tennesseans how many people with whom they could gather. He has also enabled and empowered localized health board tyranny instead of individual liberty, and even put out a video promoting face masks. Thus, like in every other state, Tennessee businesses are enforcing this mask tyranny on the citizenry.

A group of Tennessee lawmakers have introduced the Medical Non-Discrimination Business and Consumer Act (SB 0320/ HB 0794) to ensure that businesses are not enforcing what government is clearly incapable of doing. It is also designed to place anti-discrimination and disability laws vis-à-vis mask-wearing in line with every other practice of business regulation that prevents even private businesses from wholesale discrimination, invasion of medical privacy, and violation of the ADA.

Specifically, this bill would prohibit a person from denying an individual the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation, resort, or amusement on the grounds of the wearing or use of a medical device, or whether the individual has received medical treatment, such as a vaccine.

On a practical level, this bill would prevent grocery stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and gyms from requiring masks or proof of vaccination in order to receive services. This is in line with current anti-discrimination law as it relates to every other facet of society. Just a year ago businesses would have been shut down for the rampant and cruel discrimination they are engaging in today.

Pursuant to the ADA (36.201), no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods and services, without retaliation or coercion (36.206) covering any condition whether a physical or mental impairment (36.302.1) wherein mere presence does not constitute direct threat, even if contagious or noncontagious with transmissible diseases (36.302.b.2, 36.208).

Universal masking within businesses is unattainable because it does not address the chaos variable of the many who have an ADA right to reasonable accommodation to receive full access to goods and services, and you do not get to know what is wrong with them. Exemptions include PSTD from trauma, rape, and bound torture, autism, cancer, COPD, asthma, lung disease, pregnancy, and exposure/illness. Yet masking is the one thing that can violate anti-discrimination and disability laws, despite the fact that masks are worthless in combatting a respiratory virus.

Thus, this bill would merely place mask policies in line with every other ADA and anti-discrimination regulation we enforce on businesses today. It takes away the liability that businesses would potentially incur for allowing people to come in without a mask. It further prohibits local governments within the state of Tennessee from enforcing such mandates, a step Gov. Lee has failed to take until now.

The Senate bill is sponsored by Sen. Joey Hensley, and the House bill is sponsored by Rep. Susan Lynn. The bill is being promoted statewide by Tennessee Stands, a grassroots organization promoting a more rational approach to the virus.



Are you sick of the left regulating businesses into oblivion, then suddenly empowering them to enforce the ultimate form of discrimination when it comes to their sacred masks? If a mom-and-pop bakery must bake a cake for a gay wedding when the couple can find one hundred other businesses willing to service their event, then certainly businesses can't shut off all vital goods and services to a human being for merely breathing, especially when there is no evidence they even have the virus. Moreover, if ""businesses can do whatever they want,"" then businesses can open without capacity restrictions or other lockdown policies. It's time to apply anti-discrimination law and business regulations as a two-way street.

Let's be clear, unless this legislation is passed in all the 31 states with GOP-controlled legislatures, the mask cult will never end. It's time to even up the score and push back against government tyranny with equal and opposing force. The Medical Non-Discrimination Business and Consumer Act is that opposing force we've been waiting for.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-states-must-block-political-persecution,2021-02-15
Horowitz: The abuse of schoolchildren continues even in the reddest states,"Despite a full year's worth of science and data showing that kids in school are not at risk at all from this virus and that they are not meaningful vectors of spread, even the reddest of states are making them the last to get a reprieve from the mask fascism, rather than the first. This is likely the most radical policy ever implemented in our lifetimes. The muted response from most established conservative officials and organizations is shocking.

Yesterday, many conservatives celebrated yet another red state governor removing the mask mandate when Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon announced he would terminate the mandate by the end of the week. However, in his press release, he adds the following gem: ""The face covering protocol will remain in place in K-12 schools as a safety measure to ensure that classroom learning and all student activities can continue to occur safely.""

I guess a ""face covering protocol"" is one way to euphemize the criminalization of the breathing of our children for absolutely no scientific reason and with no legal justification. How a policy like this could ever have gotten off the ground in a state like Wyoming, much less be continued indefinitely, reveals a weakness of resolve in our own people.

What's worse than shutting down schools is acclimating children to a ""new normal"" of child abuse that, because it has the veneer of a return to normalcy, can continue long-term, if not forever. The bar of sanity was set so low from the get-go that the psychosis of masking children for a virus that affects them less than the flu will only get worse over time.

One school in the supposed red state of Ohio is now requiring double masking of children! Also in Ohio, a Dayton pediatrician is now warning about an increase in rhinovirus now that kids will return to school. The horror! Kids will now get the common cold again! Ironically, COVID has been so minimal for children that we forgot what it was like for significant portions of a class to be out of school with fever during the winter months. Ailments like strep throat, the flu, enterovirus, and other common infections will now be used as an excuse to either shut schools or forcibly mask children forever.

In fact, this is no joke. If imposing a severe form of abuse and prohibiting normal breathing of children for seven hours a day was implemented without a scintilla of blowback from most parents – all for a virus that doesn't affect the kids – it's not hard to see how the flu and even the common cold will be the new baseline for permanent masking. Despite the entire notion of regulating the lives of children being thoroughly discredited by the data, there is almost no county in the entire country where people can school their children without their faces being covered.

Data from Sweden published in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine examined ~2 million school-age children (ages 1 to 16) from March through June 2020, where there was no masking or other mitigation efforts, and found just 15 children (0.00075%) required hospitalization from COVID-19, and there was not a single reported death. They also found no greater risk of serious infection among teachers than the general population, adjusting for other variables. A similar study in Norway found remarkably low transmission in schools, even though there is no recommendation to wear masks.

With so few kids getting sick from this virus and so little evidence that masks work for anyone, why are we not considering the harmful effects of mask-wearing on children, sometimes as young as 3?

The first results of a German study of over 26,000 children and adolescents show 68% of parents reported impairments in their children as a result of mask-wearing, including the following side effects: irritability (60%), headache (53%), difficulty concentrating (50%), decreased happiness (49%), malaise (42%), impaired learning (38%), and fatigue (37%).



What are the benefits of this mandate, even if masks did work in stopping a spread, that could possibly justify this collateral damage? And what about the emotional damage? A 2010 paper from Harvard University observed the damage that can be caused by exposing them to endless fear and anxiety: ""Ensuring that young children have safe, secure environments in which to grow, learn, and develop healthy brains and bodies is not only good for the children themselves but also builds a strong foundation for a thriving, prosperous society,"" wrote the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child for Harvard University. ""Science shows that early exposure to circumstances that produce persistent fear and chronic anxiety can have lifelong consequences by disrupting the developing architecture of the brain.""

Has anyone bothered to study what masks do to children's wonderous God-given immune systems that have performed so well against this virus? How much bacteria do they help trap in the lungs of children? God didn't design us to have our noses and mouths covered, especially at the developmental stage of life.

Consider the fact that all of this harm was perpetrated against a generation of children for absolutely zero gain. The Peaster Independent School District of Parker County, Texas, for example, was one of the few counties in the country that never required masks or social isolation. According to Superintendent Lance Johnson, enrollment numbers were up this year, and it was one of the few districts in the country where the academic growth is tracking at grade level. ""Our kids have thrived and our teachers have thrived,"" he said. ""And it's just been real eye-opening to see how we've done things different than other schools.""

It turns out that the absentee rates among teachers were only slightly higher than at that time in 2019, which clearly indicates that the rate of infection among teachers was not any higher than the general community, as was witnessed in Sweden and Norway.

""18 months ago what we're doing to kids would've been criminal,"" said Johnson. ""And here we are fighting going back to that model, fighting letting kids be kids, and letting kids socialize and letting them have a normal school year.""

How can we accept another day of this in all those red states? Demand better.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-tennessee-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-prevent-businesses-from-discriminating-against-customers-without-masks,2021-03-10
Horowitz: The blueprint for ending COVID and COVID fascism in 2022,"Resolved, that the several states composing the United States of America, are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their General Government. ~ Thomas Jefferson, Kentucky Resolution

Republicans who maintain robust power in numerous red states need to commence 2022 with a simple New Year’s resolution: that they will actually fight back against federal fascism on all fronts and interpose themselves between the Washington tyrants and the liberties of their citizens. With nearly every legislature getting into session in the coming days, now is the time for the people’s voices to be heard.

If 2020-2021 was the Great Reset for the global elites, 2022 must be the Great Restoration for the ordinary citizens to launch a counterattack against the assault on our way of life. The counterattack begins in the state legislatures. What follows is a non-exclusive list of must-pass items if we are to remain a free and healthy society unshackled by the bio-medical state created in March 2020.

1) The Fight for Treatment of Our Sick

There is no greater liberty than the right to life. With gain-of-function bioweapons unleashed upon us, we should have the right to access, and doctors should have the right to provide, science-based treatment. The war on treatment of COVID has exposed the broken and corrupt government-corporate monopoly over medicine. In order to take back the personal right to remain alive and healthy, we need a bill that will accomplish the following:

a) Doctors must not be penalized with medical licensure threats because they share documented medical information or their own professional experience and observations concerning this or other viruses, treatments, or ailments. Those who speak up against public officials, if done in the public interest, may not suffer undue retaliation in the form of loss of board certification, licensure, or loss of privileges.

b) Doctors must also not be penalized for prescribing any off-label (but FDA-approved) drug that is clinically indicated to treat patients so long as they, unlike the vaccine cult, provide their patients with informed consent.

c) All medical licensing board officials should be subject to removal by the legislature.

d) All pharmacists must fill FDA-approved prescriptions for medications for off-label use so long as they are prescribed by a licensed practitioner. Failure to fill a prescription, absent a conscience objection, would result in a $100,000 fine or revocation of license.

e) All insurance companies operating in the state must cover any prescription written to treat viruses and cannot discriminate. If they can pay $3,000 for the failed and dangerous remdesivir, they can certainly pay for cheap, proven, and safe repurposed drugs.

f) Every state should set up a treatment page similar to what Florida did and encourage, rather than discourage, doctors to prescribe early and often.

g) All hospitalized patients must be allowed always to have one surrogate present in the hospital.

h) All hospitalized patients must be allowed to access FDA-approved drugs off-label prescribed by a doctor at their own expense if they agree to assume liability, along with the right to refuse any hospital-prescribed treatment. A cause of action must be granted to patients to sue hospitals who violate the right-to-try law. All hospitals must be barred from “medical kidnapping,” whereby they prevent a patient from being released or transferred.

i) No patient can be denied an organ transplant on account of injection status.

2) The Fight for Control Over Our Bodies

a) A complete ban on the ability of any private or public-sector official to force an individual to wear a mask or get a shot. We must apply anti-discrimination law, ADA, and OSHA workplace standards evenly. The slate is not clean when it comes to such egregious human rights violations of “the private sector,” and we must not shy away from enforcing against the most inhumane breaches of existing laws and standards.

b) As it relates to public-sector mandates, there must be an effort to place constitutional amendments on the midterm ballots, where feasible, to codify bodily integrity rights into the state constitutions.

c) Prescribe prison time for any local official who forcibly masks children.

d) A ban on all discrimination by insurance companies in terms of coverage for those without the shot; a ban on all discrimination for goods and services in the realm of public accommodation; and a ban on all discrimination or punitive actions taken against any health care provider or patient for opting not to get the shots.

e) Institute a cause of action for citizens to take legal action against those who violate the ban and for anyone injured as a result of getting the shot due to intimidation in the workplace.

3) The Fight to Protect the National Guard

a) The state should assume full control of its National Guard and ensure that the guardsmen are not subject to the same mandate as the entirely federal military.

b) States should create their own non-federalized militias as landing places for soldiers residing within the state from the other branches of the military who are now out of a job.

4) The Fight for Medical Privacy

a) Nobody's vaccination status should be recorded without the affirmative consent of the patient.

b) A provision requiring schools to accept religious exemptions for all other vaccine mandates.

c) A ban on contact tracing or the forced quarantine of any individual who has not been infected with an actual disease that A) has been proven deadly and B) has not already proliferated through large portions of the population.

d) A categorical ban on the authority of any state or county official, including the governor, to issue a stay-at-home order or to shut down businesses carte blanche under the guise of public health.

5) The Fight for Transparency

a) Each state should form a temporary COVID committee to hold hearings and audits of all the current actions taken by the federal and respective state governments predicated on a purported scientific premise regarding the virus, the vaccines, or treatment. Based on the findings, any policy found to be out of sync with evidence of safety and efficacy must be terminated and defunded.

b) State legislative health care committees must conduct full investigations of the treatment of patients in hospitals. The scope of investigation should include an audit and analysis of the therapeutics used, the therapeutics rejected, the deviation from standard and established care for patients in respiratory distress, and any allegations of mistreatment or discriminatory actions taken by hospital staff.

c) Every state should pay for a full audit of every individual who died within the 30-day investigative window of taking the shot.

d) Every state should establish its own vaccine adverse event database and encourage, rather than discourage, doctors to use it.

e) All funding currently used for marketing the shots should be redirected toward funding and marketing proven treatments the committee will study.

6) The Fight for State Sovereignty



a) Every state should pass a law that enables the state legislature, through concurrent resolution, to declare any act of any of the three federal branches unconstitutional, thereby having the effect of criminalizing its enforcement within the state’s boundaries.

b) Legislatures, in accordance with the process to change state constitutions, must make it easier to get back into session immediately to deal with federal usurpations, so the people don’t have to wait 6-12 months for them to get back into session in do the people’s business.

Make sure there is someone in your state’s legislature championing each one of these items. If not now, then when; if not us, then whom? More than ever, we must remember the admonishment of John Adams in the pre-revolutionary times:

Let us contemplate our forefathers, and posterity, and resolve to maintain the rights bequeathed to us from the former, for the sake of the latter. The necessity of the times, more than ever, calls for our utmost circumspection, deliberation, fortitude and perseverance. Let us remember that “if we suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our liberty, we encourage it, and involve others in our doom.” It is a very serious consideration … that millions yet unborn may be the miserable sharers of the event.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-abuse-of-schoolchildren-continues-even-in-the-reddest-states,2022-01-05
Horowitz: The Constitution is immune to coronavirus power-grabs,"In a matter of 244 years, we have gone from the understanding that ""governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed"" to ""shut up, mask up, and obey your governors.""

Amid the reams of debate written on the data, science, math, and policies undergirding the unprecedented governmental response to coronavirus, there is shockingly very little discussion about the legality of crushing the most foundational rights imaginable. Can executive officials merely tout ""COVID"" in a sentence at a press conference and rule over our lives in any way they want for as long as they want? This is the discussion that was needed eight months ago, but there's no time like the present to embark on it.

Imagine if Joe Biden delivered a prime-time speech at a press conference and announced that because of the emergent times in which we live, allowing Trump to remain president was simply not an option and that for our safety he rigged the election to ensure Trump's defeat. Obviously, we would all be shocked by such a statement and would all move to counter his hypothetical play.

Well, this has actually happened, but with much more severe consequences than even stealing an election. What is worse than election fraud is governing fraud. What's worse than someone illegally obtaining office is for someone to use that office to crush civil liberties and life itself, even if legitimately elected. Yet, for eight months, governors and mayors have been able to publicly announce a press conference and rule over our lives via press statements or tweets without any pushback.

The normally mild-mannered Justice Alito warned last month at the Federalist Society convention (which, of course, had to be remote) that ""we have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged"" and that these executive orders have produced ""previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty.""

Alito noted, as I did in May, that the smallpox vaccine case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), which is being used by lower court judges to greenlight coronavirus fascism, affected ""a local measure that targeted a problem of limited scope."" On the other hand, ""it did not involve sweeping restrictions imposed across the country for an extended emergency.""

He warned of a crisis of executive power-grabs indefinitely. ""All sorts of things can be called an emergency or disaster of major proportions,"" Alito reminded the audience. ""Simply slapping on that label cannot provide the ground for abrogating our most fundamental rights. And whenever fundamental rights are restricted, the Supreme Court and other courts cannot close their eyes.""

In a constitutional republic, elections aren't even that important. There are limits on what an elected official can do. Thus, the collateral damage from a stolen election, if one believes this election was stolen, is not even that impactful, assuming we are following the rule of law on every other issue. Even when you legitimately win an election, you don't get to rule over the lives, liberty, property, and even bodily integrity of the mouths and noses of those you defeat. We've had this systemic governing fraud all year, and few Republicans or even self-described conservatives have rigorously fought back the way anyone would if someone openly admitted to stealing the election.

It's important that, just like an abused wife, the American people understand that this is not OK. It's not OK for a husband to abuse a wife even if he feels he has valid grievances with her or that it's for her own good. The first step to evacuating someone from that relationship is to make them realize they are indeed being abused.

Likewise, Americans must understand this not part of the contract document we signed with government. Certain things are off-limits. Take a look at this chart from the Workplace Mental Health Institute showing 15 signs of an abusive relationship and ask yourself how many of them don't apply to our current relationship with government vis-à-vis this virus.

Stops you from seeing friends and won't let you go out without permission? Check



Tells you what to wear, monitors your communications? Big-time!

Won't let you work? Like never before!

Controls what you watch, read, say, and won't allow you to question anything? Censorship galore!

Punishes you for not keeping those rules and tell you it's for your own good? That's the whole point!

Calls you names and blames you for everything? That's the name of the game!

In fact, I can't think of a single warning sign that doesn't perfectly describe the relationship of government and its elite allies with the American people. This chart should serve as a gut-punch and a wake-up call to evacuate from this ""new normal"" before it's too late.

We've all forgotten that aside from habeas corpus during a rebellion, no other fundamental right can be abrogated even during a time of emergency. As it states in Art. 44 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights: ""That the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and of this State, apply, as well in time of war, as in time of peace; and any departure therefrom, or violation thereof, under the plea of necessity, or any other plea, is subversive of good Government, and tends to anarchy and despotism.""



In other words, the following usurpations are null and void:

Open-ended curfews

Shutting down or restricting businesses and private schools

Restricting even small personal gatherings

Forced quarantine even of people who don't have the virus or using faulty or no due process to push quarantine

Treating an uncovered mouth and nose like nudity

Interstate travel bans

Republicans will have the trifecta of control in 24 state governments this year. In 31 states, they will hold both chambers of the legislature. Where is the effort to push a declaration of rights reaffirming these principles?

Likewise, at the federal level, Republicans are close to passing another ""stimulus"" to bail out the states from the deleterious effects of their unconstitutional lockdowns. But before throwing more money at them, why not attach a set of conditions to that money to protect civil liberties?

Why not empower the DOJ to better enforce U.S. Code Title 18, Sec 242, which prohibits any elected official from using ""law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom"" to deprive any person of ""any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution""?

Where are the Republican Senate candidates in Georgia? Have you heard them speak truth to power on this issue? Where is the political party that represents the people during the greatest period of authoritarian rule since the settlement of this continent?

Let us never forget the warning of C.S. Lewis: ""Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-blueprint-for-ending-covid-and-covid-fascism-in-2022,2020-12-07
Horowitz: The difference between Washington’s birthday and ‘Presidents’ Day’ is the difference between liberty and tyranny,"No, we are not celebrating Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Woodrow Wilson, or Millard Fillmore this week. We are supposed to be celebrating George Washington. In other words, we are not celebrating the majestic power of the chief executive of the United States government in the abstract, but the humble leadership of one man who, until recently, successfully set the precedent of the presidency being wielded as an office of limited power rather than the power of a king.

Before George Washington's birthday was hijacked and replaced with a generic ""Presidents' Day,"" Feb. 22 was a day to celebrate the father of our country. According to the Congressional Research Service, George Washington's birthday, to be celebrated on Feb. 22, was first conceived as a federal holiday on Jan. 31, 1879. It wasn't until 1968, when Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in order to give government workers even more time off, that the holiday was moved to the third Monday in February. Although the name was never officially changed, having the date of celebration disconnected from Washington's actual birthday has allowed the original purpose of the holiday to become nearly obsolete, like every other meaningful American tradition.

Because Washington refused to become king when he had the opportunity on two occasions, and instead opted to humbly serve his country as its first elected president, the observance of his birthday is really a celebration of our Constitution and the entire republican system of governance upon which our nation depends. In that sense, ""Presidents' Day,"" aka George Washington's birthday, is truly a day to recognize that we are a republic, not a monarchy, when the president can now literally rule over our bodies and criminalize our breathing of free air.

In a revolutionary break from the rest of the 18th-century political world, the newly crafted Constitution vested the president with executive authority to faithfully execute the laws, not craft the laws. When contrasting the power of a king with that of a president, Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist #69 that ""the one [a president] can confer no privileges whatever; the other [a king] can make denizens of aliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the rights incident to corporate bodies.""

How far we have fallen that we now have a president who confers all sorts of privileges, including ""making denizens of aliens,"" the very example of legislative authority Hamilton promised the people of New York would not be vested in the office of chief executive. We now have a president who can use a virus to muzzle the mouths of the citizens, while releasing thousands of foreign invaders into our country with no care for spreading the virus.

Although the power of the presidency was not to have any semblance of the power of the king, our Founders still felt that the faithful execution of the laws was a grave task that should only be vested in one man and in a man of faith. In defending the decision by the Constitutional Convention to vest the executive authority in one man instead of a tribunal, the great James Wilson said the following during debate at the Pennsylvania Ratification Convention:

He cannot act improperly, and hide either his negligence or inattention; he cannot roll upon any other person the weight of his criminality; no appointment can take place without his nomination; and he is responsible for every nomination he makes.

Hamilton in Federalist #70 explained the need for a one-man executive as such:

It is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of the Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power, first, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their efficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and, second, the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which admit of it.

However, the Founders never envisioned two problems: the creation of political parties and the decline of religion and virtue among our civil society, two issues Washington ominously warned about in his farewell address.

Political parties have rendered our separation of powers and checks and balances moot. The legislature can no longer properly check a lawless executive because it is most often composed of enough party loyalists who will operate in tandem with the president instead of as a separate body of government. Also, one of the parties, the GOP, refuses to effectively check the ruling class in all bodies of government.

Moreover, we have lost a sense of how important religious virtue is for both the president and the people as a whole. The man we celebrate at this time of year, our very first president, devoted the largest share of his farewell address to the importance of religion and virtue:



Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked: Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.

When the president no longer believes religion is needed to maintain morality and when much of the society agrees with that view, there is nothing keeping the most powerful man in the country from acting despotically. But thankfully, for all of us, the one president who could have been a king was guided by the religious virtues to place the interests of the republic over his own power or ambition. Nobody expressed the importance of George Washington better than Calvin Coolidge during a 1927 speech honoring our first president:

His was the directing spirit without which there would have been no independence, no Union, no Constitution, and no Republic. His ways were the ways of truth. He built for eternity. His influence grows. His stature increases with the increasing years. In wisdom of action, in purity of character, he stands alone. We cannot yet estimate him. We can only indicate our reverence for him and thank the Divine Providence which sent him to serve and inspire his fellow men.

What shocked the world more than Washington's defeat of the British was that he voluntarily resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on Dec. 23, 1783. Rather than become the king of the new country, as had been the custom since the dawn of time upon leading the defeat of one regime, Washington humbly told the Congress, ""I retire from the great theatre of action, and bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body, under whose orders I have so long acted, I here offer my commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.""

King George III, upon hearing about this astonishing act of humility, reportedly told the American-born artist Benjamin West: ""If [Washington] does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.""

Indeed, he had become the greatest man in the world because he personally ensured that America would become a country of great men where each man would be the king of his own castle and all would work together to create the great experiment of self-government for the greater society.

When Washington was eventually called back for service to chair the Constitutional Convention and become the nation's first president, he could also have become a dictator but declined to do so. His greatness was most evident in his ability to strike the perfect balance in humbly devolving power to the people, while concurrently maintaining a steady hand as the first president, so that the nations of the world, as well as the reluctant states, would respect the power of the newly created government.

Washington perfectly expressed this balance and struck this tone in his state of the union address of 1795. In referring to his firm but merciful quelling of the Whiskey Rebellion the year before (he ultimately pardoned the leaders), Washington wrote to Congress:

For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested, yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit.

Over 200 years later, we have deviated from self-government in every way imaginable, culminating with the ultimate display of tyrannical executive power this past year with COVID fascism and now with the assault on the First Amendment rights of conservatives. As George Washington said, ""If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the slaughter.""

Many of us have wondered how the American people so quickly forgot the importance of their own power and the limitations of executive power in this country. Perhaps the answer is rooted in the fact that we have forgotten the origin of the holiday celebrating the very man who bequeathed us all this power of self-governance.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-constitution-is-immune-to-coronavirus-power-grabs,2021-02-15
Horowitz: The federal government has forfeited all power over immigration enforcement,"This year the Biden administration has orchestrated the most widespread invasion of illegal aliens at our border on record. At the same time, the number of arrests and deportations in the interior have plummeted to the lowest level in recent memory. As such, the federal government is the entity that has seceded from the compact established in 1789. States should respond in kind by doing what it takes to rid themselves of other countries' criminals at any and all costs.

According to a new ICE report, in fiscal year 2021, ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) made about 72,000 administrative arrests, down from an average of 140,000 from 2017 through 2019. What this means in plain English is that our own government has left tens of thousands of violent criminals from other countries on our streets, declining to do its most foundational job of protecting us from foreign threats.

It's not like the arrest and removal numbers were low because of a lack of illegal fish in the pond. This year, nearly two million illegal aliens were apprehended at our borders, over 1.7 million of whom were caught at the southwest border, which is the most on record. Our federal government has essentially dissolved the sovereignty of the entire union by forfeiting its power over the one unifying national policy that was designed to keep all 50 states safe from an invasion.

It's truly hard to overstate the reduction in the number of illegal alien criminals in this country committing completely avoidable crimes if our federal government merely did its job. As of last year – before the biggest influx of all time – there were 3.26 million aliens on ICE's undetained docket. These are individuals who have been targeted by ICE for removal, which most likely means the overwhelming majority have criminal records in addition to immigration violations. That means over 3 million criminal aliens who were dangerous enough to be on ICE's radar remain in the country indefinitely without being deported. That number has obviously swelled under the Biden administration, with its de facto moratorium on interior enforcement as border enforcement against the new flow collapsed entirely.

As of 2018, there were more than 1 million illegal aliens who have already received final deportation orders, with another 1.5 million having already received deportation orders but in the process of seeking an appeal. The case of an illegal alien allegedly raping an impaired woman on a Philadelphia commuter train as onlookers did nothing to stop the person is perhaps a grisly but apt metaphor for what has become of our union. States have done nothing to pick up the slack from the lack of federal enforcement of our national sovereignty, claiming their hands are tied when the feds refuse to remove convicted sex offenders, as this Philadelphia alleged rapist was not deported despite such a conviction. Are states at the mercy of the federal government's abandonment of our most foundational laws and tenets of the social compact?

Just this past Saturday, a 5-year-old girl in Polk County was killed by an alleged drunk driver who was in this country illegally from Guatemala. Drunk driving is a pervasive problem among illegal aliens and takes the lives of countless Americans every year. Yet none of them would die if we merely enforced our laws against illegal aliens. How bad does it have to get before the states take up the slack?

If red states truly cut off all the magnets, ensuring that illegal aliens could not obtain benefits and get jobs within the states, they would move on to the blue states and leave the red states alone. Red states must be willing to form a compact and agree to enforce the laws together and ignore illegal and illogical federal court rulings forcing red states to offer benefits to illegal aliens while they greenlight blue states violating federal immigration law every day. They must publish information quantifying the costs and crimes incurred by illegal immigration and provide citizens with a cause of action in state court against local officials who cause harm through sanctuary policies.



Our founders promised the citizens of this country a Constitution that would ""insure domestic Tranquility"" and ""provide for the common defense"" as a means to ""secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."" What we are seeing today is a government that secures the curse of tyranny domestically, while failing to protect us from foreign threats. If the federal government is going to abrogate the entire purpose of its existence, states should pick up where they left off before that preamble was written.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-difference-between-washingtons-birthday-and-presidents-day-is-the-difference-between-liberty-and-tyranny,2021-10-27
Horowitz: The new colonialism: Africa rebuffs US overtures to commit energy suicide,"Not content with the controlled demolition of our own natural resources, the U.S. government and Western oligarchs are seeking to keep Africa in the dark and are using climate imperialism to do so. After Africa largely rejected the mRNA vaccination agenda the past two years, the Biden administration is trying to impose the next “emergency” fiat on African countries by preventing them from developing their lands and using their energy resources to power their people. Thankfully, one African government sees the farce for what it is, and it appears that others will follow suit.



In July, the Democratic Republic of Congo put 30 blocks of oil and gas lands up for auction to potentially be used for drilling and other development. Earlier this month , U.S. “climate envoy” John Kerry implored Congo’s prime minister to back down on the auction of some of those lands for fear that Africa would actually get out of the dark and enjoy the lifestyle we experienced in the West until fairly recently. Last week, Environment Minister Eve Bazaiba flatly declined the request. ""Nobody can put pressure on us ... no convention in the world, not even the Paris Agreement, forbids a country from emitting CO2 for development reasons,"" she said in an interview with Reuters .

Commenting on the U.S.-Congo working group on protection of Congolese forests, Bazaiba chided the Western penchant for meddling. “This is not a working group in which a colonialist controls a colony,” she said. In other words, the Congo is not putting up with a new era of colonialism – except this time, rather than the West exploiting Africa for its gain, the West is seeking to force Africa to join it in committing civilizational suicide. Too bad American governors can’t say this to the Biden administration as the government seeks to federalize and lock up the lands in their respective states.

Ironically, the West is devolving into an uncharted post-development nation status and is regressing with acts of self-immolation by destroying its energy resources. Africa understands the power of industrialization — what African countries were lacking for a century — and wants to have what we all enjoyed until our governments were seized by energy masochists.

The Congo land-use rift occurred as Jeff Bezos' environmental fund, Bezos Earth Fund, is seeking to “conserve” 100 million hectares of land in Africa by the magical year of 2030 under the so-called AFR100 initiative. Bezos’ chief executive, Andrew Steer, had the nerve to frame this plan as the rich helping the poor rather than what it really is – the rich who can afford a greater degree of self-immolation exploiting the poor by locking up their resources in favor of useless wind and solar technology. ""Rich countries are going to have to play a bigger role on creating resilience on helping poor countries and poor citizens to adapt,” said Steer at a recent Reuters conference.

But as credulous as the Western parasites think the Africans are, they are not stupid. They have not bought into the ""climate emergency"" narrative, don't believe the policies will affect the weather, and understand that their alternatives to oil, gas, and coal, which are natural energy produced by God on this earth, don’t work and will perpetuate and exacerbate poverty in Africa. They are watching the rationing of gas in France and the coming heating crisis in all of Europe, built on a self-imposed destruction of Western energy resources.

Incongruously, as Germany and France wallow in their misery, they are offering $600 million to South Africa to push the same climate idiocy that caused this crisis. Africans have no plan to walk down the same path to geo-political masochism, especially as South Africa is beating inflation with its own coal-producing prowess .

At the upcoming climate conference (“COP27”) in Sharm El-Sheikh, African countries plan to push an energy development agenda that directly contradicts the Western countries. ""Africa has woken up and we are going to exploit our natural resources,"" said Uganda Energy Minister Ruth Nankabirwa Ssentamu, according to Reuters . ""There is no way you can develop any economy, any society without energy,"" said Omar Farouk Ibrahim, secretary general of the African Petroleum Producers' Organization.

The Africans understand that there is no way to give power to 600 million sub-Saharan citizens without electricity and to almost 1 billion without access to clean energy for cooking by relying on wind farms and solar panels, which are very expensive and require so much infrastructure, ironically powered by traditional fuel sources, to operate.



In the ultimate display of irony, some of the same German leaders sponsoring green energy boondoggles and trying to rope Africa into their inane climate projects are now counting on Africa’s vast natural gas reserves to cushion the blow of their energy crisis. So why are they trying to sabotage the hand that might feed them? Old colonialist hubris?

Meanwhile, as the Biden administration implores Africa not to develop its oil and gas resources, it is begging the Saudis not to cut oil production until after the election. African leaders are starting to see through the politics of Western meddling. They don’t like the meddling, and they don’t like the example Westerners have set in their own countries. For once, Africa might be more enlightened than the West.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-federal-government-has-forfeited-all-power-over-immigration-enforcement,2022-10-14
Horowitz: The new panic lie: Increased coronavirus hospitalizations and cases in the southwest,"The health ""experts"" and the media propagating viral panic porn think people like us don't understand arithmetic. They think they can manipulate headline stories warning of increased cases of COVID-19 in order to push more lockdowns, ignoring all the ways that more cases are being discovered, while the percentage of positive tests, new hospitalizations and deaths, and the lethality of the virus are all waning significantly.

""Arizona's COVID-19 spread is 'alarming' and action is needed, experts warn,"" read the title of an Arizona Republic article on Wednesday. Yahoo News breathlessly warned about a ""spike"" in all the southwestern states.

As is always the case, there is a grain of truth that is hugely distorted by numerous obfuscations of important facts and context. The truth is that new hospitalizations of people coming in for serious coronavirus infections are actually extremely low. What they are actually counting are the extra people coming in for all of the delayed health care caused by the lockdown. But thanks to universal testing in hospitals, they are discovering more asymptomatic cases than ever before, which had nothing to do with the original purpose of the hospital stay. Thus, they are blaming the fallout of the lockdown on the easing of the lockdown!

This chart from Arizona's coronavirus dashboard says it all.





As you can see, if you break down the new admissions by date of admission, as this chart does, the numbers are actually near zero over the past week. There was only one new admission on Wednesday, the last day of reporting. What the media is focusing on is the cumulative total of beds in use, reflected in this chart.

The total number of ""positive"" COVID-19 patients currently using beds in the hospital system is high. Now you might wonder how cumulative numbers could be so high if the new daily intake is so low? It's quite obvious that the first chart is only counting those who actually come in with new serious cases of COVID-19, for example those who have trouble breathing because the virus attacked their lungs. Those cases are extremely low relative to April.

The cumulative number chart, on the other hand, counts any ""positive or suspected inpatient COVID-19 patients."" Now that the number of people coming into hospitals in general, for any reason, is much higher than during the peak of the epidemic and also testing has become standard, they are likely counting anyone who tests positive as a COVID-19 patient in that chart, even if they came in for chest pains or trauma. Which is why there is a note at the bottom of the chart observing that the numbers are very volatile. Obviously, if the same number of patients of all conditions had come in to hospitals six weeks ago and we had had the rapid testing capabilities, the number of positive cases would have been recorded as even higher than they are today.

This dichotomy is likely reflected in the following chart of COVID-positive patients admitted to the emergency rooms.

How can it be that the same government website showing literally no more than five new COVID-19 admissions a day this week also shows record emergency room COVID-positive patients? The answer is that the virus is much more widespread, asymptomatic, and less deadly than it was before. The ER patients are coming in, as the Arizona state health director, Dr. Cara Christ, said, because of the bottleneck of much-needed care and serious ailments that were ignored during the lockdown. All but the few who actually came to the ER because of COVID-19 symptoms likely never knew they had it. This is why we are not seeing a big spike of deaths in any of the states where the media is warning about an increase in detected cases.

The very states that are seeing increases in hospitalizations are the ones that barely had patients – COVID-19 or otherwise – for six weeks because the virus didn't hit hard but the panic and suspension of certain procedures caused the admissions to plummet (unlike in New York, for example, where there were enough COVID-19 patients to fill hospitals). Now that the lockdown is over, states like Texas, Arizona, California, and North Carolina have many more people coming in to hospitals than in April. Paradoxically, it makes sense that there will be more people testing positive now than even during the peak, especially because testing is universal and rapid.

It's hard to measure a curve when we didn't have the full data during its peak. Had we been testing every person in March and April, there likely would have been many more cases.

Hence, the dichotomy between those ""hospitalized with COVID-19"" and those hospitalized becauseof COVID-19 is very similar to the inflation of the death toll we've seen, where the number of those who die with COVID-19 but not because of it get conflated with those who die of the virus itself.

The same trend we see in Arizona is playing out in Texas and likely in other states that had both low COVID-19 numbers and very few general patients in hospitals during the peak of the epidemic.





Thus, the dichotomy between patients who are actually being driven to the hospital by the virus vs. those who are there for other purposes and just test positive is huge and did not exist during the peak.

It's not that the virus doesn't exist any more, it's that it has either become less potent, has already attacked those who would otherwise get seriously ill from it, or a mixture of both. This is why Dr. Donald Yealy, the chair of emergency medicine at UPMC, who's been responsible for 30,000 tests in Pennsylvania, recently observed that those with the virus appear to be carrying lower viral loads and aren't getting as sick from it as they did in March and April.

This is why in Wisconsin, where thanks to the state supreme court ruling, citizens have been free from lockdown for nearly a month, not a single COVID-19 death was reported on Tuesday. Even though the number of positive cases has not gone down that much, deaths have plummeted.

Likewise, among the states the media is flagging for a spike in cases is California, which had a long and strict lockdown. Of course, there is zero correlation in outcomes. Overall, even that ""spike"" was reversed yesterday:

One other factor driving the discovery of more cases is the now widespread serology tests that discover antibodies in many people who never knew they had the virus. Those are also counted in the case numbers and hospitalization numbers in some states.



Finally, it's important to note that a large factor driving recent hospitalizations and likely several of the more deadly cases in southwestern states in particular could be due to cases in Mexico. The New York Times ran a story earlier this week on hospitals in California being flooded with people coming from Mexico who are seeking better care.

It's hard to compare state data when some states are getting backwash from other countries' cases. As Brownsville public health director Arturo Rodriguez said, ""In other words, you have three rates: the U.S., Mexico and your border rate.""

Already, two weeks ago, the Washington Post reported the following: ""As Mexico's health-care system has strained under the coronavirus, small community hospitals in Southern California, some of the poorest in the state, have been flooded with Americans who have fallen ill and crossed the border. They are retirees and dual citizens, Americans working in Mexico or visiting family there.""

According to the Post, ""approximately half of the coronavirus patients in several California border hospitals, including El Centro Regional Medical Center, are recent arrivals from Mexico."" Which is why Imperial County has more cases per capita than any other county in the state.

This explains why some of the largest spikes in cases and even some new deaths have been in border counties, such as Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Thus, if increased cases are used as a pretext for continuing to lock down American citizens, there is no reason why the border shouldn't be closed to medical tourism, at least from non-citizen green card holders, given that the main purpose was to alleviate the strain on our hospitals.

The media, as always, are engaging in headline panic news and fudging math that proves the exact opposite of their headlines. It's similar to what they are doing with accusations of executive force, in light of George Floyd's death, against black criminals while ignoring the fact that black criminals commit an even greater share of violent crime, which proves shooting of white criminals is even more common per capita. They think we don't understand arithmetic.

And speaking of Minneapolis, if small-scale reopening in these other states led to a spike in the virus, then don't you think jam-packed protests beginning over two weeks ago in Minneapolis would have caused a spike, rather than a drop, in hospitalizations?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-new-colonialism-africa-rebuffs-us-overtures-to-commit-energy-suicide,2020-06-12
Horowitz: There will be no red states left when the courts are done with their business,"If we ever hope to recreate America again in red states, we will have to set aside the notion that courts get the final say over broad public policy issues.

To have a nation with borders and immigration laws is ""unconstitutional,"" according to a radical Florida judge. If this is not a wake-up call about the irremediable corruption of the judiciary, then nothing ever will be.

The same judiciary that ignores an individual right to bodily autonomy now believes there is a right for a local government to thwart federal immigration law, preventing states from enforcing federal law against those localities. Up is down and down is up.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom ruled that Florida's law banning sanctuary cities is somehow unconstitutional and violates the Equal Protection Clause. You heard that right – you don't have the right to keep your vaccination status to yourself, but a local government has a collective right not to share immigration history of illegal alien sex offenders with ICE.

You might be wondering how in the world it is permissible for localities to thwart federal immigration law, much less how it's ""unconstitutional"" for a state to ensure they follow it. Easy, according to Bloom. She now feels that if organizations she disagrees with politically advocate for a certain law, that means the law is unconstitutional!

""Allowing anti-immigrant hate groups that overtly promote xenophobic, nationalist, racist ideologies to be intimately involved in a bill's legislative process is a significant departure from procedural norms,"" Bloom wrote in the September 21 ruling. ""This involvement strongly suggests that the Legislature enacted SB 168 to promote and ratify the racist views of these advocacy groups.""

Thus, you can now have a judge say that any law supported by yours truly is facially unconstitutional by virtue of a ""racist"" supporting it!

Bloom also contended that as long as the result of the law will affect more Hispanics, it automatically makes it unconstitutional. ""These discriminatory motives are made evident from the historical and ongoing pattern of racial discrimination by law enforcement and the growing reliance on an immigrant threat narrative to justify the enactment of anti-immigrant legislation across the nation,"" the judge wrote.

What this means is that if you happen to receive the majority of illegal immigration from a particular group of people, you can no longer have immigration laws because they will ""disproportionately"" affect a particular group, which is not even American, not entitled to our court system, and not governed by our Constitution.

While the courts create rights for illegal aliens at breakneck speed, they are affirming state laws and hospital policies violating bodily autonomy of Americans. The Second Circuit just upheld New York City's new vaccine mandate on teachers. Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that a health care provider serving the Northern Kentucky and Greater Cincinnati region can issue mandates requiring its more than 10,000 employees to get vaccinated or risk termination. The courts have never been there for the most sacred individual human rights of Americans throughout the past year and a half, even as they grant injunctions for illegal aliens at the drop of a hat.

Naturally, one would think the solution to COVID fascist mandates would be to move to the few red states where Republican governors actually protect the people from rules against their bodily autonomy. Well, the courts have us covered there as well! The same courts that ignore individual rights to breathe freely have recognized ""rights"" for local governments and school districts to forcibly regulate the breathing of students with masks! Not only are such rules not unconstitutional, in their estimation, even if they require a kid to cover his breathing for seven hours, but it's unconstitutional to not allow local governments to do so! The same federal courts who crush state sovereignty suddenly believe in sovereignty of cities over states.

So far, nearly every state that barred localities from instituting restrictions on breathing has been confronted with a court injunction on behalf of those counties. The latest ruling came from a South Carolina federal judge who believes allowing people to breathe freely somehow discriminates against people with disabilities. But what is so bizarre is that if masks work, then those people are certainly free to wear them. Yet we can't get an injunction in court on behalf of the right to breathe, only on behalf of those who want others not to have the right to breathe. The lawsuit was brought by the ACLU of all organizations!

The court system is rigged beyond repair. What COVID fascism has taught us is that the courts will never serve as a tool of protection for our civil liberties and can and will only be used as a cudgel against our liberty, society, and sovereignty.

As I warned five years ago in my book, ""Stolen Sovereignty,"" elections and red states won't matter one bit if we continue to accede to the lie of judicial supremacism:



Pick your favorite conservative issue and your preferred policy solution and understand that the courts will toss out many of those policies. There is a standing army of legal professionals waiting to assail religious liberty, create new rights for criminals, and invalidate immigration enforcement acts at the drop of a hat.

During one of his final public speeches before his death , Justice Antonin Scalia rhetorically asked, ""Do you think the American people would ever have ratified the Constitution if they had been told 'the meaning of this document shall be whatever a majority of the Supreme Court says it is'?"" Well, I think we can certainly answer that question with regard to the political opinions of a single district judge.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-new-panic-lie-increased-coronavirus-hospitalizations-and-cases-in-the-southwest,2021-09-30
Horowitz: Three ways the COVID hospital data is being inflated,"In George Washington's republic, the contours of fundamental rights and the scope of governmental authority were defined by natural law and the Constitution. In Anthony Fauci's new America, those rights and powers are defined by coronavirus case and hospitalization data. As such, if hospitalizations are to be the new Constitution, shouldn't we at least demand answers about misleading data being used to impose an authoritarian and deleterious lifestyle on us?

Putting aside the fact that these lockdown measures don't work to stop the spread of the virus, are we even measuring the spread properly? In addition to governors failing to provide historical context to the current hospital levels compared to flu seasons, there are several other recent factors inflating the numbers.

Counting observation beds

To begin with, as a nation, we have decided to treat this virus in the hospital much more than any other virus. Congress has thrown billions of dollars at the hospitals, and they receive higher reimbursement rates for treating COVID-19 patients. However, many of the cases are not necessarily clinical level. Undoubtedly, in the worst cases, patients are critically ill, but the panic surrounding this virus creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of more people coming to the ER and being admitted. The financial incentives for hospitals certainly exacerbate this trend.

One particular change in policy that might be responsible for some of the inflation since October is the fact that they are now including those admitted to ""observation"" beds in the COVID hospitalization count. On Oct. 6, HHS updated its guidance for hospital data reporting. When reporting ""total hospitalized adult suspected or confirmed positive COVID patients,"" they added a clause, not included in previous guidance, urging hospitals to ""include those in observation beds.""

In case you thought this was just technical advice to hospitals, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent a letter to hospitals in October threatening harsh penalties for those who don't report this data. ""Failure to report the specified data needed to support broader surveillance of COVID-19 may lead to the imposition of the remedy to terminate a provider's participation from the Medicare and Medicaid programs,"" warned CMS in a memo to all hospitals that serve Medicare and Medicaid patients.



Thus, if you combine the carrot and the stick — both the financial incentive to pad the COVID numbers and the threat of loss of funds for not reporting them — why would a hospital ever err on the side of underreporting and not overreporting? Remember, these incentives are driving the data reporting, which in turn is controlling the destiny of our lives.

Hospitalization is needed to obtain remdesivir

Another reason why a lot of COVID patients who are largely sub-clinical are being admitted to the hospital is because of the use of remdesivir. I've previously written on how this drug was proven to be completely ineffective by a massive study conducted by the World Health Organization. Nonetheless, it is the only FDA-approved drug for COVID-19 treatment, and in order to obtain it, one needs to be hospitalized for at least three days. As A.J. Kay, writer at RationalGround.com observes, because CMS waived the requirement for hospitals to produce a utilization review plan for this drug (because remdesivir is king), it necessitated hospital admission.

The approval of this drug took place on Oct. 22, which would also explain the recent surge in hospital numbers. It would also explain why ICU admissions don't seem to be rising commensurate to the hospital admissions.

Clearly, there are many people being admitted who don't necessarily need to be there.



Car accidents and heart attacks magically become COVID

North Dakota and Iowa are the only states that distinguish those who are hospitalized becauseof COVID-19 from those hospitalized because of other ailments or injuries and just happen to test positive. Based on those numbers, I estimated that between 25% and 30% of the hospitalizations are really counting those admitted for other conditions who happen to have asymptomatic or mild cases of the virus, which are detected by universal testing in hospitals. But a new report from the Miami Herald suggest that in some states that number might be much higher.

On Wednesday, the Herald reported that out of 898 patients who tested positive in Miami's public hospitals last week, 52% of them ""were admitted for other reasons, largely to emergency rooms, without typical COVID-19 signs."" In other words, more than half of those who are now recorded as COVID hospitalizations are really admitted for anything from car accidents and broken bones to heart attacks, kidney stones, and abdominal pain. That is simply astounding.

The Herald uses this fact to sow more panic by suggesting that it is a sign of growing spread. Well, no kidding. This virus is everywhere and is as prolific as the flu is during flu season. But that's the point. Everyone is going to be exposed to this virus, and only a tiny percentage become sick enough to legitimately be hospitalized from it. However, during a period of ubiquitous spread, a large percentage of those in the hospital will test positive or even contract it after entering the hospital. Imagine if we counted everyone in the hospital during flu season as a flu case, even if they were asymptomatic and admitted for other reasons.



The irony is lost on the media and politicians that the overwhelming majority of cases are very mild or asymptomatic, but by panicking over the virus and treating every case like Stage 4 cancer, we are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of straining hospitals with both illusory numbers and logistical problems with overaggressive quarantining of patients and staff.

Just remember these are the numbers that are being used to determine our ability to school our children, open our businesses, enjoy fresh air or entertainment, or even get together on Thanksgiving.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-there-will-be-no-red-states-left-when-the-courts-are-done-with-their-business,2020-11-19
Horowitz: Time’s up: Trump doesn’t need permission of cities participating in insurrection to send in military,"How is it that we are two weeks into an armed insurrection in Seattle, where local politicians let terrorists take over a police precinct and several city blocks and prevent all city services from entering? How is it that Americans continue to get beaten out of their cars by lynch mobs, and it appears there are no police in sight? Every Republican tells us that re-election of Trump is the most important outcome we can strive for, but he is president right now. He holds the power of the federal government. Are we really at the mercy of local governments ignoring or downright participating in the insurrection?

This question was settled long ago. State governments never had the power to violate life, liberty, or property, pursuant to Art. IV, §2, cl. 1 of the Constitution, which prohibited states from violating core natural rights from the very first day of the republic. In 1867, however, the 14th Amendment's Privileges and Immunities Clause gave the federal government enforcement power over states that violate those natural rights, which were specified at the federal level in the Bill of Rights after states had already adopted the original Constitution.

In response to the Civil War, Congress passed a law in 1871 to authorize the president to put down any insurrection. It was the original enforcement legislation designed to put teeth into the 14th Amendment, as envisioned under Sec. 5 of that amendment, which authorizes Congress to enforce violations by states. It's law to this day under 10 U.S. Code §253 and was amended in 2008 to apply to natural disasters and terrorism.

The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it—

(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or

(2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.

There are no limitations on the time, methods, or place in which the president can deploy the military to put down insurrection and domestic violence. With the anarchists desiring to relive the Civil War, it's time to use a Civil War-era law to put down this rebellion, as the law was designed to do.

What we are facing today in many cities is the worst unlawful combination of insurrection and violence that is hindering numerous state and federal laws, blocking highways and threatening motorists, and destroying businesses and property. Everyone seems to think that the president needs the permission of the state to deal with this, but the law was clearly designed for when ""authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection.""

The language of ""privileges and immunities"" was taken from the then-recently passed 14th Amendment to ensure that states couldn't get away with ignoring people's inalienable rights. Trump and Senate Republicans need to up the ante and threaten to invoke this statute if states and cities continue to allow ""autonomous zones"" and rioters to maim, loot, burn, steal, and obstruct traffic.

Obviously, we were all reluctant to immediately deploy the military and were hoping that local police would finally come to their senses, as they always have in the past after a few days of rioting. However, three weeks into this insurrection, many of these city governments have downright joined in the insurrection, which has led to direct threats to the lives and property of all Americans indefinitely. Truckers now have to rethink where they deliver goods, as if this were Afghanistan, where you need a map to see where the government has full or partial control over the territory.

Here is the latest motorist lynching in Santa Monica, California, captured in a video posted by my BlazeTV colleague, Elijah Schaffer:

With California officials downright encouraging this behavior and preventing the police from stopping it, the president is obligated to step in. The philosophy behind the 14th Amendment and the 1871 law to implement it is that the federal government was created for situations where states are either inherently incapable of defending liberty (a foreign invasion) or when they refuse to protect liberty and downright promulgate tyrannical edicts against life and property. Slavery and Jim Crow had to be swatted down by the federal government. Now these riots and beatings need the same response.



The police have been made to be criminals while the criminals are being exalted as civil rights leaders. This cannot go on longer. We cannot wait until November. Trump is already president and already has all the authority he needs. It's time to use it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-three-ways-the-covid-hospital-data-is-being-inflated,2020-06-19
Horowitz: TN legislature bans vaccine passports and protects doctors who speak out against shots,"Well, it took 19 months, and it's only one state so far, but we finally have a red state that is living up to its reputation. Over the weekend, the Tennessee legislature passed an omnibus COVID freedom bill that places the state on a completely different path to dealing with this virus from the rest of the country – one rooted in science, compassion, liberty, and health care freedom.

The more the vaccines fail and other treatments rise, the more our federal government and most states continue to mandate the shots and clamp down on safe alternative treatments. The Tennessee legislature has passed a catch-all bill that will do just the opposite. While no bill is perfect, HB 9077/SB9014 will include many of the provisions we need to right the ship on COVID, and certainly much more than any other state has done so far. It is the first state to pass these provisions through a legislative body. The bill now awaits the signature of Governor Bill Lee.

Here are the main provisions:

All governmental and private entities would be barred from requiring proof of having taken COVID shots. They also couldn't take adverse actions or deny employment based on vaccination status. In other words, Tennessee is applying existing anti-discrimination law that is rigorously enforced in every other realm to the issue and time where it is needed most. The only exceptions are those who are signed on as federal contractors and have already signed their lives away to the federal government.

Authorizes unemployment benefits for those who quit their jobs due to any requirement.

Provides a cause of action for anyone injured by the vaccine as a result of an employer asking the individual to receive it.

Except in a few circumstances, this bill completely bars any local governmental entity or schools from requiring someone to wear a mask or taking adverse action against people for not covering their faces. Anyone injured as a result of a mask mandate can sue in court. Masks can be required under ""severe conditions,"" but just for 14 days, and medical exemptions must be accepted. The original House bill also banned even private entities from implanting a mandate, but the Senate took it out.

Removes any authority of a local health entity or official, mayor, governmental entity, or school to quarantine a person or private business due to COVID-19 for simple exposure to the virus.

Prohibits any health care provider from vaccinating a child without parental consent.

Prohibits all use of state funding to go toward implementation of any federal COVID countermeasure.

Allows any doctor to prescribe the monoclonal antibodies for any patient they believe needs it.

State medical boards are prohibited from taking any punitive action against a physician for the recommendations they make about coronavirus treatment, mitigation, or prevention — including vaccination.

All hospitals required to allow a loved one to see dying patients before they die.

As a separate provision from COVID policy, all school board members must now run on partisan ballot lines so that sneaky liberals can't win in red counties.

The conference report on the bill was adopted 58-22 by the House and 25-6 in the Senate. The Senate, which is full of liberal Republicans, watered down an even better series of bills from the House; however, one House conservative told me they plan to hit this issue even harder in about 60 days when they return for their regular 2022 session.

In other words, Tennessee is finally acting as red as California is blue – at least to a degree. Now, imagine the effect on the national landscape if half the country, especially all the other GOP supermajority states, followed suit. Freedom would reign supreme in America. This was one of the rare circumstances when leadership actually worked together with the rank-and-file conservatives rather than working together with the special interests to fight the majority of their constituents. House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Lt. Gov. Randy McNally (who is also the Senate leader) deserve credit for getting this done so swiftly after months of inaction from Governor Bill Lee.



Unfortunately, we can't have nice things. Contrast the Tennessee legislature to its counterpart in Florida. There they enjoy the presence of the nation's most effective governor, yet they won't even ride his coattails and stand up against Biden with him leading the way. The legislature has thus far rejected Gov. DeSantis' call for bill that bars vaccine mandates in the state.

State legislatures in red states are the last thing standing between us and becoming like Australia. The entirety of the grassroots focus needs to be on pressuring legislatures and governors to act. The federal government is not only a lost cause, but a malignant force against our life, liberty, and property. If the federal government can promulgate unconstitutional human rights abuses without even passing them through Congress, then you better believe we have the power, indeed the duty, to pass countermeasures out of the legislative bodies closest to the people.

Horowitz: Top 6 demands to put Americans first in omnibus bill,"Our nation is at an inflection point like never before. Despite clear science and data indicating that our government is now responsible for countless deaths and injuries from vaccine mandates and the blocking of treatment, nothing has been done to rectify this for the future. We have a border that is wide open to millions of illegal aliens and cartel criminals. We have a government getting us into war with Russia over a corrupt Ukrainian regime, crushing consumers with inflation without any effort to boost American food and fuel production. And we have a budget bill that will not only ratify these policies, but spend even more money enforcing them and exacerbating the demise of the U.S. dollar.

In other words, it all comes down to the 2,741-page omnibus bill released late Tuesday night, which the House will vote on hours after it was posted online. It’s time to fix our government through the budget or shut down this ruinous government from destroying our lives. Let’s not forget that the inflation and supply chain crises were not originally caused by the Russian war; they were caused by COVID fascism and biblical levels of spending that devalued the dollar. Currently, both parties plan to solve the problem … by spending even more on COVID funding, spending $12 billion on Ukraine, and engaging in a proxy war with Russia and its oil exports without ramping up domestic production.

Republicans have the votes to block the omnibus bill in the Senate. Technically, they even have a majority, because Democrat Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.) is on medical leave. Here are the six demands they should make before passing a budget bill.

1) End of all COVID mandates: Workers, soldiers, health care professionals, and patients are still being forced to get the shots, despite everything that has been revealed about the safety and efficacy. All the vaccine and mask mandates still in place must be terminated. Yet not only does the omnibus bill fund every corrupt agency that is still promulgating these immoral and illogical policies, it gives another $15 billion to HHS to promote Pfizer, mass testing, and health surveillance. In total, the monsters at the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for the COVID disaster got a 12 percent funding boost, which will total $108.3 billion.

2) End emergency declaration: Ideally, the existing emergency statute should be repealed and replaced, but at a minimum the current emergency declaration and the invocation of the PREP Act that has induced all of this mischief and has handed our society over to Big Pharma must end.

3) Drill, baby, drill: Both parties seem to agree that we must dump $14 billion into Ukraine while cutting off Russian oil. Putting the prudence of these policies aside, it is indefensible to harm American consumers without first ramping up American production. This includes:

Approval of the Keystone pipeline;

Expansion of drilling in Alaska and federal lands and termination of moratorium on permits;

Removal of Biden’s recent global warming regulations on energy production;

Elimination of the ethanol mandate, which increases the price of fuel and food and harms independent oil refiners;

Ending the ban on financing of coal-fired power plants;

Ending all the existing barriers to fracking;

Ending restrictions on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission limiting its ability to approve natural gas pipelines;

Pulling out of the Paris climate accord;

Suspending the EPA seasonal fuel blend regulations, which would decrease refining and transportation costs.

4) Ban oil and gas from Venezuela and Iran: If we are going to ask the American people to sacrifice Russian oil and gas on behalf of the Zelenskyy regime, then shouldn’t that same sense of morality trump supply concerns when it comes to Iran and Venezuela? Yet the Biden administration plans on using them as alternative exporters of energy.

5) Defund spying on political opposition: The DHS has announced it is treating opponents of election fraud and COVID fascism as the highest terrorism concern. The DOJ is promising to work with local law enforcement to combat concerned parents standing up to licentious school board officials. How can we combat authoritarians overseas when our own government is engaging in tyrannical behavior?

6) Defund border invasion: Thousands of illegal aliens are being flown from the border to our communities rather than being removed. Over 62,000 were released in January alone. Any program designed to complete the criminal smuggling conspiracy of the cartels must be defunded, and Title 42 removals must be applied to all who come to our border.

The bottom line is that a vote for the current omnibus is a vote for more inflation, more medical experimentation, more mandates, an open-ended war with Russia from a position of weakness, and every other immoral activity funded by our government. Yet rather than secure these demands, what was the hill to die on for GOP leader Mitch McConnell? He bragged about raising Biden’s $10 billion Ukraine aid package to $14 billion. In other words, he doesn’t give a hoot about Americans and American issues. The only thing that elevates his testosterone levels is foreign interests.



Does anyone believe this will change when Republicans have the majority and the same GOP leaders control the floor process with the same decrepit values they harbor today? If anything, there is no time like the present. With a 27% approval rating, Republicans could fight on every one of these issues and have the public on their side. Except all of the bad guys are actually on the same side – Republicans and Democrats. Which leaves we the people without any avenue to redress our grievances.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-tn-legislature-bans-vaccine-passports-and-protects-doctors-who-speak-out-against-shots,2022-03-09
Horowitz: The ultimate election fraud? Violating civil liberties,"Our veterans didn't fight for a country where mayors and governors can shout COVID, a noun, and a verb in the form of command and magically make our natural rights disappear.

What's worse than wrongly ascending to office based on fraud? Using that office to fraudulently govern in a way that violates the most basic civil and religious liberties this country was founded upon. Just because you win a state or federal election doesn't mean you have the right to treat the citizens like subjects. You might get to decide issues pertaining to zoning or garbage collection in a way that some of the people don't like, but you can't destroy their liberty and property and rule over their persons in the most literal sense. That's what distinguishes our constitutional republic from a pure democracy. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""An elective despotism is not the government we fought for.""

While everyone is fighting over the election results, both Democrat and Republican governors and mayors are suspending civil liberties indefinitely using already failed methods meant to stop the spread of a respiratory virus. Baltimore's mayor announced the closure of businesses and churches over a 10-person capacity limit plus an outdoor mask mandate even when people are far apart. Numerous cities are declaring curfews (as if the virus is nocturnal). Even in Republican-dominated Utah, the National Guard was dispatched to ""contact trace"" the public for a virus that has already spread for months and is impossible to trace.

Meanwhile, crime is skyrocketing in many of these cities, yet it's the peaceful citizens who must fear the police if they fail to cover up their humanity, not the criminals. As such, the citizenry must fear both the authoritarian government and the anarchists and criminals at the same time. A mix of North Korea and Afghanistan?

What is so ironic about this form of fascism is that these draconian restrictions have already been in place for months to varying degrees and, by proponents' own admission, have failed to stop the spread. Thus, now, a governor can suspend life, liberty, property, religious services, and the right to breathe free air even outdoors indefinitely without any checks and balances and without having to show evidence that those measures work.

Consider the absurdity of responding to a spread with an outdoor mask mandate. By definition, authorities are admitting that the indoor mandates in place since the spring with over 90% compliance in most states failed to stop the spread. However, it makes no sense, according to anyone's opinion, that outdoor spread would be driving the epidemic more than the indoor spread. Thus, they are tethering an even more severe violation of the Constitution to a previous version of it that clearly didn't work to achieve their stated goals.

Then again, this was never about stopping the virus. This was about tyranny. Just like releasing criminals from jails was never about stopping COVID in jails but about dismantling our criminal justice system. Just like voting by mail was never about protecting people from the virus but about institutionalizing voter fraud.

What has become clear is that regardless of who winds up sitting in the Oval Office on January 20, we will not have a country left if we continue to allow North Korea-style authoritarianism to prevail under the banner of the coronavirus.



Folks, what we are doing is clearly not working. We are suffering usurpations and abuses that are exponentially worse than anything King George did to the colonists, yet there is no rebellion in sight. For that matter, we don't even see a political blowback in the majority of state legislatures where Republicans command a majority.

The left is increasingly ensuring that we have no peaceful means of defending our civil rights, religious liberty, and even bodily integrity under the reign of coronavirus fascism. Consider the following amalgamation of actions taken against us:

All information debating and questioning the legality and prudence behind these measures is censored.

They say we are not even allowed to protest these measures because it will spread the virus, while Black Lives Matter and Biden supporters can host large gatherings with the encouragement of government.

The same federal courts who will grant relief on bogus claims from criminals and illegal aliens within hours of their petitions laugh our bedrock civil liberty claims out of court.

Republicans, with very few exceptions, are just as tyrannical as Democrats, thereby ensuring that we can't even escape to red states for relief from these authoritarian measures.

The police are now being used against us for living our lives rather than against the growing anarchist movement that endangers our public safety.

If we defend ourselves against the mobs that are ignored by the police, we are the ones who will be prosecuted.

Vote in elections to change the status quo? Good luck winning them with mail-in fraud and ballot-harvesting countering a groundswell of lawful individual voting.

The only thing we have left is the ability to speak out, but watching how Australia and other former liberal democracies are now prohibiting any speech criticizing lockdowns, our days are numbered.

Indeed, when you realize what is happening to us, the acts of King George preceding the Revolutionary War don't appear to be too intolerable. And there is a reason for that. Our Founders sought to nip the tyranny in the bud before it became too powerful for them to redress. Patrick Henry, in his famous ""give me liberty or give me death"" speech, warned, ""We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts."" To those who felt that the tyranny had not gotten bad enough and that it would be too arduous a task to rebel, he posed the following challenge:

They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance, by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.

So, will we wait until they station cameras in our houses to make sure we are wearing masks at home in order to finally push back? Or will we organize new cadres of the Sons of Liberty and expose these tyrants at the local level while refusing to comply with evil, illogical, and unlawful arbitrary edicts? The clock is ticking. As it states in our Declaration of Independence, ""All experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.""

While memorializing our troops on Memorial Day 1927, President Calvin Coolidge noted that their sacrifice abroad is only worthwhile if we honor the Constitution at home. ""The integrity of the Union rests on the Constitution,"" said Coolidge in his poignant speech at Arlington National Cemetery. ""Unless that great instrument is to be the supreme law of the land, we could have no Union worthy of our consideration.""

It's time to make our union a constitutional republic again so that it's worthy of the sacrifice of our veterans. It's time to get educated and activated while we still can … or be enslaved.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-top-6-demands-to-put-americans-first-in-omnibus-bill,2020-11-11
Horowitz: We can no longer celebrate our independence. We must fight for it again.,"The day was July 4, 1826. As John Adams lay on his deathbed in the afternoon, he uttered his final words: ""Thomas Jefferson survives."" While in the literal sense, Adams was mistaken because Jefferson had died several hours earlier, in one way he was correct. The work that Jefferson completed on that very day exactly 50 years before – the work Adams helped him craft before the two became archenemies and then friends again – survived another two hundred years. Until now.

July 4, 2020, will be an Independence Day celebration like never before. In fact, it won't be a celebration at all, but merely a commemoration of what we have lost and hopefully a reminder of what we need to fight for all over again after 244 years. It will be marked not by the grand public displays of fireworks, for those are forbidden by restrictions upon the very liberties expressed in the Declaration of Independence, but rather by the sounds of fireworks being thrown by anarchists against police – anarchists who now dictate our way of life as we the people continue to be locked down.

It wasn't just the statue of Thomas Jefferson that was ripped down in Portland, Oregon. It was the foundational governing document he helped draft – the guiding light of our republic until it died 244 years later – that has been torn to shreds.

Ronald Reagan observed on July 4, 1986, as he related the story of the reuniting of Jefferson and Adams in friendship, that ""the things that unite us – America's past of which we're so proud, our hopes and aspirations for the future of the world and this much-loved country – these things far outweigh what little divides us.""

Well, indeed, 34 years later, we can now say with certainty that there are very few things that do not divide us, chief among them whether we are even proud of America's past or whether we seek to uproot every last vestige of its memory.

In order to understand what we have lost and what we need to fight for again, let's review the precious document that was signed on July 4, 1776. The product of five great men – Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and Thomas Jefferson – in just the 201 words of its preamble, this founding charter of government established six inviolate principles of the morality of a just governing system – all of which have since been broken:

That individuals are born with natural rights that come from God, not from historical precedent, English Common Law, or the democratic whims of the majority in a given society. Those rights are beyond the reach of mob rule or a tyrannical political majority. That chief among those natural rights given by God are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, to earn a living and own property. Implicit in this is the natural right to self-defense. As Sam Adams, the Founding Father of the American Revolution, said, ""Among the natural rights of the colonists are these: First a right to life, secondly to liberty, and thirdly to property; together with the right to defend them in the best manner they can."" That individuals form a government as a social compact, not to infringe upon those rights but to protect those inalienable rights from threats in a way that could not be managed without a governing body. That on issues not affecting inalienable rights, government may exercise other just powers, primarily for the safety and stability of the society, but only by the consent of the people as expressed through some legitimate form of republican representation (consent of the governed). Inherent in this principle is that no outside forces not controlled by the members of that society itself may determine the destiny of the society. That all men were created equal in access to and defense of those inalienable rights, not societal outcomes, privileges, or other human pursuits, an ideal that runs to natural law. Also, implicit in the preamble is that all members of a given society are equal in the right to self-governance in their respective societies on their territories and that no ruling class or individual has the right to invasively govern over someone else's life. That when a long train of abuses and usurpations of the aforementioned principles continues without any other recourse, the people have the right, indeed a duty, to rebel against the existing system.

The first five principles have been abrogated beyond recognition, which leaves us struggling with how to apply the sixth.

Today, we are suffering from a perfect contortion of these self-evident truths – the worst mix of tyranny and anarchy and the most widespread violations of fundamental rights since our Founding. We have a government that undemocratically locks down our physical movement and right to earn a living based on distorted data and flat-earth ""science,"" while facilitating unequal treatment for favored classes to riot. They strip us of the right to self-defense, while freely empowering their protected people and movements to maim, loot, block free movement, and even kill.

Everything our governments should be doing, they ignore, and everything they are prohibited from doing based on natural law, they elevate to the highest order of governance.

Mobs are allowed to roam freely and dictate policies through fear and intimidation.

Desires of foreign nationals who are not signatories to the social compact founded in the Declaration are elevated above the rights of the citizens governed by the compact.

Government by the consent of the governed? Our government is allowing people across the border to come here to get treated for the virus, then using those hospitalizations as a pretext to place curfews and other restrictions on the liberty and property of Americans.

""That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men …"" They are now allowing roving mobs to restrict our movement and attack motorists. In the process, they are spreading the virus, which gives this same illegitimate government further excuse to blame we the people and lock us down. We can't gather in small groups to work or socialize, while they can gather in the thousands to dismantle our republic. How is that for all men created equal?

As I laid out in my indictment of our illegitimate government, rather than a government built on promoting and protecting inalienable rights for all, we have a government that manufactures super-rights and privileges for some at the expense of foundational rights of the whole of the people. Liberty, according to our illegitimate politicians, now means the right to someone else's property or a public benefit, instead of freedom from restraint by someone else or by government.

Thus, this is not about a few or or even many policy disagreements. It all stems from the government's contortion of life, liberty, and property to mean the exact opposite of what our Founders knew them to be. There is no bridging the divide.

This government will not fix itself without deeper intervention and divine guidance. The Republican Party is part of the problem, not the solution. As we grope in the darkness and strategize and pray for a long-term or even short-term solution, we ourselves must never forget our liberty and property rights as well as the right to individual and jurisdictional sovereignty. We must never forget that these truths are still self-evident and that we are still willing to fight for them. We must never agree to this grotesque confluence of anarchy and tyranny as ""the new normal."" And we must certainly never legitimize this illegitimate usurpation of our social contract.

They might have torn down Jefferson's statue and perverted the government built on the contract he wrote, but we still have the actual contract. It belongs to us. And in that contract, Jefferson offered not only the moral imperative to break away from England but also the moral imperative to fight back against future government usurpations of that contract in the future. That contract is eternal, because it is built on natural law from God.

As Abraham Lincoln said following the Supreme Court's dreadful Dred Scott decision in 1858:

The assertion that ""all men are created equal"" was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain; and it was placed in the Declaration, not for that, but for future use. Its authors meant it to be, thank God, it is now proving itself, a stumbling block to those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism. They knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant when such should re-appear in this fair land and commence their vocation they should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack.



Those infallible rights we are endowed with are inherent and don't come from government. They cannot be covered by a mask. They cannot be taken away.

So, where do we go from here? As we formulate a long-term solution to a problem that is much greater than any of us can deal with alone, we need to build an immediate movement and take steps. The first step is to rise up and fight back. Until now, only the mob's voices have been heard, because there is nobody else on the playing field. Nobody is representing us. To that end, we need to think beyond just the electoral process and take back our government under the following short-term propositions:

No American should be restricted by arbitrary coronavirus edicts so long as rioters are able to violate them while destroying public and private property.

No American without a criminal record should be barred from carrying a gun to protect himself from the lawlessness of gun felons who are allowed to roam the streets.

No American should be arrested for self-defense as the police stand back and allow rioters to attack them in cars and on their lawns. Patriotic sheriffs should start programs to deputize and train law-abiding owners to help keep the peace.

No American should have to pay local taxes until that governing authority reclaims the streets and the highways from roving bands of anarchists.

No federal tax funds should go to jurisdictions promoting lawless sanctuaries for the BLM mobs and criminal aliens. Patriots must demand that Trump veto any budget bill in September that does not defund anarchy.

Finally, it's time we organize citizen defense groups the way our Founders envisioned. No, we are not going to attack and harm innocent people as the governing mob is doing, but we will reclaim our right to defend our lives and property. We all respect law enforcement, but local police departments can't have it both ways. They can't abdicate their duties and throw us to the wolves but then swoop in when we try to fill the vacuum for our own protection or punish us for not wearing diapers on our faces even outside.

Just like the Minutemen of the 1770s, we need to form at the local level citizen defense groups to defend life, liberty, and property. After all, what made this great document we commemorate this week more than musings on paper was the signers' resolve to ""mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."" That pledge must be renewed at the local level in parts of the country where patriots are most common. Block by block, city by city, state by state, we must take our country back from the violent modern French revolutionaries and create another great American revolution that will make our Founders proud.

Eleven years after the signing of the Declaration, many of the same patriots assembled in the same hall in Philadelphia to codify the system of government based on the blueprint of this social compact. During the final day of triumph on September 17, 1787, Benjamin Franklin rose to speak. In his notes on the convention, James Madison captured his words as follows:

Whilst the last members were signing it [i.e., the Constitution] Doct FRANKLIN looking towards the Presidents Chair, at the back of which a rising sun happened to be painted, observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun. I have said he, often and often in the course of the Session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun.



Over two centuries later, we have come full-circle, just as the Earth rotates on its axis, and we no longer have a rising sun. We have a sun that has already set. But the good news is that through darkness comes light, and from storm clouds come the growth and sustenance of rain. The same God who birthed us with these inherent rights constantly accords us numerous opportunities in life to defend and renew those rights, just as yesterday's sunset gives birth to a new sunrise. All we have to do is show up and fight for it.

It won't be easy, but it wasn't easy the first time around, when the patriots were in the minority and most were loyalists or indifferent. As John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, the day before he signed the great contract of American sentiment, ""I am well aware of the toil, and blood, and treasure, that it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and support and defend these states. Yet, through all the gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory; I can see that the end is more than worth all the means, and that posterity will triumph.""

""The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day."" ~Proverbs 4:18",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-ultimate-election-fraud-violating-civil-liberties,2020-07-03
Horowitz: What ever happened to the right to breathe freely?,"""No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law."" ~Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford (1891)

For how long can American governments continue denying the basic human right to breathe freely without showing a modicum of evidence that masking is effective, necessary in all circumstances, and outweighs the cost to liberty and human health?

Some rights are so natural that they need not be enumerated in the Constitution

We know there is a right to freely exercise religion or bear arms, but how do we know there is a right to breathe without the cruel and draconian covering of our mouths? Sadly, our court system seems to believe that no such right exists, even as judges concoct novel rights to numerous privileges and enshrine them in the Constitution nearly every day through ordinary litigation. However, some rights are so natural and inalienable that they need not be written. Breathing without a dangerous bacteria and carbon dioxide trap over our mouths is a pretty obvious one.

In fact, in many ways, this is why Madison initially opposed the concept of a written Bill of Rights – because it would imply that only those rights listed are inalienable and that rights only come from government and are not indeed self-evident truths of nature. Even as he was pragmatically introducing the Bill of Rights on the House floor on June 8, 1789, Madison noted that some objected to it on the grounds that ""by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration, and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the general government, and were consequently insecure.""

While introducing his first draft, Madison even conceded that he found this argument to be ""one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard urged against the admission of a bill of rights into this system."" The only reason he felt he ""guarded against"" this concern was because of the language he originally proposed in ""the last clause of the 4th resolution."" That original draft language was very strong and categorical:

""The exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution, made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people; or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution; but either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.""

Although part of the spirit of this clause remained in the final versions of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, the language is not as strong as Madison's original draft. Perhaps the fact that we think government can indefinitely regulate human breath is a fulfillment of Madison's original concern.

On Friday, the Supreme Court, yet again, slapped down a California executive branch edict using COVID to interfere with freedom of religious worship. In a 5-4 decision, the court issued an injunction on the California health department's rule banning home-based group worship or Bible study during the reign of COVID terror. ""The government has the burden to establish that the challenged law satisfies strict scrutiny,"" wrote the unsigned order. ""To do so in this context, it must do more than assert that certain risk factors 'are always present in worship, or always absent from the other secular activities' the government may allow.""

I found myself shouting ""Amen!"" while reading this, but at the same time wondering why the courts only seem to apply strict scrutiny to COVID rules affecting a selection of very specific liberties, such as religious practice or gun rights, but not the more fundamental natural right to move freely and unrestricted, without one's nose and mouth being restrained, or shutdown orders in general. Somehow it seems like our court system only recognizes unenumerated rights when they are fabricated and not rooted in natural law.

Even without questions of cruel and unusual punishment or a violation of the Fourth Amendment's dictate against illegal search and seizure, it's obvious that making someone cover his or her nose and mouth – to the draconian extent the government has applied it – violates the most basic definition of individual liberty itself. As defined by Blackstone, individual liberty is ""the power of loco-motion, of changing situation, or removing one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct; without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law."" William Blackstone wrote that the right to ""personal security"" includes ""a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, [and] his health,"" as well as ""the preservation of a man's health from such practices as may prejudice or annoy it."" [1 Commentaries *125, *130.]

It's one thing to mandate masks for a limited time on certain people in certain places – for example, for people with clear symptoms, in health care settings, or on mass transit. But to mandate them indefinitely in order to move freely, obtain vital goods and services, and basically live life in any way clearly violates the most basic individual liberties that never needed to be enumerated in the Constitution. And to do so without showing evidence that someone is a threat or aren't already immune, or that the masks even work, violates the Fifth and 14th Amendments' due process clause.

Ex post facto criminalizing human breath

The Supreme Court stated in the landmark Calder v. Bull (1798) case that a legislature cannot go so far as to violate natural law even if the ""authority should not be expressly restrained by the constitution or fundamental law of the state.""

Chief Justice Samuel Chase stated: ""An act of the legislature (for I cannot call it a law) contrary to the great first principles of the social compact cannot be considered a rightful exercise of legislative authority."" Chase was referring to the idea of a state criminalizing behavior ex post facto. His point was that even if Art. I Sec. 10 of the Constitution didn't explicitly bar legislatures from passing ex post facto laws, ""To maintain that our federal or state legislature possesses such powers if it had not been expressly restrained would, in my opinion, be a political heresy altogether inadmissible in our free republican governments.""

In many ways, the mask mandates going on indefinitely forever for children to obtain an education or for humans to live a free life is the ultimate form of ex post facto ""law,"" which was defined in Calder v. Bull as making ""an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal."" We were all born as humans and are forced to live and obtain certain services. It's one thing to force someone to wear a mask for a limited time, place, or scope. But to do so essentially all his life or for a child in school when healthy is retroactively criminalizing human existence predating COVID.

Mind you, Chase was speaking of a law duly passed by both branches of government, not the government edicts we have today. The notion that the CDC can simply mandate masks on two- and three-year olds, which fundamentally violates their bodily integrity and their cognitive abilities in the most basic function of their individual liberty, shocks the conscience. It's mind-numbing how there hasn't been a major lawsuit on this issue. This is especially jarring given the lack of evidence that children pose a risk of spreading the virus or that masks are even effective.

It's impossible to harmonize COVID fascism with decades of case law on right to privacy

It's not like we haven't lived through decades of the courts inventing novel rights that aren't written in the Constitution and most certainly aren't natural. For example, in 2017, the Supreme Court, in Packingham v. North Carolina, ruled that the state's law restricting child sex offenders from accessing social media was not enough of a ""compelling interest"" to outweigh what the court believed to be an important right, even though the state clearly had a much more compelling case for blocking pedophiles from social media than masking children for COVID.

The court in Packingham designated social media a place ""to engage in a wide array of protected First Amendment activity"" like streets and parks and noted, ""By prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.""

Think about that: One has a right to access social media even as a convicted child sex offender because one basically can't live life properly without it, according to the court. Yet, at the same time, government can restrict human breathing in nearly every setting without having to provide any evidence one is a threat or that the experimental medical device of masks – authorized only under an emergency use authorization – even works. They can place people at risk for shortness of breath, headaches, lack of cognitive function, bacterial infections and rashes, and self-contamination, all without showing that they work.

Justice William Douglas was able to suggest in the famous Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) case, ""The First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from governmental intrusion,"" even though there is no right to privacy in the Constitution. Justice Arthur Goldberg stated in his concurrence that birth control is covered by the unenumerated rights of the Ninth Amendment. ""The concept of liberty ... embraces the right of marital privacy"" and ""The right of privacy is a fundamental personal right.""

Well, if birth control is a concept of liberty and privacy so fundamental as to serve as the backbone for Roe v. Wade to kill babies, then what about the privacy and liberty of breathing? If anything, in this case it's worse because you are not asking to take an action (consume birth control), but to refrain from an inaction and not have government force you to wear an experimental medical device that has not been approved for respiratory viruses.

As Clarence Thomas stated in his famous dissent in Obergefell:

""In the American legal tradition, liberty has long been understood as individual freedom from governmental action, not as a right to a particular governmental entitlement.""

The court punctuated this right to privacy under the 14th Amendment by stating in the Lawrence v. Texas (2003) sodomy case, ""The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.""

Think of how they are demeaning the existence of people who are in pain and have trouble breathing under a mask and are controlling the destiny of the most sensitive parts of our body with these Chinese face burka edicts. Mandatory mask-wearing for long periods of time to obtain vital services (especially outdoors) clearly violates the liberty of ""bodily integrity"" enumerated in the landmark Glucksberg (1997) case among those liberty interest secured under the 14th Amendment.

Moreover, a person certainly has a greater right and compelling human need to breathe without oxygen reduction and rebreathing their own toxins left on a mask than to engage in sodomy. This is especially true for children being forced to exercise and play sports for a protracted period of time with a face covering that undoubtedly compromises their intake of oxygen and exfiltration of CO2 while laboring with rigorous physical activity.

In Roe v. Wade, the court said, ""The abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision."" The court applied that even to when that decision is 100% directly killing a particular baby. It's extremely hard to see how that doesn't apply to human breathing, especially when there is no evidence that an individual is carrying the virus, has the ability to spread it, is a danger to a particular individual, or that said governmental regulation even helps.



When the court established the right to bodily integrity in the aforementioned Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford case, Justice Gray noted, ""The right to one's person may be said to be a right of complete immunity; to be let alone."" That would imply that perhaps the forcing of a human to place something over his nose and mouth might not even be subject to any government interest balancing test. But even if we are to believe that the pandemic would align bodily integrity more in line with a typical right, like any fundamental right, it can indeed be regulated to some extent, but the burden of proof must be on the government to demonstrate it is necessary and efficacious in that particular circumstance, not the other way around.

Indeed, 80 years into the Supreme Court's crusade to invent new rights not mentioned in the Constitution, the only rights the justices won't recognize are those that didn't even need to be stated in that document, such as the right to breathe.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-we-can-no-longer-celebrate-our-independence-we-must-fight-for-it-again,2021-04-12
Horowitz: What North Dakota teaches us about our failure to drain the swamp in red states,"You want to know why Trump voters feel so desperate with no one to turn to and nowhere to live in freedom? Look no further than North Dakota.

What if I had told you at this time last year that in a few months we would have to wear face burkas for the rest of our lives, including children who are not in danger of dying from or spreading the virus? You would have thought that even if Democrats conjured up such an illegal, immoral, and illogical idea, it would be immediately opposed by every red state. Think again. Welcome to North Dakota, which, thanks to leftist Gov. Doug Burgum, has a mask mandate just like in California, despite zero evidence that such unconstitutional edicts change the natural geographical and seasonal trajectory of the virus.

Despite zero evidence of efficacy, the alleged GOP governor once cried over people not wearing them in his state. He obviously would have no explanation for how 100% compliance has failed to work in Los Angeles:

The good news is that counties are starting to fight back for liberty and for our children. Already in November, the Tioga School Board in Williams County, North Dakota, voted unanimously not to mandate that schoolchildren wear masks.



However, after intense pressure from the state school superintendent, the school board capitulated. At the time, Kirsten Baesler, the superintendent of public instruction, threatened the school district with loss of funds. ""Any time a person, including a school district or school board, disregards laws they do so with the understanding that consequences can occur,"" said Baesler on November 19.

And the rest is history.

So here we are in a county Trump carried 82%-15% in a state Trump carried by 34 points, and schoolchildren can't even learn without state-sanctioned child abuse. Baesler spoke about following the law, but what law? Mask mandates violate the essence of individual liberty. Plus, these edicts are all executive fiat, not law. The question is how this can persist in a state this conservative.

Every statewide elected official, including Gov. Doug Burgum, is a Republican. Republicans hold a 40-7 majority in the state Senate and an 80-14 majority in the state House – larger majorities than Democrats hold in California. How is it that Burgum was easily able to get re-nominated this past summer in the GOP primary? Republican primary voters went out and voted unanimously for Trump and then cast a ballot for a Republican who opposes what they believe in. Moreover, how is there no legislation to stop such craziness – at least against children who don't spread the virus – in the state legislature? Republicans have veto-proof majorities.



This problem exists in the reddest states in the country. In Wyoming, for example, Republicans will hold a 28-2 majority in the Senate and a 51-7 majority in the House over Democrats. Yet even in that state, there will be a mask mandate in many places. That is also the state that elected John Barrasso as senator and Liz Cheney as a representative. Both of them support impeaching Trump, even though Trump carried the state by 43 points. For comparison, Biden carried New York by 23 points. The fascism we are seeing in red states would be the equivalent of New York rejecting gay marriage. But that never happens in blue states.

The reason we have this problem is because we elect leftist Republicans during the primaries, even in the reddest states. Just yesterday, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma wrote a letter bizarrely apologizing only to black constituents for objecting to the certification of the election. Putting aside what race has to do with ballot harvesting and illegal changes in election law, these are the types of Republicans we have even in red states.

The point is we can complain about Democrats controlling the trifecta of government in D.C. from now until 2022, but we have nobody to blame for red-state fascism, especially on the issues determined at the state and local levels, other than ourselves. It's time for a Never RINO movement parallel to a Constitution Sanctuary movement, which will ensure liberty in red states. If all the people at the rally in D.C. on January 6 would organize in each state and county primary, we could peacefully redress the grievances of the forgotten American, at least in the more conservative states.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-ever-happened-to-the-right-to-breathe-freely,2021-01-15
Horowitz: What we expect from state legislators in the war for our own health freedom,"When King George promulgated the ""Intolerable Acts,"" the colonial legislatures played a leading role in organizing the rebellion against the budding tyranny, which eventually led to the creation of our democratic republic. Two and a half centuries later, we have now endured 19 months of unabated tyranny that makes King George look quite tolerable, yet the representatives closest to the people have been stone silent in most cases.

On March 26, 2020, when it was already apparent to those with a modicum of foresight that something much darker than ""15 days to flatten the curve"" was afoot, I called upon the state legislatures to convene immediately to investigate the virus, how to deal with it properly, and to redirect policies away from the unelected federal and state departments of health. Not only did they fail to convene at the time, but even during the 2021 regular session, most states failed to enact any meaningful limitations on COVID tyranny and redirect the profligate funding and policies toward what actually saves lives. Because they failed to heed John Adams' warning, ""Nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud,"" COVID is a new tyranny affecting our lives, liberty, property, and even bodily autonomy more than anything King George ever had in mind.

Nineteen months later, it's time for Republicans in state legislatures to atone for their mistakes and finally convene special sessions to comprehensively eradicate the authoritarian and undemocratic policies. On Thursday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called on the state legislature to come back to session and deal with the odious mandates. Other governors must follow suit, and if they fail to do so, the legislatures must vote to call themselves back into session immediately. Some states plan to use the special session on redistricting to address these issues as well. However, tinkering around the edges is not good enough. They must uproot COVID fascism – root and branch, to borrow a broken promise from Mitch McConnell on Obamacare – and redirect our COVID response to early treatment.



Here is what we expect state legislatures to cover at a minimum:

1) Ban all injection mandates : This includes all public and private mandates, without exemptions for health care. Iowa's proposed SF 193 is a good blueprint for other states. The bill should include the following provisions:

A ban on all discrimination by insurance companies in terms of coverage for those without the shot.

A ban on all discrimination for goods and services in the realm of public accommodation.

A ban on all discrimination or punitive actions taken against any health care provider or patient for opting not to get the shots.

Institute a cause of action for citizens to take legal action against those who violate the ban and for anyone injured as a result of getting the shot due to intimidation in the workplace.

The state should assume full control of its National Guard and ensure that the guardsmen are not subject to the same mandate as the entirely federal military.

States should offer unemployment benefits to those federal workers who lose their jobs and create a program to find jobs for them within the states.

2) The right to treat and access treatment :

A ban on any state medical or licensing board taking action against any physician for prescribing clinically indicated, medically necessary appropriate off-label FDA-approved drugs, for offering their professional opinion on any aspect of the pandemic or its treatment, or for not wearing a mask.

All medical licensing board officials should be subject to removal by the legislature.

A requirement that all pharmacies fill any prescription of an FDA-approved drug used off label for the virus. Any pharmacist who denies a prescription of a medically necessary drug – unless he has a religious conscience objection – would face a $500,000 fine or a year in jail.

Every insurance company must cover COVID-related prescriptions pursuant to the same rules they use for billing of other prescriptions, as well as for coverage of the vaccines and remdesivir.

A new patient bill of rights for hospitalized patients, which will allow them to always have one surrogate present in the hospital, allow them to access FDA-approved drugs off label prescribed by a doctor at their own expense if they agree to assume liability, and the right to refuse any hospital-prescribed treatment.

3) The right to medical privacy :

Nobody's vaccination status should be recorded without the affirmative consent of the patient.

A provision requiring schools to accept religious exemptions for all other vaccine mandates.

A ban on contact tracing or the forced quarantine of any individual who has not been infected with an actual disease that has been A) proven deadly and B) has not already proliferated through large portions of the population.

4) ""Never again"" lockdowns and masks :

A categorical ban on the authority of any state or county official to issue a stay-at-home order or to shut down businesses carte blanche under the guise of public health.

A categorical ban on the authority of any state or local official, including public schools, to forcibly mask people. Provide for a legal cause of action for anyone harmed by such violations.

5) Clip the wings of state and county health departments :

All state and local health directors must be subject to removal by the respective governing legislative authority.

Any public health orders issued by the health departments – state or county – are to be regarded as advisory unless they are affirmatively ratified by two-thirds of the governing legislative body.

No public health emergency declared by the governor may last longer than 30 days without the support of two-thirds of the legislature. Any declared emergency would trigger an automatic reconvening of the legislature until the declaration has expired.

6) Investigate all actions taken by the federal government :

Each state should form a temporary COVID committee to hold hearings and audits of all the current actions taken by the federal and respective state governments predicated on a purported scientific premises about the virus, the vaccines, or treatment. Based on the findings, any policy found to be out of sync with evidence of safety and efficacy must be terminated and defunded.

State legislative health care committees must conduct full investigations of the treatment of patients in hospitals. The scope of investigation should include an audit and analysis of the therapeutics used, the therapeutics rejected, the deviation from standard and established care for patients in respiratory distress, and any allegations of mistreatment or discriminatory actions taken by hospital staff.

Every state should pay for a full audit of every individual who died within the 30-day investigative window of taking the shot.

Every state should establish its own vaccine adverse event database and encourage, rather than discourage, doctors to use it.

All funding currently used for marketing the shots should be redirected toward funding and marketing the monoclonal antibodies and other proven treatments the committee will study.

Last March, legislators could feign ignorance about this virus, its origins, and the proper way of dealing with it. A year and a half later, if they have no desire to reclaim authority on behalf of the people from the unelected medical cabal responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, they should resign from the legislature.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-north-dakota-teaches-us-about-our-failure-to-drain-the-swamp-in-red-states,2021-10-22
Horowitz: Where is the red-state sanctuary for American constitutional rights?,"If blue states were able to successfully serve as sanctuaries for illegal alien sex offenders from federal law enforcement during Trump's presidency, why can't red states serve as a constitutional sanctuary for Americans losing their most basic human rights?

Americans in all 50 states are losing their livelihoods for not getting injected with a very questionable shot that no longer works; they are being refused proper treatment for a virus they didn't create; the federal government is hunting down anyone who was within earshot of the Capitol on Jan. 6; and the FBI are now threatening to treat anyone who protests critical race theory at school board meetings as terrorists.

On the other hand, Republicans control 23 trifectas, 19 of them with supermajorities in the legislatures. Where are they during this time of peril, and why have those states not become sanctuaries for Americans fleeing this era of totalitarianism? Why are red-state governors and legislatures completely missing in action during these dangerous times when our federal government, which controls corporate America, seems to have devolved back to pre-enlightenment governing principles? Why are they not holding one emergency session after another to redress our urgent grievances? Why are Texas-based companies like Southwest Airlines able to violate the Nuremberg Code with their inhumane mandates without the much-vaunted Texas GOP apparatus outlawing mandates or at least subjecting them to liability? Is anyone home? What is the breaking point that will actually draw a meaningful response from the so-called opposition?

Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Monday that he is directing the FBI and federal prosecutors to meet with state and local law enforcement on how to combat what he referred to as ""threats of violence"" against school board officials by protesters of critical race theory.

""The Justice Department will also create specialized training and guidance for local school boards and school administrators,"" said Garland in a DOJ press release. ""This training will help school board members and other potential victims understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.""

First, it's important to note that our adversaries are telling us exactly what they fear. They understand that the lynchpin to us winning back our freedom is by taking back our local governments, such as school boards. Which should motivate us even more to focus on the policies and elections at the local level more than congressional and presidential elections.

It's also noteworthy that the same people who couldn't care less about BLM burning down dozens of cities, illegal aliens organizing a stalking campaign against Senator Kyrsten Sinema, and violent cartels crashing our border are suddenly fearful of moms and dads protesting the teaching of racism in their schools.

However, the most important question we should all be asking is: Where are the GOP governors? This order should be dead on arrival in every red state. Within 24 hours of this announcement, every GOP governor should have issued an order barring all law enforcement from working with the feds to target First Amendment rights and peaceful Americans, especially at a time when this same administration is advocating the de-incarceration of violent criminals.

It's time conservatives demand more from their supposedly Republican officials. Every GOP governor, attorney general, and state legislative leadership team should coordinate across state lines to push back against federal tyranny on a myriad of issues. This is a more effective check and balance on this administration's behavior than Republicans winning back Congress, even if real Republicans actually secured positions of leadership. States are sovereign units of government and have the ability to stave off federal usurpations, especially when backed by the culture on the ground among the people. Just ask Trump how successful he was fighting California on sanctuary cities. Well, if it's good enough for illegal aliens, it should be good enough for Americans.

Horowitz: Why is Governor Kristi Noem attacking the small group of conservative South Dakota legislators?,"Why are red states not nearly as red as California is blue? Why is it so hard to pass bills against chemical castration, COVID fascism, illegal immigration, and medical tyranny in states with few Democrats in the legislatures? Well, unfortunately, in red states it’s not so much the voters who control the arc of legislation, but the special interests. And in smaller red states, the Chamber of Commerce and the medical cartel wield an outsized share of influence, often turning red states into de facto anti-abortion/pro-gun versions of blue states. Nowhere is this more evident than in South Dakota.

On paper, Democrats are an endangered species in the Mount Rushmore State. Not a single labeled Democrat holds a state office. Republicans control the state Senate 32-3 and the state House 62-8. Sounds like a conservative paradise, right? Well, as it relates to abortion and guns, like most other red states, the politics reflects the political orientation of the majority of the people. Other issues? Democrats as may as well hold a super-majority, particularly in the Senate. They just run as Republicans.

In that vein, it was shocking to read how Governor Kristi Noem has declared war, not on the RINOs who legislate like Democrats, but on the few House Republicans who actually want to make the state distinct from a blue state. Last week, the Argus Leader reported that Noem is taking a “hands on” role in training candidates to run for legislature, including those challenging the few conservative incumbents.

Not seen as vulnerable in her primary, Noem says she's still not taking her party's nomination for governor for granted. But she is managing to find time to involve herself in some battleground legislative contests. She's offered candidate school seminars to up-and-coming politicians, making endorsements and even going as far as publicly chastising Republican incumbents she doesn't see eye to eye with politically.

Last month, for instance, Noem joined District 4 House candidate Stephanie Sauder on a radio program where she openly accused Rep. Fred Deutsch, R-Florence, of being a poor legislator doing damage to South Dakota's way of life.

According to the Argus Leader, the governor is also working with Sen. Lee Schoenbeck, the president pro tempore, “to unseat far-right members of the party seeking re-election.”

Here is a list of targeted races based on a paper circulated by Schoenbeck referenced in the Argus Leader:

The highlighted members are the establishment picks not deemed “far right.”

But what does “far right” mean? People who oppose men in female sports, chemical castration of minors, corporations violating human rights and mandating dangerous shots, but support reduced taxes? The aforementioned issues have essentially been the dividing lines between the governor and some of the House conservatives over the past two years. These members were pushing for a half-percent reduction in the sales tax, but were stymied by the governor. Then they tried to eliminate the sales tax on food and institute a gas tax holiday, something done even in some blue states. Yet the governor evidently opposes it enough to primary them out of office.

Conservatives in the state and nationwide clashed with Governor Noem last year when she opposed the bill barring men in female sports.

“All of the people on her target list are true Christian conservatives, and those are the people she wants gone,” said Rep. Rhonda Milstead, the lead sponsor of HB 1217, the female sports bill, in an interview with TheBlaze.

Milstead also accuses the GOP establishment of targeting the most conservative members with new districting maps. “Our redistricting was awful because it put the people they want out in districts where they will have a hard time, or they placed solidly conservative people against each other in the same district,” charged the freshman, who represents the greater Sioux Falls area. Milstead claims the map was drawn with the intent of placing several other conservatives into her district.

Fred Deutsch of Watertown was placed into a new district because he was viewed as more repugnant to the GOP establishment than Joe Biden and the Democrats. His crime was the sponsoring of a bill banning chemical castration for minors, a bill that easily passed in numerous other red states. Yet this year, South Dakota failed to pass a single meaningful bill on any important issue, from transgenderism and illegal immigration to medical freedom and COVID fascism.

In an interview on KXLG in Watertown on April 21, Kristi Noem, who hails from that part of the state, lambasted Deutsch and others for being a drag on the state and sloppy legislators who don’t read bills and understand the consequences of good governance. “We need people who are thoughtful,” said Noem in a common refrain we hear from establishment Republicans.

Milstead disagrees. “Fred is an excellent researcher and probably does more research on the issues than the next 10 legislators. He always does his homework, even when I disagree with him, and Gov. Noem knows that.”

There is a common thread undergirding this intra-party battle in South Dakota that reverberates nationally in the Republican Party. It’s not a divide between conservatives and liberals or moderate Republicans and “far right” Republicans. It’s an unbridgeable gap between the priorities and the values of the average red state voter and the special interests that control the powerful entities in the state.

Although red-state Republican governors and legislative leaders will find some minor ways to distinguish themselves from Democrats, as it relates to the issues combatting the spirit of the age, they will always be incorrigibly on the side of the corporatists. Whether it’s transgendersim, mass refugee resettlement, illegal immigration, or COVID fascism, the powerful Republicans in office will always side with big business, which, unlike in past generations, is squarely on the side of cultural Marxism and against individual liberty. Even as it relates to the tax issue, which in the past united Republicans of ever ilk, the corporatist wing wants to focus on targeted tax provisions rather than broad-based cuts for obvious reasons.

Nowhere is this more evident than with the health care cartel. Sanford Health and Avera Health are the top employers in the state. It’s quite obvious why medical freedom will be taboo in the legislature. “The game is very simple,” notes Rep. Milstead. “The South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations political action committee contributes to numerous liberal candidates around the state who they feel will walk the line on their issues. Most candidates do not have a lot of money, and so they operate with a sense of fear over what these lobbyists and PACs can do to them.”

Rep. Steve Haugaard is running against Noem in the June 7 primary. On his campaign website, he makes it clear that it is not any one issue that is motivating his run, but the power structure behind the results we see on numerous issues. “The axis of Big Tech, Big Business, Big Education, and Hollywood have changed our culture dramatically just in the past decade,” writes the former House speaker, who now faces a David vs. Goliath contest. “Today, large multinational corporations are dictating how we should live, how our children are raised, and what values our children should be taught.”

The South Dakota Constitution begins with the phrase, “We, the people of South Dakota, grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberties …” Today, we face the challenge of corporations that have essentially become an arm of government or often even stronger than government, with the ability to destroy civil and religious liberty while shielding elected government officials from having to do the dirty work. They often enable elected red-state Republicans to campaign on doing the opposite, knowing full well they will work hand in glove with the lobbyists of those entities to silence the voice of the people.



Thus, anyone who wants to advance the cause of liberty and traditional values beyond the two legacy issues will inevitably have to engage in a full-scale war with the most powerful interests of the state.

"Horowitz: With attack on Colorado baker by transgender lobby, red states can take action","Here we go again. It appears that Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado is the only baker in the entire country. He was the go-to Christian baker for gay wedding ceremonies, and now he might be forced to bake a transgender ""transition"" cake (yep, there's a cake for everything). Once again, in a world where the entire business universe can discriminate against and censor conservatives, the left gets to have their cake and eat it too.

The plaintiff in the new trial that began on Monday, a man who now goes by the name Autumn Scardina, admits to purposely targeting Phillips after the Supreme Court took up his original case, just as a matter of ""calling someone's bluff."" In other words, this was not about a burning desire to eat a cake that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside.

Some might be wondering why this litigation can even get off the ground. Didn't the Supreme Court side with Phillips in the original case? Well, as I noted at the time, the supposedly conservative court actually invited further lawsuits and only gave Jack Phillips a very narrow win based on the unique circumstances of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission's unfair targeting of him in that case.

On June 4, 2018, the high court ruled 7-2 that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission singled out Jack Phillips and engaged in overt religious discrimination in its ruling against him. However, the court did not rule that a state can force an individual to craft messages that violate his First Amendment rights. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, affirmed his previous view that there is ""authority of a State and its governmental entities to protect the rights and dignity of gay persons who are, or wish to be, married.""

The ACLU was correct at the time when it predicted that this was just a Pyrrhic victory for religious liberty and that, in fact, the court ""reaffirmed the core principle"" that, generally, speaking, businesses must serve everyone and every event for any reason.

We live in surreal times, when our political and legal culture have the First Amendment and anti-discrimination law turned on their heads. On the one hand, they suggest that a person cannot refuse service for a particular message that violates his conscience when the customer can obtain that service easily almost anywhere else. Yet, at the same time, they believe that the entire corporate world can collude with each other and government to deny conservatives the ability to obtain any service that essentially allows them to engage in effective speech or commerce.

Likewise, they believe all stores can deny all service to any individual who doesn't take the draconian step of covering his mouth and nose, yet a single store can't deny service for a particular message directly targeting the merchant's own religious beliefs.

Which is why, if conservatives really want to put an end to this, they should not only try to get a new case in front of the presumed more conservative Supreme Court, but actually fight back in the red states. All red states should pass legislation protecting individuals, institutions, and businesses from being forced to service ideas, speech, or events that violate their religious convictions. A group of 20 or so states with strong majorities in the legislatures should work together to do this all at once so that the left's cancel culture cannot effectively target and isolate one individual state.

What the saga with South Dakota's female sports bill teaches us is that Republicans in red states are terrified of cancel culture, which is certainly the strongest on the side of the Rainbow Jihad. As such, each state needs to pass a bill similar to what Mississippi passed several years ago – but they should do so all at once. What this will do is not only prevent the states from being isolated, but also create a circuit split in the courts. It would be most prudent to promote a bill like this in the Dakotas, Iowa, Arkansas, and Missouri so that it would tee up the case for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the most conservative in the country.



This in turn would force the Supreme Court to take up the case. While we've learned never to take the ""conservative"" justices for granted, with the new orientation of the court, it is likely we have at least five votes.

Finally, conservatives will have to confront the entire concept of judicial supremacy head-on. The same courts that see no problem with states violating natural law with COVID fascism or changing election law during elections will interfere with anything and everything red states do to keep their economies, culture, and liberties functioning. The only reason we don't have more court interference is because Republican legislatures rarely do anything righteous with their strong majorities.

If conservatives ever hope to make red states distinguishable from blue states, they will have to give the courts the same treatment the blue states do and show them the power of the other branches of government.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-is-governor-kristi-noem-attacking-the-small-group-of-conservative-south-dakota-legislators,2021-03-25
Horowitz: Wyoming RINO curses out colleague for forcing vote against Biden’s injection mandate,"In the state of New Jersey, a truck driver was able to defeat the most powerful man in the legislature, running against COVID fascism with an ad shot on his iPhone. In Wyoming, on the other hand, with a 28-2 majority in the Senate and a 51-7 majority in the House, Republicans won't even block Biden's illegal mandate on our bodies. Worse, the former GOP speaker so emphatically opposed any effort to do so that he dropped an F-bomb on the legislator who sought to record the vote.

Last month, after much urging from conservative grassroots, Republicans voted to convene a special session to block the impending vaccine mandate. Now they have concluded their session without passing a single bill, not even a watered-down version. But on the way to watering down the bill, they cleverly placed a provision in the bill to cancel any state prohibition on employers requiring mandates once the federal government illegally mandates it. In other words, they oppose the mandate except if and when the feds actually mandate it!

Last Thursday, while debating HB 1001, RINO representatives in the House were watering down the bill all day without recorded votes. It got to the point that the bill essentially protected nobody from the mandate. Finally, Rep. Chuck Gray proposed an amendment to strike the language from the bill that neutered the prohibition on vaccine passports once the federal government mandates them. After Gray requested a recorded vote on this amendment, the only such recorded vote on the entire bill, Rep. Harshman, a former speaker who was participating on Zoom, was caught on a hot mic cursing out the conservative rep.

""Chuck Gray, f*** [inaudible],"" Harshman was caught saying. ""Little f****n' [inaudible].""

Wyoming Rep. Steve Harshman Swears at Rep. Chuck Gray www.youtube.com

Harshman was roundly condemned and forced to apologize, but most of the members of the body and the press missed the point. The issue wasn't so much the profanity that he used. It was that a Wyoming Republican was so incensed about a fellow Republican's attempt to record the GOP vote as siding with a deeply unpopular president that he was pushed to profanity. And indeed, out of 51 Republicans, just 18 of them supported Gray's amendment. Thirty-one Republicans joined with the existing seven Democrats to keep the language in the bill crowning Biden supreme over Wyoming law and bodily autonomy. All but 11 House Republicans opposed an earlier version of HB 1002, which prohibited state and local governments from enforcing the mandate.

There's an important lesson here that rings true in every supermajority red state. These seven Wyoming Democrats are likely now more powerful than Democrats in New Jersey. While New Jersey Democrats now have to worry about voters throwing them out if they get too radical, Wyoming's seven representatives and two senators can have their vision actualized through RINOs without incurring any backlash. Who are the voters going to remove?

These Republicans campaign every season on being ""pro-life and pro-gun,"" but side with the left on every issue that matters. This is why it's so important for them to quietly squelch any conservative legislation without a recorded vote. The last thing they want is sunlight, because then the voters would throw them out in primaries, the same way they did in Virginia and New Jersey legislative elections during the general election.

Now, in a state Trump carried by a 45-point margin, we can't even oppose a deeply unpopular mandate by a senile and radical Democrat president. Isn't it interesting how these same Republicans who believe it is wrong to ""regulate"" private business by telling them they can't violate bodily autonomy rights suddenly have no problem when OSHA mandates a 500-page scheme of how to force employees to get the shots and a cumbersome reporting and documenting regime? These Republicans are frauds and need to be removed in the upcoming primaries. Every one of those 31 Wyoming representatives needs a primary challenge. Conservatives need to hammer the RINO red-state governors like Wyoming's Mark Gordon with the same vigor as we would a blue-state tyrant like Phil Murphy or Gavin Newsome.

Wyoming's state motto is ""equal rights."" Yet the state is now obsequious to an illegal federal mandate that will create a medical apartheid built upon a dangerous shot that actually doesn't stop the virus and likely makes it worse. All these phony Republicans want to do with their trifecta supermajority control of numerous state governments is to file lawsuits with a court system that is corrupt. They believe in bodily autonomy to murder babies but not against needle rape. They somehow think that whatever the federal government promulgates automatically supersedes a state. This is dangerously naive.



Section 1 of the Wyoming Declaration of Rights makes it clear who is the final arbiter of constitutionality in the face of tyranny:

All power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety and happiness; for the advancement of these ends they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper.

Article 7 speaks directly to this era: ""Absolute, arbitrary power over the lives, liberty and property of freemen exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest majority.""

It's time for Wyoming to return to its roots. If state legislators have no interest in doing their jobs and would like our country to run on executive fiat and judicial supremacism, they should quit their jobs and join the thousands of American workers now unemployed due to their support for mandated medical experiments.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-with-attack-on-colorado-baker-by-transgender-lobby-red-states-can-take-action,2021-11-05

And in a precious few days, we the people will decide for ourselves, our progeny, and for the rest of time whether America will remain a vibrant and free constitutional republic, the likes of which the world has never known, or whether America will become just another nation in decline, going the way of Athens and Rome but in a shorter time. This election will decide, WE will decide, if we wish to live in freedom or tyranny, in sunlight or darkness, in prosperity or poverty. The choice could not be starker. And the choice is ours.



We must ask ourselves: What will our children and grandchildren think of us, how will history judge us, what would our ancestors say of us, if we so casually and without duress turn aside mankind's greatest achievement and vote for a thousand years of decline, gloom, and doom? Each successive generation must commit to ensuring that the next generation lives free. We must reflect on the selflessness with which Americans have sacrificed and died, on battlefields throughout the world and in our own Revolutionary and Civil Wars, so that we might appreciate what we have inherited — a country in which we live and flourish in a civil and open society.

As I explained in ""Liberty and Tyranny,"" too often, liberty's permeance makes its manifestations elusive or invisible to those born into it. Even if liberty is acknowledged, it is often taken for granted and its permanence assumed. Under these conditions, the statist's agenda, that is, the Democrat Party's diabolical plans, can be alluring. It is not recognized as an increasingly corrosive threat to liberty but rather seen as coexisting with it. But all liberty-loving citizens should know better and be alarmed by the ascent of tyranny not only in the Democrat Party but throughout the culture. Nor should we be confused or taken in by the various nomenclatures designed by the Democrat Party to deceive us into believing that its movement is some kind of ""people's"" movement — such as ""democratic socialism."" Like all such movements, it ultimately relies on the iron fist to control the people, not serve them.

As I previously noted, the Democrat Party's presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who has perfected the politics of deceit and manipulation, veils his pursuits in moral indignation, intoning in high dudgeon the injustices and inequities of liberty and of life itself, for which only he and his party can provide justice and bring a righteous resolution. And when the resolution proves elusive, as it has during his 47-year political career, he demands ever more authority to wring out the imperfections in mankind's existence. Hence his 110-page Marxist manifesto. Unconstrained by constitutional prohibitions, what is left but Biden's own moral compass, which has already led him astray? He is never circumspect about his own shortcomings. Failure is not a product of his beliefs but merely want of power and resources. Thus are born endless rationalizations for seizing ever more governmental authority. Consequently, the Democrat Party's intention to destroy the Supreme Court by packing it with kindred ideologues; the expansion of the U.S. Senate to create a super-majority, one-party Democrat rule; the elimination of the filibuster rule to crush any opposition to the Democrat Party's lawmaking agenda; and the elimination of the Electoral College, in order to prevent millions of Americans outside the big cities and most populated states from participating in the electoral and governing system, thereby ensuring Democrat Party dominance for decades. In short, the fundamental transformation of America from a constitutional Republic to a Democrat Party leviathan.

We must never accede to the terms of our economic and political surrender and servitude. We must never abandon our children and grandchildren to a dark and bleak future. We must never accept a fate that is alien to the legacy we've inherited from our ancestors. We must never accept social engineering by politicians and bureaucrats who treat us like lab rats rather than self-sufficient human beings. For those who choose tyranny over liberty and vote for Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, they do not speak for the tens of millions of us who revere the principles undergirding our society and appreciate the fruits of our economic system. Nor do they get to dictate the terms of our existence, as they contort the Constitution and the law to accommodate their political ends. We must not be compliant with their demands and designs. We must vote: Vote for President Trump and the Republicans, and rally our families, friends, co-workers, and neighbors to vote for President Trump and the Republicans! And we must, like our forefathers who founded this magnificent country, become active in our own survival!

Levin: I am appalled at the election of Raphael Warnock,"As an American who reveres our country, our founding, and our Constitution, I am appalled at the election of Raphael Warnock. His beliefs, as declared over the course of decades, about this country, race, Israel, and a host of other issues are frightening. As a Jew, I find Warnock's relentless anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements shocking, yet they represent a growing view within the Democrat Party, the left, and the media. And those statements were never condemned by Democrat Party leaders and the media. In fact, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigned hard for Warnock, and this morning the media are touting his historic victory without comment about what the election of such an extremist and anti-Semite means for the future of the Democrat Party and the nation. Such self-censorship is now all too familiar.

Furthermore, as Democrats and the media, as well as a sizeable number of GOP officials in Washington and their pundits and media, condemn the president for fighting to the bitter end over serious election abuses — the worst of which are the constitutional violations in key battleground states strategically instituted by the Democrat Party and Biden campaign — precious little is said about the declared intention of the Democrat Party to gut the independence of the Supreme Court by packing it with left-wing ideologues, destroying the Senate by packing it with new Democrat senators from Puerto Rico and D.C., killing the filibuster rule to ensure that all and any laws the Democrats wish to pass will come to pass, and destroying the Electoral College. If carried through, this will be the greatest attack on our Constitution and our republican system since the Civil War — when the Democrat Party led the Confederacy. The media, of course, are all in with this. From the New York Times and the1619 Project and the Russian collusion conspiracy by the media and the Democrat Party to the attempted coup and impeachment of President Trump, the cover-up of the Biden family ties to communist China (and other countries), the celebration of Antifa and BLM (violent anti-American organizations), the endorsement of fascistic orders from power-hungry governors violating freedom of association, the free exercise of religion, private property rights, etc., and a long list of other notable propaganda and/or censorship campaigns, the media have become a poisonous and corrupt force in our society.

In the House, Pelosi has the slimmest majority — about 10 more seats than the Republicans. If Ossoff should win the remaining Senate seat in Georgia, the Senate will be split 50-50, with Harris as the potential tie-breaker. This means by the smallest of margins, the Democrats would control Congress. Yet they would use their temporary, slimmest majority to forever alter the way in which we govern ourselves. They would shred the Constitution, which as statists they have long abhorred, and attempt to permanently control the administrative state and the electoral process. This is exactly how they turned states like California, the land of Reagan, into a one-party state with supermajorities in the legislature and no hope of Republicans retaking statewide offices.

We also face a difficult issue with Democrats who abandon the blue states they've helped create for Republican states, where they continue their voting pattern for Democrats and leftists. It is one of the main reasons why states like Georgia and Virginia have turned blue and Texas is moving purple. When this is combined with a half-century of unrestrained immigration and the concomitant purposeful lack of assimilation and identity politics (promoted by the Democrat Party), and now the unconstitutional evisceration of our election laws (Article II, Section 1, Clause 2), the consequences are bleak. So too with the ideological indoctrination on our college campuses and the intellectually corrupt and political partisan mass media in our country.

The Republican establishment and its handful of media propagandists are incapable of addressing any of this — and have not in any effective way. Instead, for the likes of McConnell, his first principle is his own continuing rule over the Senate Republicans. Even back in the Tea Party days, he, Boehner, and their small cabal did all they could to blunt that movement as it threatened their reign. The Democrat Party is a radical force that seeks to constantly alter our government and society, while the Republican Party is passive and ineffectual, clueless on whether or how to slow the growing tyranny. If you think about it, there have only been three Republican presidents in the last 100 years who have dared to confront the statists and their progressive movement — Coolidge, Reagan, and Trump. The disconnect between D.C. Republicans and Main Street Republicans could not be more pronounced. Yet the D.C. Republicans are adept at playing a deceitful game of saying one thing to their constituents when running for office and doing something much different once elected or re-elected. Many are simply unfit by nature, principle, or character for this struggle — a struggle for the nation's future. Reagan won two massive landslides, yet much of the opposition he confronted to his agenda was within the GOP in Congress. Trump stopped dead the advance of the radical Obama agenda with his defeat of Clinton, but he also faced resistance within his own party — the so-called NeverTrumpers among them. Both Reagan and Trump brought the Republican Party great victories in Congress, as did the Tea Party, but the GOP establishment was not only ungrateful but contemptuous. Unlike the Democrat Party, which coddles its base, the D.C. Republicans attack their base.

While the election of an American-hating anti-Semite from Georgia to the U.S. Senate is being celebrated and the Republicans are collapsing and issuing self-righteous statements about how they're upholding the Constitution during the electoral count today, let us remember that we are Americans. There remain tens of millions of us who love our country, our Constitution, and our freedom. We see what's going on. We are engaged. And we are not rolling over. Like our forefathers, we care deeply about preserving our God-given natural and unalienable rights and ensuring that our children and future generations live in a free and just society. We are not going anywhere. I'll have much more to say on the radio this evening.

"Levin: On Jan. 6, we learn whether our Constitution will hold","January 6 is the day we learn whether our Constitution will hold and whether congressional Republicans care.

The 2020 presidential election was, in several targeted battleground states, an unconstitutional electoral exercise. Even putting aside evidence of significant fraud, virtually none of which received a hearing by our courts, events leading up to and including the November national election constituted a radical and grave departure from the federal electoral system adopted by the framers of the Constitution and the state ratification conventions. Now, let's be clear: None of this matters to the Democrat Party, since it and its surrogates perpetrated these unconstitutional acts, as I shall soon explain. Nor does it matter to the media, which is utterly illiterate on the subject and unequivocally supports the supposed outcome in any event. But it should be of great moment and concern to the people of this country and especially to congressional Republicans in both Houses, for if the latter do not at least confront and challenge this lawlessness on January 6, when Congress meets to count the electors, it will be the GOP's undoing and, simultaneously, the undoing of our presidential electoral system. Ultimately, it will be the people of the United States who love our republic who will be the losers.

Win, lose, or draw, on January 6, the Republicans must not act as if ""the people have spoken"" and be cowered into passivity or worse, such as joining the Democrat Party and media hecklers, by insisting that they are part of a lawless party seeking to ""reverse the results of the election."" Too many Republicans have already buckled, including the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, Sen. John Thune, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger. No doubt others who are unreliable and cowardly when facing the organized mob will follow. But let us not be judged by those who have intentionally and strategically manipulated our politics and the law to undermine our constitutional order. It is they who must be condemned.

Specifically, Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the federal Constitution could not be more explicit. It states, in pertinent part: ""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress ..."" This language was purposeful. During the Constitutional Convention, there were various proposals suggested for electing a president. Should the president be directly elected by the people? That proposal was rejected out of concern that such a purely democratic process could be hijacked by a temporary majority. Should the president be chosen in the first instance from within the national legislature? That proposal was also rejected on grounds of separation of powers. Should the judiciary play a role in the selection of the president? That idea was dispensed with as being the most objectionable, as judges were to be the least political of all public officials. The framers deliberatively and with much thought created the Electoral College process, in which the people and their elected legislatures — both state and national — would play important roles. But the electoral process rested first and foremost on the state legislatures directing how the electors would be chosen. The reason: While rejecting the direct election of a president, the framers concluded that the state legislatures were closest to the people in their respective states and would be the best representatives of their interests. At no time did the framers even raise the possibility that governors, attorneys general, secretaries of state, election boards, administrators, etc., would play any significant role in the electoral process. Indeed, certain of those offices did not even exist. Moreover, as I said, the courts were rejected out of hand. Thus, such an important power was to be exercised exclusively by the state legislatures.

After the 2016 election, the Democrat Party, its various surrogate groups, and eventually the Biden campaign unleashed hundreds of lawsuits and an unrelenting lobbying campaign in key states that had previously been won by President Trump, taking unconstitutional measures intended to stop President Trump from winning these states in the 2020 election, thereby literally undoing this critical constitutional provision. What had been carefully crafted at the Constitutional Convention and clearly spelled out in the Constitution was the main obstacle to defeating President Trump and winning virtually all future presidential elections. The problem for the Democrats was that in several of these battleground states, the Republicans controlled the legislatures, while the Democrats controlled state executive offices. The Constitution was not on their side. Therefore, they used the two branches of government that were to have no role in directing the appointment of electors to eviscerate the role of the Republican legislatures.

In Pennsylvania, considered the battleground of the battleground states, the Democrat governor, attorney general, and secretary of state made and enforced multiple changes to the state's voting procedures, all of which were intended to assist the Democrats and Biden. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, whose seven justices are elected, has a 5-2 Democrat majority. (In 2018, there was a big push by the Democrat Party to fill three of the seats with Democrats, and it succeeded.) Just months before the general election, that court rewrote the state election laws to eliminate signature requirements or signature matching, eliminate postal markings that were intended to ensure votes were timely, and extended the counting of mail-in ballots to Friday at 5:00 p.m. (state law had a hard date and time — election day on Tuesday, which ended at 8:00 p.m. ET), thereby fundamentally altering Pennsylvania's election laws and nullifying the federal constitutional role of the Republican legislature.

In Michigan, among other things, the Democrat secretary of state unilaterally changed the state's election laws with respect to absentee ballot applications and signature verification. Indeed, she sent unsolicited absentee ballot applications by mail prior to the primary and general elections. State law required would-be voters to request such ballots. She intentionally circumvented the Republican state legislature and violated the federal Constitution by issuing over 7 million unsolicited ballots. Furthermore, a court of claims judge, appointed by a Democrat, ordered clerks to accept ballots postmarked by Nov. 2 and received within 14 days of the election, the deadline for results to be certified. The ballots would be counted as provisional ballots. The state legislature had no role in these changes.

In Wisconsin, the Elections Commission and local Democrat officials in the state's largest cities, including Milwaukee and Madison, changed the state's election laws. Among other things, they placed hundreds of unmanned drop boxes in strategic locations in direct violation of state law. Not surprisingly, the locations were intended to be most convenient to Democrat voters. In addition, they told would-be voters how to avoid security measures like signature verification and photo ID requirements. These bureaucrats and local officials bypassed the Republican legislature in altering state election procedures.

In Georgia, the secretary of state is a Republican. Regardless, as explained in the Texas lawsuit brought against Georgia and the three other states mentioned above, ""on March 6, 2020, in Democratic Party of Georgia v. Raffensperger, Georgia's Secretary of State entered a Compromise Settlement Agreement and Release with the Democratic Party of Georgia to materially change the statutory requirements for reviewing signatures on absentee ballot envelopes to confirm the voter's identity by making it far more difficult to challenge defective signatures beyond the 22 express mandatory procedures set forth at GA. CODE § 21-2-386(a)(1)(B). 71. Among other things, before a ballot could be rejected, the Settlement required a registrar who found a defective signature to now seek a review by two other registrars, and only if a majority of the registrars agreed that the signature was defective could the ballot be rejected but not before all three registrars' names were written on the ballot envelope along with the reason for the rejection. These cumbersome procedures are in direct conflict with Georgia's statutory requirements, as is the Settlement's requirement that notice be provided by telephone (i.e., not in writing) if a telephone number is available. Finally, the Settlement purports to require State election officials to consider issuing guidance and training materials drafted by an expert retained by the Democratic Party of Georgia."" Georgia's Republican legislature had no role in these electoral changes resulting from consent decree.

Consequently, in each of these four battleground states — and there were others — whether through executive fiats or litigation, key, if not core, aspects of state election laws were fundamentally altered in contravention of the explicit power granted to the state legislatures and, therefore, in violation of the federal Constitution and the process set forth for directing the selection of electors. And this is before we even get to the issue of voter fraud. That said, in many instances, ballots that would have been rejected or, if counted, evidence of fraud, were now said to be legal — not by state legislatures but by those who unilaterally changed the election laws.

The United States Supreme Court had an opportunity before the election, and in this general election cycle, to make clear to the states that they must comply with the plain language of Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution. Indeed, when a federal district judge in Michigan altered that state's election laws, a closely divided U.S. Supreme Court overturned his order. Justice Gorsuch pointed out that the state legislature writes election laws. However, when a case was brought to the Court involving the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interference in state election laws, the U.S. Supreme Court was paralyzed. Chief Justice Roberts attempted to distinguish between federal and state courts, which is irrelevant; in another instance, Justice Alito ordered the Pennsylvania secretary of state, not once but twice, to segregate certain mail-in ballots, but nothing came of it. A court divided against itself cannot stand, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln. Its failure to enforce the Constitution (and by that I don't mean make law or intervene in legitimate state election decisions) has contributed mightily to our current plight.

Despite what has been reported and repeated, the president is not actually or officially chosen on Election Day. The president is not chosen upon the certification of electors by the states. The process ends in Congress. And on Jan. 6, Congress — following both the Constitution and its own procedural law — makes the final decision on who is to be president and vice president of the United States. Of course, in every election in my lifetime, up to now, while there have been some controversies, the process has proceeded without much attention. But this time is different, as it must be. The Democrat Party, its surrogates, and eventually the Biden campaign instituted an unprecedented legal and lobbying campaign, mostly under the radar, as it was not well covered by the usual media outlets, to undermine our Constitution, the Republican state legislatures, and the Trump re-election campaign, in favor of Biden. In other words, the Constitution's electoral process for choosing electors and ultimately the president and vice president was systematically and strategically attacked. It is now left to Congress, or at least the Republicans in Congress, to confront this. The Democrat Party has done severe damage to the nation's electoral system, to the point where the state legislatures are now in the position of having the least input on the manner in which elections are held and federal electors are chosen — the complete opposite of what the Constitution compels and the framers unequivocally intended. And the legislatures in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia have, in a variety of ways, objected to what's occurred, underscoring the seriousness of the problem.

If this outcome is allowed to stand without a fight on Jan. 6, it is difficult to see how this can be fixed. The Democrats will view this as a sure sign that they are free to do more and even worse. It will become extremely difficult for Republicans to win nationwide elections (something the ten or so GOP senators who wish to run for president should keep in mind). It will also become increasingly difficult to win a Republican majority in the Senate. And the 2020 constitutional violations will be used as a baseline for even more unconstitutional manipulations of the electoral system. The Democrat Party's goal is to turn the nation's electoral system into the one-party rule that exists in virtually all blue states, especially California with its supermajorities.

As I said earlier, win, lose, or draw, the congressional Republicans must act. It is the Democrats and their media who seek to undo election results by undoing the election system. Look at what they did in 2016 (need I remind everyone of the relentless assault against candidate and then President Trump?) and now 2020. And they have every intention, as they have boldly proclaimed, to further undermine our constitutional system should they win the Senate majority in a few days — by eliminating the filibuster and any ability to slow their radical legislative agenda; packing the Supreme Court with left-wing ideologues; and packing the Senate with four more Democrats from Puerto Rico and D.C. And that's just for starters. This is the same party that did not care that it had no hope of removing President Trump in the Senate, but impeached him anyway — on the most specious of grounds. They are playing for keeps and destroying our constitutional system, for which they have little regard. I am well aware that it takes a majority of both Houses to send the election of the president to the House of Representatives, where each delegation gets one vote, an extremely difficult hurdle.

Nonetheless, it is not asking too much for the Republicans to uphold the United States Constitution — which they all took an oath to do — and to fight to preserve and protect the plain words set forth in Article II. They must make the case to and on behalf of the American people. And they must make it clear to the Democrats that we, the people, who believe in this Republic, will not roll over! Now, let's see how many statesmen there are among Republican members of Congress.

Remember the ‘travel ban’? Lower courts are seeking to ‘overturn’ that Supreme Court decision,"For several generations, we have been told by the political elites that the Supreme Court stands above the other two branches of government, even when the high court violates the Constitution or claims to decide a broad public policy question squarely within the purview or powers of the other branches. Now, it appears that any lower court can simply issue a ruling more progressive than what the Supreme Court just said, and the other branches feel compelled to abide by that ruling!

Remember when a slew of lower courts created a right to immigrate for the first time and issued unprecedented injunctions demanding that Trump surrender to the courts his control over the right of entry into the United States? Well, we all thought that insanity was put to rest when the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. Hawaii that the president has unquestionable authority to shut off any or all forms of immigration when he believes it's detrimental to American interests, as it plainly says in 8 U.S.C. §1182.

Evidently, some of the lower court judges who were overturned by the Supreme Court on this issue are now granting standing to some of the same groups to sue again! U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang of Maryland ruled last Thursday that a lawsuit can proceed against the travel ban from five countries.

A group of refugee resettlement contractors and other immigration groups are suing because they don't like the process the administration has set up to allow waivers of the ban. The problem is that the Supreme Court said quite clearly that the president can disallow migration without offering any waivers whatsoever. Chief Justice John Roberts could not have been any clearer:

""By its terms, §1182(f) exudes deference to the President in every clause,"" wrote Roberts in the majority opinion in Trump v. Hawaii. ""It entrusts to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, for how long, and on what conditions. It thus vests the President with 'ample power' to impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere enumerated in the INA."" (Emphasis added.)

Yet there is no stigma in the legal profession against lower court judges attempting to obstruct and twist Supreme Court rulings they disagree with. Judge Chuang, without ever mentioning the fact that he himself was overturned on this very issue, brazenly declared that Trump v. Hawaii was only ""representing a snapshot in time and does not necessarily preclude a different determination at a later stage of the case on a more fulsome record."" From reading most of his opinion, you'd have thought it was the Trump administration that lost in the Supreme Court.

Taking that position to its logical conclusion, a lower court can always find ways that the same question presented in a slightly different case is not governed by the obvious controlling Supreme Court precedent because that SCOTUS case was only ""a snapshot in time.""

Liberals are seeking similar lawsuits against the travel ban in their favorite California courts as well. In February, Judge James Donato allowed a similar lawsuit to proceed in the Northern District of California.

Justice Clarence Thomas has warned about the need to end this practice of lower court universal injunctions, which not only violate the separation of powers between the courts and the other branches, but also essentially strip the Supreme Court of its legitimate supremacy over the judicial branch itself.

In June 2017, Thomas warned, after the Supreme Court initially removed only part of the lower court injunction against the travel ban, that the forum shoppers would continue to go back to the same repudiated lower courts.

""Litigation of the factual and legal issues that are likely to arise will presumably be directed to the two District Courts whose initial orders in these cases this Court has now— unanimously—found sufficiently questionable to be stayed as to the vast majority of the people potentially affected,"" warned an irate Thomas during the preliminary stages of the lawsuit.

If these same district judges place another injunction on Trump's partial immigration moratorium, will he suddenly begin issuing visas to these people unless the Supreme Court steps in yet again? How can the Supreme Court both (wrongly) be regarded as supreme over the other branches but not supreme over its own inferior courts?

According forum-shopped judges, they have the power to continuously alter public policy for years until the case reaches the Supreme Court, not only when we know they will be reversed but when they have already been reversed. This is a recipe for a banana republic.

This is part of a broader trend of lower courts ""repealing"" Supreme Court opinions they don't like. In one of the most egregious rulings of all time, a California judge said that Trump must continue the discretionary and temporary program of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) because Trump, in the estimation of Judge Edward Chen, has ""animus against non-white, non-European immigrants."" SCOTUS already said in Trump v. Hawaii that such considerations cannot be used to block the president's lawful authority, but the Trump administration refused to delegitimize this ruling.

More recently, two federal judges, one in Oregon and one in Washington, issued injunctions against Trump's gag rule prohibiting Title X recipients from referring women for abortions. The Supreme Court upheld this exact regulation under Reagan in Rust v. Sullivan (1991), but Judges Michael McShane and Stanley Bastian ignored it.

Lower courts have similarly gutted the Heller decision over the past decade, often citing Justice Stephen Breyer's dissent. Recently, a federal judge in Oregon essentially overturned the landmark Janus decision last year banning forced union dues. Thus, while conservatives have lost marriage, life, and so many cultural issues to the Supreme Court and have unquestioningly accepted those rulings as gospel, liberals respond to the few losses at the high court with, ""Hold my beer and let me show you the power of a district judge.""

It's important to note that the lower courts already won in the travel ban case by successfully forcing Trump to water down his original order twice. The original order prioritized persecuted Christians in the Middle East for refugee resettlement and placed caps on refugees. It was actually upheld by one Massachusetts judge, but the administration wrongly agreed to the notion that another single district judge can shut it down. Even though the Supreme Court's ruling would easily have covered the original order, were Trump to ever strengthen it, the courts would begin the process again.

Allowing this cancer of lower court supremacy to continue brings irrevocable harm to our country. A liberal legal writer for Slate observed approvingly this week how the ""lower courts are lobbying SCOTUS to rein in partisan gerrymandering"" and that ""while SCOTUS dillydallies, the lower courts are taking action, aggressively overturning gerrymanders across the country.""

The term ""lobbying"" is quite peculiar to describe a court, but Slate is not wrong in its observation of how lower courts are pushing the Supreme Court rather than being pulled by it. Despite the fact that the Supreme Court has already signaled in a Wisconsin case that the courts shouldn't get involved in most political gerrymandering decisions and is deciding the ultimate case on the issue within weeks, two federal judges in Michigan and Ohio brazenly declared the GOP maps in both states unconstitutional after the states had been electing congressmen for a decade based on those lines.

Let's face it: conservatives have done a poor job educating people on the role of the judiciary over the past few generations. They have agreed to the notion that the Supreme Court rules on political issues absolutely. But now, the trend of progressive lower court supremacism has not only contradicted our constitutional system of checks and balances, but has butted heads with Supreme Court supremacism itself.

The real truth is that this has never been about a principled belief in judicial supremacism, but rather a pragmatic stratagem of ""heads we win, tails you lose"" on the part of the left. If the Trump administration continues to legitimize these decisions, it has nobody else to blame.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/levin-on-january-6-we-learn-whether-our-constitution-will-hold,2019-05-08
Editorial: How did the New York Times end up publishing a piece of Chinese propaganda?,"I don't read the New York Times anymore (and haven't for years), but Thursday night I saw someone tweet a Times piece titled, ""World Feared China Over Coronavirus. Now the Tables Are Turned,"" and I couldn't help myself.

It shouldn't be surprising anymore to find a piece that might literally be communist propaganda in the pages of the Old Grey Lady — after all, I lived through the Cold War when such a thing was a regular occurrence, and Tom Friedman has been publishing communist China's press releases as columns in the NYT for years.

It is still jarring, though, to see what unbelievable suckers NYT writers can apparently be for even the most fantastic and unbelievable claims, as long as those claims are made by a totalitarian communist regime. The actual thesis of Thursday's piece was that China has done a much better job of containing the coronavirus than has most of the West and that the Chinese government (and people!) are now sitting around wondering why we in the West are all so bad at containing the coronavirus.

Seriously.

Here is just one of the pieces of obvious bovine fecal material that slipped through the layers and layers of editors and fact checking that we are constantly assured exist at the Times: ""But on Thursday, [China] reported no new local cases for the first time since the outbreak began. Its uncompromising response — locking down cities, shutting factories, testing thousands — seems to have brought China's contagion under control.""

Now, it might be technically true that China reported no new local cases on Thursday. However, only the world's most irresponsible journalist — or the world's biggest idiot — would print that claim without pointing out that it's obviously false.

The chances that there were zero new cases of coronavirus in China on Thursday are, well, zero. You do not have to be an expert in infectious diseases to know that this is not how they work. You just have to be possessed of the common sense and skepticism that God gave the average fifth-grader.

If President Donald Trump had announced Thursday that there were no new cases of coronavirus reported by the United States government, the Times would have printed five news articles debunking the claim and three opinion columns about what an irresponsible leader Trump was for making such an obviously false claim. But when the Chinese government — which has literally kicked out Western journalists so no one can see what is going on — made the same claim, the Times just uncritically printed it.

Of course, numerous courageous whistleblowers from inside China have stated the obvious — that the Chinese government's claims of a miraculous recovery are fake. But no one should need those whistleblowers to know that the ChiComms' claims were obvious lies, any more than North Korea needs whistleblowers to tell the world that Kim Jong Il did not actually bowl a perfect 300 the first time he ever bowled.

Making up fantastic lies about the perfection of their government and leadership is what communist governments do. It's a signature hallmark of communism to never ever admit that the government has made a mistake and to further claim that the government has accomplished fantastic miracles that Western governments could not replicate (because, in every case, no government could actually do those things).

But even if you got a job at the Times without somehow being aware of how communist governments have operated for the last 100 years, any person possessed of a fully formed cerebral cortex should have known not to uncritically reprint such fantastical claims about China's success at controlling the spread of the virus, especially after China kicked out all journalists who don't work for its state-sanctioned media.

So why didn't these reporters and editors from the Times?

I think a lot about Stephen Glass, in my line of work. Glass, if you will remember, hoodwinked his editors at the liberal New Republic for years with stories that were entirely made up. He quoted people who didn't exist. He retold stories that never happened. And when his malfeasance was finally exposed, his editors had a day of reckoning. And what they admitted, frankly, was that they did not check his work as diligently as they should have because his stories confirmed their pre-existing biases and beliefs.

Newspaper editors ought to have pictures of Stephen Glass hung on their walls, if they don't want to end up getting embarrassed like the New Republic was. Because that lesson — always question stories that confirm your beliefs the most — is a necessary one.

I try to be fair and accurate with the facts as an editor. But I am not so unaware of myself that I don't think I have natural biases and beliefs. I'm aware that I tend strongly toward libertarianism and suspicion of government power, regardless of which major political party is in power.

So when I see a story that tends to suggest that government is doing a great job or that a burdensome regulation is necessary, my pre-existing beliefs provide skepticism for me. I automatically look to poke holes in the story and question the underlying assumptions therein specifically because they challenge my core beliefs.

However, when a story confirms those beliefs and biases, the natural tendency is to let your fact-checking guard down. ""Why, of course this story is true,"" I might think to myself, ""Because of course government and regulation are mostly evil."" This is where danger arises both as a private citizen and also as a person in the news business.

And this, I think, is where the Times got suckered into being a national laughingstock Thursday — again. The media have somehow convinced themselves that it's really important to obsess about the fact that President Trump refers to coronavirus sometimes as a ""Chinese virus,"" and they hate him so much that they would like to believe that even the obviously corrupt and dishonest Chinese government is doing better at controlling coronavirus than he is. After all, that would help sell their most treasured belief, which is that he should be defeated at the ballot box in November.

And so, because of these pre-existing biases, the Times let down its guard and allowed really obvious lies to slip through uncritically.

It should be noted that this is the most charitable possible explanation for this travesty of an article. It is, I suppose, possible that the Times is following the craven example of the NBA and openly kowtowing to the Chinese in an attempt to get its reporters back into China.

Either way, it's a shame. The world could use honest reporting in the middle of this crisis about what's really going on in China. Sadly, they will not get it from the New York Times.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/lower-courts-are-seeking-to-overturn-supreme-court-immigration-ruling,2020-03-20
Read like the Republic depends on it — because it does,"""It's so nice to see someone reading,"" a waitress said to my husband. He was waiting for me alone at a café while I was having my nails manicured.



He found her enthusiasm peculiar yet complimentary, and he chuckled when he told me what she had said to him. Perhaps it was the shock of witnessing a book instead of an iPhone between the fingers of a millennial.

My husband could have narrowly been among the 6% of Americans who read digital books only, but he's not, and neither am I.

It's not difficult to guess why the sight of a book in my husband's hand made the waitress hazard a comment: Books are threatening to go the way of 8-tracks, VHS players and rotary telephones.

The number of Americans who willingly read has declined since the 1980s, partly due to the advent of television, the internet, and, one could argue, the torrent of 24/7 push notifications in the palm of our hands.

In 2017, the Academy of American Arts & Sciences showed that voluntary reading rates hit a record-low among American adults.

Outside of work and school, 53% of adults in 2017 read at least one nonfiction or fiction book for personal interest.

In the same degree, those who are reading spend an average of 17 minutes per day doing so.

The time spent with books daily is even less among younger Americans between the ages of 15 and 44. They leaf through books about 10 minutes per day.

Contrast the year 2017 with the year 1992 when at least 61% of American adults read at least one book for personal interest per year.

As the survey noted, that's a 14% drop in reading rates among Americans within 25 years.

With these statistics in mind, it's no wonder that the sight of a millennial holding an actual book would elicit comment from a total stranger — a stranger who was probably more used to seeing people glued to the ever-present smartphone.

For better or for worse, smartphones have entirely re-conditioned our bodily autonomy. We feel utterly vulnerable without them, and replacing them with anything else, much less a book, feels like a coup d 'état.

To that I say, ""Vive la résistance!"" Books — and the power they provide — are so much more beneficial to our actual well-being than smartphones — which science suggests may be causing serious addiction and physical problems among younger generations in particular.

Take, for example, the unhealthy and unnecessary obsession our smartphones create. When we're away from them, we're physically stressed.

Research by Dr. Nancy Cheever at California State University observed the effects they have on us using equipment to measure the heart rates and perspiration levels of two teenage girls.

""I'm just going to put your phones back here because they might interfere with the equipment a little bit,"" she told them. They had no idea Cheever was measuring the physiological changes their bodies experience in the absence of their smartphones.

While the two were attached to Cheever's equipment, she began texting and calling the girls' cellphones so they could hear the alerts.

Cheever recorded sweating and increased levels of stress and anxiety that were four times higher than that of an adult who had participated in the same experiment. Prior to smartphones, the leading cause of stress among students was poverty.

Studies have also shown that excessive usage leads to less sleep, lower self-esteem, shorter attention spans, memory loss, a lack of creativity, and decreased analytical skills.



The paradox is that the benefits reading provides are antithetical to the effects smartphones impose, yet we care more for the latter.

For starters, reading reduces stress, helps slow down the process of memory loss, contributes to a healthy night's sleep, and most importantly, increases empathy.

Analysis has also shown that those who read are also more likely to remain civic-minded and engaged in democracy.

In one of the most comprehensive studies on reading by the National Endowment for the Arts, research showed that reading contributed directly to good citizenship.

Proficient readers are twice as likely to participate in volunteer work, are more likely to vote, and are more likely to maintain a greater curiosity surrounding current events.

NEA made it clear that while the study can't prove there's causation, the interest group is positive there's a correlation:

""With lower levels of reading and writing ability, people do less well in the job market. Poor reading skills correlate heavily with lack of employment, lower wages, and fewer opportunities for advancement. Significantly worse reading skills are found among prisoners than in the general adult population. And deficient readers are less likely to become active in civic and cultural life, most notably in volunteerism and voting.""

Additionally, in 2003, 84% of Americans proficient in reading voted in the 2000 presidential election while only 53% of nonreaders showed up to the polls.

If the benefits of reading are a win-win for everyone, why are so many of us doing so little of it?

One could argue too many Americans are ignorant to the benefits they provide. In Matthew Arnold's ""Culture and Anarchy"" (1869), Arnold argues that reading ""the best that has been thought and said"" is the panacea to our cultural deficiencies.

Humanities professors could also be at fault for misconstruing what reading was intended for.

Rather than teaching students to utilize books as a tool to refine their minds and their beliefs, students are taught to tear down astute observations by criticizing them, rejecting them, and reducing them to outdated rubbish.

This nihilistic approach to some of the greatest works of our time creates a backward culture by creating a faulty illusion that critical thinking is supposed to be about destroying instead of building.

This robs the individual of their agency by preventing them from obtaining meaningful convictions and values. This approach also produces a society that believes in empty nothingness.

Horowitz: 9 laws Republicans must pass to stop voter fraud,"How is it that in the year 2020, our elections look more dysfunctional than other modern countries' and more chaotic than our elections were during the time of our grandparents? The answer is that Democrats have institutionalized fraud by subverting the entire concept of Election Day and basic verification standards. If this election is not a wake-up call for Republicans to clean up election fraud, at least in the states they control, they deserve to be victims of these ""glitches"" and will likely never win a national election again.

Here are nine commonsense ideas that anyone who wants a fair election would have no problem implementing:

1. Issue a voter photo ID to all registered voters : I need an ID card to own a gun in my home state. There is no reason we should not have a voting ID card issued by the state and subject to renewal every 6-8 years.

2. Prohibit mail-in ballots for federal elections : There is a reason why the majority of European Union countries ban mail-in ballots for those not living abroad. They are prone to all sorts of fraud, which dates back to our 1864 election. This is why we should ban all mail-in ballots except for those serving in the military.

3. Absentee balloting should be limited to individuals who cannot vote in person : These ballots would require a witness signature and a copy of the voter's photo ID accompanying the ballot.

4. All ballot-harvesting should be banned : Any individuals eligible for an absentee ballot must submit their own ballots. Nursing homes and other similar institutions would be exempted from the prohibition on third-party submissions, but would be subjected to strict rules and monitoring for the submission process.

5. Guard all drop-off boxes with 24/7 security : There's no reason we should be experiencing these mystery dumps from drop-off boxes. States must ensure there is a secure chain of custody of all ballot collection venues at all times.

6. No more early voting : Election Day means Election Day. It should be declared a national holiday to facilitate voting. More funding should be directed toward expanding the number of polling stations and hiring more poll workers to deal with the growing population. But then we should all vote like we used to for so many years – on Election Day itself.

7. Explicitly authorize states to require proof of citizenship to vote : Photo ID requirements would vet fraudulent voters, but not non-citizens. Alien voters are not as high in numbers as citizen fraud, but they still can make a difference in the increasingly close elections. This is why states must be empowered to require proof of citizenship to register to vote, especially given the fact that non-citizens obtain driver's licenses, which are used as a seamless pipeline for voter registration. Alternatively, we can require that states and localities use the federal SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) database or E-Verify to check for non-citizens voting

8. Tighten up section 8 of the motor voter law , which requiresstates to ""make a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters,"" by creating a clear process of cleaning up the voter rolls of deceased and out-of-state voters. Scores of counties still have more registered voters than the total population in the jurisdiction. This is a recipe for disaster, and any opposition to cleaning these rolls can only be motivated by an agenda to promote voter fraud.

9. Require body cameras on vote counters and processers : If this standard is good enough for the police, it's good enough for those who secure the lynchpin of a representative republic.

Putting this election aside, nobody can deny that our election system is broken and has been getting progressively worse. It's time to move our election system into the 21st century. When it comes to securing the franchise, we should not trust; we must verify. An election without verification disenfranchises every legal voter. Why would leftists oppose any of these verification standards that are required for many less consequential private and public functions than voting? Why do they fear honest elections?



The best time to start with some of these reforms is now. There are two extremely important Senate races that will occur in Georgia on January 5. There is a Republican governor, and his party controls the House 103-75 and the Senate 35-21. Why on earth would they not move on some of the reforms tomorrow and ensure that there is no rampant mail-in fraud?

The bottom line is that if Georgia Republicans fail to lead by example, they deserve to lose. As the saying goes, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/read-like-the-republic-depends-on-it-because-it-does,2020-11-12
"Horowitz: For the first time in our lives, free speech is about to be criminalized","""Our First Amendment freedoms give us the right to think what we like and say what we please. And if we the people are to govern ourselves, we must have these rights, even if they are misused by a minority."" ~James Madison

We never thought this day would arrive in America. Last year, we learned that they can shout ""COVID"" as an emergency, and our life, liberty, and property disappear. They can shout ""racism,"" and our inalienable right to self-defense disappears. The last thing we had was the freedom to criticize what is happening, even if there was nothing we can do about it. Now they can shout ""right-wing terrorism"" or ""right-wing conspiracy"" and say that freedom of speech no longer applies.

Leftists in this country claim that their violence is speech and our speech is violence. That is why they glorified riots last year that burned down numerous cities, caused thousands of injuries, cost billions of dollars, and elevated their cause as the most urgent grievance in need of redress. At the same time, they are pushing to criminalize not just the violent acts and actors at the Capitol on January 6, but any view or speech or assembly predicated on views that are held by those people. This is why they seem to be taking direct shots at the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech for Americans, even as they plan to grant amnesty to those whose entire presence in this country is illegal.

As everyone focuses on the corporate world violating the spirit of the First Amendment by excommunicating anyone with conservative views, watch carefully how the governmental actors are coming very close to violating the letter of the First Amendment with the force of the ""law"" behind it. Big tech might have a monopoly on the internet and communications, but government has a monopoly on violence, law, and the ability to restrain our liberty. If we don't wake up immediately, our speech and freedom to assemble will be not only censored, but criminalized.

It started on January 6, when Tom Edsall published a column in the New York Times noting, ""A debate has broken out over whether the once-sacrosanct constitutional protection of the First Amendment has become a threat to democracy."" This is a tried and tested tactic of the Left – to have their columnists float a radical idea as a ""debate,"" while their governmental actors begin working on it in earnest.

Just take stock of what we are seeing out in the open. They are now arresting people all over the country for merely being in the Capitol, even if they didn't engage in violence, vandalism, or theft. Had this standard been applied to Black Lives Matter, there would literally have been millions of arrests. So no, this is not just about punishing those who acted violently. The FBI is placing signs all over the country asking people to report those who were at the Capitol, something that never happened even in the most deadly BLM/Antifa riots last year, or at Trump's inauguration four years ago in D.C.

They are militarizing D.C. with 20,000 troops, when the threat of violence against Trump's inaugural guests four years ago was exponentially greater. They are declaring emergencies in states as remote as New Mexico with no evidence of violence present. Garrett Soldano, a leader in the anti-lockdown movement in Michigan, claims the FBI paid him a two-hour visit because a local called the FBI and claimed he is a violent extremist.



If the FBI had done this when hundreds of cities were on fire for days on end with no control among local police departments, I would just feel they are being overly cautious. Given that BLM was promoted as the leader of our civic discourse and we are all being treated like terrorists, however, we should be very scared they are coming for the First Amendment, not for national security. Remember, the Justice Department seems to believe this was a planned attack. So the hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters who just came there to express their views had no idea that a few bad actors were planning this. The fact that they are hunting down anyone and everyone should scare us all.

Last week, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said emphatically that the First Amendment doesn't apply to sentiments he disagrees with. ""This idea that saying that Pennsylvania was 'rigged' or that we were 'trying to steal the election' — that's a lie. And you do not have the right, that is not protected speech.""



Thus, from now on, Democrats can unilaterally change election law in middle of an election – up until and including abolishing Election Day in favor of mail-in ballots – and anyone who criticizes it or organizes a rally against it is subject to prosecution? These comments would be comical if they didn't coincide with actions taken by his party coming into power in Washington that look a lot like martial law.

In other words, if you watch the language the Left is using about our speech and the actions the Biden administration and the governors are taking, it's quite evident that Big Tech is not the only thing we have to worry about. If nothing changes, I predict that even if Parler is able to become completely independent in the private market, the government, which has the ultimate monopoly on power, will shut it down.

Last week, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the same man who is prosecuting business owners and threatening them with labor camps for earning a living, said on a conference call with prosecutors that he is investigating those from his state who merely attended the rally.



Already in 2019, Richard Stengel, the Biden transition ""team lead"" for the U.S. Agency for Global Media, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that the First Amendment needs curtailment. ""All speech is not equal. And where truth cannot drive out lies, we must add new guardrails. I'm all for protecting 'thought that we hate,' but not speech that incites hate,"" wrote Stengal.

This is pretty bizarre coming from a side of politics that already controls 99% of all speech and big business that controls speech. What exactly are they afraid of? If anything, we are the ones who should be scared of their speech, given the monopoly they hold.

Well, George Washington already warned us about the motivations of those who clamp down on speech. ""For if Men are to be precluded from offering their Sentiments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences, that can invite the consideration of Mankind, reason is of no use to us; the freedom of Speech may be taken away, and, dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter,"" said Washington in an address to the Continental Army on March 15, 1783.

The question facing patriots in the coming days is quite simply this: Will we allow that final domino to fall?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitz-9-laws-republicans-must-pass-to-stop-voter-fraud,2021-01-18
Horowitz: Masking children playing sports outdoors is anti-science child abuse,"Imagine having children run a 3-mile track and field exercise gasping for oxygen, outdoors, while not exhibiting symptoms of a virus, all for the suspicion of a virus that poses less a problem to them than typical seasonal pathogens. Even if masks somehow worked, how can any sane person with a sense of humanity in his bones justify the harm to children weighed against any known problem of transmission and illness to children, especially outdoors?

Children rarely get as sick from COVID-19 as they do from the flu or stomach bugs, and most of them don't even get as sick as they do from the common cold. Out of the millions of children who have likely gotten the virus, the CDC studied the 182 reported pediatric deaths through December 31, 2020, and found that even among those purported to be COVID deaths, 35% of them were completely unrelated to COVID and only 8 were attributed only to COVID-19.

Even if we included the bogus deaths, this chart from my friend Emily Burns places this infinitesimally low infection fatality rate into context relative to the flu:

If this is enough justification to destroy the lives of our children with masking for seven hours a day, then how can we ever go back to normal when the flu season typically causes more disruption to the lives of children? Also, children are primary vectors of spread for the flu, whereas they rarely spread this virus. A CDC study published in JAMA a few months ago found in-school transmission to be ""very rare"" among the 11 school districts in North Carolina that were studied.



Separately, the CDC concedes, ""Children might be more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 than are adults."" Consequently, it admits that because asymptomatic people really do not spread very often, that is likely the reason why we are not seeing outbreaks in schools. ""This apparent lack of transmission [in schools] is consistent with recent research (5), which found an asymptomatic attack rate of only 0.7% within households and a lower rate of transmission from children than from adults,"" wrote the CDC in a January 29 report.

Thus, they admit that children rarely spread this virus and that asymptomatic carriers in general rarely spread. So, a child who has no prima facie symptoms being forced to mask in schools, even indoors, is utterly insane, putting aside the fact that masks have not shown to alter the trajectory of the virus anywhere on earth. Remember, a Wisconsin study showed just one child out of 30,000 involved in high school sports during the peak of the spread last fall contracted the virus through a sports activity. And again, they become less ill from this virus than from so many typical pathogens that we've lived with forever.

But now let's take this to a new level – masking children outdoors. Even in most states that have removed statewide mask mandates, many local schools still require masks in school, even outdoors during recess and during sports. Even Fauci recently admitted there is no problem outdoors. When asked why cases are going down in Texas one month after terminating the mask mandate while they are increasing in the heavily masked northeastern states, Fauci offered the unverifiable supposition: ""It could be they're doing things outdoors.""







Putting aside the fact that this is not true because Texas clearly is holding more events indoors than New Jersey and Michigan are (Texas has no indoor restrictions), even though the latter states are seeing an increase in cases, Fauci is at least implying that there should be no need for masking outdoors even if masks were effective. Why, then, is he not calling for an end to cruel outdoor masking, at least of children?



We have five aces in the hole:

Masks have not proven effective anywhere on earth;

Children are not in danger from this virus;

Children are not vectors of spread;

Asymptomatic carriers rarely spread;

Transmission outdoors is exceedingly rare.

So how can such mandates hold up in court, given the physical, developmental, and emotional harms to children?

Even regarding adults who are more effected by the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated last June that ""the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence and there are potential benefits and harms to consider."" Well, since that time, we have had at least two waves of viral spread after mask-wearing had already become more ubiquitously enforced than anyone could have imagined.

""Widespread mask-wearing could prevent COVID-19 second waves: study,"" read the headline of a June 9 Reuters article. Places like Los Angeles and the Czech Republic experienced the steepest waves after mask-wearing was nearly 100% prevalent and even though the mask-wearing began early on when the virus was barely present.





Since then, we have had the only randomized controlled trial courtesy of the Danes failing to find any benefit from mask-wearing, which harmonizes with the 10 RCTs from previous years identified by the CDC showing zero efficacy of mask-wearing against the flu. Which is why the CDC reported in a survey that 85% of people sampled with COVID last July admitted to always wearing masks.



Over the past year, the burden of proof for us to maintain our rights has wrongly been placed on us rather than on government. We are being forced to prove we are 100% not a threat or else we have no right to breathe. They never have to prove their wild and novel assumptions. But by now we have a reached a point when we actually have 100% proof that mask-wearing for children is completely unnecessary, if not harmful. If a government can force children to cover their mouths outdoors with no symptoms using masks with pores 50 times larger than the virus – all for a virus that poses no risk to them – is there anything government cannot do to them?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitz-for-the-first-time-in-our-lives-free-speech-is-about-to-be-criminalized,2021-04-09
"Horowitz: NYC officials target Jewish business owner for COVID citation, while Biden supporters hold wild parties","There's election fraud, but then there's also governing fraud. Even if one legitimately wins an election, he cannot do whatever he wants to the citizenry. We live in a republic where the government is constrained by rules and cannot indiscriminately violate civil liberties. Yet that appears to have gone out the window in New York City, as Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio target Jewish-owned businesses.

You would think they'd be busy with the gang warfare in the city streets or the beatings in the subways, but a New York City sheriff's deputy was seen harassing a woman who owns a pottery shop in Brooklyn for supposed COVID violations. Yesterday, the local city councilman posted the video of the encounter with the following message:

Numerous videos have surfaced on the internet in recent days showing Jewish business owners and schools in Cuomo's ""red zone"" of ""certain zip codes"" Brooklyn being harassed by law enforcement and accused, often wrongly, of violating his latest arbitrary edict.



Perhaps there is something more insidious about the targeting of those zip codes:

The problem with those business owners is that they are not throwing Biden celebration parties with marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs. That would be lauded as the highest form of democratic expression.





Folks, this is the governing fraud on display before your eyes. In some ways, this is a more dangerous form of cheating than even dead people voting. In a constitutional republic, we shouldn't have to worry about our lives being at stake based on the results of an election, even if one side cheats to achieve their electoral win. Now we all have to fear this sort of sickening double standard on civil liberties in Kamala Harris' America. This is an America where criminal is victim, illegal alien is citizen, man is woman, income is welfare, and welfare is income. This is not a part of the sacred document that was signed in 1787.



We are not the ones who badly want our guy in the Oval Office as much as the other side wants their man. We think most decisions should be up to local authority and that certain policies are off-limits and out of constitutional bounds. It is the other side that seeks to dominate us by shutting down our houses of worship, schools, businesses, and even our own mouths and noses.

Meanwhile, as government does everything that it is constitutionally prohibited from doing, it refuses to protect us from criminals. My entire neighborhood in Baltimore County is being ravaged by carjackers, as criminals have become emboldened by the anti-prison stance of the Democrat Party. Now that they know prison is only reserved for someone opening a business or not wearing a mask, they feel they can terrorize neighborhoods with impunity because, after all, they are usually wearing masks when committing their dastardly deeds.



Folks, this is about a lot more than just election fraud. It's about governing fraud that makes King George look like James Madison. Indeed, the great revolution was fought over much less. The tyranny under King George wasn't that bad precisely because the Patriots didn't let the usurpations deteriorate to the point of debilitating their ability to militate against them. As John Adams so presciently warned in 1774, ""Nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, is the only maxim which can ever preserve the liberties of any people."" Sadly, we've allowed those buds of tyranny to blossom ever so strongly.

Roth: Where is the accountability? We have rampant moral hazards from government; who will stop them from destroying everything?,"When our country was founded as a representative constitutional republic, the size, scope, and purview of government was intentionally limited. The government’s role was to uphold and protect the natural rights of Americans as individuals, and it was structured to make sure the individuals had a say in any decisions.



It made sense, given the limited nature of government, to also have limited accountability for those involved in government, including the people’s representatives.

Today, the government at all levels has exploded, moving far past its original purpose. Its size, scope, and purview are staggering. At the federal level, it moves around multiple trillions of dollars each year and it has incurred $30 trillion in debt on our behalf — with actual obligations and promises far exceeding that total. Rules and regulations are so numerous, it’s hard to get an accounting on all of them. And over the past couple of years, the government at all levels has made decisions that impacted individual health and well-being and the overall economy via actions where elected official overstepped their authority.

All of this creates substantial moral hazard — actions whereby individuals or groups take on additional risks because they don’t bear the full, or in some cases, any, consequences of their actions.

Take the current state of inflation. Rampant inflation was the predictable outgrowth of a slew of bad monetary, fiscal, and other government policy decisions, and it is substantially impacting your financial position. Those who are charged with ensuring the economy runs well (something no government official should be charged with to begin with), made decisions that directly caused this outcome. They publicly stated over and over that it wouldn’t be a problem. Yet, while we have to suffer the financial consequences, what happens to them?

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who spent a large part of 2021 saying that high inflation wasn’t a substantial risk and who stood by while President Biden added $1.9 trillion in incremental spending via the “American Rescue Plan,” now has come out and said, “Well, look, I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,"" and that “there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy … that I didn’t, at the time, didn’t fully understand.""

Well, at least she admitted it, which is more than one can say for most. But, what kind of accountability does she have? In the years between being fed chair and secretary of the treasury, she made a reported $7.2 million giving economic speeches, and yet she couldn’t see the inflation that you and I all knew was coming (or purposely downplayed it)!

Will she be fired? Will she lose status and benefits? Or will she keep on contributing to and participating in this moral hazard and then go back to raking in millions for speeches when the next president comes into office?

What about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell? His actions were so behind the curve, that he was still conducting accommodative monetary policy for a year and three quarters after the June 5, 2020, intraday-high record of the Nasdaq Composite, and for two months after the U.S. was already experiencing a 40-year high in inflation. His punishment? Being reappointed for a new term as fed chairman.

The list goes on and on. Nancy Pelosi has voted for much of our national debt, yet her “punishment” is making a fortune trading on information whit which she may possess special insight or even ability to act. Anthony Fauci and a whole slew of bad actors misled the public and overstepped their boundaries creating physical health issues, mental health issues, and economic issues in their wake. What kind of responsibility will these individuals bear? The sad answer is none.

Nationally syndicated radio host and TV personality Jesse Kelly has been active in suggesting trials. In one recent tweet he said, “Not one politician or government official has stood trial for what they did to us during COVID. In fact, not one national Republican is even saying they should. That’s why I know they’re gonna do it again. They’re not afraid. They should be, but they’re not afraid.”

And that’s the truth. There are no consequences, so what stops this from happening over and over? The government needs to be restored to its original purposes, but in the meantime, if individuals are going to have the responsibilities and power that they currently do — overseeing trillions of spending, interfering in individual health and more — they need to have accountability as well.

We need to put better people in place and create consequences for their actions, or the ultimate consequence will be the destruction of everything.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitz-nyc-officials-target-jewish-business-owner-for-covid-citation-while-biden-supporters-hold-wild-parties,2022-06-06

But it doesn't want to beat Trump badly enough that it's willing to do what would actually beat him.

Otherwise, Democrats would be following the model of Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, who just won re-election in his deeply red state despite the president going all-in down the campaign stretch to oust him. However, while the GOP gained even more power across the state of Louisiana, Gov. Edwards survived. Insulated from Trumpian attacks largely because of the important pro-life legislation he not only signed into law, but publicly championed as well (and still does).

And it's not just that Gov. Edwards might be the last truly pro-life Democrat left in a meaningful office anywhere in America. It's what his pro-life stance symbolized to the very voters Trump needs but is on shaky ground with — suburbanites.

Gov. Edwards is a West Point graduate, a veteran, son of a law enforcement sheriff, and pro-Second Amendment. At the same time, he also champions the traditional liberal economic issues on labor and health care. In other words, he's a pro-life Bill Clinton (minus the sleaze).

And unlike a lot of Southern Democrats who will campaign on those themes and then once elected govern like the cultural Marxists they always were, Gov. Edwards actually has a record that says otherwise. That's why he won the Baton Rouge suburbs former Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) lost in the 2014 midterms. In fact, Gov. Edwards out-performed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign by a whopping 16 points in those suburbs, and it's why he'll remain governor of the state another four years.

See, Hillary let it be known she was a disruptor to your Pleasant Valley Sundays in the suburbs. She fully intended to bring the culture war you move out to the suburbs to avoid, right to your cul-de-sac. So in the end, while you may be a suburbanite who finds Trump and his MAGA base a little unrefined for your tastes, you're not necessarily down with turning your neighborhood into Cal-Berkeley, either.

On the other hand, Edwards makes you feel safe. Like he's not a threat to your way of life. Sure, you might disagree with him on Medicaid expansion, but you've been making a good living despite too much government for awhile now. Thus, it's a disagreement you're comfortable with working around. Edwards isn't going to turn Louisiana into a safe space for the Green New Deal.

The fact that the path blazed by Edwards in Louisiana worked in a state Trump won by 20 points in 2016 indicates it would work almost anywhere. That should send shivers down the spine of Trump's re-election team.

But here's why they can pay it no mind — there isn't a single Democrat with a path to the party's 2020 nomination capable of credibly mounting a campaign on such themes. Let alone willing.

There was a thought it was going to be Joe Biden, but on top of the fact he's sadly not with it mentally and incapable of holding the office, he's already abandoned his more moderate positions on life, religious liberty, and fossil fuels to line up with the Bolshevik Revolution that's taken over the party.

Then there's Elizabeth Warren, who's the women's studies professor that can't stop shaking her fist at you. Followed by Bernie Sanders, a died-in-the-wool Soviet who shakes both fists. Pete Buttigieg's entire candidacy is a construct of the left's culture war. For if he weren't homosexual, there's no way the white male mayor of an armpit town in Podunk, Indiana, would've even made it this far in Democratic circles.

The Gov. Edwards win absolutely is Kryptonite to Trump 2020. Except the Democrats aren't interested in winning this election nearly as much as they're only interested in winning it their way. You will be provided no safe harbor if you don't like Trump as president. It's their way or the highway, and the steep toll you will pay to get off the topsy-turvy Trump Train is America must become the People's Republic of California.

For while they love the fact Gov. Edwards beat Trump in Louisiana, the Democrats running for president hate places like Louisiana even more.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-where-is-the-accountability-we-have-rampant-moral-hazard-from-government-who-will-stop-them-from-destroying-everything,2019-11-20
Horowitz: President Trump can use this Supreme Court victory to neutralize ‘resistance’ judges,"In June 2018, following endless litigation against President Trump's ""travel ban,"" the Supreme Court stated the obvious: The president has full authority to regulate and deny entry to foreign nationals at will. Yet the lower courts continue to come back for more and are even demanding that the Trump administration hand over more information to these same litigants who should not have standing to sue, per the Supreme Court decision.

Will Trump's victory Monday at the Supreme Court for his enforcement of public charge laws have any greater success than the travel ban has had in the courts? It's up to the president and Congress to check these rogue judges.

By a vote of 5-4, the Supreme Court agreed to stay the injunction placed on Trump's public charge law by a New York district judge. It's not a surprise that five justices understand the absurdity of a lower court enjoining a modest enforcement of a long-standing law against prospective immigrants accessing welfare and then receiving a green card.

What is more important, however, is the concurrence written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, because it gets to the heart of the judicial insanity grinding our sovereignty to a halt and hampering any effort by President Trump to enforce unambiguous statutes on the books.

No matter how many times these lower courts get slapped down by the Supreme Court, they feel they can still come back for another round, even on the same issue, and halt an entire policy, beyond legitimate litigants with standing before the court. Gorsuch wrote, ""It would be delusional to think that one stay today suffices to remedy the problem."" Clearly observing this illegitimate trend of nationwide injunctions issued by forum-shopped judges in numerous other cases, Gorsuch called on his colleagues to ""at some point, confront these important objections to this increasingly widespread practice.""

Much as in Justice Thomas' concurrence in Trump v. Hawaii, Gorsuch observed that universal injunctions, used as ad hoc judicial vetoes on broad presidential authorities or statutes, clearly violates the limited scope of judicial power.

""When a court goes further than that, ordering the government to take (or not take) some action with respect to those who are strangers to the suit, it is hard to see how the court could still be acting in the judicial role of resolving cases and controversies,"" wrote Gorsuch in his concurrence.

Gorsuch went even further to illustrate some of the political chaos, absurdities, and undemocratic outcomes that are resulting from this unconstitutional practice. ""As the brief and furious history of the regulation before us illustrates, the routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions.""

Finally, Gorsuch took it to the next step and explained, as I've been warning for two years, that once you legitimize this game of forum-shopping and judicial vetoes, there's nothing stopping the Democrats from coming back for endless rounds of this:

There are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges, sitting across 94 judicial districts, and subject to review in 12 regional courts of appeal. Because plaintiffs generally are not bound by adverse decisions in cases to which they were not a party, there is a nearly boundless opportunity to shop for a friendly forum to secure a win nationwide. The risk of winning conflicting nationwide injunctions is real too.



And the stakes are asymmetric. If a single successful challenge is enough to stay the challenged rule across the country, the government's hope of implementing any new policy could face the long odds of a straight sweep, parlaying a 94-to-0 win in the district courts into a 12-to-0 victory in the courts of appeal. A single loss and the policy goes on ice—possibly for good, or just as possibly for some indeterminate period of time until another court jumps in to grant a stay. And all that can repeat, ad infinitum, until either one side gives up or this Court grants certiorari. What in this gamesmanship and chaos can we be proud of?

This is certainly refreshing. But too many supporters of the president will take this as a win and go home, simply hoping that three other justices join Gorsuch and Thomas in ""overturning"" the concept of universal injunctions. However, not only is that unlikely to happen, we shouldn't have to wait for the Supreme Court to ""allow"" us to function as a constitutional republic. The other branches of government need to put these judges in their place and refuse to give effect to their civil disobedience.

Throughout the day Monday, there were numerous headlines exclaiming how the Supreme Court ""allowed"" the public charge rule to go forward. Such language should give any constitutionalist heartburn. Courts do not stand above the other branches of government, and they do not veto or ratify policies. If that were the case, we would cease to have three co-equal, independent branches of government.

A spokesperson for the Department of Justice hailed the victory in a statement Monday and expressed ""hope"" that ""the Supreme Court is able to address the matter of nationwide injunctions once and for all at the appropriate juncture."" Well, the best way to ensure that this illegal practice doesn't continue is for the other branches to refuse to give it effect.

Congress has plenary power over the Supreme Court's subject-matter jurisdiction and judicial procedures and has full power over the entire existence of lower courts. It's a disgrace that Republicans in Congress have failed to address this with a relentless legislative push.

As for the president and the attorney general, they must heed the principle of President Abraham Lincoln and the words of his attorney general, Edward Bates: ""That is the sum of its [judicial] powers, ample and efficient for all the purposes of distributive justice among individual parties, but powerless to impose rules of action and of judgment upon the other departments.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/the-louisiana-governors-election-should-absolutely-frighten-trump-2020-but-heres-why-it-doesnt-have-to,2020-01-28
The truth about 'Palestine' and Israel's modern borders,"The Left detests Israel's right to sovereignty and a secure border as much as they detest our own. Following the release of President Trump's peace plan, the raging Left passed around a graphic on the internet attempting to depict Israel as gradually ""stealing"" land from a supposed Arab Muslim ""Palestinian"" state. The reality is just the opposite. And it's time to set the record straight.

There is no such thing as a Muslim ""Palestinian"" state

There is no such thing as a Palestinian ethnicity, at least not in the way the term is used in geopolitical parlance. Palestine is not an Arab term, nor does the term ""Palestinian"" accurately identify the Arabs living in modern-day Israel, including in Judea and Samaria. The term originated from the Romans, who captured ancient Judea (which was Jewish, not Arab) almost 2,000 years ago. The Roman Emperor Hadrian renamed the Jewish kingdom of Judea ""Philistia"" after the ancient Philistines (Plishtim in old Hebrew), a pagan group of Aegeans who moved to what is modern-day Gaza during the times of the Canaanites, referred to throughout the Bible as a nemesis to the Jewish people.

In more modern history, the Holy Land was a no-man's-land under control of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. There never was an Arab Palestinian state in the Holy Land, and all the land west of the Jordan River, including Gaza, was originally earmarked for the Jewish state under the Balfour Declaration 100 years ago. That plan was adopted by the Allied powers and the League of Nations in 1920 and 1922. On Sept. 21, 1922, President Warren Harding signed H.J. Res. 322, which formally adopted the Mandate for Palestine as official U.S. policy.

The committee report from the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 1922 recognized the fact that the land had become desolate, and the committee laid the blame at the feet of the ""deplorable"" Ottoman Turks. The report observed that the Jews were already rehabilitating the conditions of the people living there from the ""wanton and deplorable policy of desolation systemically carried out by its rulers, the Turks, for centuries."" And: ""What was once the land of milk and honey, has become, through misrule and oppression, a devastated and sparsely settled land.""

(For more on what both Republicans and Democrats said in 1922 of Jewish control over the Holy Land, read here.)

The notion that there was a large native Arab populace indigenous to the Holy Land is completely unfounded. The Jews, on the other hand, had a presence in the land for over 3,000 years, long before the advent of Islam.

The idea that an Arab Palestinian label has any legal or historical legitimacy was clearly eschewed by officials of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in its early days. In an interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw on March 31, 1977, PLO executive committee member Zahir Moshen said the following:

The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. (James Dorsey, Wij zijn alleen Palestijn om politieke reden, Trouw, 31 March 1977.)

Fast-forward 38 years, and the term ""Palestinian"" is at the root of the near-unanimous global clamor to create an Arab nation-state west of the Jordan River – something that has never existed in either modern or ancient history.

The non-revisionist history of modern Israeli borders

After World War I and the defeat of the Turks, when the Allied powers were first forming nation-states in the Middle East, they earmarked modern-day Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia as Arab Muslim states. Modern-day Lebanon was to be a Christian state, and the ""Palestine Mandate"" – which included modern-day Israel and Jordan — was to be used for a Jewish state.

However, due to tremendous Arab pressure, they established in 1922 all of the land to the east of the Jordan River as the Emirate of Transjordan, essentially excluding 77% of the original Mandate of Palestine from the Jewish state. It became a full-fledged Arab state in 1946, just two years before the creation of modern-day Israel. As former PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said in a 1974 interview with the New Republic, ""What you call Jordan is actually Palestine."" That is your ""Palestinian"" state.

Lebanon was soon gobbled up by the same Islamists, beginning a slow bleed of the Christians living there in the ensuing decades.

To this day, the only binding resolution of international law that has never been countermanded is this 1922 Mandate for Palestine. The territory under the Palestine Mandate, along with Iraq, was given to Britain as a temporary trustee, based on the resolution between the four principal Allied powers in April 1920 at the San Remo conference in Italy, which was signed by 51 nations.

Once the League of Nations was disbanded and the United Nations took its place, the member states agreed to maintain all agreements and not ""alter in any manner the rights whatsoever of any states or any peoples or the terms of existing international instruments to which Members of the United Nations may respectively be parties"" (Article 80, U.N. Charter). The Mandate for Palestine adopted by the League of Nations was the last legally binding document pertaining to the parceling out of the Holy Land. In Article 5 of the mandate, it explicitly states, ""The Mandatory shall be responsible for seeing that no Palestine territory shall be ceded or leased to, or in any way placed under the control of the Government of any foreign Power.""

Accordingly, to this very day, all Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria are legal, while all unauthorized Arab settlements are illegal.

It's not about land; it's about jihad

The binding agreement from the League of Nations never came to fruition on the ground because the Islamic supremacist ideology of the local Muslim leaders wouldn't allow Jews to live in peace and establish a state in the remaining 23% of the mandate, land that is 1/640th the size of modern-day Muslim lands.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, local Arabs and their surrounding neighbors fomented a violent jihad against the Jews living in their own homeland. The riots were incited by Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Hussein, a close ally of Hitler who was eventually expelled from the region and fled to Germany. After much turmoil and Arab rioting, in 1947, the U.N. recommended a plan via nonbinding Resolution 181 to partition off most of the land to the west of the Jordan River for a new Arab state and a tiny swath of non-contiguous land, mainly along the Mediterranean coast, for a Jewish state. Those borders were indefensible, and the crafters of the plan knew it. That was the point.

Yet Israeli leaders were willing to accept it. Their Arab neighbors, though, were not willing to accept anything short of annihilating the Jewish presence in the region. By rejecting this recommendation, which was nonbinding to begin with, the Arabs permanently lost any legal or moral grounds for demanding another state west of the Jordan River.

In 1948, the neighboring countries launched what Arab League Secretary General Azzam Pasha referred to as ""a war of extermination"" against the Jews. After over a year of fighting, God's providence allowed a ragtag group of Jewish militia forces to fight off the forces of the Arab Legion, gaining them more breathing room in the South and Galilee. Israel now grew to 6.7% of the original Balfour proposal and 30% of the 1922 Mandate.

While Jordan remained in control of Judea and Samaria and Egypt conquered the Gaza Strip, the Arab communities in those areas – many of whom had recently immigrated to those territories – never established a unique Arab ""Palestinian"" state or expressed a desire to do so. Those territories always remained under the control of Jordan and Egypt. Meanwhile, no nation recognized Jordan's occupation of Judea and Samaria and its renaming those territories as the ""West Bank"" (of Jordan), because it was completely illegal. The Jordanians and Egyptians also expelled all the Jews who had lived there for generations.

This was important in setting the stage for the next major war, in 1967, in which Jordan and Egypt lost those territories to Israel in yet another war of aggression. Once again, Jordan, Egypt, and Syria sought to destroy Israel and wipe out every Jew in the land. But in a matter of six days, God performed one of the greatest miracles in the modern era, and the collective Arab armies were kicked out of the entire area. Egypt lost the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula, Syria lost the Golan Heights, and Jordan lost ""the West Bank.""

Beginning in the 1970s, after another failed attempt to destroy Israel in the Yom Kippur War, the jihadists switched tactics. Rather than try to destroy Israel with conventional forces from neighboring countries, they promoted Yasser Arafat, and the PLO began to foment this myth of a distinct Arab ""Palestinian"" entity entitled to statehood west of the Jordan River – outside the original ""Palestinian"" state of Jordan (comprising 77% of the Palestine Mandate). Thanks to leftist policies in Israel and beginning with President Clinton, we began recognizing Arafat, the modern-day architect of jihad, as a ""man of peace."" It took 10 years for our government to finally realize that this monster wasn't a man of peace. Yet nearly two decades later, our government still recognized his deputy, Abbas, as a ""man of peace,"" until the Trump administration finally reversed policy.

And as they say, the rest is history.

This illusion of a Palestinian people and state is what is driving the push for Israel to surrender the remainder of Judea and Samaria after it has already ceded well over 90% of the lands it won in defensive wars – from Sinai and Gaza to south Lebanon.

Then again, who are we trying to convince? These are the same people who have no problem with violent drug cartels, every bit as violent as Hamas, controlling our own border.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/trump-supreme-court-resistance-judges,2020-01-30
Commentary: We need warriors who will punish those who seek to destroy America,"""I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam."". ― J.R.R. Tolkien, ""The Return of the King.""

We've arrived. Frazzled and scarred though we may be from nearly four years of travails, we are set to cast the ring of political power back into the civic Mount Doom from whence it came. Yet our story doesn't quite have the same sort of reset button on it that Frodo and Sam's did.

Instead of flat-out destroying evil incarnate, we are simply deciding if we want to wear big boy pants and try adulting yet again as the ""moral and religious people"" the Founding Fathers intended for a representative republic. Which is not to say that doesn't come with harsh realities. In fact, I've never been more concerned about our nation's fate.

I truly believe we are on the brink of civil war no matter which way the election goes. The lies of Fauci promise it. The streets of Philly promise it. The hatred of Amy Coney Barrett promises it. The propaganda of CNN promises it. The censorship of Twitter promises it. We are choking on fake news that distorts reality at every turn and will inevitably require painful correction.

Among the distortions I am talking about after the election is whether voices like mine will even be able to be heard with anything resembling regular and unambiguous First Amendment protections. The media memory holing of Hunter Biden and Tony Bobulinski as ""disinformation,"" while at the exact same time championing a formerly ""Anonymous"" Trump-hating fake whistle blower who turns out to be nothing more than an inconsequential grifter, is an official declaration of war against a free and fair exchange of ideas going forward.

The dystopia is here, and there is clearly no one in conservative media too big at this point to be swallowed by its gluttony. Access to platforms will be blocked. FCC violations will be conjured out of thin air. Imaginary yet all-too-real charges of libel and slander will be used to ruin careers. Expect it all. You would be naïve not to at this point.

Such a fascist battlefield will take a level of civic, political, and moral resolve from true patriots to do combat against. The likes of which the political right has rarely seen in recent decades. I have told you in the past that one of the main reasons we have arrived as this inane point in our American story is because while Democrats run for office to do something, most Republicans merely run in order to be somebody.

They want to be liked. They want to be validated. They want to be popular. It's pathetic.

We need warriors right damn now, not wannabes. Nothing else will do, especially if Trump loses. And with the GOP at the federal level a nearly lost cause when it comes to anything aspirational from a governing perspective, it will be governors in red states who will need to lead an unapologetic movement. One in defiance of the spirit of the age that demands not only compliance but its own form of worship of the progressive beast.

The usual suspects at this point at are named DeSantis, Noem, Kemp, and Reynolds among others. Not many others, though, and who knows if these folks are ready to take the next step into the breach? Pretenders of any kind simply won't be able to last. True leaders will need to be able to clearly communicate what is at stake, and why it is worth fighting for without hesitation or reservation. Not only can we not lose any more ground, we must finally have a thirst for taking some ground back.

Think Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman. It has come to that. Open war is upon you whether you wish it or not, and for our children's sake, we must find leaders who seek to embarrass and punish those who seek to destroy this once great land. They must make their states new shining cities on a hill, and dare any usurper from a rogue and rotten federal government or media enterprise to try and stop them.

Know thy enemy. Find thy enemy. Punish thy enemy. Nice has gotten us nowhere and the game is zero sum now. What are we prepared to do?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/truth-about-palestine-israels-modern-borders,2020-10-30
Why do I still read the New York Times?,"Some conservatives wonder why I read the New York Times or listen to ""The Daily"" hosted by Michael Barbaro.

As a conservative, I honestly can no longer tell you why anymore, especially not after another uncorroborated report by the New York Times surfaced over the weekend accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of yet another allegation of sexual misconduct.

While I genuinely want to know what the other side of this political landscape is thinking, is writing, and is interested in, I genuinely can't bear the one-sided coverage and the lies anymore, and I don't want to aid the Times' dishonesty with my dollars any longer.

I supported the Times throughout my undergraduate and graduate career (my graduate degree is in journalism) by way of tuition and fees, and recently renewed my subscription because I was tired of being limited in what information I could access. Plus, I love good writing and storytelling. Also, news is a big part of my job every day.

However, the New York Times isn't telling the most important stories objectively anymore; it hasn't in a while, and it's only getting worse.

Sure, the NYT reporters can write, but they've become divorced from truth and married to a progressive agenda that's blinding them so severely that they're embarrassing themselves every week.

Sometimes the Times covers exciting stories that no one else covers like The Price of Nice Nails or the dilemma filmmakers faced following the attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City when they couldn't decide on whether to cut scenes of the city's iconic skyline that featured the recently perished twin towers or to leave them in.

I also appreciated the Times' straightforward coverage about the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong that was unfortunately followed up with a gaffe of a tweet that praised Mao Zedong as ""one of history's great revolutionary figures.""

Exhale. Sigh.

Yes, the same Zedong who made Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin look like amateurs in terms of mass killings.

That's irony; or, I mean, that's the Times for you.

It's as though the newspaper has been commandeered by people who are hell-bent on agenda at all costs necessary. Even the truth is a casualty of this war. But the editors really don't seem to care.

We witnessed this after a transcript was leaked that revealed how higher-ups at the Times, including New York Times executive Dean Baquet, shifted the coverage from Russian collusion to Trump's alleged racism in an effort to topple Trump.

The Times is also now obligated to continue to regurgitate lies progressives want to hear because their subscriber base has become increasingly more progressive. No surprise there.

But what incentives does the Times offer to moderates or conservatives who want to read their newspaper? Not much, at least not right now.

We were taught ethics in journalism school but these people have completely abandoned them. The Times used to be a place journalists and aspiring writers looked up to, including myself.

The paper was, once upon a time, a beacon for fine journalism and writing, not the scandal-mongering rag we're seeing now. It's easy to dunk on them on Twitter and in news articles for its mistakes but a little piece of me is miserable each time that happens.

This newspaper was an American institution that was vital to upholding our First Amendment faithfully, and to see it deteriorate this way and at this rate is dispiriting for Americans who are already losing trust in institutions. The Knight Foundation and Gallup found that half of Americans don't trust the media.

I read the Times because I already know what conservatives care about because I'm in a conservative bubble of my own, especially on Twitter. I read the newspaper content to understand what issues are important to progressives and how they’re framing those issues to see if what I believe, as a conservative, bears scrutiny.

Another reason I read the Times is that I don't talk to progressives and I'd never be friends with a leftist because they're fascists and are fundamentally wrong about America, its founding, and its values.

Moreover, it's not that I've shunned progressives from my life by choice.

I lost touch with many of the progressives I met in college, and a few of them deleted me on Facebook during the 2016 presidential election because I was criticizing Hillary Clinton instead of bashing Trump. However, I never endorsed Trump. I didn't hate Trump, so they mustered up little courage and hit the delete friend button instead of confronting me civilly or trying to understand the concerns I had with Ms. Clinton.

That's why I kept reading the Times after college. I was now out of the progressive loop.

The only reason I've managed to stay friends with some of my friends who vote Democrat is because we knew each other before we had concrete political views.

We grew up together.

That is what makes our political discussions easier to have. There's no animosity or hostility or tension or preconceived notions as is so often the case between progressives and conservatives.

It's telling that after actress Alyssa Milano met with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in Washington, D.C., last week to discuss gun control, she said that her liberal friends were ""wrong"" about the senator.

Before that, she said she thought of Cruz as a ""villain in a movie.""

Not anymore, not after meeting him in person. However, can I blame her for thinking that?

We have the media who continues to vilify and dehumanize conservatives daily, including the Times. Kavanaugh is a perfect villain for the left and the Times because he's a white male, he's heterosexual, he went to good schools, and had access to powerful political families in Washington, D.C.

When an award-winning legacy news organization like the Times abandons all objectivity and deceptively perpetuates falsehoods and half-truths to its wide-ranging readership in a sophisticated and systematic way — like what it did with Kavanaugh, its 1619 Project, and its climate series that will not entertain climate skeptics, and on several episodes of ""The Daily"" – my measly monthly subscription is adding to more harm than good.

I want to support the Bari Weisses of the Times and the reporters who are idealists working hard to hang onto their journalistic integrity, but they're making it nearly impossible.

Unless the Times rededicates itself to objective journalism and admits to its mistakes and the bias, I'm reluctant to read a single word going forward.

Refusing to read the Times until it rededicates its coverage to objectivity isn't about boycotting a company I cannot entirely agree with; it's about the vital role a free press plays in our republic and the damage the New York Times is inflicting upon our country.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/warriors-punish-those-who-seek-to-destroy-america,2019-09-18
"Yes, Virginia: Hitler really was a socialist","Much hay has been made of late regarding a decades-old debate as to whether Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were socialists.

On the face of it, the argument may seem ridiculous. … After all, the name of the party was National Socialist German Workers' Party. For some, it should be as simple as that. They called themselves socialists, so they were socialists.

However, proponents of the idea that Hitler and the Nazis were diametrically opposed to socialism point out numerous reasons that this simple explanation is, by itself, insufficient, and in fact can point out several facts, which clearly demonstrate that the Nazis were socialist in name only, but not in ideology.

As is generally (and gloriously) true, the truth behind this debate is extremely nuanced and takes effort to discover. But it is very clearly there.

For those of you looking for the Cliff's Notes version, here is the answer: Yes, Hitler and the Nazis were socialists, for the simple reasons that they were staunchly anti-capitalist and believed that the means of production in their society should be controlled by a centralized state power. That is very clear from their writings, their words and their actions. Done and done.

Now, for those of you looking for a more complete and nuanced analysis of the topic, please consider the following thoughts:

With a recent article in Vox as case-in-point, those who believe that Hitler and the Nazis were not socialists will generally put forward some version of the following arguments:

1. The Nazis did not preach or practice pure, ""classical"" socialism, so they weren't socialists.

2. The Nazis were not the true Socialist party in Germany — there were already socialist and communist political parties in Germany — when they adopted the term ""socialism.""

3. The Nazis were fascists, not socialists. Everyone knows fascism is right wing, socialism is left wing.

4. The Nazis only adopted the title of ""socialist"" for political reasons, not ideological ones.

5. The Nazis were staunchly anti-communist and anti-Marxist, therefore they couldn't have been socialists.

6. The Nazis were racists and nationalists, so they couldn't have been socialists.

7. The Nazis did not seize all private property and money, so they weren't socialists.

8. Hitler was only interested in power, in being a dictator, not in socialist principals of peace and love and equality…

I'll address each of these in turn, but the above arguments and themes all miss a central and critical reality … and demonstrates a lack of critical thinking as well.

What's missing from the simple question of ""Was Hitler a socialist?"" is this: When do you mean?

It's a vital component of any coherent discussion, for two reasons.

First, because when examined over a timeline it becomes perfectly clear that yes, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was an extremely, very clearly socialist-aligned organization at the time of their founding. One could argue that over time the specific manifestation of Nazi-socialism did drift away from what is today viewed as ""classical""' or archetypal socialism (also a misnomer, which I'll cover shortly) and toward a nationalistic, ""Germanified"" socialism. During the build-up to war, it then morphed further into economic-statist policies of fascism and eventually a fascist-dictatorship.

Second, it's vital to note the shift and migration ""from"" socialism ""to"" a dictatorship because this is almost always what ends up happening when socialism, communism and/or Marxism implemented in any country (as evidenced by Germany's Hitler, the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, China's Mao Zedong, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, etc).

Marxist-collectivist systems devolving into brutal dictatorship with some elements of Marxist-philosophy remaining is the norm, not the exception. I'll leave what that says about Marxism to your own judgment.

So, with that said, let's start at the very beginning (a very good place to start), and review the historical record:

1. The Nazis did not preach or practice pure, ""classical"" socialism, so they weren't socialists.

Statements like this one are generally followed with quotes from Hitler or some other Nazi leader saying something negative about socialism, or examples of a policy like leaving most manufacturing in private hands as proof that the Nazi Party wasn't a socialist organization. But generally, those quotes and those policies were from much later in the Nazi-Germany saga.

What is conveniently ignored is the fact that Hitler joined the German Workers' Party in 1919, when he was 30 years old. Six years before he wrote ""Mein Kampf,"" and 14 years before he was appointed chancellor of Germany.

So, at the time the political party was formed, what did it espouse and believe? And what did Hitler espouse and believe?

History is abundantly clear on this. As we know from ""The Coming of the Third Reich""by Richard J. Evans, we know because Hitler joined the German Workers' Party, a party he'd initially been ordered to spy on and join by his Germany Army Intelligence handlers. It's key to note that the original name of the group was the German Socialist Worker's Party (italics mine), but party-supporter and journalist Karl Herrer recommended against including the word ""socialist"" because it might be confused with another local political party (the Social Democratic Party of Germany) and might make it more challenging to gain the support of his middle-class newspaper subscribers. Subsequently, the name was shortened to German Workers' Party. Author F.L. Carlsten makes that clear in his book, ""The Rise of Fascism.""

Hitler joined the party and within a few months had risen to a level of authority. Having spoken publicly for the first time at a party meeting just weeks after joining, by early 1920 he was appointed chief of propaganda, a period of party history covered in excellent detail in ""The Rise and Fall of Nazi Germany"" by T.L. Jarman.

As the party grew in prominence, Hitler believed they needed a public manifesto that clearly articulated the party's political beliefs and platform. He, along with party founders Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart, and Anton Drexler, wrote a manifesto titled, The National Socialist Program. As explained in William Shirer's seminal, ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich""(a work every American should read), on that same day, the German Workers' Party changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Hitler arranged a public meeting at a large Beer-Hall and personally read the manifesto aloud to more than 2,000 attendees, receiving ever increasing applause as he continued.

You can review the entire 25-point plan here, and yes, it is a platform that is filled with anti-Semitic and nationalist themes, but a review of several of the key points of the manifesto are important to understand their political beliefs as they orient around socialist and Marxist philosophy.

""…We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens…""

""…The first obligation of every citizen must be to productively work, mentally or physically...""

""…The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality [the state], but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all..."" [italics mine]

""…We demand the Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery…""

""…In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore, we demand the total confiscation of all war profits…""

""…We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries..."" [italics mine]

""…We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries…""

""…We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare…""

""…We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation…""

""…We demand the immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality…""

""…We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death…"" [italics mine]

""…We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the [existing] Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order…""

""…The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education…""

""…The comprehension of the concept of the state must be striven for by the school as early as the beginning of understanding…""

""…We demand the education at the expense of the state of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession…""

""…The state is to care for the national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young…""

""…We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press… Publications which are counter to the general good are to be forbidden… We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands…""

""…a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework: ""THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY BEFORE THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL."" [All CAPS theirs in the original document]

""…For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power… Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general…""

""…The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration…""

I apologize for the length here, but this was their ""Declaration of Independence"", and the length to which they spoke of these beliefs is strong evidence of how important these ideals were to them and their platform. That Hitler would dedicate the bulk of his written manifesto for his party to these indicates they were more than just a convenient political tool.

It's also worth noting that according to the US Holocaust Museum, the National Socialist Program remained the platform of the Nazi Party until Hitler's suicide in 1945, although clearly some of the specific tenets were ignored as the Third Reich matured and entered its ""war"" phase. In fact, we know from Big Business & Hitler, in 1924, party co-founder Gottfried Feder proposed an expanded 39-point plan that would include accommodation for Industrialists and large landowners with the National Socialists, but at the 1925 Bamburg Conference, then party leader Hitler refused to make any changes, stating that the manifesto was ""inviolable"" and would never be changed. Even after coming to power and declaring himself Dictator for Life, Hitler never modified a single word.

The point is that the original German Workers' Party as well as the National Socialist German Workers' Party, from its earliest roots, absolutely believed in and ran on many traditionally ""Socialist"" ideals, such as subordinating the individual to the ""common good"" and ""the State.""

Arguments as to whether the Nazi Party was ""right wing"" or ""left wing"" is what confuses most modern pundits and scholars. They clearly were nationalists, socialists, anti-capitalists and statists. Placing them on modern ""right vs. left"" political spectrum is an entirely different debate, and largely a semantic one. Whether they have more in common with the modern U.S. ""right"" or ""left"" is in the eye of the beholder.

2. The Nazis were not the true socialist party in Germany, there were already socialist and communist political parties in Germany when they adopted the term ""socialism.""

It's completely true that there were already socialist and communist political parties in Germany. Socialist parties had sprung up and gained popularity in Europe both before and during World War I. Russia had collapsed into a communist revolution during World War I, and there were communist political parties and organizations throughout Germany and Austria who had proven, friendly ties to the Russian communist parties responsible for the Russian revolution.

But the presence of other parties does not in any way indicate that Hitler's party wasn't also socialist. Just as today in America there are democratic socialists, socialist, Green Party and Communist parties, does not mean that I couldn't start up a new flavor of socialist political party tomorrow.

What is clear is that the founders of the Nazi Party did want a very different type of political party, one that was highly nationalist and one that sought an ethno-German racial ideal. In fact, as detailed in the already cited ""The Rise and Fall of Fascism,"" the reason that Anton Drexler and others founded the National Socialist German Workers' Party in the first place was their rejection of the existing Social-Democratic Party and Communist Party's lack of nationalism. Hitler's flavor of socialism was staunchly anti-Bolshevik and anti-Semitic and he spoke against ""Jewish-Marxism"" and communism, as did key party leaders Alfred Rosenberg and Rudolph Hess. Existing socialist and Marxist parties were too globalist for them – they were after a purely ethno-German socialism.

3. The Nazis were fascists, not socialists. Everyone knows fascism is right wing, socialism is left wing.

Without turning this into a purely semantic debate, applying the modern ""U.S.-centric"" idea of the right vs. left political spectrum to political, economic and social philosophies such as socialism or fascism is truly an apples vs. Legos idea.

Of course, the origins of ""right"" vs. ""left"" political spectrum likely dates to the French Revolution and had to do with which side of the King's throne courtiers and lords were seated. At that time, those Loyal to the King were on the ""right"" and those who favored the people's independence and Democracy would be on the ""left"" …but clearly today's modern conservatives and libertarians would not support rule by a monarch or dictator, whether his name was Louis, Washington or Trump.

This is a key part of why there is so much cognitive dissonance for today's self-avowed socialists when someone dares to point out that Nazis were socialists and did support many socialist ideals. Nazis were also nationalists, were anti-immigration, often xenophobic and pro-militarism. Those are traits they associate with today's modern far-right.

As Jane Carlson points out in her recent Vox article, trying to put German-Nazis of 1930 on our modern U.S. political spectrum is a troublesome exercise. For our purposes, we'll simply note that the policies and platform of the early Nazi Party clearly aligned to socialist theory of the time, simply modified to fit the Volkish German tastes of the time.

Furthermore, claims that Hitler and the Nazis were fascists, not socialists, is again an inherently anachronistic view of events. It also clouds the issue of fascism and socialism, painting them as polar opposites on the political spectrum, when, in fact, they were close bedfellows in the 1920s.

Fascism didn't come to the Nazi Party and Germany until late in the 1920s or even early 1930s. Certainly there are no contemporary media references to the National Socialist German Workers' Party as ""fascists"" during the era of the party's founding in 1919, at the time Hitler wrote and presented the National Socialist Program in 1920, leading up to the Beer-Hall Putsch in late 1923, during Hitler's incarceration in 1924 and even leading up to the elections of 1928 and 1930.

During that entire era, no paper, across all of Germany, Italy, England or America can be found that refers to Hitler or to the National Socialist party of Germany as a ""fascist"" party. They were referred to as the national socialists or Nazis, a name meant to be a pejorative. It's also noteworthy that in his book, ""Mein Kampf,"" Hitler did not refer to himself as a fascist or even use the word a single time.

It wasn't truly until the elections of 1932 that ""fascism"" could truly be applied to the policies espoused by Hitler and other Nazi politicians who held seats in the German Parliament. By then, it had been nearly a decade since Benito Mussolini, the publisher of a Socialist newspaper for more than six years, founded his own version of a violent nationalist-socialist party within Italy: fascism.

Fascist political ideology was the brainchild of another Marxist, a man named Giovanni Gentile. Gentile was an Italian intellectual and student of Marx, but whose criticism of the standard socialist model was based on the idea that the human mind was insufficiently pure to make communal socialism practical for industrial countries. As such, he advocated for a hybrid of a strong-centralized government with total authority (lead by intellectuals and experts) but leaving direct ownership of industrial production in the hands of the business elite. A Socialist-Corporate state.

Mussolini had seen in World War I, his countrymen were no longer fighting for some grand, socialist utopia as they had been toward the outset of the war. By the end of the war, they were fighting for their country. Under the tutelage of Gentile, he morphed that nationalist passion into fascism, but it was not a far-right movement. Mussolini referred to himself as a socialist in his own diary just 12 days before his capture, and it's worth noting that the party he was head of at the time of his capture was called the Italian Social Republic.

Hitler, seeing the success of Mussolini in Italy in the 1920s and wishing to curry favor with the Italian leader to help reinforce his southern flank, developed a warm and open relationship with him. By the time Hitler had been named chancellor in 1933 and dictator in 1934, it would have been fair to start thinking of Nazis as having fascist ideas. But even as late as 1937, Winston Churchill was still making speeches and writing essays about the ""two"" great ""creeds of the Devil"" in socialism and fascism, as threats faced by Britain.

The real difference between communists, national socialists and fascists is simply this: Communists are the international workers party and fascists are the national workers party.

In the end, it's reasonable to look at Hitler's adoption of some tenets of the fascist political-economic system of an authoritarian-central government but leaving private ownership of some industries as an indication that Hitler was not, in the end, a ""perfect"" socialist. But, as you'll learn below, that notion is itself, nonsense.

4. The Nazis only adopted the title of ""socialist"" for political reasons, not ideological ones.

As we have already cited from Carlsten's ""The Rise of Fascism,"" the opposite is actually true. Anton Drexler had originally wanted to include socialist in the party's title, but its primary ""publicist"" at the time, Karl Herrer, had objected — not because they were opposed to socialist ideas, but because it would make it difficult to stand apart from the already existent Social-Democratic Party, and because it would make it more difficult to appeal to middle class readers of his newspaper.

In fact, as author Robert Spector covers thoroughly in his book, ""A World Without Civilization,"" Drexler and others went out of their way to publish articles clearly delineating between Marxist-socialism and the German-socialism they intended to create, which would be a massive social-welfare state that would provide aid only to true ethno-Aryan Germans.

The ideals of the Nazi leadership were absolutely and significantly focused on German nationalism, anti-Semitism, racial purity, etc. It's also fair to say that Hitler's personal ideology and goals were built around German-idealized delusions of grandeur, and less around the philosophical tenets of socialism.

But a fair assessment of the progression of Nazi Party socialist doctrine cannot start in 1933 when Hitler became chancellor or 1938 when he invaded Poland. A more fair assessment might to be say that Hitler and the Nazis wanted to create a 1,000-year German Reich and a pure ethno-German race, and they were also socialists. More pure socialists when they started in 1919 than when they finished in 1945? Yes, certainly if our goal here is to measure Hitler against some 'perfect socialist' yardstick, then it might be fair to suggest that, by the end, he was less of a socialist than he was at the beginning.

But as I've already pointed out, the same could be said for virtually every socialist leader of all time. They all started with grand socialist ideals, tried them out, found that they didn't seem to work to achieve any practical real-world goals, so instead they became a tyrannical dictator wielding violence, torture and autocratic rule to maintain their vision. Ask Mao, ask Stalin, ask Maduro, Ask Xi, ask Castro, ask Che, ask Minh, ask Lenin…Hitler was just a me-too.

5. The Nazis were staunchly anti-Communist and anti-Marxist, therefore they couldn't have been socialists.

The idea that being anti-communist or anti-Marxist indicates one couldn't be a socialist is an anachronism, especially for post-Great War Germany. Let's not forget that Russia and Germany had fought ferociously during the war, including clashes before and after the communist revolution. Many Germans strongly blamed Germany's surrender at the end of World War I on communist sympathizers and/or spies within Germany, especially Marxist-Jewish political leaders, intellectuals and writers.

Leaders of the early Nazi Party, in particular, viewed the Treaty of Versailles not so much as a surrender to Western powers but as a surrender to international ""Jewry"", both the capitalist-Jews from America and England as well as the communist Jews from Russia. As Shirer points out in ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"" Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently referred to being ""stabbed in the back"" by communist-Jewish elements in Germany and Austria.

As such, as we learned from Roger Griffin's epic work ""Fascism,"" the anti-Marxism present in the early Nazi Party was strongly anti-Bolshevik, or, said more plainly, it was ""anti-Jewish Russians and Germans who betrayed at the end of World War I and who profited from the war.""

Recall as well that communism is merely one manifestation of Marxist political philosophy … one that could progress out of a Socialist foundation. Even today, communists and socialists can have lively debates on the topic, one rejecting or point out logical flaws in the ""purity"" of the other on the scale of Karl Marx's idea of ""perfect"" socialism. (Marx never really had such an ideal, see below).

The point is, the fact that Hitler was feverishly and passionately anti-Marxist (because he was massively anti-Semitic) and anti-communist doesn't indicate he wasn't some form of socialist.

6. The Nazis were racists and nationalists, so they couldn't have been socialists.

I would have hoped I didn't have to go too deeply into this topic, but many people seem to make some form of this argument.

The disconnect here is that most people today associate left-leaning or socialist-aligned politics to be also ""globalist,"" for open borders and pro-immigration. On the other hand, many people associate right-leaning and even ""conservative"" groups with anti-illegal-immigration and ""America-first"" policies.

Again, let's not start a semantic debate about modern policies of those on the right vs. those on the left and whether one or the other group is more or less racist than the other (let's do that on Twitter instead!); for our purposes here, what is key to point out is that Marx himself was a fairly racist bloke, who wrote an essay in 1844 titled, ""The Jewish Question"" (wonder where Hitler got that?):

""What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. … Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man—and turns them into commodities. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange…The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general."" — Karl Marx, The Jewish Question, 1844

In a letter to co-creator of Socialist doctrine, Friedrich Engels, Marx wrote:

""It is now completely clear to me that he, as is proved by his cranial formation and his hair, descends from the Negroes who had joined Moses' exodus from Egypt, assuming that his mother or grandmother on the paternal side had not interbred with a n—–. Now this union of Judaism and Germanism with a basic Negro substance must produce a peculiar product."" — Karl Marx, Letter to Friedrich Engels, 1856

Many seem to believe that today's democratic socialism is inherently and not racist universally (unless perhaps, you happen to be a Jew … or maybe a white male, at least in some of the more vehement circles), so the fact of Nazi racism demonstrates simply that they could not have been socialists. But the socialism of the Nazi era was generally not-free of the every-day racism that was pervasive throughout that era.

To be sure, the Nazis were perhaps the most racist, anti-Semitic socialists who ever existed, but their racism, just like their nationalism, doesn't erase their socialism.

Furthermore, while socialism is not inherently racist, socialism and racism have been happy bedfellows numerous times.

One of the key and so-often-present-it-seems-to-be-required components of socialist movements is the presence of a bogeyman. An enemy of the people, or, in the case of Germany, the ""volk.""

In today's Americanized version of socialism, the bogeyman is the Gordon Gekko from ""Wall Street,""Oh, wait, we have a more modern caricature of the same profile: Donald Trump. A self-made, unapologetic billionaire capitalist, flaunting both his wealth and ego across every TV screen and Twitter-feed 24/7.

For today's democratic socialist, that is the bogeyman. The rich (generally white) capitalist male who has more than his neighbor and doesn't feel bad about that.

Hitler's bogeyman was also a banker — the Jew. Anti-Semitism and versions of socialism have often gone together because of the anti-capitalist and anti-wealthy-person ethos at the heart of Marxist ideology. Because Jews have tended to be industrious and have accumulated wealth, the Jewish people have been hated by many socialist and fascist groups throughout history. Socialist and totalitarian regimes in the Middle East also hated Jews, long before the founding of Israel after World War II.

In fact, after meeting with Hitler in the 1940s, Muslim regimes in Turkey and Syria planned on building Polish-styled death camps in the Middle East. During the war, Hitler also invited the creation of an entire Muslim division of Waffen-SS, such was the alliance between Islamic-Marxism and the National Socialists, all oriented around the anti-Capitalism and anti-Semitic ideals of Marxism.

As Richard Pipes detailed in ""Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime,"" Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin also implemented anti-Jewish (themed as anti-capitalist) programs in Russia and the USSR after the Communist revolution. Lenin ordered the Jews to be sent to the front lines of combat in battle, and ordered that no Jew should be given high-ranking administrative positions in government, as was detailed in ""Time of Darkness: Moscow""by the great Russian political reformer and historian, Alexander Nikolayevich Yakovlev.

The argument that it is fascism that was the birth of Hitler's anti-Semitism also fails to hold water. Mussolini founded the fascist movement in Italy and had seized control of the Italian government well before Hitler's SS had started harassing Jews, but Mussolini protected Jews in Italy from persecution (as long as they swore political loyalty to him), until much later after his country was under Allied attack and he had to beg Hitler for German troops to fight off the Allied advance.

To this day, even in America, democratic socialists struggle with elements of anti-Semitism in their own ranks, because Jews are still being accused of hypnotizing the world via money by democratic socialist members of the U.S. Congress.

No, socialism is not inherently and always racist. But neither is socialism free from racist ideology, if that racist ideology serves as a bogeyman, any enemy of ""the people"" who is preventing the utopia of equality. Hitler's enemy of the ""volk"" was the capitalist, banker Jew, sucking the life out of his precious Fatherland. For freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), it's the un-woke white male, driving an SUV and drinking single-malt while hunting deer from a tree stand, making the world unsafe for women, children and minorities. Both were self-ascribed socialists. Both racist, too.

Racism isn't always about ""race"" either. The point is about dehumanization as a means to classify the enemies of ""The People."" In addition to murdering six million Jews, the Nazis killed additional millions of gypsies, homosexuals, blacks, Christians and Slovaks. Hitler and the Nazis used dehumanizing language to describe all of them… . Jews just happened to be his favorite target. But the techniques used by socialist were universal. Marx referred to capitalists or the bourgeoisie as ""parasites"" over 120 times in books, essays and speeches.

As recently as this past year, National of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan referred to Jews as ""termites""… although luckily Chelsea Clinton was kind enough to write an article for the online progressive magazine, ""Forward,"" politely correcting him and implying, emphatically, she'd never met a Jewish termite.

Today's democratic socialists are using the same techniques. How many times have Trump supporters been called ""sub-human"" or a ""Basket of Deplorables""? Marxism requires an enemy of the people, but when push comes to shove, people don't like to kill other people. So, the enemies must be made sub-human in order to justify the ""purging"" and ""liquidation"" that must necessarily follow. What will Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez do when wealthy, white males won't go along with their gun and SUV confiscation schemes required under their green-collectivist state? The Weather Underground boldly let us know back in the 1970s, when they issued a news release claiming that in order to bring justice to the U.S., up to 25 million white people would have to die.

Today, the Chinese Communist Party is rounding up Christians, Muslims and Uigars, placing them in concentration camps and re-education camps. More than 35 percent of the current Chinese population has been relegated to digital and travel-restricted ghettos, because their social-trust score is below Communist Party standards. Hitler had to go through the trouble of rounding Jews up and moving them into ghettos. Today, Chinese leader Xi Jinping does it with the help of Facebook and Google.

All part of creating the socialist utopia Marx dreamed would destroy the unfair inequality of capitalism.

Dozens of classical stars of the socialist firmament were ardent racists. Margaret Sanger, socialist and anti-black advocate…sorry, pro-black-abortion advocate. Bernard Shaw, famous socialist, was first to dream up and write about using gas chambers to 'gently, humanely' remove those societies that was determined to no longer have a productive use. ""Sir or madame, please kindly justify your existence."" Both Shaw and Sanger are still widely studied and celebrated by socialists today.

Perhaps a final lesson here can be learned by examining the ideology of Richard Spencer, self-proclaimed racist and white supremacist, and therefore branded by the media and political elite as a right-wing extremist. However, Spencer also rejects the U.S. Constitution, is pro-universal health care and pro-free (segregated) college education, and in favor of government-funded abortions. Most of the National Socialist program themes Hitler wrote about, he'd embrace in total. And he's a right-wing extremist? Take away just his virulent racism, he'd be a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, espousing purely leftist ideologies.

Hopefully you are getting the wider picture. Socialism doesn't guarantee racism, but neither does it offer any sort of protection from it. To claim otherwise is willful blindness to history.

7. The Nazis did not seize all private property and money, so they weren't socialists.

Again, it's vital to review the overall timeline of Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party from the early and perhaps idealistic days of 1919 all the way through the fall of the Third Reich in 1945. For most of the 1920s, Hitler and the Nazis held little by way of political power through which they could have seized anybody's property, but that doesn't mean they didn't advocate for doing so, first in their National Socialists program cited extensively above, but numerous times after that. They did, after all, seize substantial privately owned property in Germany as well as conquered lands, including thousands of businesses, farms and bank accounts.

The fact that they focused first on Jewish businesses is irrelevant to the fact that private property was seized and transferred to the ownership of the state. The fact that Jewish property was at the top of the list of whom to target doesn't make it less Marxist or socialist to do, any more than it would be less socialist to target rich white males, as is currently being proposed by Bernie Sanders and others on the far left. Who you're targeting for confiscation schemes should be a moot point.

It's key to recall who Hitler and the Nazis were. They were socialists by way of economic policies, but staunchly nationalist and staunchly anti-Semitic racists who believed in a German super-race that could only be realized by way of physically purging inferior peoples and blood and by ""reclaiming"" lands stolen from their rightful Aryan-ancestors. Eric Kurlander powerfully and skillfully provided that history in ""Hitler's Monsters,"" another book every American should read to fully understand the Nazi era.

It is true that once the Nazis came to power and started down their twin paths of political dominance within Germany and military conflict with external forces, Hitler's pragmatic side certainly overwhelmed any traditional or ""classic"" socialist ideals he may have once held. Surely after the powerful success he'd seen Mussolini seemingly achieve in Italy under fascism, the idea of communal socialism wouldn't have seemed the most efficient way for him to achieve his vision of a blood-pure and massive German super-state.

Note that the Nazis did nationalize dozens of industries and, by law, did have total centralized-control over the means of production … business owners and manufacturers had ownership of their property and factories in name only once the Waffen-SS and stormtroopers were fully in power. So, in his own way, Hitler did achieve Karl Marx-vision of control over the means of production by an all-powerful state. For Hitler, that state was simply imbued in him, instead of in a democratically elected central committee. Hitler's rejection of the authorities of labor unions or of workers' councils shouldn't, then, be viewed as anti-socialist. … Hitler was not in favor of giving any other person or group any authority over his own. Coincidentally, President Xi of China just recently declared himself dictator for life. History seems to love to recycle these themes, no?

Hitler was a pragmatist. He saw the favor of the German aristocracy and wealthy manufacturers (if they were not Jewish) as key to achieving his vision for the Third Reich. The fact that this meant not being a ""perfect"" socialist may have occurred to some, but certainly not to him.

8. Hitler was only interested in power, in being a dictator, not in socialist principals of peace and love and equality.

Before I dispense with the peace and love and equality BS … look, a study of Marx is a study about inequality! Marx was a racist, class-warfare-monger whom the average democratic socialist in America today would wholly reject from their social circles and political party.

So, I won't argue this last one, it's just beyond discussion. Socialism isn't nice and peaceful and filled with love and equality. Just stop it. Please pick up a history book and get back to me when you're ready to have a real conversation.

Yet, one final point should be made:

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT ""MARXIST"" SOCIALISM!!

From the time Marx wrote ""The Communist Manifesto"" in the 1850s until his death in 1883, Marx never once espoused any version of ""perfect"" Socialism. As socialist professor Philip Gasper pointed out quite correctly in his 2005 book, ""The Communist Manifesto: A Roadmap to the World's Most Important Political Document"":

""Marx and Engels never speculated on the detailed organization of a future socialist or communist society. The key task for them was building a movement to overthrow capitalism. If and when that movement was successful, it would be up to the members of the new society to decide democratically how it was to be organized, in the concrete historical circumstances in which they found themselves.""

So, for Karl Marx, the ""father"" of socialism, there is no thing as perfect, idealized, ""do it this way or you're not a socialist"" socialism.

The primary goal was building a movement to overthrow capitalism. In that Hitler and the Nazis viewed Jewry as capitalistic (as did Marx), it's very likely that Marx would have found them to be wonderfully and perfectly socialist. He did exactly what Marx advised: Take what you got and organize your own brand of socialism against the ""concrete historical circumstances"" in which they found themselves.

The very statement that ""Hitler was not a socialist"" by some imaginary perfect socialist checklist is itself a ludicrous notion. Marx never created one, it's only via the magic of a modern veil of anachronistic imagination that one can create such a yardstick by which to make such a claim. And so, we're back where we started, according to Marx himself: The Nazis, including Adolf Hitler, called themselves Socialists. The claimed an all-powerful centralized state power as having authority over the means of production. As such, they were socialists, by Marx' own definition.

In the end, the story follows the Occam's Razor theorem to the ""T""…

A younger and idealistic Hitler returning from the Great War believed in and espoused many socialist ideas and political ideals and got together with a bunch of other young people also espousing socialist ideas. As he grew older and gained more political power, he found that those socialist ideas weren't much use when it was time to actually accomplish anything in the real world, so he did what all socialist rulers eventually do — he claimed power by force and used violence to try to achieve his political ends, killing millions of people along the way, all the while still calling himself a socialist. And Marx slept soundly in his grave.

Socialism is the building block that undergirds all forms of modern totalitarianism. But it should never be confused with a large welfare-state safety net. Charity and safety nets can be and should be created for those who cannot fully take care of themselves. As individuals, we have a responsibility to take care of and protect the weakest among us. If we fail to do this we revert back to the laws of the jungle, that leaves its weakest behind for the good of the ""pride."" Safety nets when done right are uniquely human and humane as still look to help individual.

The human ""pride"" knows that what ennobles man is that we refuse to leave the weakest behind to be eaten and we certainly could not call ourselves a noble species if our stated goal was to not only leave the weak behind, but to set out to purposely kill any group deemed ""inferior"" or slowing the pack down. A true safety net empowers anyone that has been kicked to the ground to stand back up. It gives them a hand up as an individual — while they regain their footing.

Socialism at its root is and always must be about the collective. Collective ""injustice"" in all of its forms. In opposition to a ""safety net"" for individuals, socialism looks for ""groups"" of victims and groups of villains. Socialism is at its heart a system that dismisses rights of the one for the gain of the many. Once those the in-group deems vermin, cockroaches, greedy, privileged or problems — anything is justifiable to provide ""social justice"" to the collective.

In western society, traditional western liberalism stand against the collective mob and as a protector of the individual. Once one understands why socialism is defined as a ""stepping stone,"" you will begin to understand why the story usually ends in mass graves of enemies or starvation. Create a collective at the expense of the individual and it becomes a playground for those who seek power and riches at any cost, justifying every evil they commit in the name of the collective they are supposedly defending.

Ryan: Christina Hoff Sommers and the Maltese poodle,"""Round the city, round the clock; Everybody needs you."" — Frank Ocean

The chaos can wear on her, but American author and philosopher Christina Hoff Sommers handles it like she handles the rest of life: with patience, with a sense of humor, with a mind for cornering truth.

Still, the past few months have weighed on her. The past year. Her mother died. She was Hoff Sommers' best friend. Her father passed, too. He was always making jokes, reminding her to laugh.

Before that, she lost her husband in 2014.

Every day, unexpectedly, she remembers. Sometimes, it's when she's eager to share a funny story. Then, remembering, she pauses in the silence. Other times, she catches herself using the present tense, which no longer applies.

But she always plods forward, always keeps moving. One day, her friend Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and professor at Yale turned excitedly to Hoff Sommers: ""I know what you are: you're a manic depressive, but you only have the manic, never the depression.""

""Still,"" said Hoff Sommers, ""sometimes it seems like they're still here.""

Introducing: Izzie, the Maltese poodle

Then, Izzie bounded onto the porch like a New Orleans funeral band. Izzie being Hoff Summers' Maltese poodle.

Grrrrr. Grrrr. Growl. Yap! Yap! Yap-yap!

""Now, Izzie,"" I said, ""that's a microaggression.""

""Oh,"" Hoff Sommers said, sighing, ""she commits MACRO-aggressions!""

The first weekend of May 2019, I visited Hoff Sommers at her house in a wildwood suburb of Washington, D.C. We chatted over the course of three days that wove in and out of rain and sunlight. On Sunday night, the sky broke to a steady downfall of droplets the size of pinkie rings.

She was sick of travel. Enough traveling. Enough airports. No more 14-hour flights to different hemispheres. She was home, and it felt good to be home, and that's how it was going to be for a while: at home, peacefully, beside her vivacious 2-year-old MaltiPoo.

We chatted on the second-story balcony of her tidy home — which a friend aptly described to me as ""a literal dollhouse.""

Growing up, she never had rain, so she loves it when a storm erupts.

""A lot about teaching is dependent on good acting,"" she said. ""Performing. Being a good storytelling. To get my students interested I would tell stories. Every lecture I approached it as a big challenge to win their attention.""

At the center of the pollinated table, a sash-and-ribboned bottle of Charles de Fère Rosé, pink bubbly wine, which we tilted into ornate glasses adorned with flowers, ovalur. Hoff Sommers enjoys a nice rose champagne. Cheers, salud, or whatever the French say. We strode through a bottle easily. Then a second, over tortilla chips.

""My mother was a feminist,"" Hoff Sommers said, ""but, she liked men. For her, feminism was about friendship, and equality, and not hectoring and nagging and screeching.""

Which, the latter was the case at a recent talk Hoff Sommers gave at UCLA with protesters.

""They were so bitter. And so furious with me. 'Cause I was questioning these sacred truths, and I'm thinking to myself, 'If I were in law school, and somebody came and said a bunch of stuff I didn't agree with, I would ask them questions — ""What's your source?"" Why this drama? Why be furious?' They help me, in a way, because they're like Exhibit A of my argument. Because that's not normal behavior for law students. To be, not just skeptical — that's fine — but angry.""

""And the fact that they believe this fantasy about their own oppression,"" she continues. ""They're women. They're at UCLA Law School. They must be intelligent: It's not easy to get into that school, but sometimes I think that radical feminism is this kind of conspiracy theory for intelligent people. It's a complicated theory. You have to think your way into it, but you should be able to see through, and they can't.""

She often speaks in floaty drifts like this, like a Joy Williams short story.

But, to be clear: she supports protests. She admires gusto. The civil rights movement, the women's movement, the gay rights movement: all genuine civil rights struggles, and they were reality-based. They were necessary.

""The world's changed a lot,"" she said, in a way that was almost melodic. Then she tilted her head into the shade. Like if Stevie Nicks had chosen philosophy over witchcraft and cocaine.

A Rose in the dark

She was dressed for California. Her blouse. A plush of rose, variations of pink in a hallucinogenic design. A perfect analog to the calibrated hush of unbidden nature around us. Then she said that the truth is out there, waiting, no matter what anyone says. Meaning, it's time to decide.

Correspondence

""I've been lecturing for many years,"" she said, ""and I have a lot of people who write to me, years later, and say, 'I saw you and I was furious, I hated you, but, now I have to tell you, it helped me.'""

Just this week, Hoff Sommers got an email from a woman who said she felt clearer now, relieved. When she thought about it, it was pretty funny.

Performance

Hoff Sommers has written articles for The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, the New Republic, the Chicago Tribune, and Times Literary Supplement. She has appeared on ""Nightline,"" ""CBS Evening News,"" ""Crossfire,"" ""Eye to Eye,"" ""20/20,"" ""Inside Politics,"" ""Equal Time,"" ""Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher,"" and ""Oprah.""

In the unfortunate case that this profile leaves you dissatisfied, you can read any of the others written about Hoff Sommers by the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and the London Times.

She heard from a friend that Christopher Hitchens loved her article, ""A holiday in Hell for junior,"" about the feminist attempt to re-brand ""take your daughter to work day"" so that sons would undertake the task. He found it hilarious. ""To have written anything that would be praised by Hitchens, that made me very happy.""

She considers herself more an academic than a journalist (her primary sources tend to be books, not people). With a bachelor's degree from New York University and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Brandeis University, with an emphasis in ethics and contemporary moral theory.

She taught for a couple years at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Then as an assistant professor of philosophy at Clark University, where she was promoted to associate professor after six years. In 1994, ""Who Stole Feminism?"" It was a gob of spit in the face of modern feminism. Or at least the form that it had begun taking, what she calls ""gender feminism."" And aligns herself with ""equity feminism,"" a classically liberal approach that strives for ""economic, educational, and political equality of opportunity"" between men and women.

Then, three years later, she left academia, and joined the American Enterprise Institute as W.H. Brady fellow.

She doesn't miss the classroom. It was hard work. Today, she'd get in trouble, she thinks. She sort of did. Ruffled feathers. With support from her husband, she did not recoil, did not forfeit her beliefs in service of academia.

And since those early days, she's been a controversial figure.

With each large iteration of culture, each major shift in the climate of men and women or left and right, Hoff Sommers, embodying Big Lebowski-level nonchalance, finds herself in front of an audience. Different, each go around. Different ages, different beliefs, different reasons for their dejection or hope or their off-kilter glare.

Because somehow, every time, she also manages to piss off a fresh wave of people. Recently, they're yellers, stompers, criers, chanters, shriekers, and — yes — they are seasoned interrupters. The general demeanor of which was currently being channeled through Izzie.

""Oh, no, Izzie: You're a militant feminist,"" she said. She laughed. ""I suspected that.""

And Izzie kept barking, inciting every dog in the neighborhood, until Hoff Sommers dropped a stern Hebrew word, and Izzie listened. Everyone listened.

Then she added that it's not really like that, when she gives talks. Not every time.

""One out of 10,"" she reckoned.

But when it does happen, it goes viral. And somehow the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that Hoff Sommers grew up admiring, labels her ""an enabler of male supremacy"" and accused her of giving ""a mainstream and respectable face to some [men's rights activists'] concerns.""

""I'm not really an advocate for men and boys so much as an advocate for truth,"" she says.

Sometimes, it worries her. She often wonders, ""Wait a minute, why am I the only one? There aren't many professors, or former professors. Why wouldn't there be more?"" she paused, rhetorically. ""There are now — because it's starting to go bad, but it still troubles me.""

Because what if they're right? What if that's why she's out in the wilderness alone. But — nope, nope — when she examines their ideas, genuinely and sympathetically, she spots all the logical inconsistencies and ideological tactics. And the hostility she faces doesn't make it any better.

Think of it. Because even if it only ever happened one time, it'd be hard to shake. You start your speech to a large, mostly attentive crowd, having spent years reading and studying and fighting for a reputation, only to have five hecklers screech every time you start a sentence, accusing you of hatred, insulting your personally, calling you evil. In those moments, Hoff Sommers stays polite. A little silly. Playful. If the heckling drones on, she talks over it. Wig wags. Play-frowns. Half exclaims. Exposes irony, verbally and with gypsy-like hand motions.

But sometimes the hecklers' road-rage-like invective never subsides, and, the whole time, it's fireworks in a library and everybody's nervous.

'South Park'

Hoff Sommers has often wondered, ""Why can't people laugh anymore?"" Which is how her sons got her into ""South Park.""

She loves the way co-creator Matt Stone described his politics: ""I hate conservatives ... but I really f***ing hate liberals.""

Corner store

Her answers have the lovely down-spiral of a philosopher. She paused, blinking a lot. Changed directions.

Her father — God rest him — was always proud of her writing. He would rush out to buy her work. One time, she was interviewed by Playboy. Her dad was in his 80s. He wanted to get a copy, but he had recently moved to a small town, Brattleboro, Vermont (""California had gotten too conservative for them"").

So he crossed the state line to New Hampshire and bought it. Shifting at the counter, he told the clerk, ""I'm only buying this because my daughter's in it!""

Izzie, the Conqueror

""Fetch,"" said Hoff Sommers, ""go fetch,"" then returned to the topic of feminism. ""But we wanted to be liberated. Now they want to be protected. From young men. Who are nice guys. I mean 99% of them. Of course, any college can have a sociopath or a deviant, but most of them are nice guys. What must it feel like to be a young man?""

She's interrupted by Izzie, but barely stopped her line of thought, with a side-glance, saying, ""Fetch! Fetch!""

""And to have to cope with this notion, and these young women that've been brought up with this theory about 'toxic masculinity,' and they're filled with suspicion, paranoia, a pessimism,"" she continues, ""and that bothered me from the beginning. Because I was inspired by these young women and — what a good little doggie! What a good little thing! Now give it. Give it. Sit. Come. Down. Down. Good girl — then there's the theory about patriarchy. It's a twisted theory, supported by specious statistics. But I think it has a very negative effects on the minds of young women. They take it seriously. And they become humorless. They become angry. They panic.

""And that's what I see: a moral panic, a contagion of hysteria. Because of toxic feminism. This is a real thing — fetch, if you want a treat, fetch,"" she said throwing a neatened dog toy over the wooden railing. ""We're gonna have a lot of fetches in this interview.""

Diagram of activism

First, activists get steamed. Left, right, liberal, conservative — doesn't make a difference. They come from the fringe. Next, the snide, unwavering putdowns, usually on Twitter. Which are picked up by journalists and framed as part of a legitimate trend. Resulting in greater tensions. Resulting in actual trends. Then, a petty round of harassment or even doxxing, occasionally spilling over into real life, at times disastrously.

(As a journalist, I fully realize my role in all of this. But, just know, I'm one of the good ones.)

Either way, the bickering intensifies.

Someone gets fired for some stupid comment they made in calmer times. Feelings hurt, egos wrecked. And now it's more people steamed, and more activists vaunting the sewer-like dark of social media.

""Pick a side,"" say both sides. And, by the way, somehow not picking a side, not choosing the middle path, has become the rotten choice?

The personal and the political have fused, like how red and blue make purple, irreversibly.

After a few squabbles, your politics shape your identity. What you believe dictates who you are and what you're worth. So you fight until you're empty. Run, bawling, for cover. Or maybe you got lucky, in which case you prowl for another target, righteous and glib but ultimately alone.

It is at this phase of the great fight that we seek cultural emissaries, the representatives we have chosen, the deacons of our new society. People like Kanye West, Joe Rogan, ContraPoints, Bernie Sanders, Dave Rubin, Beyoncé, Donald Trump — whoever speaks for you.

Consistently, for the past 20-plus years, in this culture draft-day, Christina Hoff Sommers is elected matriarch of the laissez faire.

Snakepit

She would later describe her 1998 speech at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts in North Adams, Massachusetts, as the moment she was ""excommunicated from a religion I didn't even know existed.""

As part of the American Philosophical Association, she read a paper that was critical of academic feminism. Boy, that did not sit well. One woman nearly fainted, red then pale, combatively flustered.

Then, they started hissing. Hoff Sommers must have had quite the ornery grin as she waited for a chance to speak.

""I have to request that there be no hissing,"" she said, fighting a grin, ""it marginalizes people with lisps.""

Rescue ship

Both of Hoff Sommers' parents lived through tragedy, but they didn't burden her with it. Instead, they got her interested in the world, always giving her books, always taking her to debates and movies, out into culture. Her father fought during World War II, a rescue ship, in the Pacific, 19 years old. Never talked about it until much later. Her Uncle Bob, an artist in Big Sur, fought in the Battle of the Bulge, saw a friend explode.

When she was 6, Hoff Sommers' parents took her to a production of ""My Fair Lady"" at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. The allure of the stage, the capsizing burst of the music, the play of sound and dance — she wanted to stay, to always belong, onstage.

Growing up, the family's religion was the Democratic Party. Politics. Loving Kennedy. Hating Nixon. ""I remain a registered Democrat, out of respect for my parents.""

She was in seventh grade, barely a teenager, when former President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Nothing in her world had been so impossible. The president that she and her family had loved — he was dead. And in that god-awful way.

She watched the live feed as Lee Harvey Oswald took a .38-caliber belly-shot from Jack Ruby's $62 Colt Cobra. Now she'd lost a hero and watched a man die on TV.

When Hoff Sommers was 16, her mother gave her a copy of Bertrand Russell's ""History of Philosophy,"" it was OK — she shrugged when she told me — but she gravitated toward philosophy. After high school, she spent a year in Europe. Paris. Her sister was living in Holland. Also, she did a kibbutz.

Then, off to New York University. At the time, there were no rules in New York City. And colleges were just moving away from parietal hours. One reason she went to NYU was to explore the theater scene in New York City.

Ultimately, she chose philosophy over theater.

She hopes that, if she were a student today, she wouldn't be persuaded, misled. She worries that she would. She wasn't a clear thinker before college. She had an interest in tarot cards.

But the professors at NYU wanted students to be rigorous thinkers. ""You had to be able to justify your beliefs, make your assumptions clear, show that your conclusion followed from those premises. We had to do that. And it was not sentimental. It was not indulgent. They did not care about our feelings."" She pauses. ""Thank goodness.""

Maybe her biggest regret in life is that she never became a singer.

Izzie, the Militant

Hoff Sommers put Izzie inside, so she stared out like she was in jail. Twenty minutes later, she barked and clobbered the glass door.

""See what she does,"" Hoff Sommers said, mouth agape, ""I mean she's a terror,"" laughing in a playful, lavish way, turned, ""You're a witness: Am I oppressed by this dog? It's like living in a police state.""

The Outback

""I didn't know what to expect,"" she said. ""I did not expect that. I didn't realize that Australia was that polarized. Just like we are.""

The video is out. She's afraid to watch it. She may never. She considers herself a better writer than a speaker. And, on the scale of her speaking engagements, that was, well, not her best … according to her, at least — a lot of people think she did quite well, especially given the circumstances.

It was billed as the THIS IS 42 #FEMINIST Tour.

March 29, 2019 — Sydney Town Hall, Sydney, Australia

March 31, 2019 — MCEC Plenary 2, Melbourne, Australia

The idea was to put Hoff Sommers onstage with Roxanne Gay, author, professor, activist, prolific op-ed writer, feminist. Because Hoff Sommers was all of those things as well, but the women arrived at wildly different conclusions.

When she agreed to the dates, Hoff Sommers imagined that, after the debates, she could get a drink with Gay, ""That just for a second we could be two girls having a laugh.""

Hoff Sommers taught philosophy for years, so she knows how it feels to have her deeply held beliefs challenged, even upended. And she's always open to that possibility.

In the months leading up to the event that had been billed as ""two feminists with different perspectives sit down and have a discussion,"" it turned into a spectacle on par with a Mike Tyson weigh-in — post-prison.

During an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Gay called Hoff Sommers a ""white supremacist."" Then refused to retract the accusation, instead calling her ""white supremacist adjacent,"" a designation she maintains to this day.

(Hoff Sommers is Jewish.)

""I absolutely think that there is room within feminism for conservatism. There's nothing wrong with that,"" she says. ""I think what feminism, and what most cultural movements are saying, is we're not going to tolerate bigotry.""

Gay added, ""It does legitimize her viewpoint, which is really unfortunate. But I think I am up to the challenge of pushing back.""

Like many of the protesters Hoff Sommers has encountered, Gay is a no-platformer, so she believes that people with dangerous ideas should be silenced. That the best response to hate is ostracism. Problems arise when various groups cannot agree on definitions for ""dangerous"" and ""hate.""

Gay has invoked accusations of white supremacy with success before. The Bannon controversy: ""White supremacy does not deserve a platform. Xenophobia does not deserve a platform. And either you are willing to hold that line or you are not,"" she wrote. (Bannon was subsequently pulled from the program.) And the time she pulled her book from Simon & Schuster in protest of their deal with Milo Yiannopoulos.

Two weeks from the Australia tour, the Christchurch mosque shooting took place in nearby New Zealand — 51 dead. Murdered while worshipping. In their sacred place. Targeted for their religion. The shooter was an actual white supremacist.

While Hoff Sommers was venturing toward Australia alone, Gay and her squad of lawyers and agents and who knows who else were playing a heavy round of PR, talk shows and articles, with all the fury of Twitter at their backs.

In her interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Gay called Hoff Sommers' use of the term Factual Feminist ""a move right out of Donald Trump's playbook where you try to reorient people's relationship to truth.""

She added, ""That sets up a lot of really weird things where the woman of color is, what, working with fairytales? And the white woman is working with facts? I don't think that's a great way to frame the debate.""



A New York magazine article chronicled the bizarre turn of events.

So Hoff Sommers was still reeling from the whole fiasco during my visit: ""When I said in Australia that I believe that the free market is what helped liberate women — if you look at the rise of feminism, and most of the liberation movements: they developed because capitalism provided a foundation of prosperity so that there could be higher levels of human flourishing — Roxane Gay said, 'Capitalism didn't help black women,' then the crowded just went 'Yay!'. What does that even mean? What was she thinking?""

The audience howled and booed every time Hoff Sommers spoke. They yipped and whistled and screamed ""I love you"" any time Gay so much as rolled her eyes, which she frequently did.



""There was nothing I could say, nothing that would calm them down,"" Hoff Sommers told me. ""There was no way to come back with answers. And I kept thinking, 'What can I say so that the audience won't tar-and-feather me?'""

She has never gotten used to it — the belligerence, the disruption. She often wonders, how had someone like her, someone with such a sunny perspective, someone with what she calls a ""trusting, optimistic view of life,"" how had she gotten into this raging battle, this war of ideas?

In the early 1990s, a friend warned her. Told her she was challenging people who seemed aggressive and invested and obsessive, and that, if she didn't stop, she would become the focus of their ire.

One enlightening passage from the New York article:

At the first event, [the moderator] asked, 'What is feminism?' and 'What is intersectionality?' These were … terrible questions to ask an audience that had paid up to AU$247 to attend a feminist exchange of ideas … the prices were higher than usual because of Gay's large fee).

Some people who attended the Australia talks have demanded a refund.

""Words cannot kill a frail mind,"" writes Maya Angelou, ""unless it's allowed.""

When it's allowed

Hoff Sommers appearance at Oberlin College on April 20, 2015, marked the first time she had a police escort, and how fitting that both officers were women.

Some professor had written a scolding op-ed about Hoff Sommers' ""discursive violence,"" a common accusation leveled at her — basically, that controversial words are literally an act of violence.

""What they fail to notice,"" said Hoff Sommers, ""is that words are how we avoid violence.""

The campus whirred with anxiety. As if a dangerous inmate had escaped prison, armed and lustful. Students organized safe rooms. Many protest signs were taped and painted. The general disdain for Hoff Sommers frightened the administration. Left them concerned for Hoff Sommers' safety. Hence, the police escort.

The students actually let her speak. But not without plenty of jeers and hyena noise. At one point, a philosophy professor in the audience turned to the students and asked them to please be more respectful.

""Sit down!"" shouted the protesters.

Then, the grown man sat down.

Americans were wound a bit tight at that time, spring of 2015. People were afraid that Civil War II could break out at any moment. Six months earlier, the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, had enflamed deeply held tensions. Riots. Botched referee efforts by a then-tired President Obama. And peeking in from the side of the stage was Donald Trump, who would announce his candidacy for president a month later, to mostly laughs and yuks.

After Hoff Sommers finished her speech, three diversity and wellness facilitators took stage and gave the students instructions on how to deal with any post-traumatic stress they might have endured from sitting through Hoff Sommers' talk.

The policewomen ushered her through the back, to the marked van.

In total, 30 students rushed out of the lecture, in various states of agony. Thirty students, and one therapy dog.

The dream

An unknown number of Hoff Sommers' followers are people devoted to the task of scouring her each tweet in the hope that she'll write something awful.

""I don't hate them,"" she said. ""I think, 'They don't know me, and maybe they don't know themselves,' so I don't feel any contempt.""

She tilted her head sideways.

""Now. Will I like them? No, not necessarily. But, I don't have contempt. And, if you're on the left today, and you're active, on a regular basis, you are convinced of the absolute worthlessness of vast numbers of people.""

Then she paraphrased Buddhist-minded German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer: ""Contempt is such a dangerous emotion because, when you have contempt for someone, you have the conviction of their absolute worthlessness."" She let the phrase dangle in the air like a prop skull in an actor's hand in a performance of ""Hamlet.""

""Now, I do not have that view of anyone,"" she added. ""Anyone. And even if you said, 'What about the worst criminal?' part of me would wonder, 'What in their life led them to this?' I'd be frightened, if it were some ruthless murderer or something, but almost anyone, I'm just open to hearing their story, and seeing it from their point-of-view.""

She paused for a moment, then said: ""Rather than have the culture war, I'd like to have a dog farm.""

Optimism

Then there was Fred, her husband. Philosopher Fred Sommers.

He was older than her.

She will forever admire his life story, the rough-and-tumble upbringing on Manhattan's Lower Eastside, an impoverished immigrant family, into a rough-tangled boyhood, a street life. He was brought up as an Orthodox Jew, but he left religion for philosophy, a student instead of a rabbi. Still, he didn't like it when Hoff Sommers called herself an atheist.

He earned enough that she didn't need to work. ""I could have been a dilatant and not worked at all,"" she said. ""But I wanted to. Despite myself, and because of Fred, I stayed in. And he was very manly. And my boys are, too. It's completely wonderful, and sweet, and good.""

""Do you believe in God,"" I asked.

""Nope,"" she said. Then paused. ""I mean, let me put it this way. I admire people who do — that's not the word — I envy people who do. And I agree that faith may be a gift. ... I was not given that gift. And I just can't justify it intellectually. But — I'm not an adamant atheist. Because there's so much that's mysterious to us.""

On the drive to Hoff Sommers' house, I listened to an interview on NPR with Daniela Jampel and Matthew Schneid, who'd just published an article in the New York Times about the ever-evolving career roles of men and women. Hoff Sommers mentioned the article, somewhat randomly.

Fred had no expectations of housekeeping (""Why make a bed when you're just going to get back in?""). Hoff Sommers, she keeps things tidy, especially her house, in the aroma of trees and rain.

The Times article worried her, she added, because, in it, men's and women's differences are painted not as a natural harmony, but a toxic divide.

""Fred did things that were indispensable to the happiness of the home,"" she said. ""He was a great father. He didn't even like sports that much but he watched it all the time with the boys. I had my boys, two wonderful boys, who are gentlemen; my dad, the sweetest man ever; and my husband, who, I would've dropped out of grad school if he hadn't encouraged me not to. Those were the men in my life.""

She paused, in the quiet.

""I might never have had the confidence to be a fighter,"" she added, ""but Fred would always say, 'They can't say that! Go ahead.'""

He was her cornerman, cheering her on in the fight. ""Somehow, Southern California meets this New York street fighter and I became a little like him."" She nodded, adding that Fred never became like her, the California hippie chick. She stopped, nodding, nodding. ""He was fearless. And I respected that. I respected his stoicism.""

""Was he the love of your life?"" I asked.

""Oh, yeah,"" she said, without hesitation. ""I miss him every day. And I wish he were here to see all of this. Because he'd have a lot of opinions. And now I'm really on my own.""

The air settles into an even deeper quiet. Not even a bird singing or a car revving and Izzie leans forward as if drawn by the vulnerability. ""Because I always had him. And no matter what happened, no matter what anybody said — he just loved me.""

Later, she'd watch Chris Farley clips on her iPad, and laugh and laugh. A Puccini song drifting out of the corner-shelf Sonos speaker. That precious tidy living room, full of personal treasures and knotted pillows and evening light. A book titled, ""Land of Hope,"" rests on the coffee table. The glinting vases and gold-filament rug, variegated nuances of purple and ivory and, her favorite, rose.

She'd just talked about widowhood, about love, about marriage, about funerals, about so many beautiful and devastating life events. Yet, her presence was still featherlike. She'd start laughing halfway through a light sentence, randomly — not really laughing, more like swirling her tone, amused, always drawn into a certain word or phrase, only to drop her pitch again and move along, because what else can we do?

Land of hope.

Jeffrey Epstein and the Authenticity Mirage,"First thing that morning, millionaire socialite and prolific pedophile Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself in a Manhattan jail cell. With a State-issued bedsheet would you believe? Supposedly no thicker than off-brand toilet paper.

Ever since Epstein had been arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, people had been waiting for something unbelievable to happen. How light would his slap on the wrist be this time around? Or maybe not. This was the post-MeToo world, after all.

Then, when his bail was denied — Epstein's first bout of misfortune in decades, possibly ever — we all wondered if he'd actually face justice this time. And what did that mean for all his high-powered friends? Political and otherwise. Surely they had a problem with all his secrets. Supposedly he had incriminating video footage of important people, for blackmail, and here was his chance to share it with the world.

For weeks, the joke was ""Wanna bet that he gets suicided?"" Now he was dead. Via suicide. Which looked a lot like ""suicide."" It was hard to tell what was news and what were memes anymore.

*



When the guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center noticed Epstein all droopy, they slammed into his cell and yelled and yelled and yelled, ""Breathe, Epstein, Breathe.""

Alas, he was blue and stumpy and by then probably stiff.

An odd way to begin a Saturday, any Saturday, but especially the first weekend of the Iowa State Fair, as you're gnawing on a fried Oreo — chomp, gnash, chomp — and you get the news that Hell just welcomed yet another prodigious monster.

Plus, most suicides happen on Mondays or Wednesdays, and usually after midnight.

Saturday bright and early was a strange one. But I suppose even the weekend sucks when you're a celebrity millionaire stuck in high-security prison for prolific sex trafficking and molestation that was international in scope. And all you can do is think about all the high-powered people you pose a threat to, or your connections to an embarrassing amount of celebrities, including at least one member of the British royal family.

The coward. He'd stayed alive despite himself for six-and-a-half decades, raping and extorting and bullying and eluding. Why couldn't he just wait until the next figurative commercial break?

Ideally, he'd have waited til trail. So that all the people he'd tormented could stare him in his dead, sharky eyes and lob words like spit in the direction of his miasma.

And why in the middle of an already-bizarre election? Now it was Hamlet on an Iowa Saturday. A silly wacky mix-up. So lifelike because the irony is gross. Because the slip-ups are so perfectly timed.

Daddy Epstein drank the poison meant for who knows who.

And now Epstein's whimpering pouty ghost cast a shadow on the American public. Wasn't it enough that he'd existed at all? And it was annoying, the way none of it made sense.

Why hadn't he been on suicide watch? Wasn't he a celebrity? Was this the first time in his life he didn't get lavish treatment? His first time really alone, and he couldn't handle it?

Didn't sociopaths tend to avoid suicide, for narcissistic reasons?

And was it true that the security cameras — all of them? — went off for 30 minutes, the same half-hour that all the guards took a nap? A nap?

And why did he kill himself before the trial? Didn't people usually wait until after they were convicted, when there was no hope that they'd be free ever again?

And worst of all he was sulking on our weekend.

It was about disgust. We were repulsed. Like when you see a brown recluse spider and your skin gets itchy for a few minutes and you suspect that something awful has occurred.

*

All day in Iowa, at all the various rallies and speeches and events, none of the Democratic candidates mentioned Epstein. We all know they had heard the news. But who could smile after biting into a lump of charcoal? And these people were all about smiling and not at all about charcoal.

So they were playing dumb or acting smooth or just confused and annoyed like the rest of us. Whatever the case, excellent decision, to zip their lips. But it still felt odd.

Because I suspect that if the BBC ran an article about Joe Biden telling reporters, ""We need justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, who is similar to Donald Trump. What he did was cowardice. When I'm president I will handle this situation as such,"" or if Kamala Harris tweeted ""#EpsteinWasMurdered!"" and if any of that boosted Biden's or Harris' favorability online and in polls and with the media, then game on for all the other candidates.

We get it, they signed up for a year-long debate tournament and crazy stuff keeps happening and at every moment they have to be ready with some brilliant answer.

But it still felt grimy. Like they were closer to Epstein's world than to ours.

The world of politics is gross. You can read Plato's ""Republic"" in a library all day, but politics is still disgusting. Politicians are the plungers of humanity, chugging toilet water and waste for a living, a thrill. They make a game of our lives and our country. Those rubber leeches cling to dark pipes and keep climbing through the sewers and the gutters like maniacs. Some of them are gifted enough at navigating excrement and latching onto PVC pipes that they make it to the finest waste treatment facility in the land. And right there in piles of you-know-what, they duke it out until the best plunger wins.

""Hooray-glorg-SLURP,"" bellows the champion at the wobbling podium, ribboned by tufts of thin white tissue.

*

The personal is political insofar as politics as a whole belongs to humanity. In service to we the people. And humanity must always precede politics, which is just the lengthy — at times begrudging — set of rules that we do our best to adhere to, even as the global population nears 8 billion. Because roughly 107 billion people lived and died before us.

Yet we are really not much closer to the great realities than the ancients were. But we are closer to something.

And it's not Jeffrey Epstein. The opposite. Or something far, far away from him and his cruel, depraved empire of mud and paper. He is the dark ghost behind us, the skid mark leading to the fatal crash.

He typifies what we have learned and now regret knowing. Yet, he represents the undefined lower reaches of the American psyche. If Taylor Swift is the Magic Kingdom at DisneyWorld, Epstein is a speakeasy stripclub in downtown Orlando, full of backroom syringes and deadly venereal diseases.

Same city, but two horrifically different environments. Which is more American?

Easy. Disney. Hope. Wonder. Beauty arrayed into the sky despite all the dark winds that howl through mankind. Because, for the most part, America is everything in between.

So drive and drive, through the wild-eyed curves and humps of the country.

You will witness the capillary strings of fog in the morning, the soliloquy chatter of tiny red birds waiting for a storm to pass. Broken ground in the summer, and the last sheaf of daylight like a dark low jack of the ocean, and the whine of a grasshopper that sees our world the way we see the universe.

You will meet grocery-baggers and lawyers and people of so many other professions. Most things about them will be different than you. At the surface. But what you'll find are people with the same depthless stirring.

Ryan: Mayor Pete's last night in town,"Pete Buttigieg deadpanned the stage, barely out of view on the eve of disaster.

For nearly a year, he had practically lived in Iowa, as he competed with a veritable boatload of Democratic presidential candidates. Despite the outlandishly crowded field, he had risen from what the Washington Post described as ""the most interesting mayor you've never heard of,"" to a front-runner in the presidential race, edging his position among the seven remaining candidates.

Super Bowl Sunday. With the first-in-the-nation-vote Iowa caucuses in 28 hours, this ""Get Out The Caucus"" rally was Buttigieg's last pre-caucus event. Not a parking spot for 10 blocks by the time Buttigieg was supposed to have appeared.

A couple thousand people packed inside the Roundhouse, a gymnasium that resembled an ant colony, with its spiraling dome built in 1965. Situated on the campus of Abraham Lincoln High School, with its imposing Collegiate Gothic architecture, hilltopped on the south side of Des Moines, near Gray's Lake — which, on that Feb. 2, 2020, had succumbed to Iowa snow and shortened days, so the water was frozen. Not solid, not deep — only on the surface.

Inside the gymnasium, a profusion of red and yellow. Sultry, humid. People sweating. Warmed by a nagging fluorescence. And bustling. Frantic.

Periodically, the crowd shouted ""BOOT-edge-edge"" to the cadence of ""U-S-A."" Some of their far more elaborate chants had surely been scripted.

Then, lightning shook the gymnasium in the form of Panic! at the Disco. An instrumental loop of their once-ubiquitous single ""High Hopes,"" which you have definitely heard. Over the past year, it has become Buttigieg's campaign song, especially after this video went viral. The choreographed dance routine became a meme, and more videos appeared of Buttigieg-supporter flash mobs, at parks, in conference rooms, at Irish pubs.

Saturday Night Live took a few jabs, with Weekend Update anchor Colin Jost joking, ""It's all part of Mayor Pete's strategy to get a negative percentage of the black vote.""

And, just like that, Buttigieg, 38, took the stage. Behind him, a giant American flag and risers full of Pete-gear-bedecked supporters shouting ""BOOT - EDGE - EDGE. BOOT - EDGE - EDGE. BOOT - EDGE - EDGE.""



The floor rumbled. The bleachers and stairs and blinking scoreboards shook. It was a tribal war ceremony. A pep rally for a game that could cost us everything. Our freedom, our lives, our fast food whenever we want it.

The Maltese Chicken

In many way, Buttigieg represents the anti-Trump.

He's polite. He's intellectual. He's young. A church-going Episcopalian, a Rhodes Scholar, a veteran, a former McKinsey management consultant, a Harvard grad, a piano player. He even once accompanied Ben Folds for a performance of ""Steven's Last Night in Town,"" a song about an enigmatic guy who's always about to leave but never does. Afterward, Folds said, ""It was a very difficult song he pulled off. I'm serious. He's a fine player.""

www.youtube.com

He's well-spoken, decorously well-spoken. Also fluent in French, Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Arabic and Dari, a dialect of Persian that he learned while serving overseas. Oh, and Norwegian.



Like presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, he's a veteran. He joined the Navy Reserve at 27, achieved the rank of lieutenant, with a Joint Service Commendation medal. Then, In 2014, he took a leave as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to serve a seven-month deployment in Afghanistan, where he worked as an intelligence officer as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

""I was packing my bags for Afghanistan while [Donald Trump] was working on Season 7 of 'The Apprentice,"" he said at a May 2019 rally.

In his autobiography, ""Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future,"" he says that, during his time in Afghanistan, he was mostly ""behind a sophisticated computer terminal in a secure area,"" although he served as a vehicle commander on convoys through Kabul 119 times.

I would heave my armored torso into the driver's seat of a Land Cruiser, chamber a round in my M4, lock the doors and wave a gloved goodbye to the Macedonian gate guard. My vehicle would cross outside the wire and into the boisterous Afghan city, entering a world infinitely more interesting and ordinary and dangerous than our zone behind the blast walls at ISAF headquarters.

Like fellow candidates Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders, and former candidate Kamala Harris, Buttigieg is a second-generation American. His father emigrated from Malta in 1979, became a naturalized American citizen, then taught as a professor. ""Buttigieg"" is Maltese for ""lord of the poultry.""

History in the Making

Two types of people at the rally — Buttigieg supporters decked in PETE 2020 gear, and journalists, strutting or looking bored. Meanwhile, I desperately fished through my backpack for my Houston Astros hat, failing, dropping everything, a human spill. But with a smirk, because the Astros had just been disgraced following revelations that they cheated their way to a World Series win, something about banging a trash can like it was a kettledrum.

All through Buttigieg's speech, various media chattered. With their PETE press badges stuck to their arms, they gabbed like people do at annual conferences or family reunions, indifferent to the presidential candidate 80 yards away.

Chuck Todd, host of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" gabbed right beside us. Media pundits, anchors, columnists, all the important people, had converged on Des Moines.

It was like a journalism catwalk. It was like homecoming, for us, the media — the eloquent vultures who stomp around with our wings stretched as a show of dominance or a remedy to fear, compensating always.

Fox News anchor Bret Baier strutted up the aisle, flanked by an entourage. It looked like he'd deep-fried himself in orange baby powder.

Baier lacked the ordinariness that I'd sensed when I met him in Houston at the third Democratic debate. I liked Baier, even if he did snub me when I told him I write for Blaze Media. Now, he was a puffin of confidence, resembling some American emperor as he walked, parting the crowd.

Didn't any of these journalists want to know what Buttigieg had to say? Sure, when you cover an election, you hear a stump speech 40 times and it loses its spark. But our whole job was to comb for lice.

Buttigieg asked the audience, ""So, are you ready to make history one more time?""

They'd be making history, all right, far more than they expected, but not like they'd imagined. By the end of the next day, American democracy would take a pie to the face.

Youth and Inexperience

If elected president, Buttigieg would be the youngest in our nation's history, just two years over the minimum age. He got his start as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at the age of 29. After serving two terms, he left office on Jan. 1, 2020.

In a field of seasoned, older politicians, including a former vice president, Buttigieg has faced relentless scrutiny for his lack of political experience — it has come up every single debate. Most recently, in a now-viral campaign ad from former Vice President Joe Biden, who like Buttigieg, coincidentally, entered politics at age 29 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history.

So much of this campaign has been about age, and not in a charming way. A 73-year-old Ronald Reagan responded to a question about his age by saying, ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""

Buttigieg has often championed the idea of ""Intergenerational justice"" as a means of establishing an ""intergenerational alliance."" Connecting the generations.

During a May 2019 town hall for Fox News, Chris Wallace asked Buttigieg about the constraints of age for a president. Here's Buttigieg's response:

www.youtube.com

At 38, Buttigieg is technically a millennial, and the first to become a serious presidential candidate.



""We're not a generation that feels sorry for itself,"" Buttigieg told one journalist. ""But I think when somebody says, 'Gosh, why are you guys less likely to leave the home?' It's like, well, because college is unaffordable, most of the best opportunities are in cities that are unaffordable. And we graduated into a recession. So what do you expect?""

Politics Politics Politics

Despite all the chaos in the Roundhouse as Mayor Pete chanted to the crowd, I found Justin Robert Young, host of the Politics Politics Politics podcast.

Justin and I first connected last November, after my story on Kanye West's appearance at the Joel Osteen megachurch in Houston. Then Justin had me on his podcast. Immediately, we connected.

The Buttigieg rally was the first time we'd met in person.

Justin gave intermittent commentary into his ZOOM portable recorder, the kind with dual external microphones.

In person, as on his podcast, Justin Robert Young discusses politics with the grace and off-handedness and clarity of a philosophy professor explaining Immanuel Kant. Like a surfer gliding a wave.

But then he throws in some humor. He is what you could call an outcast of the media world. Same as me. There aren't all that many of us. We work for different publications, networks, podcasts — media of every political orientation. But we take umbrage with the politics of new media, it's Trumpian snarl and disdain, it's blunt sense of apathy.

He asked me for my prediction, my ""1, 2, 3, 4"" on who would win Iowa.

I get asked questions like this fairly often. I don't pretend to be a political expert. But if you're at the horse races, you pick a horse, and sometimes you just go with the horse trotting the wildest and maybe it will win.

""For my number one,"" I said, ""I'd guess Bernie. Two, Biden. Three, Warren. Four, Klobuchar.""

""No Pete?"" Justin asked.

""I mean, that would really surprise me.""

Outside the Wire

Buttigieg is the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate. He came out in 2015, at the age of 33, near the end of his first term as mayor, with an essay in the South Bend Tribune:

Like most people, I would like to get married one day and eventually raise a family. I hope that when my children are old enough to understand politics, they will be puzzled that someone like me revealing he is gay was ever considered to be newsworthy. By then, all the relevant laws and court decisions will be seen as steps along the path to equality. But the true compass that will have guided us there will be the basic regard and concern that we have for one another as fellow human beings — based not on categories of politics, orientation, background, status or creed, but on our shared knowledge that the greatest thing any of us has to offer is love.

Ten days later, the Supreme Court struck down all state bans on gay marriage, making same-sex marriage legal on the federal level. He married his husband, Chasten Glezman, a schoolteacher from Michigan, in 2018. The following year, he appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine, with his Chasten, and the words ""First Family.""

The Atlantic said a Buttigieg presidency could ""transform the relationship between gay and straight America for the better."" One op-ed in the New York Times praised Buttigieg for changing America with what the author called ""Mayor Pete's gay reckoning."" Another noted that ""Mr. Buttigieg's ascent has made a sudden and unexpected reality of something [LGBT] donors thought was still years away, if not decades."" Although the author added that the LGBT community is by no means monolithic.

Any criticisms of his gayness, or his being a white gay man, have come not from conservatives or Republicans, but from the left, from LGBT groups and openly left-leaning activism-journalists — a discord that the right has crudely exploited for their own benefit, with concern-troll schadenfreude. Because most of the writers who've criticized Buttigieg are themselves LGBT. And, while they may focus far more on differences than unity, it's their prerogative.

Either way, it's complicated. All of it. For everyone. But especially for the people in the middle of the chaos.

The most cited Buttigieg hit piece is probably the one from The Outline, titled, ""Why Pete Buttigieg is bad for gays.""

The author dislikes Buttigieg's ordinariness, his lack of overt gayness, and, finally, his status as a ""democratic capitalist."" The author concludes,

But it is hard to escape the way that American capitalism and American democracy have worked in tandem both to dissipate and to assimilate the radical democratic energies of queer liberation by giving a very circumscribed sort of gay a conditional membership to the club.

LGBTQ Nation responded with an article titled, ""Why Pete Buttigieg is good for gays,"" rebuking the Outline article, ""That isn't an argument. That's self-hatred.""

A journalist for Slate wrote that

in a primary for the overwhelmingly pro-gay Democratic Party, Buttigieg can be more accurately lumped in with his white male peers than with anyone else.

Senior politics reporter for HuffPost Jennifer Bendery wrote,

[H]is candidacy is already exposing tensions in the LGBTQ community between gay white men, who benefit from the economic and social privileges of being white men, and all the other queer people who don't.

Buzzfeed wrote, ""You Wanted Same-Sex Marriage? Now You Have Pete Buttigieg.""

Vice wrote, ""Why Do White People Love Pete Buttigieg?""

The Root wrote, ""Pete Buttigieg is a lying MF.""

The New Republic published an article in which author Dale Peck, who is also gay, referred to Buttigieg as ""Mary Pete."" LGBTQ Nation called the article disgusting. Within a day, New Republic editors removed it, saying that it crossed the line into ""inappropriate and invasive."" The removal of the article caused its own controversy.

Buttigieg addressed the negative press on ""The Clay Cane Show,""

I just am what I am, and, you know, there's going to be a lot of that. That's why I can't even read the LGBT media anymore because it's all, 'he's too gay, not gay enough, wrong kind of gay.' All I know is that life became a lot easier when I just started allowing myself to be myself and I'll let other people write up whether I'm 'too this' or 'too that'

Negotiating

Outside, among the snow of things and the ice-veiled football field, a vendor wearing a Los Angeles Lakers beanie sold Buttigieg T-shirts and hats, prowling behind two poker tables.

""Buttigieg gave quite a speech,"" I said to Justin. ""But it was so neat and tidy.""

""Nice, is the word,"" he replied. ""What we saw was a coordinated effort to be the nice guy.""

""That's not so bad.""

Buttigieg has repeatedly championed the importance of dialogue between the left and the right. Which would involve broadening the information we consume. Twitter, obviously, perpetuates echo-chamber tribalism. But the news media are guilty of ideological round-abouts as well, so it's a matter of media literacy, what Buttigieg calls ""correcting our media diet."" He was the first Democratic candidate to appear on FoxNews.



""I also think sometimes there's a sense of condescension coming from our party,"" he told Bill Maher. ""I think a lot of people perceive that we're looking down on them."" Which can lead to radicalization. A loss in the sense of belonging.

Truth

Later, Justin and I drank cheap beer and watched the Super Bowl at Beechwood Lounge in Des Moines' Historic East Village, with its boutiques and microbrews and gay bars and pedestrians. Hell of a place to watch the Super Bowl. That long narrow room, steep, a revamped house of some kind. Low lighting. No frill from the bartenders, just abrupt conversation so you know they meant what they said. Home to fashionable outcasts, such as ourselves. The less militant kind with their passion and their certitude, the profound disquiet, a disgust with the status quo.

2020 marked the centennial Super Bowl. Also, it was Shakira's birthday, a fact that everyone in the nation buzzed with, later, during the halftime show, on account of her and J-Lo being hosts, and both giving acrobatically flawless performances. Photo by Kevin Ryan

Toward the end of the night Justin raised his finger, squinted his left eye, and said, ""For your series. You should find a universal truth. Something everyone knows but hasn't said or can't express. Give them a universal truth.""



On the flight to Des Moines, I read Forrest Gander's Pulitzer-Prize-winning poetry collection ""Be With."" All week, I kept thinking about one line. A seeming non sequitur. A sentence fragment. ""Intuition of the infinite.""

Is that truth? When we discover truth, are we grasping something infinite? A constant strain. Reaching for feathers as they float through the breeze. Chasing a rabbit near a busy road and all you want to do is save a creature but it's just too fast and now the danger has spread. Still, in the words of Robert Browning, ""Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?""

Our era already resigned itself to a life of mistruth, the Age of Fake News Supreme. We know the chaos of doubting whether something is the truth or a lie. A pattern that seems to worsen each day. So it has become harder than ever to apply a universal truth to hundreds of millions of people. But I would do it.

""You're going to see some ads saying there's only two ways to go,"" Buttigieg had said earlier that day at the rally. ""Either you're for a revolution or you're for the status quo. But the good news for Americans today is we have a historic majority ready not only to rally around what we're against to get a better president, but to come together in the name of what we are for as a country.""

During an appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Dr. Phil perfectly described how this is possible.

""Why do you think that nobody can talk to each other anymore?"" Colbert asked.

""You know, to tell you the truth, I don't think anybody's trying to get along right now,"" Dr. Phil said. ""Everybody is pissed off and it's like they don't want to get along. If I'm negotiating with somebody — if I'm negotiating with you, the first thing I'm going to do is figure out how to get you the most of what you want I possibly can.""

Colbert recoiled. ""Is negotiating all about winning?"" he asked.

""Certainly you want to win,"" said Dr. Phil, ""but you gotta define 'win.' If 'win' is all one-sided, that's not gonna last very long. If you and I make a deal and I say, 'Okay, here's the deal, you do all the work and I'm gonna get all the money,' I might talk you into that today, but three-four days later you're gonna go, 'Excuse me, can we — kiss my ass, I'm not doing that anymore. Nobody's gonna go along with that, you've gotta have a sense of saying, 'All right, let's start by saying, what do we agree on?""

""Okay, that's it,"" replied Colbert. ""What do we agree on? Because it seems like, right now, during the campaign and right now, too, people are having trouble agreeing on reality. People are having trouble agreeing on what is a fact, what is an alternative fact … Why is this happening, Dr. Phil?""

""Any time there's a dispute,"" Dr. Phil responded, ""the first thing I do is say, 'Okay, let's figure out what it is we agree on, because we might agree on more than we think, and then we can have these things over to the side that we disagree on.'""

He added, ""So. What do we agree on? Everybody agrees that we're all Americans, that we all enjoy the freedoms that we want, we all want to be safe — everybody agrees with those things, right? If you say, 'What do we not agree on' — okay, now we're talking about the disagreements, but we at least have some common ground. Nobody's talking about that.""

"'Nobody's looking for the truth any more': Bill O'Reilly slams the MSM, says, 'It's all agenda-driven reporting'","On Tuesday's live BlazeTV special, ""Media Meltdown,"" Glenn Beck, Eric Bolling, and Bill O'Reilly discussed whether today's media is more or less honest and credible than when television's ""big three"" networks"" ruled the airwaves.

""Even though we are having real, harsh debate right now ... voices are being heard and people are being exposed for who they are. As ugly as it is right now, aren't we better off than we were?"" Glenn asked.

""No, and I'll tell you why,"" asserted Bill, who noted that he has worked with CBS' Dan Rather and ABC's Peter Jennings.

""There were standards at both places, CBS News and ABC News. If you were going to report something, you had to back it up with facts. So, there was a mandate to seek the truth,"" Bill said. ""When you brought your report in, you were asked, 'How do you know?' That's gone. Nobody's looking for the truth any more. It's all agenda-driven reporting.""

""So, we are worse off now than we've ever been in the history of this republic, media-wise,"" he added.

THE DOCUMENTS for 'Crimes or Cover-Up?' BlazeTV special,"COVID-19 changed everything. The way we live our lives, how we operate our businesses, how we see each other. And now, the federal government is sinking its tendrils even deeper, threatening the fabric not only of our bodily autonomy, but of the republic.

Our American way of life may never be the same. To save it, we must understand the key fundamentals of the pandemic that transfigured our society into the nightmare it is today. What is the COVID-19 origin story? Who are its top players in government and science, pulling the strings? What was their REAL response in the first days of the pandemic? The answers to these questions are frightening.

Emails, documents, and federal contracts tell a dark story that is still dominating our lives. It's time to cast a light on the shocking truth. Because only with the truth can we emerge from the darkness of this ""pandemic"" and take back the liberty stolen from us.

Why Glenn Beck has never been this TERRIFIED for America before,"America is in a very dangerous place right now. Far-left progressives are doing everything they can to create the right-wing ""extremists"" they can't seem to organically find, and many on the right have had enough. Somebody is going to do something stupid, which will only give the left the excuse it needs to brand every last conservative in the nation as a ""threat to our democracy.""

""We need a plan of action to save the country,"" Glenn Beck said on a recent episode of Glenn TV. But that plan must adhere 100% to the Constitution, he asserted, because if we lash out in anger, we will lose.

""I have never been more frightened for my country than I am right now,"" Glenn said. ""We have 350 million people and some of them are bat-crap-crazy 24 hours a day, no matter who is the president. Somebody's going to do something stupid, and the people that I would like to see behind bars — those who are intentionally trying to distort, dismantle, and destroy our republic and the Constitution — they will use any and every opportunity they have to push people in a certain direction, cast them in a certain light [...]. There isn't any way to win unless we remember who we are and rise above it,"" he added.

""This is going to be one or the other: You're going to have an authoritarian state that tells everybody exactly what to do, what you can buy; you will be a serf, or we're going to have a new chapter of freedom. Getting to either one of these is going to be ugly,"" Glenn warned. ""We must try absolutely everything we can, and November is the best way to do it.""

Glenn went on to explain why, if we don't realize that our neighbors are not the same as the ""crazies"" in Washington, D.C., we won't have a country anymore.

""I'm sorry if I am out of step with you,"" he said. ""When I started this job the week of September 11th, I promised [God] I would do my best to find the answers to share them with you and stand up for what I truly believed He would have me do.""

""All we can do is the best we can right now, and the best thing that you can do is, as the crowd gets louder, do not scream for more blood. As the crowd gets louder, we must become more quiet and humble — but in the way of Jesus. Stop thinking of Jesus Christ only as a lamb. He was also a lion. But he was a lion that roared against injustice. Just because you want to be reasoned, quiet, Christ-like, does not mean that you do not turn over tables. The tables here have to be turned over. The money-changers have got to be chased out of our republic's temple in Washington, D.C., and I am all for that. But notany other way than constitutionally.""

""Don't give the crazies what they want,"" Glenn urged. We are so close to November, then we must vote them out.

Glenn Beck: Marie Yovanovitch committed 'perjury' when she LIED under oath about 'do not prosecute list',"During Friday's Democrat-led impeachment inquiry hearing, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified under oath that she did not give former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko a ""do not prosecute list"" in 2017. Yovanovitch also doubled-down on left-wing disinformation saying that Lutsenko ""acknowledged that the list never existed"" in April.

""I want to reiterate first that the allegation that I disseminated a ""Do Not Prosecute"" list was a fabrication,"" Yovanovitch told the House Intelligence Committee. ""Mr. Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who made that allegation, has acknowledged that the list never existed. I did not tell Mr. Lutsenko or other Ukrainian officials who they should or should not prosecute.""

""That is such a lie,"" Glenn Beck said on Friday's show. ""She should be held for perjury.""

During a three-part BlazeTV exposé on the Democrats' corruption in Ukraine, Glenn debunked what he called ""the most misleading fabrication I've ever seen by the mainstream media.""

Earlier this year, award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon reported Lutsenko's claim that then-Ambassador Yovanovitch gave him a list of ""people whom we should not prosecute"" during a meeting in 2016. Shortly after Solomon's article was released, several news sources, including the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, reported that Lutsenko retracted his statement.

But Glenn's research revealed that the mainstream media got their erroneous information from a Ukrainian news site called Unian, which misleadingly headlined a story ""Ukraine Prosecutor General Lutsenko admits U.S. ambassador didn't give him a do not prosecute list,"" based on a misinterpretation of what Lutsenko told another Ukrainian publication, TheBabel.

When Lutsenko said Yovanovitch ""gave"" him a list, he did not mean she actually handed him anything in writing, but verbally conveyed the names of people he shouldn't prosecute.

""They never mentioned the fact that it was verbally dictated and he wrote the list down himself — are you kidding me?"" Glenn exclaimed. ""This is how the media is fact-checking and debunking. They are playing with our republic and Ukraine's republic. They are planting dynamite all around everything that we hold dear. How do they sleep at night? Everyone that reads their stories actually thinks that there was a retraction of one of the most damning parts of this entire case.""

Biden uses climate change as a national emergency,"Glenn Beck has been warning how the federal government would use climate change as a national emergency which would essentially give the president war powers.

Inflation and gas prices are currently being blamed on Putin, but Glenn predicts that will evolve into a “global warming crisis.” Those war powers will likely be coupled with the power to silence dissent. But how would Biden accomplish this in a republic? By copying the playbook of his hero, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Our copycat in chief lives in a dimension that believes inflation is still transitory, gas prices are just the growing pains of necessary energy transition, and basically everything else going wrong across America can be blamed on forces completely outside the influence of White House policy. In this dimension, everything will go swell for America if it will just stop resisting, sit back, and trust Biden’s FDR-plan. In this dimension, every problem is completely curable from the Oval Office – there’s nothing that hundreds of executive orders, a few trillion dollars, and good union jobs won’t fix.

Egged on by Democrat Party and media elites, historians, and even descendants of FDR and his Cabinet who all still hero-worship FDR, Biden keeps shuffling toward this fantasy that he will transform America and be renowned as a progressive savior like FDR. FDR-sized vanity is not what the doctor ordered for an America on the brink of disaster.

Election of consequence: What the polls are NOT telling you,"With the midterms now less than four weeks away, Glenn Beck reveals what the polls aren’t telling you. Is there a silent voter base that will totally disrupt the outcome of the election and stun Democrats again?

President Biden’s White House seems to have a massive blind spot. The administration has prioritized pardoning everyone convicted of marijuana possession, abortion on demand, canceling student loan debt, and promoting sex-change surgeries for children. It’s like Democrats are governing some virtual reality game version of America.

BlazeTV hosts Stu Burguiere and Steve Deace join in cutting through the Democrat and media noise to explain the issues that could unleash a red wave, and Matthew Peterson of Firebrand PAC has a challenge for Americans who think the republic is too lost and the GOP is too feeble for their vote to make a difference come November 8.

WATCH: Biden's Hostile Takeover: The Great Reset of America,"Our sacred republic has never been in more danger than it is today. Little by little, industry by industry, the far Left is fundamentally transforming the country we love. And it's an aggressive, hostile kind of takeover we've only seen in some of the world's darkest societies.

On Glenn TV this week, Glenn Beck exposes how the Biden administration and Democrats are aggressively scrambling to reset everything: our free and fair voting system, our kids' education, our policing, immigration and border security, our economy, our military, and our energy supply.

Crimes or Cover-Up? Exposing the World’s Most Dangerous Lie,"COVID-19 changed everything. The way we live our lives, how we operate our businesses, how we see each other. And now, the federal government is sinking its tendrils even deeper, threatening the fabric not only of our bodily autonomy, but of the republic.

Our American way of life may never be the same. To save it, we must understand the key fundamentals of the pandemic that transfigured our society into the nightmare it is today. What is the COVID-19 origin story? Who are its top players in government and science, pulling the strings? What was their REAL response in the first days of the pandemic? The answers to these questions are frightening.

Emails, documents, and federal contracts tell a dark story that is still dominating our lives. It's time to cast a light on the shocking truth. Because only with the truth can we emerge from the darkness of this ""pandemic"" and take back the liberty stolen from us.

This is Glenn Beck's most important chalkboard of his life. And the most pivotal time in yours.

‘Summer of rage’: These are the REAL extremists who threaten our Republic,"We are at the precipice of the fundamental transformation of America. The radicals want to change our country, and the SCOTUS rulings on Roe v. Wade and guns will be the battle cries they use. The entire process is beginning now.

It’s a top-down, bottom-up plan that includes the highest levels of government, street soldiers on the ground, and the rest of us caught in the middle while everything begins to turn inside-out. Some of the street soldiers have openly called for — and committed — violence, and for overturning the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. But the Biden administration seems to be more concerned with Jan. 6 protesters and former President Donald Trump.

On his Wednesday night ""Glenn TV"" special, Glenn Beck exposes the next moves for the radical Left after Roe v Wade: the hints from the Biden administration and what that means for you and your family. He also reveals what’s happening on the streets and how the leftist radicals (some who've been around since the '60s) are the ideological drivers of some of the current bottom-up activists.

And after the Women’s March openly called for a ""Summer of Rage"" and to put ""bodies on the line,"" Glenn asked BlazeTV contributor Delano Squires to go undercover and attend training for protesters willing to risk arrest. Delano tells Glenn what he found most disturbing about the activists’ perverted sense of justice.

Glenn Beck dismantles media lies on Ukraine corruption: 'The most misleading fabrication I've ever seen by the mainstream media',"During a BlazeTV special on Wednesday, Glenn Beck exposed how the mainstream media are blatantly lying to help cover up what left-wing politicians have been doing in Ukraine, which has directly led to the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

""It's probably the most misleading fabrication I've ever seen by the mainstream media,"" Glenn said during his special titled ""Democracy DOES Die in Darkness,"" the second of a three-part series. [Watch Part 1 here.]

Glenn explained that the media have been repeating an intentionally misleading narrative that negates one of the most crucial claims alleging Democratic corruption in Ukraine.

Earlier this year, award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon reported that the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko said that then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch gave him a list of ""people whom we should not prosecute"" during their first meeting in 2016.

Shortly after Solomon's report was released, so-called trustworthy news sources like the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal made the claim that Lutsenko retracted his statement and that there wasn't a ""do not prosecute list.""

""They lied their ass off to the American people,"" Glenn asserted. ""The media started blatantly making stuff up, writing their own fabricated story to hide what really happened. They initiated one of the most misleading lies I think I've ever seen from the media.""

Glenn revealed that the media got their erroneous information from a Ukrainian news site called Unian, which misleadingly reported that Lutsenko ""admitted that U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch did not give him a do not prosecute list,"" based on the fact that Lutsenko told another Ukrainian publication, TheBabel, that by ""gave"" he did not mean Yovanovitch actually handed him a list, but verbally conveyed the names of people he shouldn't prosecute.

""They never mentioned the fact that it was verbally dictated and he wrote the list down himself — are you kidding me?"" Glenn exclaimed. ""This is how the media is fact-checking and debunking. They are playing with our republic and Ukraine's republic. They are planting dynamite all around everything that we hold dear. How do they sleep at night? Everyone that reads their stories actually thinks that there was a retraction of one of the most damning parts of this entire case.""

Counting down LevinTV's top ten videos of 2021,"As we gear up for 2022, LevinTV counts down the top ten videos of 2021.

#10 Let's start with #10. Remember when Joe Biden launched a commission to examine ""Supreme Court Reform""? We do. Revisit Mark's recounting of the history of the nine-judge system as it stands today and how Biden may seek to damage the republic with his court-packing.

#9 This is #9: “Milley Gets Blackburned.” Rewatch how General Mark Milley squirmed under the intense questioning from senators over the withdrawal from Afghanistan — especially from powerhouse Marsha Blackburn.

#8 Here is #8: How badly did Joe Biden bungle our exit from Afghanistan, abandoning Americans and allies alike? According to Mark, enough to anger Jake Tapper.

#7 Coming in at #7 is ""The Secret Texts."" New encrypted texts revealed his hypocrisy after Joe Biden preached that he would ""leave no American behind.""

#6 Joe Biden is in trouble again in #6: Mark Levins believes Joe Biden's reproachable ""leadership"" left our men vulnerable, our allies distrustful, and our country ashamed. Mark questions what could be more shameful than a leader who disrespects our fallen soldiers?!

#5 MSNBC’s coverage made the #5 LevinTV video from 2021. The far-Left praised Biden when his moral compass, to some, appeared broken. Watch as U.S. Army veteran Matt Zeller schools them on decorum and leadership.

#4 ""Obama Palooza"" made the #4 video from 2021. In this video, Mark believes that with the Omicron variant emerging, it's important to remember when Barack Obama ignored the dangers of the Delta variant to throw a flashy, maskless, three-day birthday extravaganza like the affluent aristocracy he is.

#3 Coming in at #3 is “Medical Fascism.” Levin discussed events that took place in July when the CDC threatened to mandate masks for vaccinated people while millions of illegal immigrants stream across our southern border — many of them unvaccinated. Mark asked the right question: If illegal immigrants get a free health pass into our nation, why were Americans treated like medical prisoners?

#2 “Jim Crow Joe” is #2. Mark explained why Joe Biden is the ""liar in chief.""

#1 The #1 LevinTV video: ""Chaos in Kabul"" saw the military disaster of the Afghanistan withdrawal and the cowardly leadership known as the Biden presidency. Our ""commander in blame"" stood by his decision while Kabul imploded under the Taliban invasion. See Mark fire away at Biden's foreign policies that still threaten to set fire to America's reputation and security on the world stage.

"Mark Levin exposes the real 'greatest threat' to America, as Dems continue focus on Jan. 6","For more than a year now, Democrats have been using the January 6 Capitol Riot as a ""political cudgel."" Their goal was to stoke fear in the hearts of Americans to advance their Marxist mission, argued BlazeTV host Mark Levin on a recent episode of ""LevinTV."" But as the media and the Democrat Party liken that day to Pearl Harbor and 9/11, Mark exposed what he believes is the real threat to our republic: the Democrat Party and its allies in the corporate media.

""The Democrat Party, the media, and the American Marxists want to make January 6 the date that will live in infamy. They want it to be remembered like the attack on Pearl Harbor or 9/11 or the Civil War or anything of the sort, because their goal isn't really to find out how that building was breached.""

""Because if they wanted to know how the building was breached, the number-one witness who'd be under oath, who'd be giving testimony, who'd have to provide her texts, her emails, and so forth and so on would be Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House. It's her job primarily to protect that building. And we've had plenty of information that she was offered the National Guard from the president, that in fact some law enforcement there on the Capitol had requested National Guard, and she turned it down because she was concerned about the optics.""

Levin said Pelosi has refused to provide any information about security measures leading up to and on the day of the Capitol riot and has blocked the House sergeant at arms from answering questions. Meanwhile, the Pelosi-appointed committee supposedly investigating the Jan. 6 riot has failed to ask for any information related to the House speaker or the Capitol’s inadequate security on that fateful day. Instead, they accuse former President Trump of “dereliction of duty"" for not taking taking ""specific and immediate action"" during the Jan. 6 riot.

""Dereliction of his duty? What duty exactly?"" Levin asked. ""It's the duty of the House of Representatives to defend the House of Representatives. It's the duty of the speaker of the House to ask the president the United States for the National Guard. The president the United States cannot do that himself. Now, we know this because over and over and over again when the president wanted to send federal troops into Minneapolis, into Seattle, into Portland and other places that were being burned and attacked during the Democrat Party riots of two summers ago, the governors refused. The mayors refused. And the president's hands were, in many respects, tied,"" he added.



""Now they want you to believe that January 6 is the greatest threat ever in American history to our government. That ... challenging the results of the election [has] never been done,"" Levin stated. ""It was done in 2000 by [Democratic presidential candidate Al] Gore ... it was done on the floor of the House of representatives, January 6, 2001, when Democrats were challenging the election of George W. Bush. It was done in 2004 when they were challenging [Bush's] re-election and claiming that [Democratic presidential candidate] John Kerry had actually won the Electoral College in a number of these states ...""

Levin went on to suggest that the most dangerous attack on the integrity of America's election system was actually ""in 2016, when the Democrat Party, when the Biden and Obama administration, when the FBI and the intelligence services, and, of course, Hillary Clinton, her campaign, and the DNC actually unleashed the greatest assault on our republic, internally, that we've ever seen, which was the Russia collusion lie.""

""The collusion wasn't between Trump and Russia. It was between the Obama administration, the the law enforcement bureaucracy in the federal government, the left-wing slip-and-fall lawyers working for Perkins Coie and the Hillary [Clinton] campaign, and the DNC. That's where the collusion was, and for two and a half years they lied to us.""

Biden FIERCELY defends a possible $450K payout to illegal immigrants,"When you think you've seen it all, President Joe Biden sends out a shockwave to the heart of our Constitutional republic.

In this clip, Pat Gray, host of Pat Gray Unleashed, reacted to a jaw-dropping exchange of words at Monday's press conference. The conversation began when reporter Peter Doocy asked for clarification on President Biden's comment last week about a possible payout to illegal immigrants who found themselves separated from their children after crossing the US - Mexico border. This offense violates American immigration law.

""That's not gonna happen,"" Biden said to Fox News' Peter Doocy on Wednesday, in response to a question about a report claiming a deal was in the works.

""You guys keep sending that garbage out?"" Biden said. ""But it's not true,"" was Biden's position last week. Monday, however, Biden came out in defense of a payout for an undetermined amount of money.

""Whether [the border crossing] was legal or illegal, and you lost your child, you lost your child. It's gone — you deserve some kind of compensation, no matter what the circumstance,"" Biden said with aggression. ""What that will be,"" he added, ""I have no idea.""

""They did;t lose their children!"" Pat erupted with frustration. Pat did his best to find humor in Biden's blatant display of lies and intent to misuse taxpayer money. ""Calm down, Cujo,"" Pat said with a chuckle.

Journalist questions '10-year-old rape victim denied abortion' story,"A disturbing story about a 10-year-old girl in Ohio, a rape victim who had to travel to the neighboring state of Indiana to get an abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, has recently gone viral.

While the corporate media and pro-abortionists jumped all over the opportunity to use this horrific alleged crime as a political weapon against pro-life politicians, such as South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem (R), a few actual journalists raised questions. PJ Media’s Megan Fox said the alleged story gave her ""serious pause for a number of reasons,"" so she did a little digging (remember when journalists did that as a rule?) and found some very interesting information, which she shared in the following (brace yourself, it's long) Twitter thread:





On the latest episode of ""Relatable,"" BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey also had more than a few questions about the ""suspicious"" viral story about a pregnant 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio who needs an abortion. She went over all the red flags with this story that have some questioning whether it's even true.

'Biden is not protecting and defending the Constitution.' - Glenn Beck,"Do you believe in freedom of speech? What about freedom of the press? But what if the press is outwardly lying?

The constitutional rule of law is under attack and has been for quite some time. On this episode of ""Stu Does America,"" Stu and Glenn discussed what they described as the ""most impeachable thing"" they had witnessed in this lifetime. Watch the clip to hear the full conversation.

Glenn later provided a brief overview of the veto power granted to the executive branch of the United States government and explained how President Joe Biden appeared to have abused his veto power by neglecting to veto a clearly unconstitutional law.

""This is truly about the constitutional rule of law,"" Glenn said.

He added that President Biden, who is suppose to check the constitutionality of any bill passed by Congress, appeared to have passed on his duty to protect the Constitution, passing the responsibility along to the Supreme Court instead. Watch the clip to hear more about the specific law in question.

""A constitutional republic cannot stand in opposition to the Constitution!"" Glenn said. He went on to explain how everything the current administration does is indirect opposition to the very Constitution they swore to protect and defend.

Glenn noted that Americans will have to look past political affiliation and get back to the basics — the Bill of Rights — and decide if we still agree on our founding principles.

Glenn Beck: Here's why ALARM BELLS should have gone off when Biden said THIS,"Last week, President Joe Biden said, “Climate change is an emergency, and in the coming weeks, I’m going to use the power I have as president to turn these words into formal, official government actions for the appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory power that the president possesses.”

But Glenn Beck says the only state of emergency that needs to be declared right now is what's going on with our out-of-control federal government and president.

""When you have a president saying he is going to issue an emergency order and declare a national emergency on climate, of all things, you're about to lose your republic,"" Glenn said on the radio program.

""No matter what party the president is from, when they say any version of 'since Congress won't act, I will,' that should have alarm bells going off,"" he continued. ""When they say, 'If Congress will not act, I will,' that is a direct violation of the president's oath of office.""

Glenn argued that most Americans don't realize how weak the office of the president is supposed to be, and it even seems like many on both sides of the political aisle prefer a president who can practically wave a magic wand and change everything.

He went on to explain how the president got so much power (hint: it started with Woodrow Wilson) and why it's clearly dangerous and unconstitutional.

""The Founders put Congress front and center in the Constitution, not the president, and here's why: They had major kingophobia,"" Glenn said. ""They knew that men would try to gather more and more power and consolidate that power, and that was everything they were trying to get away from. So what did they do? Well, they were very cautious when they put together the office of the president, the executive branch. After the Preamble, the very first line of (Article I) says, 'All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.' So all legislative power is granted to Congress ... no legislative power is granted to the president. Now, I know you know this, but I'm not sure about the rest of America: The president cannot make laws.""

Bill O’Reilly blasts media over 'DISGUSTING' coverage of election,"Bill O'Reilly told Glenn Beck that the mainstream media's coverage of the 2020 presidential election was — and continues to be — ""disgusting."" He said he doesn't think the media even wants to know what really happened in November, and he believes the partnership between the media and the far left poses a ""danger to the republic.""

Bill O’Reilly: This is the ONLY way to stop Biden’s DISASTROUS power,"Every decision made by President Joe Biden has ended in ""disaster,"" Bill O'Reilly told Glenn Beck.

O'Reilly joined the radio program to explain why he thinks there's only one ""mechanism"" Americans can use stop the Biden administration's mess.

""Give me one thing that [Biden] has done, just one, that's improved this nation. Everything that he has been involved with is a disaster. Everything from the COVID mandates, to the energy policies, to the economic policies, to the inflation, to Afghanistan, to the collapsing southern border, to the social woke business, to the denial of due process. Right across-the-board, there isn't anything this man has done, or stood for, that's improved America,"" O'Reilly said.

""But there is no mechanism to do anything about it until a year from this November: the midterm elections. That's the only mechanism that we have, under the Constitution. We elected this guy and he's there for four years. You neutralize him next November [2022], with the Republicans taking back the House and Senate, then he's done. [He] can't do anymore damage because you've got him in a hole. And he's not going to be proactive with executive orders. He's just going to stay there in his jammies for two more years. OK? So that's the only mechanism.""

O'Reilly also tore into the corporate media for using its power to defend Gen. Mark Milley after news of his China calls broke. Is there any deterrence in American society anymore to keep our leaders and media in check?

""What does this say to the United States of America when you have two of the most powerful information agencies in the world — NBC, Comcast, and AT&T, CNN — actively deceiving you?"" O'Reilly said. ""They know what they're doing. And yet there is absolutely no way for anyone to hold them accountable other than not watching them, which has, of course, happened. You know they have no audience. But just the corruption level of the information flow to the American people is at an all-time high. We have never had a worse media in the history of this republic.""

"Glenn Beck: MSM's 'reprehensible' hypocrisy damages our society, our country, and 'the standing of this president in the world'","On the radio program Tuesday, Glenn Beck talked about how Democrat politicians and the mainstream media are reaching unprecedented levels of hypocrisy that has become so absurd, they are damaging our society, our country, and our president's standing in the world.

""I want to play a couple of things that I find absolutely reprehensible,"" Glenn said. ""First, let's start with death threats.""

Glenn played an audio clip of CNN senior political analyst David Gergen commenting on President Donald Trump's tweet about the whistleblower whose complaint has led to the current impeachment inquiry.

""There is a very good chance the name of this whistle-blower will get out one way or the other, in the next two weeks. If somebody goes after him, the blood will be on the hands of the president,"" Gergen can be heard saying in the clip.

""So, is [Gergen] accusing the president of wanting to kill the whistle-blower ... that, if this president finds out who this whistle-blower is ... he's going to kill him?"" asked Glenn. ""Or, no, it will be one of [Trump's] supporters that tries to kill the whistle-blower? Which is it, and is that reasonable to say at this point? Especially in an atmosphere where apparently Michael Che and NBC can get away with this 'joke'.""

Glenn played a video clip of ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian, Michael Che, talking about the impeachment threat against the president.

""When they said Trump was getting impeached, I immediately thought, 'Great, Trump is fired. Let's get drunk. But they were like, 'No, he's just being impeached, but he ain't exactly peached yet. It will still take another year or so.' And I'm like, well, damn, that sucks. Let's get drunk,"" said Che. ""I mean, the presidency is only a four-year job, but it feels like it's taking five years to just fire his a**. It's frustrating. You know, I bet somebody explained how long impeachment takes to John Wilkes Booth, and he was like, ""Okay, well, where's he at right now?'""

""Was that a threat?"" Glenn asked, adding that ""NBC doesn't have a problem with it.""

""Do you remember how the press and Hillary [Clinton] were so offended that the president, in his campaign, could have people chanting 'lock her up,' how horrible that was? And how unpresidential that was? And for him to tolerate it or laugh at it, was the biggest scandal? Let me play last night with Steven Colbert,"" he said to introduce the next clip.

""Is it time to, dare I say, lock him up, lock him up?"" CBS late-night host, Stephen Colbert, asked failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during his show Monday night.

""So it's funny now, to say that?"" said Glenn.

""Why is no one in the press interested in what the damage is to the republic?"" he added. ""It damages the president. But it also damages the republic. It damages the Constitution. It damages society. It damages the standing of this president in the world. This has not been done before. This is all new territory.""

DNC CORRUPTION: What's on the hacked Democratic computer server in Ukraine?,"When the White House released transcripts of the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, we learned that President Trump was seeking information about a missing DNC computer server believed to be in Ukraine, which allegedly contains incriminating information about the Democrats' involvement in election meddling.

This is the same server that fired-FBI Director James Comey and the Justice Department have been looking for as part of the Russia investigation. If it was so important then, why shouldn't President Trump be looking for it now? And what's on that server?

On this week's radio program, Glenn Beck noted that corruption within the government is wrong regardless of who's committing it — and we need to call it out to save our republic.

""This is massive corruption,"" Glenn said. ""It doesn't matter who they are if they are guilty, because this corruption is so deep. Exactly everything that the Democrats said that Donald Trump did in Russia, they did and are still doing in Ukraine, and we don't have a republic if this remains,"" he added.

""One of the things in the phone call that the Left made a big deal about, is [President Trump] was asking for help, not about Hunter Biden, but ... the first thing he said [to President Zelensky] is 'You still may be surrounded by really bad guys. There is corruption all around you. We think some of those bad guys are still in your circle of advisers.' And the [Ukraine] President said, 'I know who you are talking about ... and, no, sir, they are not in my circle,'"" Glenn explained.

""Then [President Trump] said, 'We are looking for a server.' Now, what server are they looking for? They're looking for the DNC server,"" Glenn continued. ""Why do they have a DNC server in Ukraine? Well, wouldn't we like to know?""

""So, Donald Trump asked for the server. How dare him? Yeah, except that's the same server that James Comey was looking for, that the FBI, the Justice Department, was looking for and couldn't find,"" Glenn said. ""Remember when they said that server was really, really important for the Russia investigation? That's the same server that Donald Trump is looking for. So, if it was so important that the FBI and James Comey needed it, why is it so bad [that President Trump is looking for it]? Because it's going to prove Donald Trump was guilty right? Why is everybody upset he is asking for this server? Why is it so bad that he says, 'Hey, talk to our attorney general about this server, can you find it?' Donald Trump, why would he want the server that was going to prove what he did in Russia? Because the people in Ukraine have been trying to get things to the United States, but they were blocked by the DNC. They were blocked by operatives in intelligence, in justice, and in the embassy.""

""I don't know about you, but I would sure like to see what is on that DNC server. And if it implicates Donald Trump, then it implicates Donald Trump. If it implicates the DNC, then it implicates the DNC,"" Glenn concluded.

Jamie Dimon's and Glenn Beck's economic warning,"Glenn Beck has been sounding the economic alarm for months, trying to warn Americans of an impending financial crisis. Now, it looks like JP Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon is doing the same, and in no uncertain terms.

Dimon said on Wednesday that an economic ""hurricane"" is coming our way, and warned investors ""you better brace yourself.”

""I said there were storm clouds. But I'm going to change it. It’s a hurricane,"" Dimon said during a financial conference sponsored by AllianceBernstein. ""Right now it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle it. That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way. We don’t know if it’s a minor one or Superstorm Sandy. You better brace yourself.""

""So, I've been telling you what's coming,"" Glenn Beck said on the radio program Thursday. ""Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan Chase said ... in his quarterly reports that 'storm clouds are gathering.' He changed that yesterday. He said these aren't storm clouds. This is a hurricane. And you had better batten down the hatches. A hurricane, a financial hurricane is coming.""



Glenn also warned that the looming financial crisis goes far beyond high prices. The far left is creating an ""emergency"" in nearly every sector of our society —an energy crisis, a food crisis, a climate crisis, a money crisis, a housing crisis, a crime crisis, and more — and it’s all part of its plan.

As we all should have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, ""national emergencies"" mean massive government power grabs, and the Biden administration isn't exactly working to make sure it never happens again.

""America, you should know, crisis is just around the corner. Do you trust the administration? Because it could be anything,"" Glenn said. ""Just remember, when you have 'national emergencies' — as I thought we all learned with COVID, but ... no states are taking that up and saying, 'never again.' So, what do you think they're going to do next time? Nobody has risen up and said, 'Stop it. Right now.' The gap between a republic or a democracy, and a dictatorship, it's really not as wide as we thought.""

Glenn Beck to Obama: YOU planted America's Marxist seeds,"Former President Barack Obama sat down with CNN's Anderson Cooper recently for an interview scheduled to air in full on Friday. During the interview, Obama scoffed at the idea that critical race theory could be a ""threat to our Republic,"" while claiming that ""right-wing media venues"" are ""stoking the fear and resentment of a white population.""

On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck set the record straight: the right-wing media's efforts to call out the far-left have nothing to do with race in America, but rather everything to do with protecting our way of life that is being threatened more and more each day by the radical, Marxist ideology seeping into government.

""Mr. Obama, you lied,"" Glenn asserted. ""You used the IRS to hunt down your enemy. You spied on the media. And your health care package, which was supposed to save every American $3,000 per year, has helped some, perhaps, while raising the cost of everyone's health care in double and triple percentages. But the worst thing that you did, is you planted, you watered, and you protected the Marxist seeds, by crying race.""

'A catastrophe of global significance just waiting to happen': Glenn Beck on why an Ebola outbreak is a real threat,"On Friday's radio program, Glenn Beck talked about the hundreds of African immigrants who have crossed the US-Mexico border in recent weeks, and the fact that most of these migrants come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area suffering the second deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history.



""We all know how deadly Ebola is. We all know it's ground zero in the Congo,"" Glenn said. ""We are now looking at the [second] biggest outbreak, the most deadly outbreak of Ebola yet. And where is it? It's centered in the Congo.""

According to U.S. Border Patrol reports, more than 500 illegal immigrants from Africa, primarily from the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola, have crossed the U.S. - Mexico border into Texas in recent weeks.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the confirmed cases of Ebola have exceeded 2000, with nearly 1400 of those cases resulting in death. This puts the fatality ratio for the virus at 67 percent, according to the World Health Organization.



Glenn explained that Ebola is particularly difficult to diagnose, in part because the virus has a 21 day incubation period, and there are no mandatory screenings, quarantines, or detention before illegal immigrants are released into communities.

""Now, this doesn't mean these guys have Ebola. This doesn't mean we shouldn't take them in if they really are fleeing from a war zone,"" Glenn asserted. ""This means we should not dismiss the fact[s] ... and if anyone thinks that ISIS just wouldn't weaponize people -- you're out of your mind.""

He went on to note that ISIS is currently active in the Ebola-stricken regions of the Congo, having claimed responsibility for a deadly attack as recently as last week, and has threatened bio-terrorism in the past.

""But why worry,"" he added. ""That's going to be called hateful. That's going to be called fear-mongering. That's going to be called everything other than what it is: a truthful look at the facts, and a warning that ... we should be screening for Ebola and we have a problem on the border. This is a catastrophe of global significance just waiting to happen.""

'The answer to bad speech is NOT less speech': NYT bestselling author Brad Thor on big tech censorship,"On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck was joined by New York Times bestselling author Brad Thor to talk about America's current ""toxic"" culture and how we are on the brink of losing freedom of speech in today's digital age.

Brad said our country is experiencing ""a wasting away of our culture in our unity as Americans.""



""We see ourselves as these silos, these sub-groups well before we see each other as fellow Americans,"" he explained. ""That's not good for our republic.""

Glenn talked about the threat of losing our right to free speech and how tech giants are able to censor content and silence voices because they operate as platforms, not publishers.

""We always said in this country that the answer to bad speech is not less speech, it's more speech,"" Brad responded. ""I am concerned that we have people who are only getting their news from Facebook. I don't care if you're left, right, or center, that's not a good idea to gather all of your news from Facebook.

""We're at the top of the mountain,"" he continued. ""But, if we're not careful, if we lean too far forward, too far back, too far left, too far right, you fall off the top of the mountain. This is the best point in the history of the world to be alive, and we're in the greatest country to be alive in, but if we aren't careful, we can lose it.""

How PAYPAL plans to ‘DISRUPT’ finances of those they label ‘white supremacists’,"PayPal recently announced a partnership with the Southern Poverty Law Center to not only ""investigate"" and label those considered ""white supremacists,"" but to actively disrupt their finances, too.

On ""The Glenn Beck Program,"" Glenn explained what that is all about and how it's all connected to America's rapid shift toward a China-style social credit system.



""The country that you know is already gone. The United States of America is not the constitutional republic that it always has been. We do not have people in Washington, D.C., who are protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States. It's no longer being used,"" Glenn stated.

""PayPal is now looking at the Southern Poverty Law Center to do their work, to investigate the role of 'white supremacist' and anti-government rhetoric,"" Glenn continued. ""And then ... the Southern Poverty Law Center will give a label to that person. ... So, if I get that label, PayPal will not let me do anything through PayPal. And if other companies join that, well, then will I be able to fly? You see, if these companies decide they can block you, they'll block you at everything you want to do.

""We're developing a system now, that if you are blocked from using Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Uber, Amazon, PayPal, Venmo, [or] other financial systems, banking platforms have announced a ban on certain legal purchases, such as firearms. If they start restricting other things, I mean, you're living in a world where you cannot hold certain political views, because you will be blocked from society and you will be unable to make a living,"" he added.

"Rudy Giuliani: I have the 'smoking gun' to prove money-laundering linked to Burisma, Bidens","President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani told Fox News' Jesse Watters that he's found the ""smoking gun'' in an investigation that has uncovered a multimillion-dollar money-laundering scheme in the Ukraine that involves far more than just Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

On the radio program Monday, Glenn Beck and chief researcher Jason Buttrill discussed Giuliani's interview on ""Watters' World"" and broke down the details in a document from the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Latvia to the Ukrainian Financial Intelligence Unit that shows a multinational money-laundering transaction that was disguised as a loan.

Glenn played a clip from the Fox News interview:

""I have, what I used to call, while I was U.S. attorney, a smoking gun,"" Giuliani said to Watters. ""This is a money-laundering transaction. It occurred just at the time that [Viktor] Shokin [Ukraine's prosecutor general in 2016] was fired. And it's about $14.6 million. This is a notice from the Latvian government to the Ukrainian government that Hunter Biden is under investigation for corruption, a 'corruption affair,'"" he explained.

""I'll simplify it: $14.8 million goes from Ukraine to a company in Latvia disguised as a loan. Then it goes from Latvia to another company, disguised as another loan in Cypress. And then it goes to the U.S.,"" he continued.

Giuliani later went on to add, ""I want to prove what happened, because I believe if we prove what happened, [President Donald Trump] will be totally vindicated.""

Glenn read a copy of the document, which was also discussed in detail during last week's special presentation: ""Ukraine: The Final Piece (The Billion-Dollar Question)"".

""This is from the prosecutor's office from the Republic of Latvia, Office for Prevention of Laundering of Proceeds Derived from Criminal Activity. This was sent to the Ukrainian FIU, that's the Financial Intelligence Unit. And the subject is Burisma Holdings Limited,"" Glenn said. ""It says [they are] currently investigating suspicious activity of Burisma Holdings Limited. According to publicly available information, Burisma Holdings Limited and its director, Hunter Biden, are involved in a corruption affair.

""The following transactions made to Burisma Holdings Limited account as PrivatBank are known to the Latvian FIU. From July of 2012, until July of 2015 ... the first one is almost $15 million from Wire Logic Technology. Then from July 2015 until December 2015, a total of $1,964,375 US dollars were received from Digitex Organization as payments for other loan agreements. The funds were partially transferred from Burisma Holding Limited account, to Devon Archer, Hunter Biden, Alan Apter, and Alexander Kwasniewski.""

"Rudy Giuliani: Manafort's 'black ledger' was a 'fraud,' part of an US-Soros collaboration in Ukraine","President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Glenn Beck during an exclusive interview on Wednesday that the infamous ""black ledger"" used to convict former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort — who is currently serving 7½ years in federal prison for financial crimes in Ukraine — was a ""fraud"" and part of an Obama-era-instated effort to discredit Donald Trump, which involved the DNC, Ukraine, and George ""Spooky Dude"" Soros.

""I am entirely convinced that this whole episode is just one chapter in at least a three or four chapter plan ... to prevent [Trump] from being president, and should he become president, the insurance policy to remove him,"" Giuliani said of the House impeachment inquiry. ""And this Ukrainian stage also had a pre-election stage, because the black ledger against Manafort turned out to be a fraud.""

Giuliani explained that a Ukrainian nonprofit known as the Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAC), which was co-funded by the Obama administration and far-left billionaire financier George Soros, was ironically under investigation for alleged corruption, namely a ""misplaced"" $4.4 million in U.S. funds designated to ""fight corruption inside the former Soviet republic,"" during the 2016 presidential election in America.

Ukrainian prosecutors, however, faced intense resistance from the U.S. Embassy in Kiev and then-embassy Charge d' Affaires George Kent, the latter of whom testified during the first open hearing of the impeachment inquiry last week. Along with former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, U.S. officials pressed the Ukrainian government to drop the AntAC investigation.

Then-FBI supervisor in charge of international fraud cases, Karen Greenaway, was at the time one of the lead agents in the Manafort investigation. Both Greenaway and Ambassador Yovanovitch were featured speakers at an AntAC conference in 2016, along with Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's new prosecutor general who was assigned to replace the lead prosecutor fired under pressure from the United States and then-Vice President Joe Biden. Greenaway has since joined AntAC's supervisory board.

""The FBI had a case that was two years old, went back to 2014. The FBI had dismissed the case. This rogue FBI agent Greenaway, who is now working for Soros, wanted to reopen it. In order to reopen it, they needed newly discovered evidence. And when this meeting took place in January of 2016 at the AntAC, what the Obama people were asking the Ukrainians to do was to go get information on Manafort so they could reopen the investigation. And, lo and behold, this black ledger shows up on the doorstep of a parliamentarian, who then brings it to the prosecutor, but also does not forget to bring it to The New York Times first.""

It's all happening right now: Glenn Beck uncovers the 'blueprints' for America's future under socialism,"Chief researcher Jason Buttrill joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Monday to talk about an extraordinary document he accidentally discovered while doing research for a book about socialism.

""We found a 'blueprint' for how to take over a country,"" Jason explained. ""[How to] do it legally within the range of their own system, within the range of their own Constitution, Congress, everything, and take over their country.""

The discovered document dates back to the late 1940s and, according to Jason, gives a step-by step breakdown on how to take over a free market republic and flip it to socialism then to communism.

""There were about five different steps that they needed to pull off ... and by the end of it they would have completely flipped a country from a capitalist democracy to full-on socialism to communism,"" Jason explained. He noted that as he read through the document he realized that several of the steps are already happening or have happened in America.

Glenn added the ""frightening"" document specifies a time frame of only three years.

""Something's happening, something's wrong, and it's happening faster and faster, and getting crazier and crazier. That's what this blueprint describes, and shows how it's done,"" Glenn said. ""And it's all being done to us right now.

'They've taken away the symbol of the American flag': Restaurant owner speaks out after being FINED for flying flags on July 4,"Terry Trobiani owns Gianelli's Drive Thru in Prairie Grove, Illinois, where he put up a row of American flags for the Fourth of July. But the city claimed he was displaying two of them improperly and issued him a $100 ticket for each flag.

Terry joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to explain what he believes really happened. He told Glenn that, according to city ordinance, the American flag is considered ""ornamental"" and should therefore have been permitted on a federal holiday. But the city has now classified the flag as a ""sign.""

""Apparently, the village of Prairie Grove has classified the American flag as a sign and they've taken away the symbol of the American flag,"" Terry said. ""So, as a sign, it falls under their temporary sign ordinance, which prohibits any flying, or any positioning of signs on your property — and now this includes the American flag. [...] The only way I could fly the American flag on my property is if I put it on a permanent 20 to 30-foot flagpole, which they have to permit.""

Terry went on to explain how the city is now demanding an apology for his actions, and all after more than a year of small-business crushing COVID restrictions and government mandates.

""COVID was tough,"" Terry stated. ""You know, we're in the restaurant business. COVID was tough on us. We succeeded. We made it through. We cut a lot of things, but we never cut an employee. We paid all our employees. I didn't take a paycheck for a year just to keep our employees on, because it was that important to me to keep things going. And, you know, you fight for a year, and you beat a pandemic, and then you have this little municipality with five trustees and a president, who just have no respect for small businesses. And right now, what I see is they have no respect for the republic and the United States ... I think it's terrible. The direction that government, at all levels, have taken us to this point, it's despicable.""

'We're ALL being gaslit': Ben Shapiro on why THIS stat should scare both conservatives AND liberals,"The Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro joined BlazeTV host Dave Rubin on ""The Rubin Report"" to talk about how the mainstream media manipulates statistics to make COVID-19 infection rates appear far worse than they actually are, why he doesn't fear authoritarianism from the government, but from cultural institutions that no longer encourage critical thinking and encourage silencing dissent instead, and to share frightening poll results that show how most people, except the far-left, are afraid to voice their politics publicly.

""The non-governmental institutions of society, in large part [are] becoming more and more intolerant of dissent, outlawing dissent, social ostracization, people losing their jobs, people having family members not speaking to them anymore. And this is leading to a complete breakdown in the possibility of us even having a republic together. It's really, really dangerous stuff and everybody feels it,"" Ben told Dave.

""We're all being gaslit by the media that says that this stuff is not important, or that, you know, it's just making the country better, but by polling data, every single subgroup in the United States, including mainstream liberals, with the exception of far-left radicals ... says they are afraid to say what they believe about politics publicly. That's insane, okay. That is a good indicator of where we are and how far we have to go,"" he added.

Ben also gave his prediction of what center-left liberals of the intellectual dark web, like Sam Harris and Bari Weiss, will have to do to prevent themselves from becoming victims of cancel culture, and shares the story of his ""nice bucket challenge"" on Twitter and why so few liberals took him up on it.

"'If we fall for this, we are FOOLS': Glenn Loury warns Dems are 'buying black votes by waving a bloody shirt of racism'","On ""The Rubin Report,"" Glenn Loury, professor of economics at Brown University, joined BlazeTV host Dave Rubin to talk about why it's controversial for a black man to be against diversity and inclusion training, affirmative action, and reparations.

Glenn also shared his thoughts on the narrative of systemic racism and racial disparities, why it's wrong, and how the Democratic Party pushes lies to get the support of black voters.

In this clip, Glenn shares his thoughts on how Democrats have fanned the flames of the racism bogeyman in a cynical attempt to get more of the black vote.

""They're buying black votes by waving a bloody shirt of racism, that's what they're doing,"" Glenn said of the Democratic Party. ""If we fall for this, we are fools. We're being led around with a ring through our noses. They show nothing but contempt for black people.""

Glenn argued that if black people in this country want to start eliminating disparities, they need to stop using the issue of slavery to play the victim as that mentality only encourages society to lower the bar for black America.

""The racial conflict coming out of [the issue of] slavery threatens the existence of the republic,"" Glenn said. ""Three hundred thousand people in a country of 3 million were slaughtered on the battlefields of the civil war. The consequence of which was the emancipation of the African slaves. Here we are now, 150 years later and the descendants of those slaves are citizens of the freest, richest and most powerful republic in the history of the world.""

Glenn also explained why he believes former President Barack Obama missed many opportunities to engage the country in an honest conversation about race, and called out former first lady Michelle Obama for saying that she fears for the safety of her daughters.

"'That's not press, that's propaganda': Mark Levin on how America's free press became a 'one-party press'","In this episode of ""White House Brief,"" host Jon Miller is joined by BlazeTV's Mark Levin to talk about the dishonesty of today's progressive media, as detailed in his new book, ""Unfreedom of the Press.""



Levin said that the free press in our country has always been biased but was up-front about their political viewpoints. The problem with today's ""modern mass media"" is that they peddle their political propaganda as objective reporting.

""Today we have a one-party press ... that doesn't identify itself as a one-party press,"" Levin said.

""I make a distinction between the modern mass media and a free press. The modern mass media, which pushes the Democrat Party's progressive agenda, a radical agenda, also is involved in social activism, whether it's so called climate change or open borders or Obamacare,"" he added. ""There's not a dime's worth of difference between the vast majority of newsrooms and journalists and the Democratic party. That's not news, that's not press, that's propaganda.""

Levin explained that, in the early days of this country, the ""patriot press"" sought to fundamentally transform the government to push individual liberty and civil rights. He compared that to today's media, who through support of big government, seek to fundamentally transform ""us, the people, the civil society, the republic.""

Later in the show, Jon welcomed Yair Netanyahu, son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his first-ever interview to talk about his organization, the Advanced Security Training Institute, which provides specialized training for U.S. first-responders in Israel.

Sydney Watson and Elijah Schaffer explain Communism in less than 5 minutes,"It seems the progressive left operates more similarly to a regime than a representative republic, and the current regime rewards anybody and everybody supporting their propaganda. Conversely, those not in favor of the regime find themselves punished.

In this clip, ""You Are Here"" hosts Sydney Watson and Elijah Schaffer discussed the aggressive tactics used by the political left and why the tactics are effective.

According to Elijah, the regime pushes globalism — a one-world government movement full of liberty-crushing policy found on the United Nations website. He explained how honest voices that dare to stand up for the truth find themselves censored, ridiculed, and destroyed.

Sydney took the points Elijah made a step farther and pinpointed how the leftist regime had well-known playbooks and roadmaps that spell out everything a Communist regime needs to collapse a political system. She eloquently explained that Communist ideology does not have to be studied by each new generation. Only a tiny corrupt few are needed to spread the cancerous ideology like wildfire.

Sydney recently tweeted (see below) a great example of how Communism takes root when the people are afraid of speaking out against the regime.

Putin's war in Ukraine prompts international ban on Russian cats​,"Now that Russian cats are banned from international competitions, does the world feel safer? Doubtful.

The International Cat Federation issued a statement announcing its shock and horror ""that the army of the Russian Federation invaded the Republic of Ukraine and started a war.""

Prompted by the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine, FIFe took action. It will not permit ""cats bred in Russia to be imported and registered in any FIFe pedigree book outside Russia, regardless of which organization issued its pedigree."" Also, cats with Russian exhibitors will not be allowed to register for shows organized outside of Russia.

The Board will revisit the restriction on May 31, 2022.

'Way over the line': BlazeTV hosts SLAM FBI raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home,"BlazeTV hosts took to Twitter on Tuesday and tipped the FBI for the agency's raid on former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home that occurred the previous evening.

Have I made myself clear? https://t.co/Gr3Sv9WHrUpic.twitter.com/c2Eo4rzSte — Steven Crowder (@scrowder) August 9, 2022 ""Any Republican, right now in office or running for office, who does not actively champion the defunding and the dismantling and defunding of our intelligence agencies, I will not vote for you,"" Crowder said during a powerful episode of ""Louder with Crowder.""

This is the act of a dictator of a Banana Republic. Republicans NEVER did this to Clinton, although perhaps we should have. With Joe & Hunter Biden paying zero consequence for his actions. This is shameful and MUST STOP. We don’t do this in America. Way over the line. https://t.co/IrypwN0dRE — Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) August 8, 2022 ""This is the act of a dictator of a Banana Republic.

The FBI had time to raid Trump’s house but we sure as shit still don’t know who Ghislaine Maxwell’s customers were.

Is there any news footage of the ""raid""? Or did the FBI show up to collect/demand materials? This whole thing is working out to fire up Trump base.

“That’s right, I said it! https://t.co/rBLaje9Jda” “There is no justification for sending 30 friggin’ FBI agents to the former president’s compound in Mar-a-Lago in early morning and conducting themselves this way or in any other cases in which they’ve done exactly the same thing,” Levin stated. “The FBI is corrupt.” “This is the worst attack on this republic in modern history. Period,” Mark said. “And it’s not just an attack on Donald Trump. It’s an attack on everybody who supports him. It’s an attack on anybody who dares to raise serious questions about Washington, D.C., and the establishment in both parties. I haven’t heard a damn thing from the Republican leadership in the Senate! Have you? Not one of those guys has put out a statement. Because they’re weak. That’s why.” Get more Mark Levin here.

Background

Yesterday, TheBlaze reported the raid.

""These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,"" read the statement from the former president.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" the statement continued.

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024,"" he added, ""especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""
